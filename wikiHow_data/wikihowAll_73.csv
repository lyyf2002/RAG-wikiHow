Turn up your fidget factor.,
Raise your heels.,
Tap your toes.,
Lift your arms.,
Sit on a stability ball.",How to Increase Your NEAT2," Many people fidget while they’re sitting. Doodling on a piece of paper to moving your legs back and forth under a table or desk are two common types of fidgeting that can also increase your NEAT. Make sure your fidgeting is appropriate for the situation and doesn’t distract you or other people. Some other ways to increase your NEAT while fidgeting include:Making fists and releasing
Tapping a finger
Bouncing your leg up and down
Knitting, You can also use sitting times as a way to build your leg muscles. Raising your heels — and even toes — off the ground while you sit can give you gorgeous calves and increase your NEAT.Place a large book on your knees while raising your heels or toes for added resistance. This can not only build muscle, but also increase your NEAT even more.

, Consistently moving your toes as you sit can increase your NEAT. Remember that small movements such as tapping your toes or wiggling your feet adds up over time, helping to boost your NEAT along the way., Just as you can do leg work to increase your NEAT while sitting, you can also use your arms. Simple movements such as raising your hands above your head can build muscle and boost your NEAT. Some other arm movements you may want to try while sitting include:Stretching out your arms
Knitting
Playing a musical instrument
Stroking or playing fetch with a pet
Bouncing a child on your lap

, If you find yourself sitting at a desk much of the day, consider shaking up your seating arrangement. Replacing your chair with a stability ball forces your body to balance, which builds core strength. It also gives you a chance to gently bounce and move throughout the day. Both of these activities can boost your NEAT and torch calories.Use a stability ball at home if you like. Sitting on the ball while you’re watching TV, eating, playing video games, doing laundry, or reading has the same NEAT-increasing benefits.

Determine your NEAT.,
Write activities in a notebook.,
Use a pedometer to track your activity.",How to Increase Your NEAT3," Increasing your NEAT can burn on average an extra 330 calories per day. One factor that can differ between an overweight or obese individual and someone within a healthy weight range is their NEAT. An overweight or obese person generally performs considerably less NEAT activities.Figuring out what activities you do throughout the day can help you do more to increase your NEAT.


Think about a typical day for yourself. Start with the morning and progress through the day. Ask yourself questions such as, “Do I get takeout for dinner? Do I walk or drive to pick it up? Does someone deliver it?” or, “Do I combine tasks to avoid taking the stairs?” You could also ask yourself how long you sit at your desk every day or even keep notes each time you get up.
Estimate your NEAT by multiplying your basal metabolic rate (BMR) with your activity level. The easiest way to calculate your BMR at home is using an online calculator, which takes away the headache of doing complicated math. Try this one: http://www.bmrcalculator.org/

Multiply your BMR results by the following numbers, which can give you an idea of your current NEAT (though being moderately to extremely active means you are likely also getting some traditional exercise): 1.1 if you are sedentary, 1.15 if you are lightly active, 1.2 if you are moderately active, 1.25 if you are very active, 1.3 if you are extremely active., Once you have your NEAT estimates, you can start to make changes that will increase them. Keep notes on your current NEAT and reassess it every month or so. Write a daily log of the activities you did to gain an overall picture of how you’re increasing your NEAT and what effects it has. Remember that even writing the notes by hand can increase your NEAT., Pedometers are small devices you can clip on to shoes or wear on your wrist. They track how many steps you take every day. Getting yourself a pedometer — simple or jazzy — can ensure that you’re increasing your NEAT over the course of the day.Buy a pedometer that best suits your needs. Even a cheap model that clips onto your shoe can help you assess your NEAT. Consider a jazzier version, such as a Fitbit or Striiv Fusion, that you wear around your wrist. These devices often track your steps, but may also remind you to get up and moving if you’re low on movement.Try and increase the number of steps you take every day by 1,000. Set yourself a reasonable goal, working up to at least 10,000 steps per day."

Add legumes to soups and stews.,
Use legumes on salads.,
Substitute wheat flour with finely ground legumes.,
Serve legumes as dips for chips and veggies.,
Try making homemade veggie burgers with legumes.,
Consider legumes in desserts.,
Opt for fresh legumes instead of canned varieties.,
Sort through your dried legumes before storing or soaking them.,
Soak most legumes before you eat them.,
Learn how to cook beans and other legumes.,
Eat legumes for their high fiber content.,
Consume legumes to get more protein.,
Add legumes to your diet to reduce the risk of diabetes.,
Benefit from lower cholesterol levels by eating legumes.",How to Include Legumes in Your Weight Loss Diet," Cooked legumes, such as lentils, red kidney beans, split peas, chickpeas, fava beans or black beans make a tasty and healthy addition to soups and stews.Due to their protein content, they also make an excellent substitute for meat/chicken/fish, particularly if you're a vegetarian.


Make sure to soak beans and peas before adding them to soups and stews, so the potentially harmful compounds get leached out.
Chickpeas are also known as garbanzo or ceci beans to some people and are the main ingredient in hummus. Fava beans are sometimes referred to as broad beans because of their flattened shape.
Another name for black beans is turtle beans.;
, Many types of legumes also go well with salads, particularity lentils, black-eyed peas, edamame beans and Lima beans.Sprinkle whole beans, peas or lentils on top of an iceberg lettuce salad, or add them to a cold potato salad. Remember that black-eyed peas and lentils don't need to be soaked beforehand.


Legumes go well with a variety of salad dressings, including creamy ones and oil and vinegar-based types.
Soy nuts (roasted soybeans) make tasty and healthy garnishes for most salads.
Edamame is also known as green soybean and often eaten directly out of the pod after being cooked and salted.
Lima beans are also sometimes called butter beans or Madagascar beans.

, When making cookies, muffins and breads, substitute about 10% of the wheat flour with finely ground legumes, such as lupin, garbanzo or fava bean flours.They will give your baked goods more fiber and protein, and might be easier to digest and tolerate if you're sensitive to gluten — which is in wheat and many other grains.


Consider adding pureed beans or lentils to your brownies and cupcakes, but just don't tell your kids! Black beans make excellent gluten-free brownies.
Use a coffee grinder and set it on ""fine"" or ""espresso"" to grind beans and peas into flour before cooking/baking with it.
You can puree cooked beans in an ordinary blender or food processor if you don't want to gunk up your coffee grinder.

, Some legumes can be whipped up (pureed), combined with a little vegetable oil and made into tasty dips for chips, breads and veggies — hummus is a good example and made from blended chickpeas.Hummus is a low-fat, high-protein dip that you can spread on bread or serve with vegetable sticks, such as carrots, celery and zucchini.


Hummus and other legume-based dips are very common in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine.
Re-fried bean dip is very popular in Mexico and South American countries and used for taco chips and in burritos.
Try a spicy edamame dip and serving with pita chips and veggies.

, Another great idea for vegetarians or people who want to reduce the red meat in their diet is veggie burgers made from legumes. Ground up lentils or chickpeas make a great base for vegetable patties, although they have a tendency to fall apart if you grill them like hamburger patties.Ground up legumes also combine well with mushrooms to make veggie patties.


Instead of grilling, add a little vegetable oil to a pan and lightly fry or sauté the veggie patties for a few minutes before adding them to a bun.
Adding cheese to veggie burgers can be tasty, but sometimes people who have trouble digesting beans are also lactose intolerant — so it can be a ""double whammy.""

, Although it may sound strange to most Americans, beans and other legumes have long been staples in sweet treats in other cultures, especially Asian societies such as Japan, China and Vietnam. Good examples of sweet desserts include Vietnamese bean pudding and Japanese adzuki bean ice cream.


Japanese adzuki beans, also called field peas or red beans, are made into a sweet bean paste in Japan and China and spread on rice and crackers.
These beans are not inherently very sweet, so sugar must be added to them.

, Buying fresh dried beans and other legumes from your local grocery store is the best idea because they tend to be less expensive, tastier and more nutritious (depending how you cook them) compared to canned varieties.Many dried beans (black, navy, kidney beans) are found in mainstream grocery stores, although you may have to go to outdoor markets or specialty health food stores to find more obscure types, such as certain types of lentils.


If you can afford it, buy organic legumes (beans) from the bulk bins of food stores — they tend to have higher turnover rates, which keeps them fresher.
Buying canned legumes eliminates the need for soaking them prior to eating, but you should still rinse them thoroughly to get rid of the excess sodium and preservatives from the canning liquid.

, Before storing, soaking or preparing your dried legumes at home it's best to spread them out on a clean counter and quickly check for any spoiled, discolored or shriveled ones first.Spoiled beans can cause others to go bad quicker, so if you find any, throw them out — preferably into a composting container or heap. You may also find some unwanted debris, such as small stones or twigs, that you'll have to remove before storing or preparing them.


Once sorted, store the dried legumes in airtight containers in a cool, dry place that doesn't get any direct sunlight.
In general, most dried beans and other legumes can be stored for about a year if done properly. Canned varieties typically last much longer, a few years or more.

, Dried legumes, with the exceptions of black-eyed peas, split peas and lentils, need to be soaked in water prior to eating or cooking them because it rehydrates them and helps remove some harmful compounds that cause digestive problems.Kidney beans, for example, can be quite toxic if eaten raw and unsoaked. You can slow soak or quick soak legumes depending on how much time you have to prepare meals.


To slow soak: put 1 pound of dried legumes (such as beans) with 10 cups water in a pot and cover in the fridge overnight or for at least 4 hours.
To quick soak: bring 1 pound of dried legumes and 10 cups of water to a boil in a pot, then cover and let simmer for one to four hours at room temperature.
Compounds that cause digestive problems in legumes include phytic acid, lectins and saponins. Soaking dry legumes can help extract these compounds out.

, After soaking beans or other legumes, rinse them first before adding them to a stockpot. Cover the beans (or other legumes) with about three times their volume of water and then add any herbs or spices that you like before bringing the pot to a boil.Once boiled, reduce the heat and simmer the beans uncovered for at least 45 minutes, stirring them occasionally, until they're tender. Cooking times depend somewhat on the type of bean or legume.


Add salt or acidic ingredients (vinegar, tomatoes) to the beans once they are cooked and tender. Adding salt too early can make beans tough and increase cooking times.
You know beans (and most other legumes) are properly cooked when they can be easily mashed with a fork.

, Legumes such as beans, peas and lentils are high in soluble fiber (and some insoluble fiber), which tends to fill you up quicker and reduce the desire to overeat. The result is that eating foods high in fiber is good for losing weight. For example, some studies suggest that regular consumption of beans is associated with lower BMI (body mass index), smaller waist size and reduced risk of obesity.A single serving of legumes can assist in weight loss through their effect on decreasing hunger for up to four hours.
Research indicates that people who eat about 3/4 of a cup of legumes every day lose almost a pound more weight each week compared to those who don't eat legumes.One cup of black beans or lentils contains about 15 g of fiber, which is 60% of the recommended daily minimum.

, Legumes are also a good source of protein, which is important for filling you up at meal times too, but it's also needed to build and maintain muscles and connective tissue.Legumes are among the best plant-based sources of dietary protein and are good alternatives to meat, which can be high in cholesterol and saturated fat. The body can also use protein for energy when carbohydrates are scarce.


One cup of cooked lentils or black beans provide about 18 g of protein, which is about 35% of the recommended daily amount for non-athletic adults.
Protein takes longer to digest than carbohydrates (especially refined sugary types), so it makes you feel fuller for longer and doesn't get stored as fat if you overindulge.
As a protein source, legumes are much less expensive than meat/poultry/fish, so including them in your diet and replacing some animal-based sources can save you money on grocery bills.
Keep in mind, however, that most legumes are not complete proteins, meaning they do not contain all nine essential fatty acids necessary for your health and dietary needs. To make sure you meet your protein needs, add a small helping of grains with your legumes (try some brown rice or quinoa, which is a complete protein).

, Eating legumes (beans, chickpeas, lentils) on a regular basis improves blood sugar control, which reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease.The amounts needed per day for significant impact on blood glucose levels are about 1 cup of legumes, regardless of type. The fiber and carbohydrates in legumes have a low glycemic index, which means they are broken down slowly and don't cause spikes in blood sugar and insulin release.


Type 2 diabetes is much more common in people who are overweight. Legumes not only help to manage blood sugar, but they help to prevent unhealthy weight gain to begin with.
Diabetes, which is defined as chronically high blood sugar, is destructive to smaller blood vessels and nerve fibers, making heart disease more likely.

, The soluble and insoluble fiber in legumes, such as beans and peas, is also helpful for lowering blood cholesterol levels, particularly the ""bad"" kind called LDL cholesterol.The soluble fiber, such as lignans, sticks to cholesterol in the bloodstream and pulls it out of circulation, which may reduce your risk of cardiovascular diseases — heart attacks, stroke and atherosclerosis (clogged arteries).


Legumes are also very low in saturated fat and don't contain any cholesterol.
Related to lowering blood cholesterol levels, eating legumes regularly can also lower high blood pressure (hypertension)."

Focus on fruits and vegetables.,
Feed your toddler lean protein.,
Avoid fast food and junk food.,
Keep portions under control.,
Eliminate sugary drinks.",How to Help Your Toddler Lose Weight1," Most toddlers will eat a variety of fruits, so try incorporating them into the daily diet as breakfast and snacks. Use vegetables in every lunch and dinner, and set a good example for your child by eating vegetables yourself as well.;
, Children should have regular sources of lean protein, such as yogurt, fish, chicken, and some whole grains. Work within your child’s preferences but make it clear that protein is an important part of mealtime.

, Toddlers need fresh, healthful food to achieve and maintain an appropriate weight.


If your child often eats take-out or packaged foods packed with fat, salt, sugar, and other non-nutritive ingredients, swap them out for carrot sticks, applesauce, strawberry slices, string cheese, and Cheerios.

, Toddlers need about half the calories of adults, so size portions accordingly. Try dividing the plate into segments: 1/2 vegetables and/or fruits, 1/4 whole grains, and 1/4 lean protein.

, Many toddlers love to drink fruit juices, but these are often loaded with calories and limited in nutritional value.


If your child drinks a lot of fruit juice (or any other sweetened drink), swap it out for milk or water. Juice, soda, and other sweetened drinks can add hundreds of calories to your toddler’s diet each day.
Do not give your toddler drinks that serve as dietary supplements, such as PediaSure. These drinks are formulated for children with difficulty gaining weight or with restrictive diets. If your child eats well and is overweight, avoid high-calorie toddler drinks of this nature.

Choose mustard.,
Spice it up with cayenne.,
Grind fresh black pepper.,
Grate some ginger.,
Listen to your tummy.",How to Help Weight Loss with Herbs and Spices1," Mustard is lower in calories than ketchup, mayo, barbeque sauce, and most other table condiments. Plus, a study from the Oxford Polytechnic Institute has shown that consuming mustard seed can boost your metabolic rate by up to 30%.Add mustard powder to sauce recipes for a little kick.
Use mustard on sandwiches, burgers, and other snacks.
Make your own salad dressing with Dijon mustard and citrus.;
, Cayenne is a super spicy dried herb that can be added to almost any recipe. Cayenne contains capsaicin, a powerful compound that helps burn fat and suppress appetite.Add cayenne to soups, sauces, and meat dishes.
Start with a tiny amount (such as ¼ teaspoon).
Cayenne is very potent.

, Chances are, you have shakers of salt and black pepper in your kitchen already. Black pepper contains a compound called piperine. Piperine helps to improve digestion and burn fat.Black pepper is most potent when freshly ground.
Consider purchasing a pepper grinder and whole black peppercorns.
Add to popcorn, salads, and dips.

, Ginger can add a delicious kick to any dish. This root has been shown to suppress appetite, improve digestion, soothe upset tummies, remove toxins, and raise body temperature (which boosts metabolism).Add to fruit smoothies.
Combine with garlic and green onion to make any dish “Szechuan style.”
Fresh ginger root will be the most potent, but you can use ground ginger in a pinch.

, If you have a sensitive stomach, including lots of herbs and spices—especially extra spicy ones—can have a negative effect. Begin introducing new spices sparingly and take a break if you feel any digestive discomfort.

, Look online for ideas. Meals don't have to be complicated; they could be as simple as grilled chicken, whole grain pasta, and broccoli.

, If you know what you are going to cook and you have already bought the ingredients, then you will be more inclined to prepare a healthy meal.

, This will not only be a great way to come together, but it will stop you from shoveling your food down.

, A rule of thumb for adults is usually three ounces (90g) of protein, one cup (175g) of vegetables, and half a cup (87.5g) of starch. Bring serving dishes to the table to allow all family members to learn how to serve themselves proportionately. Successful portion control means that you don't have to miss out on your favorite desserts or fried food dishes, you just need to learn how much of it you can eat without it being bad for you.

, This method of eating is essential in helping your family lose weight because it allows the food to begin the digestion process in the mouth. It also fills the body faster so you are more inclined to eat less. If you practice eating in this manner, it will become second nature.

, Water is always the best beverage, but fruit juices and low fat milk are just as important. Consider adding seltzer water to juices for a little fizz.

, Take regular walks, bike rides, and join a gym as a family. Doing so will not only make you fitter, but it will provide another opportunity to bring the family together.

Praise your loved one’s efforts.,
Do not remind them of the setbacks.,
Ask about their progress, but not insistently.,
Avoid using judgmental language.,
Listen.,
Don’t use scare tactics to encourage them to lose weight.,
Replace sedentary activities with active, healthy ones.,
Give healthy gifts for holidays and birthdays.,
Mark their achievements by celebrating with them.,
Lead a healthy lifestyle.,
Enroll in their weight-loss program.,
Get involved.",How to Help a Loved One Lose Weight," Deciding to lose weight and choosing to live a healthy lifestyle can seem like a daunting task to some. When a loved one commits to these goals, be encouraging every step of the way. If your loved one is struggling, remain positive and be their cheerleader.


Make sure their efforts don’t go unnoticed. You may say to your loved one, “I am really proud of you for committing to exercising and eating healthy. You’re doing a great job!”
Do not judge your loved one for their choice to make a change. Even if the change is not one you want to make yourself, help them by validating their decision.;
, If your loved one does not meet a weight-loss goal or cheated and enjoyed a high-calorie meal, try to shift their focus to help them stay on track. Do not bring up the setbacks or ask how the setback happened. Remind them of their efforts, big or small, to help them refocus and stay on track.For example, you might say “I think it’s really great that you have been going to a Zumba class twice a week. That is an intense but fun work out!” Remind them of their accomplishments in a positive, supportive way.

, It is okay to ask your loved one about their progress, but avoid doing so incessantly. Your loved one may feel as though they are being pestered, and they may feel less inspired to continue to lose weight and exercise.Plan to ask how it is going every few weeks to remind them that you remember that they are making significant lifestyle changes. If and when they are ready, your loved one will share their progress with you.

, When your loved one discusses setbacks or hurdles, don’t reprimand them. Criticizing their stumble will only add to their guilt, and it may make them less likely to turn look to your for support in the future.


For example, if they confess that they ate the breakfast pastries at work, don’t ask questions like “Why did you do that?” or “How many calories was that?” If they ask for advice, suggest that they bring in a piece of fruit or a low-sugar yogurt into the office for a morning snack to avoid temptations next time.

, Sometimes the most helpful thing you can do for your loved one is to listen to them. Be present in the conversation, and acknowledge the ups and downs. Your support and empathy may be just what your loved one needs.


When your loved one is frustrated, let them vent and empathize with them. When they are happy, let them talk about how good it feels to finish a workout routine or how great it is to have more energy., Using fear to encourage your loved one to stay on track can be counterproductive. Instead of promoting a healthy lifestyle, you may cause your loved one to become defiant and angry.Don’t remind your loved one that being overweight or obese can lead to a variety of health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.

, Sometimes meeting weight-loss goals can cause a person to feel like they have to give up things that they love and enjoy. Remind them that their time spent with friends and family does not have to be pushed to the side. A person can still lead a healthy lifestyle and enjoy social, fun activities.


If the two of you used to meet up for an after-work cocktail or go for ice cream on Sundays, suggest that you go bowling, play pool, or take an art class instead., Instead of sending a box of tempting chocolates for Valentine’s Day or baking sugary cupcakes for your loved one’s birthday, give them a healthy gift like a fruit basket instead.Having healthy options around the holidays and other celebrations can help them stay on track and reach their weight-loss goals.


If they love to take yoga or cardio classes, give them a gift certificate for their favorite studio.
Enroll your loved one in a local farm-share program so they can have fresh vegetables delivered to their home each month.
Do not tempt your love one. You may always bring them a cake or pie for a holiday, but if you know they are implementing a healthier lifestyle, ask them about healthier alternatives that they would enjoy.

, Plan to celebrate with your loved one as they progress and achieve their weight-loss goals. Choose a way to celebrate that does not involve indulging in a calorie-dense meal or grabbing sugary after-work drinks. Demonstrate that celebrations can be healthy and unique, and they do not need to be about indulgence or reverting back to unhealthy habits.


When they lose 10 pounds, for example, offer to take them for a game of golf or relax at a nail salon instead of taking them out to their favorite pizza place or ice cream parlor.
When your loved one reaches a larger goal, offer to take them rock climbing, zip-lining, or hiking in a nearby park.

, Leading a healthy lifestyle benefits both your mind and body, and it can be a positive influence those around you. Eat fresh fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Aim to exercise for 150 minutes each week to boost your heart rate, strengthen your muscles, and burn calories.Leading by example is a great way to influence your loved ones and inspire them to improve their overall health.

, Social support has been shown to help individuals lose weight.If your spouse or another loved one who you live with is trying to lose weight, consider joining the program, too. If you are both working toward a common goal and sticking to a dieting and exercise routine, it will be easier to stay focused and motivated.


If you are both cutting out junk food and sweets, for example, those temptations won’t be stocked in your food pantry at home, which will make the program easier for both of you.

, Consider going to a work-out class with them, or offer to cook a healthy dinner with them once a week. Joining in on their efforts will help your loved one feel supported, and it may inspire them to increase their healthy lifestyle choices if they have someone to join them from time to time.Tell your loved one that you signed up for a 5K walk or race and ask if they would like to join, or suggest that they two of you find a nice walking trail in your neighborhood or local park."

You might say to your wife, ""I love you so much, seeing you struggle with your weight has me worried. Is it OK if we talk about it?"";

Recommend exercise, as the release of endorphins experienced during and after working out can boost her mood and fight symptoms of depression and stress.Suggest that you both try meditating, as studies have shown that this can alleviate both stress and depression.Discuss the possibility of going together, or if comfortable, of her going alone to see a therapist.

, You may have dreamed of walking the Great Wall of China when you were a younger couple, or perhaps you've always wanted to go on safari, or hike the Appalachian trail! Remind your wife of these goals and dreams, and use that conversation to gently bring up your concerns about her weight.

, This is especially important if you have a more active metabolism or professional life than your wife. Seeing you chow down on your favorite foods while she has to adhere to a more rigid diet can lead to resentment or poor self-image.


If she has bought or prepares special diet food, try to encourage her healthy behaviors by participating in her dietary plans.Have a bite to show your support!

Pizza
Ice cream


, The colors in your food are generally an indication of phytochemicals and other nutrients important for your health.An easy way to improve you and your wife's diet is by wife eating food from a wide range of colors.

, You and/or your wife may feel like you are being oppressed as you tally up the number of calories you consume throughout the day, but calorie and portion control are vital to losing weight. In the words of Peter Drucker, consultant and author, ""What gets measured, gets managed.""Though fad diets focus on certain kinds of food and/or sources of nutrition, many researchers today stress how overconsumption of calories is the true culprit of weight gain.Keep an eating log on your phone or in a memo pad you can carry throughout the day. List everything you eat, look up the caloric cost of those items, and identify which foods are your caloric trouble spots.

, Meal plans will do more than help your wife lose weight. A meal plan can also save you time, money, and stress, all while preventing you from indulging in more convenient, less healthy options.If you notice, through your eating log, that you are not getting enough of a certain food group, tailor your meal plan to improve this.

, A dietitian has the knowledge and skills to help you come up with a balanced, healthy plan for your wife's weight loss diet. You may want to bring your eating log and any meal plans you've devised on your own. This way your dietitian can:


Offer guidance and advice about what you've already done, what can be done better, and how you might improve down the road.
Have a full idea of your lifestyle and preferences. On the spot, you might not know what to say if he were to ask you about your diet. Having your eating log on hand can help him advise you more efficiently.

, The time you spend exercising with you wife is not only good for your health, it can also promote bonding and happiness in your relationship.Show solidarity and support for your wife by encouraging her throughout the exercise, and by taking part in her healthy choices.

, Depending on the weight of your wife, it may not be feasible to hit the gym right away. She might even hate going to the gym. Instead, start with small, routine activities, like:


Going for a walk in the morning
A leisure sport, like tennis
Bird watching
Shell or sea glass collecting
Dancing

, Even something as simple as going to the park can help relax and restore her mind and body.You might want to take a Frisbee along, or your dog. You should also consider:


A visit to a scenic lighthouse.
A trip to a museum or exhibit.
Visiting local historic sites.

, Routine can give a sense of safety and pleasure to your weekly activities.Generally, it takes an average of 66 days to establish a new habit, and by planning on regular activities can help establish that habit.You and your wife might agree on doing three exercise oriented activities every weekend.
Encourage her to increase intensity and frequency as her fitness improves.

, Although not necessary to improve her fitness, a gym membership would provide many resources to her. Besides exercise equipment, many gyms also have trainers on staff. These individuals can help you develop a personalized exercise plan for her weight loss. A personal trainer can also:


Help her develop accountability
Motivate her
Realize new perspectives
Achieve proper technique and form

,
Make healthy alternatives of your favorite restaurant recipes at home.

, It will be easy for her to fall into the trap of fixating on a magic number that, when achieved, will mean she is healthy. But poundage doesn't necessarily translate to healthiness.


If your wife is exercising and dieting, she may shed inches and tone up but stay the same weight.
Muscle is denser than fat, so it's possible to get significantly healthier while maintaining roughly the same weight., Instead of a decadent night out full of food and drink, the use of healthy motivators can be a game changer.Plan to celebrate certain milestones and accomplishments, like her first month of exercise, with things like:


A couples painting class
Tickets to her favorite music
A manicure
A massage

, Even if you do not see immediate results, tell her how proud you are of her hard work as encouragement.Ask her if there are any additional ways that you can show her your support, and try to implement her suggestions., Even if she falls short of the goal, be sure you are regularly reminding her that you're proud of her effort.In some cases, you might offer too much praise, making her feel like you're talking down to her. Don't take offense. Express that you only want to applaud her efforts and ask her how you can do that better. Try to understand that:


She's working hard to lose weight at your initiation.
Losing weight can be physically and emotionally exhausting.

Create a supportive atmosphere at home.,
Set an example of a healthy diet and lifestyle.,
Do not bring home any unhealthy food or drinks.,
Encourage good behaviors instead of attacking bad ones.,
Celebrate a big weight loss milestone together with your family member.",How to Help Someone to Lose Weight," This is probably the most important thing you can do. Many people tend to overeat when they are angry or upset. Do your best to prevent emotionally tense situations that might lead to overeating. Let your beloved one know that in an hour of need, he or she may and should, count on you rather than on food.;
, For example, do exercises together. Most often, we are prone to imitate each other. If your family member sees that you exercise regularly and eat healthy food, then he or she will try to do the same. Do your stuff without attracting any attention to it and your family member will subconsciously copy your behavior.


Try to pick exercise that involves time to talk as you walk, run or cycle or that takes you to a nice place, such as the beach, the local pool or a hike through the woods. Making exercise enjoyable is a big part of increasing the motivation to get involved.

, The same is true for the empty wrappers and packages of the food you’ve eaten somewhere – all that might tempt the one who is trying to lose weight. You might think that nobody will notice an empty wrapper, but the person who is on diet will. If you want to eat or drink something unhealthy, pastry or soda pop or anything like that, don’t do it at home. Let the one who is losing weight see only a good example of a healthy eating.


If you do want to have snacks at home, keep them well hidden and consume them away from sight.

, Most overweight people know that their routine diet is unhealthy, but they do not have enough willpower to fight their habits. Any mentioning of calories won’t help––just be supportive and patient, do not grumble about food.

, When he or she reaches a milestone in the weight loss program, make sure you really give him or her a huge pat on the back. You could also do something fun together, such go to a movie or visit an exhibition. Just do something together to show how glad and proud you are.

Try coconut or almond yogurt.,
Try ghee or coconut oil instead of butter.",How to Make Paleo Swaps Without Following the Paleo Diet1," Milk and other dairy products are off limits on the paleo diet.

You can even make your own almond milk.;
, Dairy cheese is not allowed on the paleo diet, so it is important to either leave it out or swap it. Even if you are not following the paleo diet, you can easily make a swap for cheese by using a cheese alternative or making your own non-dairy nut cheese.An easy way to substitute cheese is to sprinkle a couple of teaspoons of nutritional yeast flakes onto your food. These are available in the bulk section of grocery and health food stores.

, If you are in the mood for ice cream, then you can swap regular dairy ice cream for a non-dairy version, such as a coconut or almond milk ice cream.If you purchase a non-dairy ice cream, look for a brand that does not have too many ingredients or added sugar.

Have granola or muesli for breakfast instead of cereal.",How to Make Paleo Swaps Without Following the Paleo Diet2," Wheat flour is not allowed on the paleo diet, but you can swap it with a gluten-free and grain-free alternative. Try swapping regular flour for coconut flour, almond flour, or almond meal.Just be aware that you will need to adjust the recipe, as you cannot swap coconut or almond flour 1:1 with wheat flour.


Coconut flour and wheat flour are not equivalent and, if you are using a recipe that calls for wheat flour, you will need to make some adjustments. For example, if the recipe calls for 1 cup of regular flour then you will need to use 1/4 to 1/3 cup of coconut flour. You may also need to add more eggs — for every 1 cup of coconut flour, you will need to add six beaten eggs and 1 cup of liquid, like coconut milk.It is generally a better idea to follow recipes that specifically use coconut or almond flour instead of experimenting and trying to swap them in for wheat flour. Try making some paleo coconut flour brownies.

, Rice is not allowed on the paleo diet, so you will need to replace it if you want to make a paleo swap for rice. Grated cauliflower makes a nice substitute because it resembles rice.Grate a head of fresh, raw cauliflower using a box grater. Then, cook it as desired or enjoy it raw.

You may feel you deserve a treat after a long night, so you'll be unlikely to reach for unhealthy foods. Make sure this is not an option. Keep your home stocked with healthy snacks for when you get off work.Healthy snacks include fruits, vegetables, and spreads like hummus.
Prepare food in an easily snack-able form so you don't have to waste time preparing when you're tired from work. Cut fruits and vegetables into slices before leaving for work. You can also buy pre-cut fruits and veggies at the supermarket if you have a particularly long week.;
, Even if you sleep in late, you should always have breakfast. Within one hour of waking up, make sure that you eat a healthy meal. This can help rev your metabolism for the coming day.Try oatmeal and fruit, or healthy proteins like hard boiled eggs.

, If you're exhausted from working late, the 24 hour McDonald's across from your office may seem like a well-deserved treat at 3 AM. However, part of the reason night shift workers gain weight is because of unhealthy eating habits like these. If you need a meal during your shift, prepare a meal at home before work.Make sure any meal you bring is healthy. Strive for meals rich in lean protein, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
You should also bring in your own snacks. This will help you avoid unhealthy vending machine foods during your shift.

, Metabolism tends to slow down if you wait until you're extremely hungry to eat. Due to the unusual schedule, night shift workers often end up eating when they're already famished. Not only does this have a poor effect on the body, it's a cause for post-shift overeating and can make you feel sluggish on the job. Opt for light snacks between meal times and, when it's time for your dinner break, stick to a low calorie, healthy meal., Many people mistake thirst for hunger, so make sure that you stay hydrated during your shift. Dehydration can lead to food cravings and overeating, which can cause you to pack on the pounds when working a night shift.Purchase a water bottle and fill it before your shift. This will cut down on the cost of purchasing bottled water at work. Refill the bottle at a water fountain when necessary.
If you're not a big water drinker, consider infusing your water with fruit to add flavor. For example, you can add a squeeze of lemon or toss a few berries into your water bottle. This may also add a small amount of calories to your drinks, cutting back on the urge to snack or overeat.

, It can be hard to maintain a regular eating schedule when you're working a night shift. However, it's vital you do so if you want to lose weight. Your body learns to expect food at certain times. If you're working a late shift, your eating habits may be erratic. If you shift your eating schedule during weekends or days off, your body never has time to fully adjust to an eating schedule. This may cause weight gain.Try to eat at specific times each day. For example, if you get up at 1:30PM, make sure to eat breakfast by 2PM. Even on weekends or days off, when you may get up earlier, strive to eat at 2PM.
This can be difficult when it comes to socializing. For you, dinnertime may be around midnight, but your friends may be getting together for food at 7PM on a Saturday. Show up and have a drink or a light appetizer instead of a full meal.

, Moving more throughout your shift can help you keep unwanted weight off. If possible, opt for light exercise during your night shift. Not only will this help you burn more calories, it could help you sleep better at night.For example, you can take walks during your breaks, walk up and down stairs during spare moments, or do stretches in your cubicle or office.

, Many people who work night shifts have an erratic schedule. Due to this, you may have trouble making time in your routine for exercise. However, if you want to lose weight, regular exercise needs to be part of your schedule.Find a time that works for you to exercise. Exercising after work is probably not practical, and may actually be dangerous if you're jogging on the street at 3AM. However, see if you can find time in the afternoon.
Look for gaps in your schedule. Say you get to bed by 4AM on most nights, and tend to sleep until one. Your shift typically starts at nine o'clock. You could find some time during the afternoon to get in 45 minutes of aerobics a few times a week.

, For weight loss, it's recommended you get in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or 75 minutes of intense physical activity each week. Make sure you hit those numbers by exercising three to four times a week.Choose an activity you like and are likely to stick to. If you loathe running, jogging will probably not be your best route to weight loss. However, if you love riding your bike, make time for an afternoon bike ride a few times a week.
You can find ways to make working out less tedious. Listen to music while you jog or use your treadmill. Watch television at the gym to make the time go by faster.

, It's a bad idea to jump into a vigorous exercise routine if you've been inactive for a while. Ease into any workout routine slowly. For example, if you want to start running, begin with walking and slow-paced jogging before you begin to sprint.


You should also talk to your doctor before beginning a new form of exercise. You want to make sure you do not strain yourself.

, People who do not get enough sleep have trouble sticking to exercise schedules. This can be due to increased fatigue. If you tend to skip out on quality sleep, this can be a barrier to weight loss.You need about seven to nine hours of sleep a day.You may feel the need to unwind after a night shift. However, if you get home at 3am and play video games until 5am, you may end up skipping out on high quality sleep.
Set a bedtime for yourself and stick to it. Even if it's difficult, having a set bedtime can help you manage your schedule and help stave off weight gain.

, Working the night shift can be exhausting. However, bingeing on caffeine late at night can make sleep impossible. Avoid going for coffee and energy drinks towards the end of your shift so you don't go home wired and unable to sleep., If your mind is racing with thoughts from work, you need to find a way to shut your brain down. Make a relaxing bedtime ritual for yourself. This can help you wind down and fall asleep.Something you find personally calming can help. For example, taking a warm bath may be a good idea. Reading can also take your mind off of the moment, promoting sleep.
You should stay away from electronic screens before bed. The blue light that comes from a laptop or phone stimulates brain activity, making sleep difficult.
Stay consistent. If you engage in the same ritual every night, your body will learn to associate that routine with sleep. This will help encourage your brain and body to shut down for rest.

Start with a liquid base.,
Add frozen or fresh produce.,
Add protein.,
Add extra flavor.",How to Make a Low Calorie Smoothie1," Start your smoothie with a liquid base. It should be added to your blender first before the fruits, vegetables, or other ingredients. This helps protect the blades as well as helping things blend well.The ratio of the liquid base to the fruits and vegetables should be for every 2 cups of liquid base, add about ¾ cup of fruit, vegetables, or other ingredients. You can add more fruits and vegetables if you want, especially if they are juicier.
For a low-calorie smoothie, instead of piling in a lot of high calorie fruits, choose one or two fruits, a green, a protein, and some spices.
Balance high calorie fruits, like bananas and pineapple, with lower calorie fruits, like berries. Instead of one cup of nut milk, consider using ½ cup of skim milk and ½ cup of water to reduce calories.
Add ice at the end if you want to cool your drink, give it a frozen treat consistency, and thin it out.;
, Smoothies are thick, so you should start with a thin liquid base. This can be anything liquid, such as dairy milk, soy milk, herbal teas, or nut milk. If you want to use dairy milk, make sure to use a lower calorie version, like 2% or 1%. Use unsweetened nut milks instead of sweetened nut milks or dairy milks to save calories.For low-calorie smoothies, choose low-calorie bases including:


Water
Unflavored, unsweetened almond milk
No sugar added coconut water or coconut milk
Rice milk
Green tea

, The produce is the main ingredient for your low-calorie smoothie. You can use frozen fruit or vegetables, but, of course, fresher is better. You can add just about any fruit or vegetable you want. For lower calorie smoothies, load up on veggies and limit fruits.


Some good ideas for vegetables include any dark leafy greens, like kale or spinach, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, avocados, or beets. Almost any fruit makes a good smoothie. Try berries, melons, bananas, pineapple, pears, peaches, mangos, and kiwis.You can buy prepackaged smoothie packs in the freezer section of your grocery store. You can also freeze your own produce. Bananas, mango, berries, kale, spinach, and even melons can be frozen. Since you are just throwing them in a blender for a smoothie, you don’t have to worry about freezing them perfectly.

, To make a low-calorie, all around healthy smoothie, add some protein. This doesn’t mean tossing in some protein powder. There are natural, tastier ways to get protein in your smoothie. Try:Low fat cottage cheese
Low fat plain Greek yogurt
Tahini, almond butter, or low-calorie, no sugar added peanut butter
Nuts, such as almonds or walnuts
Hemp, chia, flax, or pumpkin seeds
Silken tofu

, You can add a lot of flavor into your smoothie without adding in extra calories. Smoothies don’t have to be just strawberry and banana or tropical. You can make any kind of smoothie you want with any flavor. Try adding spices and herbs to vary the flavor. Try:Cinnamon
Nutmeg
Basil
Mint
Turmeric
Cardamom
Cilantro
Thyme
Cloves
Ginger
Cayenne

Use a blender instead of a food processor.,
Try an immersion blender.,
Use a traditional countertop blender.,
Consider a higher speed motor.,
Decide if you want single-serve or multi-serve.",How to Make a Low Calorie Smoothie4," To make any smoothie, you need a good blender, but higher power blenders do not necessarily mean better blenders. Additionally, you don’t want to use a food processor for smoothies. Food processors work better with solid foods, and smoothies are mostly made with softer fruits and vegetables.

, Immersion blenders are hand-held blenders with the blades at the bottom. An immersion blender is a popular choice for making smoothies. You can blend the ingredients in the cup you want to drink from, or you can do it in a separate bowl or container.You can’t crush ice with an immersion blender. Some frozen fruit may pose difficulties, too.

, Countertop blenders sit on the countertop and ingredients are added to the blender jar. The jar can be glass, plastic, or steel. These blenders can range from $20 to over $500.Glass is heaviest and provides the most stability. In addition, glass won’t retain any flavor or odors. Glass also allows you to see your smoothie as it is made, which can help you know if you need to add more liquid or if you need to keep blending.
Plastic blenders can get stained, especially when you are using a lot of brightly colored fruits and vegetables, like blueberries and beets.

, If you are going to make smoothies with a lot of harder vegetables and fruits, like carrots, beets, frozen fruits, or similar, you may want to buy a blender with a larger motor. This helps ensure the blender is strong enough to puree all the ingredients. Consider a blender of at least 1000 watts., Blenders come in a lot of various sizes. If you are making smoothies for yourself, a single serve blender may be all you need. If you are looking to involve family members, use smoothies to serve guests, or make extra for later, you may be more interested in a multi-serve blender.Traditional countertop blenders are usually multi-serve. High-speed blending systems, like the NutriBullet, are single serve.

Keep your fat intake between 20 and 35 percent of your total calories.,
Enjoy plant-based fats.,
Eat less saturated fat.,
Avoid trans fats.,
Choose where you want to include fat in your diet.,
Flavor foods without the fat.,
Choose foods with a low calorie density so that you can eat more bulk instead of small portions of fatty foods.,
Find low-fat ways to add creamy texture to dishes.",How to Manage Fats and Sugars on the Volumetrics Diet1," If you aren’t counting calories yet on Volumetrics, then just make sure that fat makes up about 1/4 of what you consume every day.;
, Adding a little fat to your Volumetrics meals will help you to feel more full, especially when coupled with the larger volume of fruits and vegetables that you are eating. It will also help your body tone up better as you lose fat and water so that you don’t look as giggly (it’s not a substitute for exercise, but the plant-based fat does help improve the consistency of your flesh as you lose the weight).


Use olive and canola oil when you make salad dressing. You should start both your Volumetrics lunch and dinner with either soup or some salad.
Sprinkle nuts and seeds (no more than 1 tablespoon) on your salad.
Eat avocados in moderation. Avocados are high in both nutrients and monounsaturated fats, which are very heart healthy.

, Saturated fat is found in many fatty cuts of red meat or in fatty cheeses and butter. Many foods that contain saturated fat also have a high calorie density, which means they should only be consumed in limited amounts.

, Trans fats, like partially hydrogenated oils, are designed to keep products shelf stable at room temperature. However, these fats are also extremely harmful. Avoid products like margarine and processed foods that contain trans fats.

, Deciding what matters and what doesn’t in terms of fat will help you to make decisions that work for your own dietary preferences. Because you cannot eat many foods with high calorie density, you will have to make some trade-offs concerning when you consume fat.


Eat leaner cuts of meat and then you can put more cream in your coffee.
Enjoy low-fat cheese so that you can have a full-fat salad dressing.

, You’ll still enjoy substantial flavor in your food while keeping your meal’s calorie density low.


Try different cooking methods, like roasting, grilling and broiling.
Cook foods in broth or wine to add flavor without adding fat.
Herbs, spices diced flavorful vegetables and citrus juices and zest, as well as vinegars also add big flavor without adding fat.

, With larger portions of fruits and vegetables, for example, you can feel full without the fat, which is at the heart of the Volumetrics philosophy.

,


Learn to cook with yogurt or with reduced-fat sour cream.
Try pureeing vegetables or potatoes for a creamy texture without the fat. You can also use these purees in place of fat in many dishes.

Order your coffee with non-fat milk.,
Choose an English muffin instead of a bagel.,
Select popcorn instead of chips.,
Choose mustard.,
Replace sugary drinks with water.,
Explore other substitutions.",How to Save 100 Calories Every Day1," One of the easiest ways to cut 100 calories from your diet is to make small substitutions. In time, you won’t even notice the difference! Start by making the switch to non-fat milk in your coffee.Order lattes, cappuccinos, or other coffee drinks “skinny.”
Use non-fat milk in brewed coffee instead of half & half or creamer.
Try unsweetened almond milk for a dairy-free alternative.;
, You may have been told to skip bread altogether if you’re looking to shed calories. But that does not have to be the case! By selecting lower calories bread options, you can shave 100 calories from your breakfast.Choose 100% whole wheat bread whenever possible.

, Popcorn is a whole grain that provides you with complex carbohydrates and fiber. When you use an air-popper, your popcorn is also very low in fat. Sub this snack for the chips in your lunch to save 100 (or more) calories.Choose a pre-packaged popcorn like Skinny Pop.
Pop it at home.
Choose healthy toppings instead of butter. Try nutritional yeast (available at health food stores), Parmesan cheese, and/or sea salt.

, Mustard contains fewer calories than mayo, ketchup, barbeque sauce, and most other condiments. Plus, mustard has actually been shown to increase metabolism--up to 25%--which can save an additional 50 calories a day.Put mustard on sandwiches, burgers, and other snacks.
Make salad dressing out of Dijon mustard and citrus.
Top salmon with mustard and bake.

, Soda and even fruit juice can easily pack on the calories without making you feel full. Stocking your fridge with water or diet soda instead is an easy win., Finding healthy but delicious replacement for your favorite junk foods makes them easier to resist. If you crave French fries, try a baked potato instead (light on the butter). Make your own ice cream substitute out of frozen banana, or find a healthy pizza recipe."

Read the ingredient label.,
Use real sugar in small quantities.,
Learn to enjoy the natural sweetness of fruit.,
Use sugar substitutes wisely.",How to Manage Fats and Sugars on the Volumetrics Diet2," If sugar or high fructose corn syrup are at or near the top of the ingredient list, then the food gets the majority of its calories from sugar. According to Volumetrics guidelines, you should avoid or limit your consumption of these foods because of their high calorie density.

, For instance, if adding brown sugar to a bowl of a whole grain cereal like oatmeal will persuade you to eat oatmeal, then go ahead and add a teaspoon of brown sugar to your oatmeal. Keep the sugar addition small so that the calorie density of the oatmeal stays low.

, If you don’t like to eat fruit on its own, try some of these ideas:


Drizzle fruit with liqueur or sprinkle it with a small amount of shaved chocolate or chopped nuts.
Eat fruit desserts that are lower in calorie density, such as frozen fruit pops or sorbet made with real fruit.

, Use sugar substitutes as a tool for eating less sugar and not as an excuse to consume large amounts of foods that contain few nutrients.


Instead of choosing to eat a processed sugar-free package of cookies, choose to eat fruit. The fruit contains more nutritional value and a lower calorie density, which means that you can have more to eat.
Don’t consume too much diet soda just to feel full. Instead of drinking multiple sodas, eat nutrient-packed foods with a low calorie density to fill yourself up.

Use smaller plates.,
Shell your own nuts.,
Eat an open-faced sandwich.,
Fill half your plate with veggies.",How to Save 100 Calories Every Day2," An optical illusion may be causing you to eat more than you need to. Researchers at Cornell University have noticed a correlation between the size of our dishes and the amount of food we think we need to feel full. In short, you can actually trick yourself into saving calories—while still feeling just as full—by using smaller plates.Use a smaller bowl for cereal or soup.
Use smaller plates for dinner.
Use a smaller glass for juice.
When you eat tacos or burritos, use smaller tortillas.

, When you snack on shelled pistachios, you are far more likely to overeat. On the other hand, if you spend the time and energy to crack open the shells yourself, you give yourself more time to feel full. Additionally, some studies show that keeping the shells visible helps remind you how much you have eaten, thus reducing over-snacking.Peanuts and pistachios are easy to shell by hand.
Pecans, walnuts, and other nuts will require the use of a nut cracker.

, When you eat a sandwich, you don’t really need the top slice of bread. In fact, sometimes that top slice absorbs the flavor! Enjoy your favorite sandwiches while saving 100 (or more) calories by opting to have them “open-faced.” Save that top piece of bread for a sandwich tomorrow., When you are filling your plate at dinner, aim to cover 50% of it with vegetables. Vegetables are filled with essential vitamins and minerals, and they are notoriously low in calories. You can shave 100 calories from your plate by making veggies a priority.You can choose from:


Leafy greens, like kale or romaine
Cruciferous veggies, like broccoli
The gourd family, like zucchini
Use potatoes sparingly

You're connected with thousands of others who are also looking to lose weight. Check out sites like Weight Loss Buddy, SparkPeople, and Diet.com, which are weight loss sites with a strong community.


One study in particular found that those people who ""friended"" others and checked in more regularly lost 8% more weight than those that didn't.Start by looking for groups you can join or people you can connect with that have the same goals. The information shared will be helpful to you.
Search Facebook, Twitter or Instagram for subjects relating to weight loss, healthy eating, fitness or a particular diet.
To get the the most benefit from your time spent online, it's wise to join a couple of social media outlets. Combined, they can act as a fairly large support group.
Having a whole group of many people to reach out to for more support, more ideas or to complement you on your progress is a valuable part of social media.;
, Although you may be a more passive social media user, you'll do better if you interact with your social media outlets more often.


Don't only sign up for groups or friend others. Get as active as you can. That means friending others, liking pages or pictures, sharing photos, tracking your progress, commenting on other's progress, etc.
The more active you are with the social media community, the more information, support and community you'll receive in return.
If you're on a weight loss Facebook group and participate regularly in commenting or providing support, you're more likely to get support back from other members.

, The internet is a great resource for weight loss. Social media takes that a step further allowing others to share resources they've found or created through these collaborative networks.


Another great benefit to using social media for weight loss is that you're put in contact with a large variety of resources for weight loss.Many times, just being a part of a group or being friends with others puts great information onto your news feed or account homepage. This can put a lot of great information at your hands on how to lose weight and stay accountable.
However, you can also ask the social media community for information as well. Need a new breakfast recipe? Write a post or tweet about it. Need a new workout idea? Write about it on a community page.

, Although many apps are not necessarily a specific social media outlet, they do have some similar qualities and many connect with social media outlets and can enhance your diet.There are a variety of weight loss, fitness or nutrition apps that you can use either on your smartphone, tablet or computer. Look for apps that can connect with your social media outlets.
For example, find a running app that allows you to share your distance and pace on Facebook or share your route on Twitter.
You can use a food journal app that shares your daily meals on Facebook or Twitter as well.
These apps can help you track your progress and provide additional tools for your weight loss journey. When paired with social media, they can really make weight loss more encouraging and fun.
Some popular dieting and fitness apps include: MyFitnessPal, Run Keeper, LoseIt!, FitBit and Noom Weight Loss Coach.

, Staying accountable during weight loss is essential. Accountability is what helps keep you on track with your weight loss plan, but also helps you maintain your weight loss long-term. Social media allows you to track yourself in a variety of ways. Social media is a great outlet to not only keep yourself accountable, but also can give you tools to stay on track.


You can keep a virtual food diary and share with your friends or group members. They can comment on your diary and make suggestions as well.
Consider putting up how long you've exercised for or how many calories you've burned. You can even set up competitions for total steps walked or miles run with others online.
Also see how others in different groups or others that you have connected with track or share their progress. Do they share pictures of the scale? Do they track minutes of exercise? See what ways they are using social media.

, One great social media outlet to use for your weight loss efforts is Twitter. It can be as personal or anonymous as you'd like. However, this tool is a great way to stay on track.


One particular study showed that those who shared their victories on Twitter, trimmed up faster compared to those who didn't.Twitter is an easy to use website that works well for weight loss. You can send tweets about your weight loss, what you're eating or even ask questions via tweets.
In addition, Twitter uses hashtags which help you search for certain subjects and help others find your tweets about a specific subject.
It might be a fun idea to create your own special hashtag to share with your online support group so everyone can catch up on your progress. For example, you might have a #FitFriday hashtag and track your weekly exercise routine.
For example you could tweet ""#FitFriday, hit the pavement and walked 3 miles today!

, Facebook is a really good place to look for support and ideas for weight loss. It offers you a variety of ways to stay on track and can be a really useful tool.Facebook allows you put add in much more information compared to other social media sites. You can add photos, create special groups or join specialty groups, friend people, connect with certain apps and have access to a constantly updated news feed. This additional functionality will be beneficial to you.
One special feature of Facebook in particular, is the ability to join or create specialty groups. This allows you to have a personalized support group. People can share progress, you can comment, share pictures, upload recipes and more on these group pages.

, Instagram is another social media outlet that can help you visually stay on track. Many times pictures are more useful and more fun compared to written updates.Instagram is similar to Twitter in the sense it offers a little more of a limited capability. However, instead of tweets, you upload photos with comments or captions.
This can allow you to upload pictures of the foods you eat, the numbers on the scale, pictures of your morning run or pictures of yourself as you continually lose weight.
Many times, seeing pictures of others as they lose weight or having to post a picture of yourself, is motivating enough to stay on track.

, In addition to using social media and apps to help you lose weight, you'll also need to change your lifestyle. You can use social media to help you with lifestyle changes, too. One thing you will want to focus on is exercise. Regular and consistent exercise can help you lose weight and then support weight maintenance once you hit your goal.Use Pinterest to search for new exercise routines. Try searching for keywords like ""Cardio routine,"" ""30 day HIIT challenge,"" ""Abs workout,"" etc. Not only will you find new exercises to incorporate into your routine, you will also find daily, weekly, or monthly fitness plans you can follow.
Try following a motivational Facebook page like Yoga Journal Pose of the Day, which will keep things fresh by emailing you three different yoga poses every day.YouTube is a goldmine when it comes to exercise videos. Try searching for ""Zumba dance routine"" or ""Cardio workout"" to find thousands of exercise routines to choose from. It can also be helpful if you're not sure about a particular exercise. For instance, if you're not sure you're doing squats correctly, search for ""Squats proper form"" and you can watch experienced trainers demonstrate the technique.
Include at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity cardio activities each week. This can be walking, jogging, cycling, hiking, dancing or swimming.Also include one to two days of strength training each week. This helps build lean muscle mass and can help increase you metabolism over time.

, If you want to lose weight, you'll need to exercise and monitor how many calories you eat each day. Cutting out a few calories and monitoring your diet will help start weight loss. Smartphone apps are great tools when it comes to counting calories, as most people have their phone on them at all times. As soon as you sit down to a meal, log your calories using an app like MyFitnessPal. This app provides you with the maximum calories you can eat each day to reach your weight loss goals. Log what you're eating into your food diary and check out chat forums for recipes and advice.


Other popular calorie counting apps include Lose It!, FatSecret, and Cron-o-meter.To help get your weight down, consider watching your total calorie intake. When you cut out a healthy amount of calories, you can slowly lose weight over time. Aim to cut out about 500 calories total from your diet, which will result in about a one to two pound weight loss each week. This is a safe and sustainable rate of weight loss.
Do not cut out more than 500 calories or eat fewer than 1,200 calories daily. This will leave you too hungry, lacking in energy and promote slower weight loss long-term.

, Monitoring calories is important; however, you also need to support your calorie counting by measuring out the appropriate portion sizes of the foods you eat. Dieting apps like Calorie Counter, MyPlate Calorie Tracker, and Lose It! include information on portion control. Try an app like Pertinacity, which can help you estimate portion sizes by comparing the amount of food on your plate to the size of your fist.


When you're measuring protein, include a 3–4 oz serving at every meal. Weigh out 3–4 oz or measure out about a 1/2 cup of protein-rich foods.If you're serving yourself fruit, choose 1 small piece or measure out about a 1/2 cup of cut fruit.For vegetables, your portions should be bigger. It should be about 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of leafy salad greens.Grains also need to be measured. Weigh out about 1 oz per serving or measure out a 1/2 cup per serving., Reducing your calorie intake and exercising are key to losing weight; however, if you're not eating a balanced diet, your weight loss may not be as great as you'd like. Social media is a great resource for diet plans and recipe swapping. Try searching ""Nutrition"" on Facebook and join a group in which community members suggest healthy recipes. Pinterest is another great resource for healthy recipes; just try searching ""Healthy chicken recipes"" and you'll have tons of delicious dishes to choose from.


If you join an online weight loss community, chances are there will be tons of resources for healthy, balanced meals. The website FitDay offers online consultations with Registered Dietitian, who can help you come up with a detailed meal plan.A balanced diet helps provide your body with every essential nutrient it needs. Without those nutrients, you can experience fatigue, slow weight loss and nutrient deficiencies over time.To eat a balanced diet, start by eating something from every food group each day. That means including a source of protein, fruits, vegetables, dairy and whole grains daily.
In addition, eat a wide variety of foods from those groups each day. Don't just eat the same foods. This will limit your intake of a variety of nutrients. Instead choose a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains and protein sources throughout the week.

, Another part of your lifestyle that's important to manage is your stress levels. Stress is not only frustrating to deal with but, can also make weight loss much more difficult. Using social media to connect with friends and loved ones may help reduce stress in women.Studies have shown that stress, especially chronic stress, increase your hunger hormones causing you to eat more and even eat foods that aren't all that great for you.Try an app like Gratitude Journal, which encourages you to record things for which you are grateful (you can include photos if you want). You can share your journal with friends and tag them in your posts or keep your journal private. Studies show that expressing gratitude can decrease depression and anxiety.Consider a meditation app like Headspace, which provides guided guided meditation sessions via your smartphone. You can team up with up to five friends and monitor each other's progress and provide each other with motivation."

Your carb intake should be in the recommended range of 20-50 grams per a day.Don't feel that you must restrict yourself to a small number of foods. You can enjoy a wide variety of healthy foods that provide a large array of nutrients.


Healthy protein sources include egg whites, soy products, and chicken. Fish such as salmon and trout, as well as shellfish like shrimp and lobster are also good sources of protein in a healthy diet. Non-fat greek yogurt is also a good way to get protein and dairy in your diet.
Low carb vegetables include: broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, kale, brussels sprouts, cabbage, swiss chard, lettuce, cucumber, and celery. Steaming or baking vegetables, rather than frying them, will ensure you receive all the nutrients and antioxidants in low carb veggies for the week.
Healthy fat sources include avocados and nuts, as well as olive oil, coconut oil, and avocado oil. These oils are healthier alternatives to cooking with animal fats or heavily saturated fats.;
, Foods high in carbs and sugars cause your body to secrete insulin, which is a main fat storage hormone in your body. When your insulin levels go down, your body can start to burn fat. It also helps your kidneys shed excess sodium and water, which will help you reduce any water weight.Avoid foods high in starch and carbs like potato chips, french fries, and white breads. You should also avoid consuming foods high in sugar like soft drinks, candy, cakes, and other junk food.
Animal fats found in red meat and gamey meat like lamb can be fattening and slow down your metabolism as they are difficult to digest. Skip the steak or the lamb burger for one week as part of your meal plan.

But you should also include healthy sugar options such as fruit.

, This meal plan should include three main meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner), scheduled at the same time of day, as well as two small snacks (between breakfast and lunch, and lunch and dinner), also schedule at the same time of day. This will ensure you eat at a consistent time for all seven days and do not skip or miss a meal. Eating about 1,400 calories a day, combined with daily exercise, can lead to healthy weight loss.A meal plan is essential to the success of your weight-loss program. It keeps you aware of what you will be eating throughout the day and the entire week. This helps you stay on track.
Make a grocery list based on your meal plan and go food shopping for the week on Sunday. Stock your fridge with all the necessary ingredients to make your meals for the week so you can prepare each meal easily and quickly., Kickstart your day with a protein filled breakfast that will give you energy (and keep your blood sugar up) for the rest of the day. Aim for a breakfast that is 400 calories and eat it every morning at around the same time. Go for variety and rotate two to three options. Pair your breakfast with unsweetened tea or a glass of water with lemon.Start the day right with a berry parfait and an English muffin. Put four ounces of low-fat yogurt in a bowl with one tablespoon low-fat granola and ½ cup sliced strawberries. Add one more layer of yogurt and granola and finish it with ½ cup raspberries. You can eat this delicious berry parfait with half a toasted whole wheat English muffin topped with two teaspoons peanut butter.
Make instant oatmeal and add in dried fruit and nuts for a healthy, fiber packed breakfast. Add 1 ⅓ cup fat-free milk to two packets of instant oatmeal (look for no sugar added oatmeal). Cook it according to the package directions in the microwave or the stove. Once it’s cooked, mix in two tablespoons dried cranberries and one tablespoon chopped walnuts.
Create a filling, but healthy morning meal by toasting two whole wheat waffles. Add one tablespoon pure maple syrup and one small sliced banana. Have a glass of fat free milk on the side.
Avoid a carb-heavy breakfast, which will lead to blood sugar highs and lows throughout the day and activate cravings.

, Schedule in lunch so you eat at the same time every day and can plan out your meals in advance. Make lunches that are 500 calories or less, and rotate several lunch options so you get some variety for the week.Try a protein heavy meal like a bean tortilla with gazpacho. Warm up a two ounce wheat tortilla in the microwave or on the stove and fill it with ½ cup cooked black beans, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, two tablespoons shredded reduced-fat cheddar cheese, and half an avocado, sliced. Serve it with one cup of ready-made gazpacho or salsa. Finish with a one ounce piece of dark chocolate for dessert.
Integrate fish into your diet with a tilapia and rice pilaf dish. Heat up one teaspoon olive oil in a pan over medium high heat. Season a three ounce tilapia fillet with some salt and pepper. Place it in the pan for about two to three minutes per side. When the fish is done, it should flake easily with a fork. Prepare ½ cup rice pilaf (prepared from a box or made from scratch) and ½ cup steamed snap peas. Serve the tilapia with the rice pilaf and the snap peas. Finish the meal with a baked apple, topped with a pinch of cinnamon and one teaspoon honey, served with ⅓ cup low-fat vanilla ice cream.
Have a hummus and vegetable sandwich that is high in protein and flavor. Spread ¼ cup store-bought or homemade hummus on two slices of whole-grain bread. Add baby salad greens, sliced cucumber and red bell pepper. Have your healthy sandwich with one cup of minestrone soup, six ounces of low-fat yogurt and ½ cup grapes.
A carb-heavy lunch leads to more carb cravings and an afternoon energy crash.

, Finish your day with a dinner that is filling but will not overload your metabolism or create fat that is hard for your body to burn. Keep your dinner within 500 calories a meal and focus on a balance of protein, vegetables, and healthy fats. You can also rotate lunch and dinner options every day for variety.Make a protein-rich dinner with grilled pork chops and asparagus. Heat one teaspoon olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Season a three ounce pork chop with salt and pepper. Place it in the pan and cook it for three to five minutes per a side. Serve with ½ cup mashed potatoes, one cup steamed or baked asparagus, and ½ cup bell pepper strips. Top the meal off with ½ cup fresh raspberries.
Create a protein packed dinner with red lentil soup. Garnish each bowl of homemade soup with a tablespoon of non-fat yogurt and fresh cilantro. Have a slice of whole wheat bread or a handful of crackers on the side.
Cook an easy, filling dinner by making a vegetable frittata. A frittata is an egg based dish that combines egg, a vegetable like mushrooms and spinach, and a light cheese like feta to make a kind of pie. Frittatas are great sources of protein, and vegetables, and also make good leftovers for breakfast.

, Water will help your immune system stay healthy, keep your skin looking great, and keep you hydrated during your daily workout.Replace sugary drinks like soda with water sweetened with slices of lemon or lime.
Unsweetened green tea is another good substitute for sugary drinks. Green tea contains a good amount of antioxidants, meaning that it helps your body fight against free radicals, which enhance signs of aging in humans., Write down everything you eat and be meticulous about it. You're less likely to eat badly if you have to deal with the guilt of writing it down in your journal afterward. You can also track your calorie intake and how successful you are at maintaining your meal plan.Also note in your journal how you're feeling when you ate the food. Were you feeling depressed, happy, angry, or optimistic? Focusing on your emotions as well as the foods themselves can help cue you into patterns of emotional eating, if there are any.

, Most exercise plans recommend working out for five days of the week and taking two days to rest. Depending on your current fitness level, you may want to commit to doing light exercise every day or more intense exercise every other day. Rather than overdo your workouts, focus on being consistent and sticking to an exercise plan that is realistic and specific to the needs of your body.Create a workout schedule so you are exercising at the same time every day. This could be every morning at the gym before work, every other day during lunch, or every night several hours before bed. Look at your schedule for the week and pencil in workout time so it is part of your day and you cannot miss it or forget about it.

, Start every workout with light cardio as you never want to stretch or put stress on cold muscles.


Do a light five to ten minute jog in place. Use a jump rope and jump in place for five minutes. Or, go for a ten minute run to activate your muscles and break a sweat.

, It's important to stretch your muscles after your five to ten minute cardio warm up so you do not injure yourself while doing high intensity exercises. You should also stretch for five to ten minutes at the end of your workout. Stretching will keep you from pulling your muscles or harming your body.


Do basic leg and arm stretches so your bigger muscles are warmed up and ready to work during your exercise routine. Practice lunge stretches, quadricep stretches, calf stretches, and butterfly stretches.

, HIIT is an exercise program that alternates intense exercises with short intervals of recovery or rest. This type of exercise will help you burn fat fast. High intensity exercises force your body to use the sugars in your body and allows you to burn fat faster than low intensity workouts. You will also use stored body fat during the recovery phase, which will reduce your stored body fat. You can perform HIIT exercises with gym equipment, or an exercise mat and a few free weights. There are several popular HIIT programs, including:The Beach Body Workout: This twelve week HIIT program only takes 21 minutes, three days a week, and is designed to help strengthen and sculpt your body, while also shedding weight. The program targets specific areas of your body, such as your arms and abs, and integrates cardio and stretching. After week one of the program, you will start to notice a leaner look and stronger muscles.The 25-Minute Sprint Fartlek Workout: “Fartlek” means “speed play” in Swedish. This type of HIIT program combines continuous training with speed intervals. You control the intensity and speed of each interval, so the training can feel spontaneous and engaging. This program focuses on cardio training, where you walk, jog, or sprint for set amounts of time.
The Countdown Jump Rope Workout: To do this interval workout, all you need is a stopwatch and a jump rope. Start by trying to jump for two straight minutes, then rest for two minutes, and jump rope again for 1.5 minutes. Then, rest for one and a half minutes and then jump rope again for one minute, and rest for one minutes. Finish with jumping rope for 30 seconds. Rest for three minutes and then repeat the intervals one to two more times.

, Playing sports is a great way to burn calories while having fun. Sports puts a little competitive fire into the equation; you often forget that you're working out, and will still likely break a sweat. Sports good for weight loss include:


Soccer: This sport that will boost your cardio and help you burn fat.Swimming: An hour of swimming in the pool will burn 400-600 calories, and strengthen your joints, your muscles, and improve your blood circulation.Basketball: Playing a game of full court basketball can help you burn 400 to 700 calories., Mix up your workout week by joining a fitness class that combines cardio with strength building and interval training.


An aerobics and dance class like Zumba can help you lose weight. One hour of Zumba class can help you burn 500-1000 calories.Cycling is great for weight loss and muscle strengthening. Take a spin class to up your fat-burning exercise routine and lose weight in your thighs, butt, and abs., It’s difficult to eat out and have a healthy meal. Many restaurant items are carb-heavy, fat-heavy, and loaded with sodium. Avoid going out for meals during the week so you can stick to your meal plan and ensure you are only eating foods that will help you stay full and lose weight.


Pack your own lunch and bring it to work to avoid eating out in the middle of the day. Prepare your meals in advance so you aren’t tempted to eat out.

, Committing to a weight loss program for a week with a friend or partner can help you stay motivated and stick to the program, together. You are also now accountable to each other as you both work hard to lose weight for the week.

, Once you have experienced one week of healthy eating, focused exercising, and other lifestyle changes, you may want to consider continuing these habits. Work on maintaining your diet over the period of a month, as well as your exercise plan, and then try maintaining it.

A healthy amount is 1 or 2 pounds a week, but in the first week it's possible to lose a lot more (mainly water weight), so we're not going to do any dream crushing just yet. Just figure out how much you want to lose during the next 240 hours.


Let's say you want to lose 5 pounds in the next 10 days. That's 1 pound every 2 days. Since a pound is 3,500 calories, that's 1,750 calories you need to lose every day. What's your amount?;
, Let's keep going with this 5 pounds example. You need to have a 1,750 calorie deficit to lose .5 pounds a day. For the record, that's steep, but we'll entertain it nonetheless. Here's how to figure out how to make that work:


Go to wikiHow's How to Count How Many Calories You Need to Eat to Lose Weight article. It'll give you your BMR and the amount of calories you can eat every day.
Once you get that amount of calories you can eat every day, subtract 1,750. That'll be the number you're working with. Obviously, the more exercise you do, the more calories you can eat.

, You're serious about this, right? So grab a notebook or download an app (there are dozens of free ones out there). When you come face-to-face with what you're eating, it's a lot easier to see where your downfalls are. And to see your progress! And lots of apps have neat things you can mess around with that are pretty motivating, too.


In this diary, you'll be counting calories and tracking them. That way if you do really well on one day, you can fudge a little on the next. Or vice versa.

, Select an exercise plan that you can make a part of your routine. Is it easier for you to work out in the mornings before work? Or, is waking up early something you can't commit to? Look at your schedule for the the next 10 days and pick specific times to work out that are doable for you. Be sure to stick to them.


Aim for a workout almost every day. An hour is good, but 30 minutes will do. If you have to break it up, no problem! And if you ""don't have time,"" make some. Even though you’re focusing on the next 10 days, there is no harm in striving for a healthier routine you can carry forward.

, You've got the plan. You've got the motivation. Now all you need to do is set yourself up for success. It sounds a bit harsh and it may feel like a blow to your wallet, but go through your kitchen right now. Throw out the junk food and prepackaged stuff you know you don't need. If you're serious about this 10-day weight loss thing, you'll make the sacrifice. It's the only way to avoid the temptation.


Okay, easier said than done. The family would probably throw a fit, wouldn't they? Let's make a compromise: get whoever lives with you to hide the food or put it somewhere you can't find it. And don't let them tell you where it is!

, Let's get down to brass tacks right away. We only have 10 days, so it's high time we start eating the right way. And after so many years of eating you thought you had it down! Nuh uh. Mom didn't have weight loss in mind when she taught you. Here's how to eat with an eye on a trimmer waistline:



Eat often. We're not talking the 6 small meals a day like you've heard -- we mean three decent-sized meals and two snacks. When you eat 6 small meals a day your body is constantly producing insulin and never switching gears -- and you're never really fully satisfied. So put snacks into your diet. You'll actually end up eating less.Eat slow. Chew your food. Put down your fork between bites. Because if you eat too fast, your body gets all, ""Woah, wooahhh! I'm full! Did I forget to tell you?"" You gotta give it time to register what you're putting in.

Eat from a small plate. It's an optical illusion. Whatever is in front of you, your brain wants to eat. So fill up a smaller plate and you'll magically eat less.Don't multitask. If you're shoving food in your face in front of the fridge, your mind doesn't register it as mealtime. So sit down. Concentrate. Think about the texture and flavor. And then go about your super busy day.
Blue is an appetite suppressant. So use a blue (small) plate, have a blue tablecloth, and for good measure, wear a blue shirt. Ever wonder why restaurants are never blue?, Recent studies have shown that having a higher-calorie day every so often can actually help you lose more weight. Yeah. Crazy, huh? The reason being that when you're restricting your body, your metabolism slows down and your body clings to its nutrients for dear life. Having a higher-calorie day gives your body a metaphorical breath of fresh air, allowing it to relax and let go of some of your fat stores and let your metabolism run wild. So during this 10 day period, consider 1 or 2 days where you eat a little bit more.


A variant of calorie cycling is carbohydrate cycling. If you're eating mostly non-starchy veggies and protein (aka not a lot of carbs), it could do you well to have a day where you do consume carbs. Your body prefers to burn them over fats or protein, so including them in your diet does the same thing -- it vamps up your body's processes, actually spurring you to weight loss.

, Another thing to consider is your stress levels. Turns out higher stress levels equal higher levels of cortisol -- and that equals wanting to eat more. When you're under stress, there's emotional eating, there's less sleep, and in general less mindfulness. So relax! Your waistline needs it.


A good place to start? Meditation or yoga. Yoga also burns calories, so that's two birds with one stone. If nothing else, take 15 minutes a day to sit down and get some zen. Too many days pass by where you don't get any ""me"" time!

, More science! It seems that those who sleep more, weigh less. And it makes sense -- you feel good, you're body is running normally, and you have less time to eat! So get in your 8 or so hours. You'll feel all the better for it.


It has to do with your hormones leptin and ghrelin.Your levels get all sort of messed up and it leads to them telling your body you're hungry when you're really just tired. And to top it off, when you're sleepy, you load up on sugar, grab take out for dinner because you're tired, and skip the gym for the same reason. That's three strikes right there.

, Let's tell it like it is: if you spend the next 10 days drinking nothing but lemonade and Sriracha, you're going to lose a ton of weight. You'll just feel like crap a week from now and all the weight will come back when you reintroduce food to your body. It totally messes up your metabolism and if you're looking for a long-term solution, this isn't it. But if you're looking to fit into that dress? Well...maybe. Just be careful. And don't tell your mom we mentioned it.


wikiHow's How to Lose weight fast has a great section on fad diets. Whether you're looking to only drink maple syrup, eat cabbage, spend days in the sauna, or get your colon cleansed, it has everything you'd ever want to know (and probably a few things you don't).

, It will be the closest thing you get to a miracle. When you load up on the stuff, a number of beautiful, beautiful things happen. Here's a list that should convince you to start carrying a bottle around:


It fills you up. The more you drink it, the less you want to consume.
You're still consuming something. The more often you drink it, the less often you're consuming something else.
It flushes your body of toxins (aka keeps your poo regular)
It's great for your hair and skin
It keeps your muscles and organs hydrated and healthy

, In case the stoplight metaphor is helpful and all. If you want to lose weight and quick, the easiest way is to load up on green veggies. Yeah, all vegetables are ""good"" for you, but some are definitely better -- and those are the green ones. They're what they call ""nutrient dense"": for very few calories, they're awfully filling and full of vitamins and minerals.


Anything leafy is pretty fantastic. Kale, swiss chard, broccoli, spinach, cabbage, lettuce, etc. Brussels sprouts, too! You can eat handful after handful and still have plenty of calories left for your day.

, Not red, white. If it's white, it's probably a refined or processed carb. That means the fiber is basically gone and there's not a lot of nutrients packed in there.So white rice, white bread, and even starchy, white potatoes should be kept to a minimum, if eaten at all in this 10 day period.


Just for the record, your body needs carbs. They're found in vegetables and whole grains and those are some of the best things for you. But those are complex and unrefined; it's the processed, sugary ones you want to stay away from.

You know about Atkins (no carbs). For 10 days, it can be effective. This is kinda like the fad diet thing -- you can try it for 10 days and it'll probably work, but the second you stop, get ready to clean up the mess you've made. So go no-carb if you can stick it out, but know of the long-term possible consequences.



, Your diet needs to be at the very minimum 10% protein. If you want to lose weight, it's a good idea to have it be even more of this. It builds up your muscles and is super filling -- all of which leads to weight loss. So pile on the fish, white meat, soy products, and beans.


It's become so trendy that even a diet up to 30% is considered normal. Studies have shown that a high-protein diet, when combined with exercise, can reduce your blood fats. And protein is known to reduce insulin spikes, which calms cravings.Win, win, win.

, Because your body does need them! It's not a good idea to cut them out entirely -- just concentrate on the good ones -- those are the unsaturated kind. They're found in avocados, olive oils, nuts, fatty fish like salmon and trout, an low-fat dairy products. In fact, having these healthy fats in your diet (moderately, of course) can help lower cholesterol levels and reduce risks of heart disease.Humans needs at least 10% of their diet to come from fat. Around 25% is normal and good -- though only 7% or so should come from saturated fats. That's the kind found in red meat, high-fat dairy products, poultry skin and eggs.

Eggs are good sources of protein, though, so 1 a day is fine. Same goes for avocados, which are more rich in fat than protein.Just don't go overboard!



, Not only does sodium constrict your blood vessels, which makes your heart have to pump much harder, it manifests in clinging onto water, which bloats your waistline.So if you're not doing it for your heart's health, do it for your pants size!


One teaspoon of salt has 2,300 mg of sodium. We only need 200 mg each day. That's a little unfeasible, though, so 1500 mg is the recommended daily amount. No more than 2,300 however!, This one is less about science and more about psychology: humans have a tendency to eat the worst stuff (and/or the most) at night. So if you swear to yourself that you won't eat past 8 PM, those late night taco runs won't be happening. And when those late nights roll around and tu quieres tacos but you opt for that glass of water instead, that's poundage falling off. It's tough socially, but it's worth it.


This is probably the hardest thing to do. Your friends go out, there's alcohol, there's munchies, and you want nothing more than to take part. Consider two things here: you can go if you can take the temptation. But, also, it's only for 10 days. You could do anything for 10 days, right?

, The facts are this: cardio burns calories faster than weightlifting. However, combining both burns even more. There's nothing better for your body than working all your muscle groups in different ways. And cardio and weights do just that. So make time for both!


In this 10 days, you'll want to do cardio pretty much every day. Weights, on the other hand, should only be done every other. If you do want to do them more, make sure you're working different muscle groups; your body needs a day to repair itself after a workout.

, Going to the gym every day is great. It really is. Very few people can say that. But if you're going to maximize these 10 days and milk 'em for all they're worth, you need to take small opportunities to stay active. Heck, even fidgeters are more likely to be thinner!When we say ""small opportunities,"" we mean things like dancing while you're doing the dishes. Doing yoga while you watch TV. Planking during commercials. Cleaning your room instead of Facebooking. Scrubbing the floor. Washing the car by hand. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Parking at the far end of the parking lot....Is your mind churning with ideas yet?

, Cardio is good, but lately science is pointing the to fact that interval training is better. And it's quicker and more convenient to boot! Instead of jogging for 30 minutes, you do quick bursts of all-out runs for 30 seconds between periods of leisurely walking for 15 or 20. Why? It burns more calories and keeps your heart pumping; there's an afterburn effect, too!It can be done with anything -- not just on the treadmill. As long as you're cycling between periods of intense work and not-so-intense work, it qualifies.
Curious about this after-burn effect? It's called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption. When your body works out at rates it cannot sustain, it takes the next day to build its oxygen back up. That's more calories gone even when you're not working out.

, It's too easy to develop a routine...and then get bored with it. Either your muscles get bored or your mind gets bored or both. And when this happens, you actually burn fewer calories -- you're pushing yourself less hard. So switch it up! Either mess around with duration or intensity or do a completely new activity. Your body and mind will thank you for it.


Fill your days with exciting activities to get that spark ignited. Instead of going to the gym, take a kickboxing class. Go to the pool or go on a hike. Grab some friends and play basketball, tennis or volleyball. That way you're burning calories and barely even realizing it.
Hot yoga can be a fun twist on an old exercise favorite. It can even help flush salt out of your system, which may have you bloated. Just remember to replenish the lost fluids with water or green tea.

, Bodybuilders will probably tell you to do weights and then do cardio. Weight loss advocates may tell you do to cardio first. And some others will tell you to do cardio on an empty stomach in the morning. But what it boils down to is this: know when you're at your best. Whenever you can push yourself the most, whenever you feel like you're pumped up, work out. Whether that's in the middle of the night or after a taco is up to you. It's all good.


Experiment! You may hate running because you've only done it after work. Maybe before work actually goes better for you -- and it could energize your entire day. So in these 10 days mess around. You could find a habit you'd like to pick up for the rest of your life.

Just 20 minutes of moderate exercise each day can keep you healthy and strong.You don't even have to dedicate a single block of your day to exercise. Taking a 10-minute brisk walk in the morning and another in the evening would suffice.
Joining a gym or fitness center may help you stay motivated, as well as giving you access to other resources such as certified trainers and classes for variety.
You also might consider exercising with a friend. That way you can get some social time in as well as your daily exercise.;
, Strength training is important not only for losing weight but also developing a more fit and toned physique. As you start to build stronger muscles, you will feel a lot better about how your body looks and how your clothes fit.Many people are worried about strength training if they've been struggling with weight loss because they believe they will add bulk and get bigger. However, this typically isn't the case.
Muscles burn more calories even at rest than fat does, making strength training all the more important if you've decided to ditch the scales.
Try bringing along a set of wrist or ankle weights when you go on a walk. You can do a few sets of exercises during your walk. Just make sure that you do not wear the wrist or ankle weights during the entire walk because this will put too much strain on your joints. Carry them in a small backpack and remove them after you finish each set.
If you want to start lifting weights, consider starting with a certified trainer. Explain your goals and they can help you develop a workout routine that will maximize your results and help you slim down without adding any bulk.

, If there's a sport you enjoy playing, find out if there's a league or club in your community that you can join. Many towns and cities have community leagues through the local recreation department.If you're playing a sport you enjoy, you'll be getting exercise without it really feeling like work because you'll be having fun.
You also gain the opportunity to become more involved in your community and meet like-minded people who share your interests.
Volunteering to assist with youth sports also can give you some exercise while helping children stay active and develop their skills.

, Going to the gym isn't the only way to exercise. You can fit little things into your daily routine that will keep you active without disrupting your life too much.For example, instead of stalking out the closest possible parking spot when you go shopping, park at the end of the lot and enjoy the brief walk.
You also can fit a little exercise into your daily life by taking the stairs rather than the elevator whenever possible – especially if you're only going up or down two or three floors.
Keep dumbbells by your couch so you can do some quick curls or lifts while you're watching television. Keeping an exercise bike or treadmill in front of your television is also good for this, and enables you to get some exercise in while you're watching your favorite show. However, keep in mind that watching more than an hour of television per day contributes to a sedentary lifestyle, which can be harmful to your health.

, When you were focused on the scale, your exercise goals likely were weight-oriented. Now that you're no longer weighing yourself, you are free to create more meaningful goals than simply to ""lose five pounds in a week"" or something like that.Set your goals in terms of doing more and performing better, rather than focusing on weight loss.
For example, if you've just started running and you currently run one mile in 12 minutes, you might set a goal to drop a minute off that time each week until you reach your goal of a six-minute mile. When you reach that goal, you'll know that you've succeeded regardless of any number on any scale.

, What you eat is an important part of whether you gain or lose weight. Whole foods, including plenty of fruits and vegetables at every meal, provide the nutrition you need without a lot of the chemicals and additives that you don't.Try to buy as many fresh foods as possible when you go to the grocery store, including fresh vegetables and fruits. Keep in mind how long they'll keep, and plan your grocery trips accordingly.
You also want to include a source of lean protein, such as skinless chicken or turkey, fish, trimmed lean beef or pork, in every meal. Seeds and nuts, soy, legumes, lentils, chick peas, all beans, and yogurt also are good sources of protein whenever you want to switch it up.
Check the labels carefully on packaged foods you buy, such as cereals or snack bars. Organic products are good options, but regardless you want to make sure most, if not all, of the ingredients in the food you're buying are whole foods that you recognize.

, Frozen meals and junk food may be convenient, but if you're trying to lose weight they won't do you any favors. Even many frozen foods that are labeled as diet foods still include a lot of sugar and chemicals that promote weight gain.Don't get the idea that all processed foods are necessarily bad for you. For example, frozen vegetables are technically ""processed,"" but may be just as good as buying fresh vegetables.
Just look at the label and stay away from those that have a lot of chemicals or other things that aren't food listed as ingredients.
If you're accustomed to eating frozen meals for the sake of convenience, you may have to rearrange your life a little to make time to cook better meals. For example, you could set aside a couple of hours one day a week to create larger quantities of meals that you could freeze yourself and eat throughout the week.

, If you want to lose weight, you have to kick mindless snacking and emotional eating to the curb. Learn to listen to your body and understand what cravings mean, what hunger feels like, and when you're full.Switching your schedule so that you're having a small meal once every two or three hours instead of three bigger meals a day can help control your eating, especially if you have the habit of snacking.
Get rid of sugary and salty snacks and junk food, and keep plenty of healthy snacks such as almonds or carrot sticks around for when you get the munchies.
If you crave something, ask yourself why. If your craving has an emotional reason, focus on the source of that emotion rather than satisfying your craving.
For example, if you have the urge to eat because you're stressed out about a work assignment, you may be able to combat that stress more productively by calling or emailing a coworker, or mapping out a schedule to get the assignment done in time.

, Generally, you want to try to drink at least six glasses of water a day to keep your body adequately hydrated. If you're exercising and sweating a lot, you may need to drink more water to replace the fluids you're losing.Keep in mind that many times when you think you're hungry, you're actually dehydrated. Drinking water regularly will make you feel fuller and can keep the urge to snack at bay.
If you're not a fan of plain water, try flavored or carbonated water.
Gradually replace any soft drinks that you normally drink with water. You may notice a big difference right away in the way you look and feel.

, When you're trying to lose weight, sugar is your enemy. Read the ingredient labels carefully on all food that you buy, watching for added sugar that can thwart even the best-made diet plans.Look at the foods you normally eat, especially packaged foods, condiments, and frozen meals. Many of them contain corn syrup or high-fructose corn syrup, a type of added sugar that can ruin your weight loss goals.
Remove soft drinks, candy, and sugary snacks from your house so you won't be tempted.
If you have a sweet tooth, try replacing the sweets you normally eat with fruit and fruit juices that don't have added sugar. You'll still get the sweet taste, but without all the added sugar, calories, and fat.

, Visit your doctor regularly to get your blood pressure checked. If it's high, your doctor can tell you what a good target blood pressure would be for you and recommend changes in your diet and lifestyle that will help bring your blood pressure down.Having good blood pressure is a better indication of your overall health than the readout on the scale, and many people who are technically overweight still manage to maintain a blood pressure safely in the healthy range.
If your blood pressure is high, try to get an extra 10 or 15 minutes of exercise a day (in addition to the 20 to 30 minutes you're already doing). Don't smoke and limit your alcohol intake.
Once you've visited your doctor, keep checking your blood pressure at home, especially if you were diagnosed with high blood pressure. This way you can personally track how any changes you make are affecting your blood pressure.

, If you're over the age of 20, you should visit your doctor for a cholesterol screening at least once every five years. Your cholesterol levels naturally will rise as you get older, but getting screened regularly can help you keep yourself out of the danger zone.Generally, you want to keep your LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol below 130. Any number above that means you are at an increased risk for heart or blood vessel diseases.
In contrast, you want your HDL or ""good"" cholesterol to be higher. This type of cholesterol actually protects you against heart disease. Ideally, it should be 60 or more.
There are some factors that affect your cholesterol levels, such as age and heredity, that you cannot control. However, with a healthy diet and an active lifestyle you typically can keep your cholesterol levels in the optimal zone.

, How you live and what you get out of life are more important than how much you weigh. Focus on the things that really matter to you, and make time in each day to do something you enjoy.One way to enhance the quality of your life is to find a cause that you're passionate about and do some volunteer work. Search in your area for nonprofit organizations that support or advocate a cause you like. Call them up and offer your time.
For example, if you love animals, you might consider volunteering to walk the dogs at a local animal shelter.
Invest in your hobbies if you enjoy them, regardless of whether others scoff at them. If you enjoy playing guitar, set aside time each day to play your favorite song or learn something new.

, If you feel strong and healthy and you like the way you look in your clothes, you'll worry a lot less about the particular number that shows up when you weigh yourself.When you aren't weighing yourself, you no longer have the comfort of knowing you've lost weight because the number has gone down. You also don't have the stress of feeling like you've failed because the number happens to go up.
What's more important isn't the number on the scale, though. It's whether you can look in the mirror and be comfortable and confident with the way you look and how your clothes fit.
Beyond that, feeling healthy and having energy throughout the day to do the things you need and want to do should be your ultimate goal – not being able to fit into a particular size of clothing.

, As with your exercise goals, you'll get a lot further towards losing weight if you try to do more things rather than worrying about whether you're thin enough or whether you look attractive.As you continue to make healthy eating choices and maintain an active lifestyle, you'll get excited to keep pushing yourself to make progress and improve your performance.
Keep in mind that bodies are made to be active and do things, not to look a certain way. If you focus on your body's ability to function and use it for that purpose, you'll ultimately be a lot healthier – and maybe even a lot happier too.

, If you can’t seem to lose weight despite your best efforts, then it might be a good idea for you to talk with your doctor. Your doctor may be able help you by:

Checking for underlying health conditions that may be interfering with weight loss.
Referring you to a dietician for help crafting a meal plan that works for you.
Referring you to a therapist for help with emotional eating.

Decrease or totally eliminate sugar from your diet.,
Control the consumption of nuts.,
Keep an eye on your fruit intake.,
Get a good night's sleep.,
Exercise.,
Get a few hours of exercise per week (mainly resistance or weight training).,
Make sure to avoid skipping meals.",How to Lose Weight on the Paleo Diet," Although the thought of no sugar may seem like torture, the consumption of sugar can have harmful effects on your body.Sugar (and high fructose corn syrup) do not contain any vitamins or minerals and have no nutritional value.When you consume high amounts of sugar, it is converted into fructose, which is later converted into fat. When you eliminate sugar from your diet, you automatically decrease the amount of fat stored., Even though nuts are allowed on the Paleo diet, you must keep track of how many ounces of nuts you consume if you want to lose weight. Nuts are small and tasty, which makes it is very easy to misjudge what a portion size really looks like. You may also be eating more nuts than you realize if you eat Paleo desserts and breads.


Keep in mind that despite being healthy, nuts are very high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which can disrupt normal hormone production, impair thyroid function, impair the immune system, and contribute to weight gain if consumed in excess. Make sure you limit your intake to about a handful per day., Although fruit is high in the fiber as well as vitamins and minerals that your body needs to function, it is easy to consume too many fruits due to their sweet taste. Despite their colorful and tasty allure, fruits contain sugar in the form of carbohydrates. Moreover, if you frequently find yourself drinking your fruits instead of eating them, that could also be hindering your weight loss efforts because fruit juices contain lots of excess sugar.

, Many people do not realize how important getting a good night’s sleep is for losing weight. Individuals who get less than seven hours of sleep per night on a regular basis tend to compensate for their tiredness by reaching for sugar-filled (i.e. quick energy) foods. By the end of the day, the individual has gone through several sugar crashes and is too tired to exercise. The end result is sugar stored as fat and an increased waistline. On the other hand, when you get enough sleep, you awake feeling refreshed and are more likely to make good food choices, which leads to more energy.;
, Even though 90% of weight loss has to do with what you eat, it is still important not to ignore the other 10%.Working up the desire to exercise can be tough for many individuals, while coming up with reasons to avoid working out is not.

, The more you exercise, the more calorie burning muscle you will build. Eventually, the muscle will replace the fat on your body and you will start to see the trim and toned body you have been working so hard for!

, In fact, not eating enough food can stall your weight loss progress because your body’s metabolism slows down to compensate for the calorie deficit.Eating three regular meals and two snacks per day will keep your metabolism burning steadily.Even though you may feel as if you are eating all of the time, you are preparing your body to keep its metabolism running on high!"
"
Start slowly.,
Garden at least 3 to 5 times a week for 30 minutes to an hour.,
Vary gardening activities.",How to Lose Weight Gardening1," If you are not currently physically active, begin a gardening routine slowly. Most gardening tasks require the use of several muscle groups. If you start off slowly, you may avoid muscle strain and soreness.


Begin by planting and watering plants. Add some light weeding. As you become stronger, add more strenuous tasks like digging, mowing the lawn or pushing a wheelbarrow.;
, To lose weight and maximize health benefits, a regular gardening routine is important. If you do not have 30 minutes to 1 hour available at one time, break up the gardening tasks into smaller periods of time. For example, weed for 20 minutes in the morning and mow the lawn for 20 minutes in the afternoon.


Plan a gardening activity each day. To lose weight gardening, you must work in the garden at least 3 to 5 times each week. Plan activities for each gardening session to make the best use of that time. For example, weed a garden bed for 30 minutes one day and turn compost for 30 minutes the next.
Continue the gardening activities in the winter. If you live in an area with a cold winter climate, the garden may not need daily tending. However, continue the exercise routine. Shovel snow, split wood or rake leaves to continue the gardening weight loss.

, Rather than working on a strenuous gardening activity for 1 hour, break up garden tasks into more moderate activities. For example, break up a session of strenuous digging with flower deadheading. Rotate through a variety of gardening exercises each week. Consider a few of the following activities to vary your gardening routine.


Mow the lawn with a push mower. A push mower, rather than a riding mower, provides great cardiovascular exercise. During the summer months, mow the lawn once or twice a week. If your yard is too large to use a push mower in a single session, divide the lawn into small areas and mow each area over the course of a week.
Dig holes. Digging holes for fence posts, flower transplants or new trees builds muscles in the stomach, legs, shoulders, arms, neck and back. Instead of using gas- or electric-powered post hole diggers, get out a shovel and dig a hole yourself.
Start a compost pile. Compost is a valuable fertilizer for the garden, but also presents an opportunity for gardening exercise. Turning or rotating compost with a pitchfork burns about 250 to 300 calories every 30 minutes.
Weed to lose weight. Weeding helps tone your legs, arms, shoulders and back. The more resistant your weeds, the better workout you will be. When weeding, switch arm and leg positions to ensure even muscle use throughout your body. Instead of spraying weeds with chemicals, pull them out yourself to expend extra calories and tone your muscles.

Reduce calories and portion sizes.,
Aim to eat a balanced diet.,
Limit snacking.,
Avoid high-calorie processed foods.,
Drink adequate fluids daily.,
Do 150 minutes of cardio each week.,
Include one to three days of strength training.,
Increase lifestyle activity.,
Include one to two rest days a week.,
Journal.,
Track your weight and measurements.,
Make changes.",How to Lose Weight in 4 Months," In the course of four months, you can lose a considerable amount of weight just by watching your calorie intake and portion sizes.


If you cut out about 500 calories daily from your diet and incorporate exercise, you'll lose about 1 to 2 pounds per week. That means, in about four months, you can lose around 16 to 30 pounds.
Another way to decrease calories is by monitoring your portion sizes. Larger portion sizes may tempt you to eat more food in one sitting and, therefore, more calories than your body needs.
Measure out a 1 to 2 cup (8 to 16 oz) total portion size per meal. This should leave you feeling satisfied-not overly full.;
, Regardless of how much weight you want to lose or how many calories you're cutting from your diet, it's always important to follow a well-balanced diet.


A well-balanced diet is one in which you eat foods from each and every food group most days. In addition, you follow the appropriate portion sizes and choose a wide variety of foods from each food group.Include a 3 to 4 oz (about 85 g) serving of lean protein at each meal.Choose items like: poultry, eggs, tofu, legumes, seafood or low-fat dairy. These foods will help support and fuel your weight loss and help control your hunger.
Make half your plate or meal a fruit or a vegetable. Incorporate a 1 cup (8 oz) serving of vegetables, 2 cups of salad greens or one small piece of fruit during your meals or snacks.Both fruits and vegetables can bulk up your meals while adding very few overall calories.
Serve yourself 1/2 cup or 1 oz portion of 100% whole grains.Including a serving or two of these during the day helps add beneficial fiber to your diet.

, Having an occasional snack won't ruin or stall weight loss. In fact, a well-timed and well-planned snack can actually aid weight loss. Snacks can give you a boost of energy, extra hit of nutrition or the fuel for a tough workout.. You need to be smart about the type of snacks you choose, and when to eat a snack.


If you're choosing to have a snack while losing weight, aim for a 150 calorie snack. This will help you stick to a lower calorie level overall and still allow you to lose a decent amount of weight within four months.Also, make sure that you include some protein and a fruit or vegetable for your snacks. The protein and fiber combination can help give you some energy and keep you satisfied longer.
Only snack if you truly need to or are physically hungry or if there is more than four hours between your meals. Avoid snacking out of boredom or stress.
Smart snack options include: a small Greek yogurt, a piece of fruit and low-fat cheese stick, 1/4 cup of trail mix, one hard boiled egg or 1 oz of nuts and 1/2 cup of grapes.

, When you're trying to lose weight in four months, there are certain foods you should limit or try to avoid. Processed foods can stall weight loss when eaten regularly or in large quantities.


Many processed foods are high in calories, added sugars, harmful fats and other preservatives and additives.Limiting these foods from your diet will help you stick to a lower calorie and more nutritious diet plan.
Avoid the processed foods that won't help weight loss like: sweetened beverages (regular soda, alcohol, mixed coffee drinks and fruit juices), breakfast pastries, candy, cookies, cakes and pies, frozen meals, ice cream, processed meats, fried foods, fast foods, chips and crackers and canned meals.

, Water can play an important role in your weight loss plan. Drinking enough will be important to your health and diet.


Most health professionals recommend you drink at least eight 8-oz glasses (about 2 liters) daily; however, if you're more active, you may need up to 13 glasses (3 liters) daily.You know you're well-hydrated when you're not typically thirsty throughout the day and your urine is the color of lemonade or very pale yellow by the end of the day.
Water is great for weight loss because it can quell your appetite throughout the day.In addition, drinking a large glass of water before a meal can make it easier for you to stick to a smaller portion since you're feeling full on the water.

, In addition to diet, another important part of your weight loss plan will be physical activity — especially cardio. Even within a four month time period, this type of exercise can heavily influence your weight loss.


Including regular amounts of cardio throughout the week will help support your weight loss.These activities raise your heart rate and can burn a significant amount of calories.
At a minimum, include 150 minutes or 2 1/2 hours of cardio or aerobic activities each week. This will give you the weight loss benefit as well as many health benefits.
Include moderate cardio activities like: jogging/walking, dancing, cycling, taking an aerobics class or doing water aerobics.

, In addition to cardio, it's also beneficial to add in regular strength training to your exercise routine. This type of activity can also support weight loss.Participating in 20 minutes of strength training one to three times each week can help build lean muscle mass, prevent osteoporosis and increase your metabolism.If you have increased lean muscle mass, your body is able to burn more calories at rest. Within four months, you can make a significant difference in your body's lean muscle mass and metabolism.

, Increased cardio and strength training can offer many benefits to weight loss, but it's not the only way — increasing your lifestyle activity has been shown to be equally beneficial.Again, in a four month time period this extra activity can really affect your overall weight loss.


Lifestyle activities are exercises that you already do as part of your typical day. For example, taking the stairs, walking to and from your car, walking to go get the mail or doing household chores.
Many studies have shown that these activities are equally as beneficial to weight loss and overall health as planned or structured cardiovascular exercise.
Try to think of ways you can increase your overall exercise. For example, can you park farther away from your office? Can you schedule in a 10 minute walk break or yoga session on your lunch hour? Can you take more stairs? These activities will get you moving more and help burn more calories throughout the day.

, In the course of four months, you may make significant progress on your weight loss as well as on your physical fitness level. At the same time, you need to be careful and aim to prevent injuries as you ramp up your activity levels.


It's important to take good care of your body and let it rest and recovery during ""off days"" planned during the week.Many strength and muscle mass gains actually occur during rest.In addition, your body needs to rest and recover so that it continue performing at your current fitness level.
Also, if you never plan a rest day, you actually might see a plateau or stall in your weight loss progress., Journaling is a great addition to any weight loss plan. This will be especially true while you're losing weight over a longer time period like four months.


You can write about your goals in your journal and your progress as well.
In addition, it might be smart to track your foods and keep a food diary. It can help keep you accountable and help give you an idea of what's working or not working in your diet plan., During the four month weight loss period, consider tracking your weight and other measurements.


Tracking your progress through weight and different measurements can help you decide how well your diet is or isn't working.
Weigh yourself about one to two times a week. Also, Weigh yourself at the same time of day, in the same clothes (or without clothes), on the same day of the week. This helps you see a more accurate weight loss trend.
In addition to weight, you can track different measurements. Measure your waist, hips, thighs or arms. Only track these measurements once a month so you'll be able to see any changes.

, After your four month weight loss plan is up, consider reevaluating your progress, goals and any changes you want to make.


After four months, you might be satisfied with your weight loss. If so, keep up with the healthy lifestyle behaviors you've adopted. Completely reverting back to previous habits may cause you to regain the weight you've lost.
If you're enjoying the weight loss and think you'd like to lose more, continue with your current diet and exercise plan.
If you've struggled with weight loss and still want to lose more weight, reevaluate your plan. Did you not exercise enough? Did you snack more often than you should? Review food journals or exercise logs to see where you can make changes. Make the necessary adjustments and keep on going!

They may also be able to provide you with additional guidance or recommend alternatives that might be more appropriate for your health.
A registered dietitian is a nutrition expert that may give you a more effective diet for weight loss. They can create a meal plan for you that will help induce weight loss in addition to guiding you towards healthy foods to help you lose weight.
Visit the EatRight website and click on the orange ""Find an Expert"" button on the top right to search for a dietitian in your area.;
, In order to lose weight, you'll most likely need to cut out extra calories from your diet. Safe weight loss, or losing 1-2 pounds per week, requires you to cut out or burn off about 500-1000 calories daily.


It is not recommended to cut out more than 500-1000 calories from your diet daily. You run the risk of being unable to meet your nutrient goals.
Although weight loss and healthy eating go beyond calories, it's important to be calorie aware - knowing whether or not you're eating enough calories for your body and lifestyle.
You can combine cutting calories with exercise to maximize how large your calorie deficit is daily.

, Studies show that consuming adequate protein helps support weight loss in addition to keeping you feeling satisfied.Include lean proteins such as: poultry, beef, pork, eggs, dairy products, legumes and tofu.
In general, it’s recommended for women to consume 46 g of protein daily and men to consume 56 g daily.This recommendation is easily met if you consume about 3-4 oz of protein at each meal. That's about the size of a deck of cards or the palm of your hand or about 1/2 cup of items like beans or lentils., Fruits and vegetables are high in nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals and are also low in calories. Making half of your plate a fruit or vegetable helps cut down on your overall caloric intake.Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables each day. Choosing a different colored fruit or vegetable is an easy way to eat different vitamins and antioxidants.
In general, aim for about 1-2 servings of fruit a day (about 1 small fruit or 1/2 cup of sliced fruit per serving) and at least 3-4 servings of vegetables (1 cup or 2 cups leafy vegetables per serving).Keep in mind that you can eat extra vegetables without throwing off your diet. In fact, eating more vegetables may help you to feel full and make it easier stick with your diet.

, Whole grains are an excellent source of fiber and a few vitamins and minerals.If choosing to eat grains, aim to choose whole grains when possible.


Whole grains are an unprocessed grain. They contain the hull, germ and endosperm parts of the grain.Whole grains include: brown rice, 100% whole wheat pasta, oats, quinoa and 100% whole grain breads. Popcorn is also considered a whole grain.

, Having the occasional healthy snack is appropriate when you're trying to lose weight. In addition, a snack may even help support your weight loss efforts.If you really want to snack, think about whether it's necessary. A low-calorie snack can be a good option when there's more than 6-7 hours between meals, before or after a workout or you're feeling very hungry and there's more than 2 hours until your next meal.Try to keep your snacks between 100-200 calories. This will help get you to your next meal without blowing your daily calorie budget. Including fruits, vegetables and lean protein help keep snacks calorie-controlled while still being nutritious.Healthy snacks can include: cottage cheese and fruit, 2 hard boiled eggs, 1/3 cup of trail mix, or air-popped popcorn without butter.

, Staying hydrated can also aid in weight loss. Aim to drink about 64 oz or 8 glasses of clear, sugar-free liquids daily. Although this is a general rule of thumb, it's a good place to start.Even mild, chronic dehydration can slow weight loss. When you're dehydrated or feeling thirsty, many times this feels like hunger. This could be triggering you to eat, when you just need a few sips of water.Keep track of how much water or other fluids you consume daily by keeping a labeled water bottle near by.
You can decrease or manage portion sizes by drinking a large glass of water right before your meal. This may help make you feel satiated a bit sooner.
Avoid sweetened beverages. Avoiding soda, fruit juice, punch, sports drinks, energy drinks, kool-aide, sweet tea, lemonade, sweetened coffees, etc. can make a huge impact on your daily calorie intake. You may even lose weight just by eliminating these drinks.

, Going out for a bite to eat is something that's fun, social and can be included even on a weight loss plan. Be careful about the items you choose and try to pick a meal that will fit into your overall eating pattern.


Restaurant foods can be higher in calories, fat and sodium compared to homemade foods. Many times, this is due to sauces, dressings, marinades or added oils or butter. Ask to have these things served on the side.
Pass on the starch. Eating only protein and a vegetable may help keep your overall calorie levels low.
Choose an appetizer portion or a kids portion to help minimize larger portion sizes that are served at restaurants.
Limit or skip the alcohol and desserts. These can be significant sources of extra calories when you go out to eat. For example, a frozen margarita can have 675 calories and a slice of molten lava cake may be over 1,100 calories!

, It's recommended to do about 150 minutes or 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity physical activity each week. Studies have shown that regular physical activity can help support weight loss and long-term weight maintenance.Aerobic activities can include exercises like: walking, jogging, swimming, biking or hiking.
Exercise is a great support to weight loss, but it is only part of the weight loss picture. Exercise alone will not always cause weight loss. The best combination is to do aerobic exercise along with a calorie-controlled diet for the best results., Weight lifting or resistance training is another important part of your exercise routine. Try to include about 1-2 days of strength training each week for the best weight loss benefit.Strength training includes activities like: weight lifting, Pilates or isometric exercises like push-ups or crunches.
Avoid doing strength training every day. It's important to allow your muscles to rest and recover after each strength training session., Making a consult with a personal trainer is a great idea to help you get started with an exercise routine. These fitness professionals will be able to show you how to use a variety of gym equipment, design a workout plan for you and may help you stay motivated.


Check with some local gyms to see if they are offering any discounts or specials on personal training sessions. Many times they'll offer a free session if you sign up for the gym membership.
Although multiple personal training sessions can be expensive, you may only need a few so you can learn the ropes of the gym and an appropriate workout for you.

, Tracking your meals, snacks and beverages in a food journal can help you become more aware of what you eat and also help you stay on track with a new diet plan.Purchase a journal or download a journaling app on your smart phone. Track as many days as you can. Ideally, track a few weekdays and a few weekend days. Many people eat different on weekends compared to a more structured work day., Check in with your weight daily to see how you are coming along with your weight loss. Regular daily weight check-ins may also help keep you motivated and improve your weight loss results. Step on the sale every morning as part of your daily routine, such as right before you brush your teeth in the morning., Writing down goals can be helpful with any type of change, but is especially helpful with weight loss. Jot down a few ideas of the goals you want to achieve throughout your 3 month timeline.


Be specific with your goal. Make sure it's timely, specific and realistic. Remember, large amounts of weight loss are not realistic and are most likely not safe or healthy.
Set smaller goals before your long-term goals. Maybe make a goal for each month or every two weeks during your 3 month timeline.

Your doctor can help you to determine how much (if any) weight you need to lose.Your doctor can also help you make a healthy weight loss plan and track your progress.


Your doctor may also refer you to a dietitian, who can design a healthy eating plan for you.;
, When you're deciding on a meal, stick to leaner meats. For instance, steak, hamburgers, and other red meats are often high in fat (though not always). Better choices are chicken, fish, and beans.If you're a girl from age 9 to 18 or a boy age 9 to 13, you should eat 5 ounce equivalents each day. Boys 14 to 18 should eat 6.5 ounce equivalents.These portions may be smaller than you're used to eating. For instance, one ounce is equal to 1/3 or 1/4 of a can of tuna (depending on the size), 1 egg, or 1/3 to 1/4 of a hamburger patty (depending on the size). For beans, 1/4 of a cup is considered an ounce. So, for instance, if you ate a hamburger patty, that could be most of your protein for the day at 3 to 4 ounces., If you're hungry often, try reaching for fruits and vegetables instead of prepackaged snacks. Snack on celery sticks with natural peanut butter, carrot sticks, or an apple instead of cookies, chips, or cake.Other healthy options include tomato slices with cottage cheese or bell pepper strips with hummus.
If you're in the 9 to 18 age group, you should be getting 1 1/2 to 2 cups of fruit a day.Boys 9 to 13 should get 2 1/2 cups of veggies, and those 14 to 18 should get 3 cups. Girls from 9 to 13 should get 2 cups a day, while those 14 to 18 should get 2 1/2 cups., Whole grains are foods like whole wheat pasta, whole wheat bread, whole cornmeal, brown rice, and oatmeal. On the other hand, refined grains are foods like white rice, white bread, and regular pasta. Whole grains are better for you because they are less refined and have more fiber. That means they'll keep you fuller for longer.Girls 9 to 13 should be eating 5 ounce equivalents of grains each day, while girls 14 to 18 should be eating 6. Boys 9 to 13 should eat 6, while 14- to 18-year-olds should eat 8. At least half of those grains should be whole grains.An ounce of grains is considered one slice of bread, 1/2 a cup of cooked rice, 1/2 cup of cooked pasta, or a cup of cereal., Dairy is a good source of calcium and protein. It can also add flavor to your food. However, when picking dairy products, stick to low-fat or no-fat products, such as skim milk, low-fat cheese, and fat-free yogurt.If you're in the 9-18 age range, you should be getting 3 cups of dairy a day. One cup can mean a cup of milk or yogurt (8 ounces), but it can also mean an ounce or two of hard or processed cheese., Sugary drinks can add many calories to your day. Try to avoid drinks such as sports drinks, sodas, and juices. Instead, stick with water or even unsweetened herbal tea.If you don't like plain water, try adding a slice of orange or just a splash of juice to help give it flavor.

, It's tempting to eat until your plate is empty. However, if you pay attention to when you get full, you'll end up eating much less overall., While eating a cookie every once in a while is fine, try to skip eating high-calorie foods every day. These foods include things like cookies, cakes, candies, and burgers. Make these a treat, not something you eat each day., You should be moving at least an hour a day. One way to get started is to give up screen time. Put down your phone. Step away from the computer. Get outside with friends and get active.However, if you're not used to exercising, you can start smaller. Start with what you can do, and work up to more.

, You don't need to be on your school's hugely competitive basketball team to play a sport. You can join an after school club that plays soccer, or join a league through your city's local parks and recreation department. Ask your parents to help you find a sport you enjoy. Playing a sport will get you moving on a regular basis, and you can have fun doing it., Maybe you haven't liked exercising in the past because of what you've been doing. So maybe tennis isn't really your thing. You have plenty of other options. Try dancing, swimming, or jump roping, for instance. Even something like archery or horseback riding gets you out and moving., Even small actions can lead up to more activity throughout the day. For instance, when you take a break from studying, maybe you usually just listen to music for a bit or play a short game. Instead, get up and have a short dance party. Run downstairs or around the living room. Do some jumping jacks. Just adding these little bursts of activity can help., Most people could stand to be a little healthier. See if your family wants to get in on the action. Talk to your parents about making healthier changes for the whole family.For instance, you could say to your parents, ""I don't feel like I'm at a healthy weight, and I'd like to make some changes. What do you think about getting the whole family involved? I think we could all be a little healthier.""

, If possible, it's best to keep junk food out of your house completely. However, if other people in your house still eat it, then you obviously can't do that. You can ask them to hide it away from you, though. Maybe the rest of the family could have a special cabinet for junk food that you don't go into, or maybe they could keep special snacks in their rooms, when possible. If you can't see it, you'll be less likely to eat it., You're going to not do what you're supposed to sometimes. It's just human nature. The key is to do it in moderation. Try to do the right thing about 90 percent of the time, and you'll be fine. Beating yourself up isn't going to help the situation., It's best if you can sit down to a meal with your family, as you can all enjoy a healthy meal together. However, even just sitting down for a meal instead of eating standing up or in front of the television can help you pay attention to what you're eating and learn not to mindlessly plow through your food.If your parents aren't much into cooking, maybe you can learn a few simple, healthy meals to cook for your family once and a while. For instance, baking fish in the oven is fairly simple, and perhaps you can learn how to boil vegetables. If you're interested, ask your parents if you can take a basic cooking class.

, Breakfast gives you enough energy to start your day. Plus, when you eat breakfast, you won't be as hungry later. That means you won't be as tempted to snack throughout the day.Include a little bit of protein, whole grains, and a fruit or veggie if you can. For instance, try a bowl of oatmeal with some low-fat yogurt and blueberries. You could also have whole-grain toast with boiled eggs and a side of strawberries., This step is easy, though it can be hard if you're busy or a night owl. Basically, getting enough sleep can help you be healthier and lose weight.If you're in school, you need to get 9 to 11 hours every night., Let's face it, life as a kid can be tough sometimes. You've got school and friends and family to deal with. But stress can also make you gain or keep on weight. You're not going to make stress go away completely, but you can learn ways to cope with it.One way you can deal with stress is to write about it. Keep a journal, and at the end of the day, write about what's bothering you that day. Just writing it can help take a load off your mind.You can also try meditation or deep breathing. It's not as crazy as it sounds.Deep breathing is literally just taking a moment to focus on your breathing. Close your eyes. Focus only on your breathing. Breathe in slowly through your nose, counting to four in your head. Hold your breath for four counts, then breathe out slowly. Try to block out any other sensations or thoughts. Continue breathing this way for a couple of minutes until you feel yourself calming down.

, You now know what habits in your life you need to work on. One way to start changing is to set goals to help you achieve that. For instance, maybe you want to eat healthier or move more., A goal like ""eat healthier"" is much too big. You probably have a vague idea of what to do, but it's not actually something you can put into action right now. Instead, try goals that are actions instead.For instance, instead of ""eat healthier,"" you could try goals such as ""trade one sweet snack for a fruit every day,"" ""eat three helpings of vegetables each day,"" or ""cut out three sodas per week.""

, Telling yourself what will be good can help you stick to your goals. For instance, if your goal is to ""cut out three sodas per week,"" you could write, ""I won't have as many sugar crashes. I'll be eating less sugar. I'll be consuming less calories. It can help me lose weight."", Put your goals up where you can see them. Say them out loud each morning. Making sure you see what your goals are can help you stick to them., You won't change all your habits overnight. Even changing one habit can take a while. Just keep working at it, and eventually, you'll have new, healthier habits. Once you've changed one or two habits, you can work on other ones."

Keep track of the calories you burn.,
Build muscles while gardening.,
Use proper form to build muscles and avoid pain.,
Maximize results.,
Increase flexibility.,
Increase your metabolism.",How to Lose Weight Gardening2," In order to lose weight gardening, you must burn more calories than you consume. The following list is what an average male weighing 180 pounds (81.6 kg) will burn in 30 minutes of constant gardening activity.


Water the lawn or garden with a hose to burn 61 calories.
Rake leaves to burn 162 calories.
Bag leaves to burn 162 calories.
Plant seeds or seedlings to burn 162 calories.
Weed a garden to burn 182 calories.
Plant trees to burn 182 calories.
Clear land to burn 202 calories.
Dig, till or spade a garden to burn 202 calories.
Lay sod to burn 202 calories.
Chop wood to burn 243 calories.
Mow the lawn with a push mower to burn 243 calories.
Shovel snow to burn 243 to 364 calories, depending on how heavy the snow is.

, Most gardening tasks provide resistance training, which is comparable to weightlifting at a gym. Consider the following muscle-building activities.


Mulch gardening beds. Lifting bags of mulch, shoveling mulch and pushing a wheelbarrow are strenuous gardening activities that build muscles in your arms, legs, back and shoulders.
Turn a compost pile. Using a pitchfork or hoe to turn a compost pile builds your shoulders, chest, back, upper arms, thighs and legs.
Transport garden supplies. Moving heavy supplies, such as bags of soil or fertilizer and garden pots, can build muscles in your arms, legs, shoulders and back. Moving garden supplies from the garden center to your car, into your yard and around your garden also provides a cardiovascular workout that increases your heart rate, which is an effective way to lose weight.

, Pay attention to proper posture and body positioning in order to build muscle tone safely.


Avoid jerking motions. Keep all body motions steady and smooth.
Keep abdominals firm. This will help you maintain proper back alignment, and will also build strong abdominal muscles.
Use your legs, not your back, when lifting heavy objects. Bend your knees and put weight on your legs, rather than your back.
Utilize proper form when diggings. Do not twist your back when digging with a shovel. Rather, point your front foot in the direction you are digging and turn your body toward the foot. Bend your knees while shoveling. Alternate the leading foot while digging for extended periods of time. Avoid holding your breath. Exhale as you lift a heavy load with the shovel and inhale as you lower it. By concentrating on your breathing, you will maximize your efficiency.
Use a cushion when weeding on your knees. This will protect your knees. Keep your back straight and avoid sitting on your heels while kneeling. Stand up and stretch your arms, legs and back every 10 minutes.

, Gardening is a good workout, but to maximize results, exaggerate movements. Exaggerated movements increase the body's range of motion. For example, rather than simply raking, bend your knees to increase muscle use in your legs. As you continue raking, challenge yourself by bending your legs lower and lower until your muscles begin to tire.

, Gardening requires a lot of stretching, such as bending to plant flowers, extending a rake to gather leaves or reaching to trim tall branches. When stretching, focus on increased flexibility. If you can't bend from the waist and touch the ground when you begin gardening, keep working at it. Over time, you will increase your range of motion.

, Gardening activities like planting, digging and weeding incorporate movements that benefit your muscle strength, flexibility and cardiovascular system. Not only do you burn calories while accomplishing garden tasks, but you also build muscle. The muscle development helps increase your metabolic rate, even when your body is at rest.

Limit your daily intake of carbohydrates.,
Avoid simple carbohydrates.,
Consume moderate amounts of grains.,
Increase your daily intake of fiber.,
Eat healthy fats.,
Eat well-balanced meals.,
Follow a Mediterranean-style diet.",How to Lose Weight by Controlling Insulin1," Your pancreas produces the most insulin when you consume a carbohydrate-rich meal. This is bad, especially when you're aiming to lose abdominal fat. Controlling the amount and type of carbohydrates you eat throughout the day can help you manage your insulin levels.Carbohydrates are found in the following foods: grains, starchy vegetables, legumes, fruits and dairy products. They are also found in sweets and sweetened beverages.
Carbohydrates are found in a wide variety of food groups. Because they are so widespread, it's not realistic or healthy to completely avoid carbohydrates.
There is no right or wrong diet style when it comes to limiting your carbohydrates. You may choose to follow a diabetic diet, a low-carb diet or come up with your own specific diet plan to help manage your carbohydrate intake and insulin levels.;
, Some foods cause a quick spike or rise in blood sugar and insulin levels. Simple carbohydrates are known to be low in fiber and include: sweetened beverages, sweets or desserts, refined grain products (like white rice) and foods made from white flour (like white bread).


Instead of drinking sugary, sweet beverages, stick to no or low calories beverages. Try: water, flavored water, decaf coffee or tea.
It's most likely unrealistic to completely give up sweets and desserts. Limit them in your diet and stick to smaller portions.
Also limit refined grain products. These are not only low in fiber, but also low in a variety of other healthy nutrients. Try to choose 100% whole grain as often as possible.

, Foods like bread, rice or pasta are significantly higher in carbohydrates compared to other food groups. Although these foods are considered a healthy part of a balanced diet, they will raise your blood sugar and insulin levels quicker and higher than other food groups.


Limit your consumption of grain-based foods. You do not have to completely avoid them, but it may be ideal to limit yourself to only one to two servings daily.
One serving of grains is about 1 ounce or 1/2 cup.When you're choosing to eat grains, try to choose 100% whole grains. These are higher in fiber and other nutrients that can support a healthy diet.Whole grain foods include: quinoa, barley, brown rice or 100% whole wheat bread.

, Fiber is typically found in more complex carbohydrates. These are carbohydrates that digest slowly and release blood sugar or glucose into your bloodstream more slowly. This helps prevent a spike in insulin.Foods that are high in fiber include: beans, lentils, fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
In general, women need about 25 g of fiber daily and men need about 38 g of fiber daily. Aiming to meet these minimums can help you manage your insulin levels more efficiently.Try to include a fiber-rich food at each meal and snack. This will help you manage insulin levels throughout the entire day.

, Healthy fats, like omega-3 fats, not only support a healthy heart, but also slow the digestion of food like carbohydrates. Including healthy fats throughout your day can help slow the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates and manage insulin levels.Healthy fats are found in a variety of foods including: olive oil, fatty fish, avocados, nuts and seeds.
Other sources of omega-3 include vegetable oils such as soybean, canola, and flaxseed. Include these with your salads and cooking preparations.
Include one to two servings of healthy fats daily. One teaspoon of oils, 3-4 ounces of fish, 1/4 cup of nuts or seeds and 1/2 cup of avocado counts as a serving., While you may need to limit or avoid certain foods, you need to make sure you're still getting all the nutrients necessary to a healthy body. Eating a well-balanced diet will support weight loss and insulin control.Examples of well-balanced meals to help manage insulin levels include: scrambled eggs with vegetables and cheese, a mixed green salad with grilled salmon and a chicken and vegetable stir fry with 1/3 cup quinoa.
Some nutritionists recommend that half of your dinner plate be made up of vegetables.
In addition, eat regularly throughout the day. Skipping meals or going too long without eating can cause low blood sugars and decreased stability in insulin levels., Increase your fiber and healthy fat intake will help manage insulin levels.A Mediterranean style diet typically promotes the consumption of high fiber fruits and vegetables, fatty fish, dairy products and whole grains.


This type of diet or eating pattern has also been shown to help reduce high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease.Those following this diet eat poultry or eggs only one to two times weekly and limit red meet to less than once a week or just occasionally throughout the month."

Drink lots of water.,
Take it easy on the salt and sugar.,
Avoid alcohol.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Eat more calcium-rich foods.",How to Lose Weight from Your Cheeks1," You may be suffering from chubby cheeks because your body is retaining too much water because you're not drinking enough of it. When your body worries that you're not drinking enough water, it stores excess water in your cheeks and eyes, making your face look puffy. Drinking at least nine 8-ounce glasses of water a day will keep your body from being dehydrated and will make your cheeks look less chubby., If you include too much salt and refined sugar in your diet, then your body is more likely to retain water. Just like not drinking enough water, this will keep your face and cheeks looking puffy from all of that retained water. Though you can't give up on salt and sugar completely, try cutting salty or sugary foods out of your diet and eating foods that are low in salt or sugar.Instead of salty meats, go for lean meats.

Be physically active.",How to Lose Weight with Vitamins," Before taking any over-the-counter medication or supplement, you need to talk to your doctor. Not all supplements are safe for all people.


The FDA does not monitor vitamin, mineral and herbal supplements. Any supplement can be sold over-the-counter to any person. Look for supplements that have been certified by U.S. Pharmacopeia, NSF International, and ConsumerLab.com. These companies test supplements to ensure they contain what is claimed on the bottle.When starting a supplement talk to your doctor or pharmacist about which type of supplement may be appropriate for you.Tell him or her what your goal is and ask if there are other options outside of a vitamin.
When asking about a supplement you've already purchased, make sure to have the brand name, vitamin type and form (found on the ingredient label) and dosage amount. This information will help your doctor decide whether or not the supplement is appropriate for you.;
, Since dietary supplements are not regulated, you'll need to take charge of what you ingest in supplement form. Carefully monitor which type of supplements you decide to take.


Read the ingredient label of all vitamins. For example, if you're looking for Vitamin D, choose a supplement that visibly says ""Vitamin D"" on the front. Then flip the bottle over and look at the ingredient list. This will tell you what form of Vitamin D is in the supplement in addition to other ingredients in the pill. Make sure all other ingredients are safe for you.
Read the serving size and dosage amount. On the back of the bottle, there should also be a nutrition fact panel. It will tell you the serving size (example: two tablets) and the dosage per serving (for example, 30 mg). Make sure to be clear about how much is safe to take for you and what the exact serving and dosage amount is. Do not take more than the serving size or dosage daily.Read about any possible side effects. Like prescription medications, many over-the-counter supplements do have side effects. Review any side effects listed on the package and research the supplement online for additional information as needed., Studies have shown that those who supplemented regularly with Vitamin D (and were previously deficient) lost more weight compared to those who didn't take a Vitamin D supplementVitamin D deficiency is one of the most common vitamin deficiencies and is present in about 1 billion people worldwide.Side effects of Vitamin D deficiency are widespread and can include: increased mortality, cancer, metabolic disorders, skeletal diseases, heart disease, and infection.The current Vitamin D recommended daily intake is 400 IU.However, more recent studies suggest supplementing with levels as high as 2,000 IU per day.Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, which means it's stored in your adipose or fat tissues. It can stay in your body for up to three to six months. Be very careful with how much you supplement with. If your levels get too high, it becomes toxic and cannot be removed from your body.Food sources of vitamin D are far and few between; however, the following do contain some Vitamin D: cod liver oil, fortified milk and orange juice, salmon, beef liver, eggs and swordfish., Some studies have shown that calcium works with vitamin D for weight loss. Higher calcium intake has been shown to discourage fat accumulation in your fat cells.The recommended intake for calcium is 1,000 – 1,200 mg daily. However, you'll need to split up your supplements into doses of 500 mg as your body cannot absorb much more than 500 mg calcium at one time.Recent research shows that higher levels of calcium supplementation may lead to heart disease and hardening of the arteries.Take care with how much calcium you supplement with in combination of the calcium you eat from your diet.
Calcium also bind to some dietary fat in your GI tract and prevent your body from absorbing it, but this is only true of the calcium obtained from dairy products, not from supplements.The best sources of calcium from foods include: dairy products, dark leafy greens, broccoli and almonds.

, Magnesium is an important mineral that's involved in over 300 chemical reactions in your body. Studies show that in addition to these functions, magnesium may also help promote weight loss.Magnesium plays a role in a variety of metabolic functions but has been shown to improve your fasting glucose and insulin levels which may help you regulate your weight.Symptoms of a magnesium deficiency may include irritability, muscle weakness, and an irregular heartbeat.The recommended intake for magnesium is 350 mg per day.Take it in one to two doses throughout the day.
The best food sources of magnesium include: dairy products, beans, nuts, fish and shellfish., Although probiotics are not considered a vitamin or mineral, they are a supplement that has been linked with weight loss and maintenance of a healthier weight.Probiotics are live, ""good"" bacteria that are found in a variety of areas throughout your GI system. They are consumed through foods and beverages and are thought to support your immune system, and to prevent or manage constipation and diarrhea.Studies have shown that a more diverse set of that ""good bacteria"" or gut flora is related to lower and healthier weights.If you want to take a probiotic supplement find a supplement that contains at least 5 billion CFUs (or colony forming units) per serving.You can also add in probiotic foods like cultured yogurt or yogurt drinks, sauerkraut, miso, and tempeh.

, A few studies have shown that choline supplements may help you reduce your weight and overall body mass.Choline is not considered a vitamin or mineral, but is an essential nutrient that's involved in metabolism, lipid transport, and hormone synthesis.The daily recommended intake for choline is about 400-500 mg of choline. However, choline supplements generally only contain about 13% choline and a supplement containing 3,500-4,000 phosphatidylcholine (name of choline on the market) is safe.The best food sources of choline include: beef liver, eggs, wheat germ, scallops and salmon., Although vitamin and mineral supplements may be able to support weight loss, it's generally difficult to lose weight without modifying how many calories you eat each day.Most health experts will recommend you cut out about 500 calories daily. This is a slight decrease that results in about a 1 – 2 pound weight loss each week. This is considered slow, gradual and safe weight loss.Try using a food journal or food diary app on your smartphone to help you keep track of how many calories you're eating each day.

, In addition to monitoring your daily calories, it's important to eat a well-balanced diet daily. This will help ensure you're meeting your daily recommended amounts of vital nutrients.Most of your required vitamins, minerals and other nutrients should come from foods (supplements should only be used as a backup). Eat foods from each food group most days and include a wide variety of foods from within each food group daily.Stick to appropriate portion sizes as well. Following the right portion sizes helps ensure you're eating the right amounts of each food. Stick to: 3 – 4 oz of lean protein, 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of leafy greens, 1/2 cup of fruitand 1 oz or 1/2 cup of grains.

, Snacks are part of a nutritious diet and even be a part of a weight loss plan. Be smart about what you choose and how often you snack.


Typically its recommended to keeps snacks at around 150 calories per snack when you're trying to lose weight.Also try to include a lean protein or a fruit or vegetable in your snacks. These foods provide your body with the nutrition and energy to keep you going throughout the day.
Snack only when you need to. For example, a pre- or post-workout snack is a good idea or a having a small snack between two meals that are more than four hours apart.Examples of nutritious, low-calorie snacks include a hard boiled egg, an individual greek yogurt or an apple with a cheese stick.

, One thing that can sabotage your weight loss is liquid calories. They can slip into your diet without you even feeling full or satisfied.Limit beverages that are full of sugar and calories. For example, limit: regular sodas, juices and juice cocktail, energy drinks, sports drinks, smoothies, flavored coffee drinks, and alcohol.
In addition to limiting liquid calories, try to get between eight to 13 8-oz glasses (2 to 3 liters) of clear, hydrating fluids each day. Being adequately hydrated can support your weight loss.Fill up on hydrating fluids like water, flavored water and unsweetened decaf coffee and tea.

, In addition to diet and supplementation, being physically active on a regular basis can help you lose weight.Health professionals recommend getting in at least 150 minutes of cardiovascular or aerobic activity each week.Try activities like walking, jogging, dancing, swimming or doing aerobics classes.
In addition to cardio exercises, it's also important to do two to three days of strength training each week.This can help build lean muscle mass and increase your body's metabolism and ability to burn calories."

For dinner the diet requires you eat one hard boiled egg, along with one carrot, and a single serving of cottage cheese., Day five begins with the same austere breakfast of coffee and one slice of bread. It is followed by 150–200 grams (5.3–7.1 oz) of boiled fish, such as salmon. For dinner on day five you are instructed to eat 250 grams (8.8 oz) of beef with celery as a side.


Keep to the same breakfast of coffee and one slice of bread on day six.
Follow this with two hard boiled eggs and one carrot for lunch.
Dinner on day six should be 300 grams (11 oz) of boiled skinless chicken breast, alongside 150 g (2 cups) of lettuce as a side., You are now a week into the diet and will probably be tired and hungry. Day seven starts with no breakfast, just a cup of tea without sugar. It gets worse with no lunch, just lots and lots of water. You do get to eat something in the evening, but only 200 grams (7.1 oz) of lamb and one apple.Day eight is a little easier, but you still go without breakfast and only drink a coffee with one sugar.
Day eight is the same as day one: two hard boiled eggs with 400 grams (14 oz) of boiled spinach and a tomato for lunch.
In the evening you can eat 200 grams (7.1 oz) of beef with 150 g (2 cups) of lettuce. You can add a little lemon juice and olive oil to the lettuce for extra flavour., On day nine you continue to skip breakfast, just drinking a coffee with one sugar. At lunch time you are permitted to eat 250 grams (8.8 oz) of lean ham along with one pot of natural yoghurt. For dinner you can eat a little more than the previous evening: 250 grams (8.8 oz) of beef with 150 g (2 cups) of lettuce.On day 10 you have one slice of bread with your coffee for breakfast, the first solid breakfast since day six.
Lunch is two hard boiled eggs together with 100 grams (3.5 oz) of ham and some lettuce on the side.
The food for the evening the same as day three, just one tomato, some boiled celery and one serving of fruit.

, The end is almost in sight, and you will no doubt be feeling the strains of such a severely restrictive diet. On day 11 stick with a coffee and one slice of bread for breakfast. For lunch eat one pot of natural yoghurt and drink 200 milliliters (6.8  fl oz) of orange juice. Day 11 is the same as day four and for dinner you again eat one hard boiled egg, one carrot and one serving of cottage cheese.On day 12, have just one carrot for breakfast, before eating 200 grams (7.1 oz) of boiled fish for lunch. You can add a little butter and lemon juice to the fish.
For your dinner eat 250 grams (8.8 oz) of beef with some celery on the side.

, On the final day start with the familiar breakfast of one cup of coffee with a slice of toast. For lunch you can eat two hard boiled eggs along with one carrot. On the last day the diet advises you to skip the evening meal altogether., The Copenhagen Diet involves a dramatic drop in the nutrients as well as the calories you consume and that are essential to your health. It also involves skipping meals on many days, which can be very dangerous and damage your overall health. If you do undertake this diet it is important to closely monitor how you feel.


People undertaking an extremely restrictive, low-calorie diet should be monitored by their doctor throughout the process.
If you begin to feel especially lethargic or light-headed, then you should re-consider completing the diet and opt for a more balanced approach.
There is little available medical advice for those using this diet, most likely because no health professional would recommend you to do it.

, The severity of diet means that it is unlikely that you will have the energy required for even moderate exercise during the two weeks. It's important to try to keep up some physical activity but don't push yourself while on the diet. Gentle exercise such as walking or stretching can be one way to keep up some activity.


The fact that you will probably not be able to exercise during the diet highlights how extreme it is, and it's short-term nature.
Doing a diet that involves exercise instead will help to maintain lean muscle mass while you burn fat., The nature of this diet means that most of the weight you lose will be water weight, rather than fat. As a result, you can find that you rapidly re-gain the weight lost during the course of the diet once you start eating normally again. This can be a very demoralizing experience but it does reflect the short-term nature of severe diets such as the Copenhagen Diet.


Understanding that this is a short-term option will help you understand the changes to your body that you experience.
You can use the diet to kick start a new healthier lifestyle.
The self-control and discipline you learn sticking to the diet could help you push on to more healthy lifestyle.
Quickly losing then gaining weight is known as ""yo-yo dieting"" and has been linked to a higher risk of sudden cardiac death and coronary heart disease death for women., The Copenhagen Diet is not an answer to an unhealthy lifestyle and nor is it a path to a healthy one. You can experience quick weight loss over the two weeks but this should be coupled with positive goals for long-term health. Try not to focus exclusively on pounds shed, but changes that will lead to sustained benefits.The Copenhagen Diet should only ever be one part of your broader goals.


You can start by undertaking the diet, but have goals for a longer period than the two weeks of dieting.
Be specific and realistic with your goals. You want to be able to measure your progress and not set yourself an impossible task which will only act to demotivate you when you struggle to attain it."

Start at Phase 2 of Atkins 20.,
Climb the “carb ladder.” The plan for Phase 2, for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike, is to add food groups and higher carb foods individually to gauge their impact and determine your ideal balance.,
Pack in the protein.,
Focus on “Foundation Vegetables.” In Atkins terminology, Foundation Vegetables are key low-carb veggies that are meant to add up to 12-15 Net Carbs daily.Salad greens are heavily represented as Foundation Vegetables because of their low Net Carb counts.,
Consider Atkins 40 as well.",How to Use Dr. Atkins' Diet as a Vegetarian or Vegan1," Atkins 20 is the name now used for the traditional Atkins plan. This is known as the “balancing” phase, where you start to reintroduce certain carbs and foods slowly to determine the proper balance for your body.Following the standard schedule, you would follow Phase 1 until you are within 15 pounds of your weight-loss goal (or for at least two weeks), then move into Phase 2 until within 10 pounds of you goal. However, because of the limitations in low-carb protein options for vegetarians, it is recommended by Atkins to start at Phase 2 because it permits more carbs.
Atkins, in any phase, focuses on “Net Carbs,” which it determines as total carbohydrates minus fiber, measured in grams.;
,


Phase 2 typically starts at 25 g. of Net Carbs daily, which is increased in 5 g. increments (weekly, biweekly, or monthly, depending on your goals/preferences). Vegetarians, however, can start at 30 g. and build up from there.Atkins also recommends that vegetarians introduce seeds before berries, to facilitate protein and fat intake.

, Without meat available as an easy low carb protein source, vegetarians on Atkins need to rely on options like eggs, cheese, and soy. All through the Atkins diet, you'll see that protein is essential. Find sources that are appropriate to your dietary restrictions and focus on a variety of ways to get these into your diet to hit your protein goal.


Atkins calls eggs “one of nature’s most nutritious creations,”so if you are a vegetarian who includes them, they will be a backbone of your diet plan. Eggs can be a daily breakfast staple, and in any form — boiled, fried, deviled, chopped, etc. — can be included in meals and snacks throughout the day.
No one can live on eggs alone, however, and especially if you are a vegetarian that eschews them, move your focus onto things such as cheese and other dairy like cottage cheese and yogurt, and especially soy.
From edamame to tofu to meat substitute products, soybeans are an incredibly versatile source of protein for vegetarians. Soybeans provide the most complete vegetable protein, and supply only about 3-6 Net Carbs per serving as edamame, tofu, or tempeh. Consider also gluten-based meat substitutes, such as seitan, or Quorn, a meat substitute made from fungi.

, You will consume less than one Net Carb gram per half-cup of alfalfa sprouts, endive, arugula, radishes, spinach, lettuce, and turnip greens, among others.
Other low Net Carb veggies include mushrooms, cucumbers, broccoli, asparagus, and green beans.
Starchy vegetables like potatoes don’t make the cut, nor do corn or carrots because of their sugar content.
So, if you aren’t already a salad-lover as a vegetarian, you may want to become one before trying Atkins, though there should be enough vegetable variety to keep you happy.

, Atkins 40 is a newer version of the diet plan that is meant to provide a bit more flexibility, as well as a bit more leeway on carbs.With it, you start with 40 g. Net Carbs daily, (10 per meal times three, 5 per shack times two), and add 10 g. weekly after getting within 10 pounds of your weight goal.
Foundation Vegetables should make up 15 g. of your daily Net Carbs (around 6-8 servings), with other carb foods making up the remaining 25 g.
This, then, provides you a little more room for including nuts, beans, legumes, and whole grains into your meals from the start, which might make life much easier for a vegetarian.

Find reliable sources of information that can provide you with the benefits, disadvantages and any possible side effects or dangers of the supplement you're interested in.;
, Studies completed by the company itself or recommendations from celebrities, magazines, or newspapers generally are not reliable.


There are some websites and government sites that offer extensive information on vitamin, mineral, herbal and weight loss supplements. They include all unbiased, reliable research that has been done on the supplements they have listed., Most over-the-counter diet pills will advertise some sort of weight loss claim. It's important to understand these claims are not regulated by the FDA and may be false.


Be aware of ""clinically proven"" claims on supplements. The supplement company should provide supporting evidence to this claim. If there is no supporting information or studies only completed by the company itself, it's important to realize this may be a false claim.Also be aware of unsafe, unreliable products. They will have claims such as ""lose 10 pounds in one week"" or ""24 hour diet."" These are generally unsafe supplements., All medications, even prescription medications, come with a list of possible side effects.While they may be rare, it's important to be aware of exactly how a medication or supplement could affect you.


Read all information on possible side effects prior to taking any medication or over the counter diet pill.
Note that some ingredients of many weight loss pills are not well studied and side effects are not well known. For example, bitter orange is known as an ""ephedra substitute"" and may be associated with similar negative side effects.Take extreme caution when ingesting diet pills.

, Your doctor should do a basic physical examination and review your current medications and medical history. She will be able to determine if weight loss or the use of diet pills is safe and appropriate for you.


If you're in good health, your physician may see no problem with you using diet pills in moderation.
Tell your doctor the type of pills you plan to take, and ask her opinion about them, especially in relation to your general health status.
If your physician doesn't think diet pills are appropriate, ask about prescription weight loss medications, medically supervised diet programs, or if your physician can refer you to a local registered dietitian.

, Read the instructions prior to taking any diet pills. Follow the instructions exactly and be sure to note any side effects or weight loss that has resulted.


Do not double up on doses or take the pills in intervals too close together.
Some diet pills advise certain foods to avoid while taking. Pay attention to these special directions.
You decrease your risk of adverse side effects when you take supplements as directed.
Discontinue the use of any diet pills or supplements if you experience negative side effects. Contact your doctor immediately and inform her of the side effects you're experiencing and the pills you're taking.

, Many diet pills cause your body to lose water through urination. Some diet pills act as diuretics or contain other ingredients that act in a similar fashion.Aim for at least 64 oz or 2L of clear fluids (like water or flavored water) daily to help maintain proper hydration status. The amount of water needed may differ for everyone, but the ""8 glasses"" daily rule is easy to remember.
The loss of too much water can result in dehydration, which may cause additional adverse health issues.

, There are some prescription medications that are used to help people lose weight. Studies have shown that these medications (like phentermine or Belviq), when combined with a medically supervised diet and exercise, can result in clinically significant weight loss.Clinically significant weight loss is a drop in weight that results in the improvement or resolution of co-morbid conditions like high blood pressure or sleep apnea.Your doctor will evaluate you for the appropriateness and safety of prescription weight loss medication. You will be required to follow up regularly and most likely meet with a registered dietitian and exercise specialist.
There are a variety of prescribed weight loss medications your doctor may choose. Most increase your energy and decrease appetite.Weight loss medications are generally not intended for long-term use. Therefore, it's important to make lifestyle changes to help support and maintain weight loss long-term., There is no magic bullet to weight loss. Even with diet pills, you'll need to modify your diet to help support and maintain weight loss.Include appropriate servings and portions from each food group:


Include sources of lean protein at every meal. Serving sizes should be around 3-4 ounces or the size of a deck of cards. Include foods like: poultry, lean beef, eggs, low-fat dairy, seafood, legumes and tofu.Include six to eight servings of fruits and vegetables daily. One serving of fruit is about 1/2 cup or one small fruit and one serving of vegetables is 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy greens.Eat about two to three servings of grains. One serving is 1/2 cup or about 1 ounce.If you can, make most of your grain choices whole grain for added health benefits. Choose: oats, quinoa, brown rice, or 100% whole wheat bread.
You should eat about three portions of dairy every day.One serving of dairy is equivalent to 1 cup of milk, 1 ½ ounces of natural cheese, or 2 ounces of processed cheese., In addition to eating a healthy diet, its important to monitor portions or count calories to help induce weight loss.Each person will need a different amount of calories depending on their age, gender and activity level. However, to lose weight you may need to cut calories by about 500 calories daily. This generally results in a 1-2 pound weight loss per week.Measuring your portions can also help manage calories. Stick to smaller portions for less calories at each meal and snack. Take the time to measure the recommended portion sizes for protein, fruits, vegetables and grains.
Use a food diary or download a calorie-tracking app onto your smartphone.

, One source of calories that should be limited are those calories coming from sweetened or sugary beverages. These calories provide little to no nutrition and can lead to weight gain.Limit beverages like: regular soda, sweetened coffee drinks, sweetened tea, sports or energy drinks, fruit juices, and alcoholic beverages that include these beverages as mixers.
Try to include as many clear, sugar-free fluids as possible. Try: water, flavored water, plain coffee, and tea.

, Any weight loss plan needs exercise to succeed and be sustained.Including regular exercise will support weight loss and help maintain your weight loss long-term.


It's recommended to include about 150 minutes or 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercises each week. This means you should be sweating slightly, be moderately out of breath, and have a slightly elevated heart rate.Also include two days of strength training exercises for 20 minutes a session. Try to work most major muscle groups."

Use your allowance of 200 additional calories.",How to Prepare Biggest Loser Meal Plans1," Multiply your current weight times 7 to find your daily calorie target. If you weigh 200 pounds, for example, your target would be 200 x 7 or 1,400 calories.;
,


Make sure that at least half of your servings are from vegetables; don’t eat more fruits than vegetables.
One serving equals 1 cup, 1 medium piece or 8 ounces (227 g) of a fruit or vegetable.

,


Meat, low-fat dairy or vegetarian protein sources are all acceptable.
Appropriate serving sizes are 1 cup or 8 ounces (227 g).

Make further adjustments to Atkins 20 Phase 2.,
Be precise with the rest of the plan.,
Learn to love soy even more.,
Check out Atkins 40 as well.",How to Use Dr. Atkins' Diet as a Vegetarian or Vegan2," As with vegetarians, it is recommended that vegans using Atkins 20 (the traditional plan) start with Phase 2. This “balancing” phase permits more carbs, but also requires some additional adjustments for vegans.Vegans are recommended to start with 50 g. Net Carbs per day, as opposed to the 25 g. for standard Phase 2 or 30 g. for vegetarians who consume eggs and dairy. Vegans will still follow the guide of adding 5 g. per day in increments made weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly (based on preference), up to 80 g. Net Carbs.
Vegans are also advised to make allowances for seeds, nuts, and legumes from the start, instead of introducing them over time.
Basically, even Atkins itself is admitting that vegans, due to the limited protein sources available to them to begin with, cannot consume enough calories per day on Atkins without making some changes. But with adaptation, it is possible to succeed.

, Since vegans have to make some alterations to important elements of the Atkins 20 plan, it becomes even more imperative for them to adhere closely to the remaining parts of it.Eat frequently, with no more than 3-4 hours between meals or snacks. Feeling hungry all the time is more likely to trigger carb cravings.
Make sure you are spreading out your Net Carbs during these frequent meals. Using 40 of your 50 allotted Net Carbs at one meal — for instance, pairing ½ cup of chickpeas (22 Net Carbs) with a cup of soy milk (17 Net Carbs) will leave vegans in particular with very few dining options for the rest of the day.Also, consuming too many carbs at one time can cause a spike in insulin, which helps convert carbohydrates into fat, and which the Atkins diet is constructed to avoid.Drink eight glasses of water daily, as is recommended for all Atkins dieters. Hydration is important for everyone, and water can be surprisingly effective at curbing hunger temporarily.
Choose lower-carb whole grains as needed, such as long grain brown rice and whole grain pasta (of which Atkins sells branded versions, if you’re interested).
Vegans won’t have a problem with getting their daily vegetables in, but stick primarily to the Foundation Vegetables with lower Net Carbs., Soybeans are important for vegetarians on Atkins, but are critical for vegans as a protein source.


In the form of edamame (6.2 g. Net Carbs, 11.1 g. protein), silken tofu (3.1 g. Net Carbs, 5.4 g. protein), and tempeh (3.3 g. Net Carbs, 15.4 g. protein), or in foods ranging from (miso) soup to (soy) nuts, soybeans need to play a central role in the diet of any vegan on Atkins.This wikiHow article offers some ideas on vegan cooking with soy and other proteins and is a gateway to various wikiHow vegan recipes. Remember, though, that recipes need to be vegan and low-carb to suit Atkins.

, As mentioned in the vegetarian section, Atkins 40 is a newer plan with a little more flexibility and allowance for carbs. The starting point for everyone on the plan is 40 g. Net Carbs daily, adding 10 g. per week once within 10 pounds of your weight goal.You could also consider starting at 50 g. Net Carbs, as with Atkins 20 for vegans.
With less focus on restrictions of food types, especially in the beginning, vegans can consume “sufficient protein from seeds, nuts, soy products, soy and rice cheeses, seitan, legumes and high protein grains like quinoa.”"

Define the details and benefits of the “Eco-Atkins” diet.,
Out-carb Atkins, but smartly.,
Fill up on fiber.",How to Use Dr. Atkins' Diet as a Vegetarian or Vegan3," This diet is not, strictly speaking, an Atkins diet, though Atkins does tout is as an option for vegetarians and vegans on its website.The concept of this diet derives mainly from a study detailed in the Archives of Internal Medicine (2009), which found that participants placed on a vegan low-carb, high-protein diet saw a markedly better drop in LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels as compared to those on a standard low-fat vegetarian diet, while both groups lost weight roughly equally.The vegan diet in the study was 31% protein (mainly gluten, soy, and nuts), 43% fats (mainly nuts, vegetable oils, soy products, and avocado), and 26% carbs (from fruits, veggies, and some cereal products).

, The 26% of calories derived from carbs in Eco-Atkins equates to roughly 130 g. per day, which is low by traditional nutrition standards (around 225-350 g. daily) but quite high for typical Atkins plans (which tend to max out at around 80 g. Net Carbs).


Atkins, not surprisingly, states “Imagine how much better this group would have done if they followed Atkins protocols for carb consumption?”,but let’s presume that you intend to stick to the diet as described in the study.
The greater leeway on carbs on Eco-Atkins is not an invitation to consume white breads, rice, potatoes, or baked goods, however. You need to spend these extra carbs on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, oats, and the beans, legumes, etc. from which you are deriving much of your protein., One important reason to focus your carbs on vegetables, beans, legumes, and whole grains is the higher fiber content in these foods. When dieting in general, and especially when on a vegetarian/vegan low carb diet, fiber is definitely your friend.High-fiber foods take longer to digest, providing a greater feeling of satiety (that is, fullness), which can combat cravings and help keep your diet on track.
A high-fiber diet helps promote bowel health, can lower cholesterol and reduce blood pressure and inflammation, and helps control blood sugar levels.The value of fiber is why it is deducted from carb counts in Atkins’ Net Carbs.

Eat foods that fall into the very low CD category (foods with a CD of 0.6 or lower) in unlimited portions.,
Eat reasonable portions of low CD category contains foods (CD of 0.6 to 1.5).,
Eat modest portions of medium CD category foods.,
Limit your intake of high CD foods.",How to Understand Calorie Density on the Volumetrics Diet2," These foods include fruits, non-starchy vegetables and broth-based soups. You can eat as much as you want of these foods as long as you stop eating when you feel full. These are some general guidelines:


Vegetables (non-starchy): 1 cup of raw leafy vegetables, 1/2 cup of cut raw or cooked vegetables or 1/2 cup of vegetable juice.
Fruits: 1 medium piece of fruit, 1/4 cup dried fruit, 1/2 cup fresh, frozen or canned fruit, 1/2 cup fruit juice.

, Whole grains, legumes, lean protein and low-fat dairy generally fall into this category. Eat reasonable portions of these foods.


Grains: 1 slice of whole-grain bread, 1 ounce of dry cereal, or 1/2 cup of cooked rice, pasta or cereal.
Fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products: 1 cup milk or yogurt, 1-1/2 ounce cheese
Lean meats, poultry and fish: 1 ounce cooked meats, poultry or fish, or 1 egg
Legumes: 1/2 cup cooked legumes (beans, peas, etc.)

Understand simple carbohydrates.,
Understand complex carbohydrates.,
Realize that animal proteins are complete.,
Know that you have to combine plant proteins to get all the essential amino acids.,
Understand the need for fats.,
Make sure you get the right vitamins and minerals.",How to Stay Healthy on a Raw Food Diet1," Simple carbohydrates are basic sugars that include glucose, fructose and galactose. They give instant energy to your body and are an essential part of a raw food diet.


All kinds of ripe fruit are good sources of simple carbohydrates.
The most abundant raw food sources of simple carbohydrates are mangoes, grapes, melons, bananas, and papayas.;
, Complex carbohydrates are complex sugars that break down more slowly in the intestine. This type of carbohydrate provides more sustained energy, because they take the body longer to process.


Complex carbohydrates are found in animals as glycogen and in plants as starches.
In a raw food diet, legumes, wheat, rye, oat, corn, yam, rice, carrots, and grains are common sources of complex carbs.

, Animal proteins, like that found in eggs, milk, clams, oysters, fish, and dairy products, are first class proteins because they provide all the essential amino acids. However, if you are on a raw food diet, some of these foods may be difficult to consume without cooking.


You can immerse eggs or fish in boiling water for 5-6 seconds to reduce the raw taste.

, Plant proteins are second class proteins, meaning that no single type of plant can provide all the essential amino acids in one package. However, if you combine plant proteins strategically, you can improve the quality of your protein intake.


Examples of plant protein sources are germinated nuts, dry beans, seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame seeds) and grains.
To germinate the seeds and nuts, you need to put them in a cup and add water.
Do this at night so the seeds will be ready to eat the next morning.
These seeds and nuts can be complemented by legumes to provide complete sets of amino acids.

, Fat is an essential component of any healthy diet. Fat provides ample energy to the body, and some types of fat, such as omega-3 fatty acids and mono unsaturated fats, can provide cardiovascular benefits.


Nuts, seeds, avocado, coconut butter, flaxseed, and mustard oil are good sources of fat.
Olive oil, soybean oil, corn oil, and sunflower oil can be used to increase the flavor of food as well as meet fat requirements.

, Almost all plant foods are rich in some types of vitamins and minerals. However, green leafy vegetables are the most abundant sources of the various nutrients that your body needs to function properly.


There is a wide variety of vitamins and minerals that are essential to the body's function, such as iron, magnesium, zinc, fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, and many others.
You can prepare salads, or consume lettuce, carrot, kelp, and grass juice to make sure you are getting the right amount of vitamins and nutrients.

"
"
Consume whole grains.,
Enjoy vegetables.,
Eat tomatoes.,
Add nuts.",How to Use Nutrient Synergy in Your Diet1," Whole grains are low in cholesterol and fat, plus they contain protein, high levels of fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals (chemical components found in plants with powerful healing properties). Whole grains are a food synergy superfood.Whole grains include oats, brown rice, quinoa, millet, and many others.
These grains can be boiled in water, broth, tomato sauce, or any other liquid (cooking time will vary from grain to grain).;
, Vegetables offer numerous synergistic health benefits. Eat a wide variety of vegetables, as often as you can! Dark green veggies, in particular, are a crucial component in a food synergy diet.Eggplant and okra are particularly high in viscous fiber (soluble fiber that keeps your gut healthy).
The carotenoid family of vegetables (sweet potato, carrot, spinach) provides a rich mix of phytochemicals.
Cruciferous vegetables (kale, broccoli) contain anti-cancer compounds.

, Tomatoes contain all four major carotenoids, which create a powerful food synergy when taken together. Additionally, tomatoes contain three powerful antioxidants (beta-carotene, vitamin E, and vitamin C) that have been shown to have synergy. Finally, tomatoes contain lycopene, which has been proven to fight cancer.Carotenoids are what create the colors in fruits and vegetables.
They are excellent for your skin and hair, and they protect against cellular damage.

, Nuts are another excellent food that contribute to a synergistic diet. Nuts contain monounsaturated fat, antioxidants, and phytochemicals. Taken together, these may help lower blood cholesterol, boost the immune system, and decrease the risk of certain cancers. Nuts also contain vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin E, potassium, and magnesium.Try almonds, cashews, or walnuts.

Have fun with the raw diet to make sure you stick to it.,
Keep preparation easy to prevent your diet from feeling like a burden.,
Consume adequate calories and nutrients to stay healthy.,
Eat chemical free foods.,
Maintain appropriate storage of foods to help them last long.,
Calculate calories to maintain a healthy food intake.",How to Stay Healthy on a Raw Food Diet2," If you do not enjoy your diet, it will be very hard to stick to your plan. Try to make your diet plan fun and exciting, by learning how to have fun preparing and eating your food.


You don't need to change your menu overnight. If you think about your current diet, you might find a lot of raw foods there already. Start with them and gradually add new ones to ease the transition. At the same time, eliminate cooked or processed foods.
You should not sacrifice the pleasure of eating. You will soon lose interest in your new diet if you do so, so make sure to choose foods that you like.
You can start with your favorite raw salad, salsa, nuts, cheese, pesto, or super foods like berries, raw chocolate, honey, maca, or young coconuts.

, You are probably not going to become a professional cook. So, your raw food diet should be easy to prepare with common ingredients to prevent getting frustrated by having to comb the supermarket looking for ingredients.


Do not start with recipes that require intensive training, costly kitchen equipment, or complicated procedures like dehydration and sprouting. Find foods that you already eat and enjoy like smoothies, juices, and raw fruits.
You should try to avoid rare and costly items. It is best to find seasonal, yet delicious items. This way, you can rotate your menu to avoid dullness and boredom.

, An ideal raw food diet plan should be balanced, including all the essential nutrients present in their appropriate amounts and proportions.


Try to rotate among different foods so that any deficiencies of one can be covered by another.
This will also prevent the boredom of eating the same food day after day.
Don't avoid sweet fruits if you are healthy and don't have diabetes, because they can provide a good source of calories and vitamins.
Eating a good amount of fruit will provide you with the calories that most raw foods lack.

, One of the principles central to embarking on a raw food diet is to avoid hazardous and toxic substances. If you purchase raw foods grown and preserved with chemicals, that principle is spoiled.


Thus, try to get raw foods in fresh and natural conditions.
It is great if you have a piece of land to grow plants. In apartments, you can also grow plants on a sunny windowsill or balcony.
Try herbs and fruits like tomato, papaya, pepper, lemon and other plants that do not grow too tall.
You may also make your own compost using a compost bin to provide organic fertilizer for your garden.
Put your daily kitchen waste in the bin and add some soil. After a few months, you will get an excellent compost to nourish your plants.

, Raw foods decompose and spoil easily at room temperature, so try to consume them when they are fresh.


Some foods even produce bowel-toxic substances after prolonged standing, due to the action of bacteria.
Warming some other stored foods can activate harmful bacteria.
You can freeze some foods like nuts, seeds, dried fruits (particularly foods that can be kept at room temperature for several days) for days to weeks without any deterioration of nutritional value.

, The three main sources of a raw food diet are fruits, vegetables, and nuts and seeds. You can calculate a rough estimate of the total calories you will consume daily.


Typically, an adult male needs 2500 calories and an adult female needs 2000 calories per day.
Choose foods from all three groups to meet the total calorie requirement.
If you combine foods in this way, the requirements for protein and fat will probably also be met.
Check online for the nutritional value (including calorie count) of different food items, particularly the ones that you have in your current eating pattern. Make necessary adjustments in relation to amount and proportion.

"
"
Ensure that you get adequate protein.,
Consume enough vitamin B12.,
Get enough calcium and iron.,
Satisfy your psychological hunger to avoid feeling unsatisfied.,
Be aware of detox symptoms.,
Practice proper food preparation to avoid food poisoning.",How to Stay Healthy on a Raw Food Diet3," Throughout childhood, you were probably told that meat, milk, eggs, and fish are the main sources of protein in most diets. However, there are many other sources of protein available if you look closely and plan ahead.


Many plant products are rich in protein.
In fact, broccoli, avocados, nuts, seeds and legumes have a higher amount of protein per gram than many animal products.
The only drawback is that plant proteins are not first class, meaning that a single type of plant does not contain all the essential amino acids.
To make sure you get your required variety of amino acids, simply combine two or more plants.
Most likely, the deficiency of one will be fulfilled by another.

, It is true that a strict raw food diet lacks some vitamins and minerals, the most notable of which is vitamin B12.


About 38% of vegans suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency.
However, you can easily overcome this issue by adding yeast to your diet.
Add 1 tablespoon of nutritional yeast to your daily menu.
Alternatively, you can take 10 micrograms of vitamin B12 supplements daily.

, Some people doubt that a raw food diet can contain enough calcium and iron. With the proper planning, you can definitely make sure that your raw food diet incorporates enough of these two essential nutrients.


Green leafy vegetables are abundant sources of calcium and iron.
Vegetables like broccoli, nuts such as almonds, and sesame seeds are rich in both minerals.

, Always feeling hungry can be a result of a sudden transition to a raw food diet. This psychological factor can be addressed by meditation, yoga, and satisfying your taste buds by eating slowly.


In some cases, hunger may a sign of inadequate calorie intake.
Make sure you are taking in enough calories in the form of carbohydrates and fats.
Seeds, nuts and sprouts can be a great remedy for hunger.
Sometimes thirst may be perceived as hunger. Drink enough water (2 liters daily at least).
Lastly, you may add raw animal products, like milk, which are very filling.

, The withdrawal of cooked and processed foods and the introduction of greens to your diet may alter your body chemistry. As these natural ingredients become the basis for your diet, harmful and toxic substances begin to wash away.


You may experience nausea, diarrhea, headache, abdominal cramp, acne, or rash during this stage.
To avoid detox symptoms, withdraw processed and cooked foods more gradually.
Add heavy raw foods like nuts, coconuts, and avocado to slow down the detox.

, There is always the risk of a bacterial contamination of raw foods, because raw foods are not exposed to heat that would kill the microbes.


This is particularly true for raw vegetables that can be contaminated by environmental organisms and animal waste, and unpasteurized milk.
Always wash raw foods thoroughly with fresh water.
Try to avoid raw milk and milk products.
Keep your kitchen neat and clean and wash your hands with soap and water before handling foods.

Eat a new kind of breakfast.,
Have a tasty mid-morning snack.,
Have a large lunch to round out your diet.,
Eat a full and nutritious dinner.",How to Stay Healthy on a Raw Food Diet4," For a raw food style breakfast, try eating 2-3 whole fruits, like apples, oranges, pears etc. They should be seasonal and easily available.


To avoid monotony, try to eat different types of fruits on different days of the week.

, Because your breakfast is very light and focused on carbohydrates, you need to eat some protein and fat to balance the diet. You can use any type of germinated seed or nut for this purpose.


A 1/2 cup of walnuts, cashews, brazil nuts or pecans will do the job.
Soak the seeds or nuts overnight in fresh water. When the morning comes, they will be ready to eat.

, Lunch should be your largest meal of the day in a raw food diet and must contain all the essential nutrients. For this reason, you will see the greatest variation in the lunch menu.


Your lunch should be appetizing, nutrient and calorie rich, and filling.
Make sure to keep green leafy items, fruits, legumes or grains, nuts, and oil in your diet plan.
A simple menu could contain an avocado salad, for which you will need 3 cups of green vegetables (any type according your preference), 1 avocado, 1 beet, 1 carrot, 1 tomato, 1 lemon (juiced), 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of hemp oil, and a pinch of salt.
Cut your avocado in half, remove the pit and slice into strips. Put them on top of your greens and add your other ingredients. Mix well and serve to eat.

, Dinner is also a major meal of the day and you need to include all the essential nutrients. You can prepare a salad with dressing using a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts or seeds.


Consider preparing a salad with lettuce, pear, apple, garlic (one each), and a dressing with balsamic vinegar, stone-ground mustard, olive oil, water, lemon juice, salt, and agave/honey. Mix the salad items together and pour the dressing over the salad.
You can add animal products such as milk and dairy products, egg and fish to your dinner menu.
If you do, make sure to balance them by removing other items to keep your calorie intake within your requirements.

Combine iron and vitamin C. Vitamin C is famous for its immune boosting function, but it is also a crucial vitamin for your nervous system.,
Combine calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K. This trio of nutrients is the perfect “bone-building” combination.,
Combine vitamins C and E. Vitamins C and E are both powerful antioxidants that protect cells from the damage of free radicals.,
Combine potassium, magnesium, and calcium.",How to Use Nutrient Synergy in Your Diet2," Iron is critical for energy, healthy metabolism, and healthy red blood cells. Taken together, vitamin C and iron improve the absorption (and boost the strength) of one another.Foods like spinach, kale, collard greens contain both iron and vitamin C naturally.
Try pairing lemon (high in vitamin C) with high-iron foods like spirulina (in a smoothie) or quinoa and lentils (in a salad).
Another example is to use both red peppers (which contain vitamin C) with iron-rich black beans in a burrito.

, Calcium does the work of building healthy bones, vitamin D aids in calcium absorption, and vitamin K directs the calcium to where it is needed most.Scramble some eggs (vitamin D) with spinach (vitamin K) and cheese (calcium).

, The combination of these vitamins is far stronger than either vitamin taken alone. Additionally, this winning combination helps to reduce the build-up of plaque in the arteries, leading to increased arterial elasticity.Enjoy a bowl of berries and citrus fruits (both high in vitamin C) sprinkled with pumpkin and sunflower seeds (both high in vitamin E).

, When these three minerals are consumed together, they form a “group dynamic” that works to promote proper nerve function and electrolyte balance, as well as reducing blood pressure.Start your morning with a bowl of oats (high in magnesium), topped with bananas (high in potassium), and a dollop of yogurt (high in calcium).

Pair B vitamins with omega-3s.,
Consume vitamin A with healthy fats.,
Combine healthy fats with vitamin D. Vitamin D regulates the absorption of calcium and phosphorous in the body.,
Pair vitamin E with a healthy source of fat.",How to Use Nutrient Synergy in Your Diet3," Although B vitamins are not a fat-soluble variety, research shows that when B vitamins are paired with omega-3 they work together to promote the health of your heart.Salmon is an excellent source of both B vitamins and omega-3s.

, Vitamin A promotes growth, healthy reproduction, immune system function, and the health of your eyes. As a fat-soluble vitamin, however, vitamin A must be consumed alongside a healthy fat in order to be properly absorbed.Liver is an excellent source of both vitamin A and fat.
Cook carrots in coconut oil or a little butter to harness their vitamin A.

, Vitamin D is essential for growth, immune function, and the development of bones and teeth. Like vitamin A, vitamin D must be consumed with a healthy fat to be absorbed.Fatty fish, like tuna or mackerel, are great sources of both vitamin D and healthy fat.
Saute mushrooms in olive oil to best absorb their vitamin D.

, Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that protects the cells from the damage of free radicals. Vitamin E also helps to prevent many diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and heart disease.Almonds are a good source of both vitamin E and fat.
Baked grain-free muffins using pumpkin (high in vitamin E) and almond butter (high in both vitamin E and healthy fat)."

This phase is all about drastically lowering the amount of carbohydrates you consume so it goes without saying that you need to identify low-carb snacks. These snacks should be made of fat, protein and fibre to best help you control your appetite between meals. You can investigate a large number of snack recipes online., One of the attractions of the Atkins diet is that you don't have to cut out all fatty food, and still get to enjoy things like cheese. Cheese can be a good option for a small snack between meals that will limit your hunger and help you stick to the serving sizes for the main meals.


Eating an ounce of hard or string cheese is a great snack for the induction phase.
You can grate some mozzarella over two slices of tomato with a little basil for a nice snack.
Wrapping some grated cheese in a lettuce leaf is nice alternative to just eating the cheese on its own., Eggs are also a good choice for snacks while you are in the induction phase of the Atkins diet. You can prepare eggs scrambled, hard-boiled or soft-boiled, or even make yourself a small omelet with non-starchy veggies and cheese.

Try keeping a few hard-boiled eggs in your refrigerator for an easy snack between meals.

, Vegetables make good snack choices during the induction phase. Half an avocado is an excellent snack to put into your rotation. Alternatively you can try an artichoke simply drizzled with a little lemon juice. A simple side salad with a boiled egg is also a fine choice for a low-carb snack.You can combine vegetables with cheese to make a delicious snack that is low in carbohydrates but will stop you from getting too hungry.
For example, have a cup of sliced cucumber and two slices of cheddar cheese.
You can also stuff five green or black olives with cheese, or have them on their own., There are lots of meat-based snack options for the induction phase. You can roll some cooked sliced ham around a few raw or cooked greens to make a delicious ham roll-up. You can switch the vegetables for cheese to make a cheese and ham version. Get two slices of ham and smear a tablespoon of cream cheese on each one. Roll it up for a great phase one snack.One fish option is to switch the ham for 3oz of sliced smoked salmon. Smear the cheese onto the salmon.
You can roll the salmon and cheese up in a thin slice of cucumber., In the induction phase of Atkins you should eat one mid-morning and one mid-afternoon snack. You may not feel the need to snack if you have opted to eat four or five small meals during the day rather than three main meals. You should ensure that you don't go more than four to six hours during waking hours without eating anything. A hot drink or broth can used be an alternative to a solid snack., Most of the snack options are quick and easy to prepare. For example, it doesn't take long to make a cheese and ham roll-up, or hollow out an avocado. You may, however, need to prepare these snacks in the morning before you go to work or school. Always try to do this on the same day as you eat them, or the night before, so they are as fresh as possible.


For some snack options, such as salads, you can prepare larger amounts and eat them over a couple of days to save time. Pickles (no sugar) are also a quick snack option.
Having readily prepared snacks in the fridge, already set aside in the appropriate portions, will help to you control what you eat very closely and keep track of your consumption.

, Snacking can often lead to problems with any diet, so it's particularly important that you monitor what you eat closely and stick to the programme outlined. Try to vary your snacks so it doesn't become too repetitive and boring. Experiment with different combinations and different ingredients to broaden your horizons.


There are some Atkins branded protein bars and shakes that are low in carbohydrates and make good snacks, but always check the label for the net carb content. Some bars are designed as snacks, others as meals.Don't become stuck on protein bars and shakes, try to keep as much balance in your diet as possible.
Remind yourself that the induction phase is short-term, and that you will be adding in more variety in the next phase.

, It is especially important that you drink enough water in the induction phase of the diet. The Atkins diet has a strong diuretic effect so you need to make sure you do not become dehydrated. You should drink eight glasses of water a day. Each glass should contain eight ounces of water., You should see this as the first step on your way to sustainable weight loss and a healthier lifestyle. Seeing the induction phase in your broader plan can motivate you stick with it through these first weeks. Having regular phases and regular goals can help you to maintain your commitment and support you in your long-term weight loss plan.


Having attainable, specific and plausible goals will be the most productive way to map out your progress.Couple your Atkins goals with some for specific amounts of regular exercise, such as thirty minutes running twice a week.

, Sticking to Atkins throughout the induction phase will require focus and commitment, but you don't want it to dominate your thoughts every waking minute. If you are constantly obsessing about net carbs it could all become too overbearing. Try to keep it to something you think about at meal times and forget about it the rest of the time.


Carrying on your life as normal while you are dieting will help you to stick to it and show that you can make dietary changes that are sustainable and not disruptive.
This is hardest in the induction phase when the drop in carbs in most pronounced, so plan some activities with friends to take your mind off it.

, If you don't look after yourself well during the induction phase you could fall ill and end up coming off the diet prematurely. The most likely causes of of feeling unwell are dehydration and an electrolyte imbalance.There are some things you can do to help you avoid these and stay as healthy as possible in the first weeks of Atkins.


Drinking eight (eight ounce) glasses of water a day will keep you well hydrated and negate the effects of a loss in water weight in the induction phase.
The loss of water weight can lead to light-headedness and a loss of energy. To ward these off combine good hydration with consuming sufficient salt.
Be sure to consume sufficient protein, three servings a day of four to six ounces, to maintain lean muscle mass., One way to help you maintain motivation and stay on track during induction is to keep good records of your progress. Having a graph or chart that shows how far you have come will help push you forwards in the following days. Plot out small milestones even in the induction phase to give yourself a trajectory to follow.


Being consistent in your net carb intake is key in the induction phase, so devise a plan that illustrates this.
Try for level and progress steady rather than any peaks or troughs., Once you complete the induction phase you should take a moment to feel proud and reward yourself. This doesn't mean pigging out on chips, but reward yourself with something that isn't food. You could buy yourself a new CD or DVD, or go to a movie. Having frequent smaller rewards as you meet your goals and progress through the Atkins programme can be more effective than one big reward at the end.Small rewards will help to keep you motivated and to feel tangible benefits beyond just your weight loss.
Instead of a material reward you could give yourself an afternoon off from work or study to have fun.

Research the science of the raw food diet.,
Understand which foods are acceptable and why.,
Plan out your meals ahead of time.,
Eliminate unacceptable foods from the home.,
Use combinations of flavors to add variety to your meals.,
Secure the support of family members and friends.,
Start a journal to monitor your success.",How to Succeed on the Raw Food Diet,"


The raw food diet is based on the concept that the human body evolved to consume whole foods rather than highly processed foods.
Many consumers mistakenly believe that the raw foods diet means you cannot cook any of your food. This is a misconception. Instead, the raw foods diet involves choosing food items, which are all natural such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.
Learning about the principles behind the raw food diet will provide you with reason to pursue and stick with this diet program.;
, Once you learn the basic concepts and principles of the raw food diet, it is important to carefully study food lists to determine which foods are acceptable on the raw food diet. It is fairly simple to identify foods that can be eaten on this diet. Raw foods include fruits, vegetables, legumes, seeds and nuts. Any foods that have been processed or have artificial additives are not a part of the raw food diet.

, The biggest obstacle for many individuals who attempt the raw food diet is that of the fast food concept. This obstacle is not limited to fast food restaurants. Instead, the obstacle is characterized by all the foods sold in grocery stores and in restaurants that are highly processed and extremely quick to prepare.


Raw foods are more difficult to prepare because they require cleaning, chopping or slicing, seasoning and cooking. Foods such as potato chips, processed lunch meat, processed cheeses or other highly processed foods are convenient and easy to grab and eat on the go. Planning out your meals ahead of time is a great way to overcome this obstacle. When you plan each of your meals in advance, you will not be tempted to simply grab something that is highly processed and will negatively affect your health.
You can write out meal options at the beginning of the week and even prepare meals ahead of time and keep them in labeled containers in the refrigerator.

, The best way to ensure your success with the raw food diet is to rid your home of unacceptable food items.


If the foods are in your house, you will be more likely to slip up and eat them.
Our bodies can actually become addicted to the artificial and processed components of many processed food items. When we are exposed to these foods on a daily basis, we are more likely to consume them because of an intense craving or during a moment of weakness.
By eliminating these foods from your house, you will not be tempted to eat them every time you visit the kitchen.

,


One of the reasons why consumers fail when they try the raw foods diet is that they become burned out on the repetitious flavors and food items. Because you are severely limiting the types of food from which you can choose, it is easy to get sick of these food items if you don't use spices and flavors to add variety to your prepared meals.
There are many different spices that you can use to increase the variety of vegetables or other raw food items.
Variety will prevent you from getting frustrated with the raw food diet and giving up.

, Any diet is easier to manage if you have a reliable network of support that is as dedicated to your success as you are.


If you include your friends and family members in your determination to try the raw food diet, you can drastically improve your chances of success.
You may be even more likely to succeed if you and your family decide to try the raw food diet together.
When you are not alone in your attempts to revolutionize your nutrition, the process becomes much easier. Even if you are experiencing a bad day filled with temptation, your dieting counterpart may be able to encourage you to stick with the diet.

, Positive reinforcement is a great way to encourage yourself to continue with the raw food diet. During the transition to a raw food diet, your results may be too gradual for you to notice unless you keep a careful record of your daily experiences in a journal.


Begin keeping a journal a couple of weeks before you begin the raw food diet. In the journal, write down your daily meals, your energy levels, your weight, any negative health side effects, your sleeping habits and your mood.
When you begin the raw food diet, detail the changes in your journal. By going back and comparing your current situation to your health before the diet, you can see the dramatic changes that your body is experiencing.

Talk to your doctor.,
Recognize the possible risks of a ketogenic diet.,
Start with a general low-carb diet like Atkins to ease yourself into nutritional ketosis.,
Calculate your “macronutrients.” Macronutrients are nutrients which your body needs in large quantities, and they provide energy in the form of calories.,
Eat as much as 20 or 30 grams of carbs daily.,
Eat 2 – 8 ounces of protein several times a day.,
Eat fats with all your meals.,
Don’t stress too much about calories.,
Stay hydrated.,
Use a ketone meter to test whether you are in ketosis.,
Look for ketosis symptoms (also known as “keto flu”).,
Notice that your health has improved (after a few weeks).",How to Start a Ketogenic Diet for Weight Loss," Although the ketogenic diet is grounded in medical and nutritional fact, there is not a universal opinion in the medical community that the diet is effective for weight-loss. Your personal doctor will be able to advise you if the diet is a good fit for you personally.


Some sources view a ketogenic diet as an effective way to counter the symptoms of certain illnesses — such as epilepsy — rather than a weight-loss diet.If you are pregnant or diabetic, work with your doctor so they can monitor and adjust your medications while you follow this diet. If you are type-1 diabetic, seek permission from a doctor well-trained in nutrition before you start this diet.;
, A ketogenic diet — and putting your body into ketosis generally — presents risks for anyone who suffers from heart or kidney problems.If you are at risk for heart disease or kidney disease, avoid ketogenic diets.


A ketogenic diet prescribes moderate amounts of proteins, and large amounts of fats.
A ketogenic diet will also add strain to your kidneys. Protein-heavy foods increase the amount of calcium in your urine. This, in turn, can strain your kidneys and lead to the development of kidney stones.

, The Atkins diet is heavy on fats and proteins, low on carbohydrates, and will encourage your body to burn ketones for energy. Atkins is a decent “middle ground” between a regular diet (often high in carbs) and a low-protein ketogenic diet.


This step is optional, but may make the transitional period into a ketogenic diet easier.

, Calculating your macronutrient intake will let you see the current levels of your fat consumption. With this information, you can decide how to reduce your carb and protein consumption, and increase your fat consumption.


There are three types of macronutrients: fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Fats provide more calories per gram than either proteins or carbs.
There are many macronutrient calculators available online. You’ll need to input your height, weight, daily exercise, and dietary information.

, If you determine — through a macronutrient calculator — that you currently eat more than 30 grams of carbs daily, look for ways to decrease your carb intake. It’s crucial to avoid carbs on a ketogenic diet, as carbs easily convert into glucose, which keeps your body from burning ketones for energy.You should only receive about 5–10% of your daily calories from carbohydrates, by eating about 20 – 30 grams a day.Focus on getting your carbs through salad greens and non-starchy vegetables only.
Avoid carb-heavy foods like pasta and bread.

, Protein is a necessary part of your diet, and without proteins, you will have very little energy. You may also feel hungrier or develop food cravings throughout the day. However, too much protein will diminish the weight-loss effects of a ketogenic diet.You should aim to consume about 25 – 30% of your daily calories from proteins.The amount of protein you eat will vary depending on how much protein you require as an individual. This is often tied to lifestyle, whether active or sedentary.

, Fats are the cornerstone of the ketogenic diet, and will encourage your body to burn fatty ketones for fuel. Typically, calories from fat should comprise 80 – 90% of your meals.(However, you cannot eat unlimited fats on a ketogenic diet; the calories can still add up and cause weight gain.) Examples of fatty foods include:


Organic butter and lard
Coconut oil
Fatty cuts of organic, grass-fed meat.
Egg yolks and full-fat sour cream
Homemade mayonnaise
Heavy whipping cream and cream cheese
Avocados and bacon
Nuts and nut butters

, Unlike many other weight-loss diets, you do not need to actively keep track of the number of calories in the dishes you eat while on a ketogenic diet. Since a ketogenic diet reduces food cravings throughout the day, you’ll likely be less motivated to eat excess calories anyway.If you do want to track your calories, use the following breakdown as a guide (assuming that you’ll consume about 1,500 calories a day):1,050 calories from fat
300 calories from protein
150 calories from carbohydrates

, Once your body is in ketosis, your kidneys will begin to release excess water which your body had been retaining. This retained water is a consequence of a high-carb diet, and once you reduce your carb intake, water retention will decrease as well.As a consequence, you may need to increase your daily water intake to avoid dehydration.
Headaches and muscle cramps are a sign of dehydration. You may also need to increase mineral intake, especially salt and magnesium, as these are often lost when your body gets rid of retained water., A ketone meter will measure a small sample of your blood, calculate your blood sugar, and will inform you if your body is in ketosis.


Certain ketone meters test urine rather than blood; however, testing your blood is more accurate than testing your urine.
Ketone meters are commonly for sale at drug stores, and also online.
If you are in ketosis, your body will burn its fat reserves, and you will begin to notice weight loss., Within three to seven days of starting the diet, you may notice symptoms like: strong-smelling breath or urine; slight nausea; high energy and mental clarity; fatigue; or diminished appetite with no cravings.


If these symptoms last longer than a week, or increase in severity, you should visit your doctor. Severe nausea can lead to vomiting and dehydration, which are unhealthy when continued for multiple days.
Many of these symptoms will vanish once you become keto-adapted.
This symptom analysis can be performed in place of testing, if you are limited financially or do not want to test your blood or urine.

, This should also be accompanied by weight loss, and any bloating or inflammation which you had previously experienced will have improved greatly.

",How to Reduce Salt Intake to Lose Belly Fat," Processed foods contain salt not only for flavoring, but also as a preservative.


Processed foods include canned soups, processed lunch meat, frozen items and even canned vegetables.;
, Stick to fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains. Make your own salad dressing, too.


If you think you've eaten too much salt, consume fruits and vegetables that are high in potassium to balance it out. Foods high in potassium include apricots, avocado, bananas, milk, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, kiwi fruit, potatoes, spinach and tomatoes.

,


A food with less than 5 milligrams of sodium is considered sodium-free. A good guide is to aim for less than 140 milligrams per serving. Pay attention to serving size, too, as that can alter your sodium intake.
Choose fat-free or low-fat dairy products. Not only do they contain less sodium, but also less fat.
Stay away from smoked or salted fish. Choose fish that are packed in water, or fresh fish if it's available.

,, Leave salt out of everything you prepare yourself.


Season vegetables with vinegar or lemon juice. Or, add flavorful vegetables like onions and peppers to low-fat meats.
If you feel you must salt food while cooking, add it at the end because you will need less. The salt flavor leaves the food the longer it cooks and becomes less noticeable.

Include a variety of fruits and vegetables.,
Avoid bacon bits and croutons.",How to Stay Slim and Trim with Salads," This will allow you to easily absorb fat-soluble nutrients, which include many of the vitamins (A, D, E, and K, for example). It may seem counter-intuitive to encourage consuming fats in your salad dressing, but in fact this will help your body absorb necessary nutrients without giving you too much in the way of harmful fats.


If the meal contains another small dietary source of oil, you may forego dressing altogether and use lemon or lime juice as a healthful alternative.;
, Iceberg lettuce, spinach, romaine, arugula, and radicchio all have their own advantages, so using a combination lets you make the most of each of them. It also adds color and flavor that improve your salad. For the optimized nutrition intake, mix all of these in a same bowl of in everyday routine.


Emphasize darker greens like spinach, kale, and arugula, rather than iceberg lettuce, which has little nutritional content.
Add herbs like parsley and basil to get even more anti-oxidants and flavor from your salad.

, Cheese is a great source of calcium, and helps release the saturated fats in your food more quickly to make you feel more full. It looks and tastes great in salads, but don't overdo it. Use only small amounts of cheese and select types with low fat contents. Grated cheddar or parmesan, or small balls of mozzarella, can make a huge difference in your salad.

, Proteins release extra fats to make you feel satisfied, and they are an important part of your diet. Great sources of protein to add to your salad include salmon or chicken, tofu or edamame, seeds and nuts, and beans. Use a healthy serving size - don't overdo it - but make sure they're there!

, Different fruits and veggies contain different nutrients that you need, so the more you eat, the better. The variety of textures and tastes makes for a delicious and exciting salad. Vegetables like broccoli, cucumbers, carrots, and bell peppers work well together in a salad, and they're only enhanced by fruits like strawberries, pears, oranges, and raspberries.

, These have almost no nutritional content but add a lot of sugar and calories. Use walnuts or flax seeds for the same crunch without destroying the health factor.

Fasting diets like the Master Cleanse are not recommended for individuals with chronic health conditions or on certain medications.;
,


Because this diet is highly restrictive, it is important to understand exactly how the program works before beginning the Master Cleanse. Eliminating a step of the process or an ingredient in the recipe could have a direct impact on the success of the diet.

, All of the ingredients should be as fresh as possible when the drink is made.


You can mix up enough of the lemonade to last a full day (60 oz. at a time), as long as you keep it refrigerated. It is not recommended to make up more than one day's supply at a time, because the mixture can go bad quickly.

,


Some people experience potentially unpleasant side effects with the Master Cleanse, including headaches, diarrhea and nausea. Many also suffer from fatigue while on the diet, which can make it difficult to focus on tasks.
You may find it helpful to do the Master Cleanse over the weekend or during a time when you can be at home. As the body goes through the detoxification process, frequent trips to the bathroom are not unusual. You may also find that you need additional time to rest while using the Master Cleanse diet.

, If you have a regular exercise program, suspend physical activity during the program.


It is best not to try to exercise while participating in the program. Because of the extremely low caloric count you are consuming daily, your body is simply not receiving enough nutrition or energy for regular workouts.

, Most diet experts recommend a maximum of a 10-day program for the safest and best results. For quick weight loss, 10 days is a good amount of time. If you are using the diet for detoxification, 3 to 5 days is usually sufficient.

Consult with your doctor or health care provider before fasting.,

Make sure you know the physical effects you'll experience.,

Make sure you know the health concerns and benefits.",How to Prepare for Fasting," There are lots of great reasons to fast, even if you don't have a medical condition, but there are potential health risks involved and it's something you should discuss with a licensed professional before jumping off into the deep end of fasting.Some medications you take may have dangerous effects on your body during fasting due to changes in your blood chemistry.
Fasting may not be ideal for people experiencing health conditions such as pregnancy, advanced cancer, low blood pressure and more. If you have any medical condition, you should check with your doctor before fasting.
Your doctor may want to conduct a urine test or blood test before the fasting period.;
, There are hundreds of different fasting practices. Some include just drinking water, some include drinking juices (or clear liquids), some are for spiritual reasons, or for weight-loss reasons, or to help with a medical condition. You'll need to sort out which is the best choice for you.Water fasting is a more aggressive type of fasting and one of the harder types. You can do it anywhere from 1 to 40 days (although 40 is definitely pushing it and not recommended without a doctor's approval). 10 days is the recommended number of days for a water fast. You'll need to begin and end with a couple day juice diet. Distilled water is the best water to drink for a water fast.
The juice fast is one of the safer bets for fasting, because you're still getting nutrients from the juices you're drinking, so it isn't as aggressive as the water fast and is more recommended. 30 days is the standard for a juice fast. You'll want to drink all-vegetable and all-fruit juices (don't mix the two) and you can have herbal teas and vegetable broth as well. Make sure that you strain the juices to avoid the fibers that will make your digestive system work harder.
The Master Cleanse is a fast that is a mix between the water fast and a juice fast. You drink a mixture of freshly squeezed lemons, water and maple syrup for about 10 days. This is an easier fast because you will still be getting some calories (although not as many as you are used to).
Fasting periods can last anywhere from 1 to 40 days, depending on your specific goal and the kind of fast you're doing (juice fast, water fast, clear liquid fast, etc) because this will determine how your body is coping with having most of its calories taken away.

, Fasting is about eliminating the toxins that have built up in your body (it will do this even if you're fasting for religious or spiritual reasons) so you're going to need to be prepared for feeling ill and weak, especially at the beginning.


Fasting may cause side effects such as diarrhea, fatigue and weakness, increased body odor, headaches and more as a result of the detoxification process.
Consider taking time off from work or relaxing more throughout the day to accommodate the effects fasting has on your body.

, The more you reduce the garbage that you intake the easier the fast will be on you and your body. So gradually stop drinking alcohol and try to cut down on or stop entirely smoking.


This procedure will reduce any potential withdrawal symptoms you may experience during the fasting process, as well as reduce the toxins in your body that the fast is going to work to eliminate.
Habitual and addictive substances include alcohol; caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea and soda; cigarettes or cigars.

, As with removing addictive substances you're going to need to make a different in your diet so that your body won't have to work as hard to get rid of the toxins and bad substances that are so apart of eating these days.A good way to ease into this, is to eliminate a few things a day (refined sugar products in the first couple days, meat in the next couple, and then dairy, etc.).
Reduce your intake of chocolate and other foods that contain refined sugar and are high in fat, like sodas, chocolate, candy and baked goods.
Eat smaller portions of meals so that your digestive system doesn't have to work as hard, and so that your body starts to become accustomed to operating on fewer calories than it usually does.
Reduce your intake of meats and dairy products, because these can clog up your system and are harder for your body to digest.
Eat increased portions of cooked or raw fruits and vegetables. These will help your process better and have fewer toxins that it wants to get rid of.

, This is when you really want to make sure that your body is prepared and this is why people can't just jump into a fast without preparing ahead of time (or if they do, they have a much harder time during the fast itself).


Eat only fruit and vegetables, because they will cleanse and detoxify your body in preparation for the fasting period.

, Drink only water, fruit and vegetables juices made from fresh, raw fruits or vegetables. You'll need to up your liquid intake during the pre-fast to help keep your system hydrated and prepare it for being only on liquid for awhile.

, You don't want to do too much exercise, but you definitely will need to do some to make sure the lymphatic fluid keeps moving and the keep the vascular system is working properly. Do some slow yoga, or go for a moderate walk.


You're going to feel tired, even on the pre-fast diet, so be aware of that, but don't worry about it. Just adjust your normal levels of activity to accommodate that tiredness.

, Whether you get enough sleep and rest is going to determine how well you do on the fast and how well you recover afterwards. Make sure that you're getting enough sleep at night and make sure that you're taking it easy during the day.


This is why it's best to plan ahead for a fast, instead of jumping in headfirst. You'll need time to recover and to rest and so you'll need to make sure that you aren't having a super busy schedule.

, The fast tends to be most uncomfortable and difficult during the first couple days and those are usually the days when people give up, but if you power through them, you'll probably start to feel better from day 3 onwards, with occasional bouts into discomfort as your body heals and purges.In the first stage (usually days 1 and 2) of the fast you may experience headaches, dizziness, nausea, bad breath, and a heavily coated tongue. These are just the signs that your body is cleansing your system of toxins. You'll probably also be incredibly hungry during this stage.
In stage 2 (about days 3 to 7, depending on the fast)) your skin might become oily and you might start breaking out a little, but your body should start adjusting to the fast. Your sinuses might go from clogged to clear several times.
Eventually, in later stages, your bowels will release their load, which can come as diarrhea or loose stool and can contain lots of mucus, especially as you don't put anything into your body for several days. Your breath will keep smelling bad until your body has rid itself of toxins. You will also probably continue to experience low energy, as your body has fewer (or no) calories to keep it going.

, A lot of times people give up in the first couple days, because of discomfort and they think that it won't get better. Unless you're having a serious medical issue (which you'll need to talk to your doctor about), breaking your fast before the finish won't benefit your body at all. There are a few things to do to make sure that you complete your fast.


Set your objective. Before you start to fast, make a clear statement on why you're doing this fast. Is it for health reasons? Is it for religious reasons? Are you trying to clear your system out? Make this a clear statement and remind yourself of your objective in the hard moments of your fast.
Make a commitment. Sometimes it can help to get a friend or trusted family member to hold you to your fast commitment. It's harder to break a fast when someone is monitoring you.
Log your fast. As you're preparing for your fast, write down each day what you eat, how you feel, and what your objective is. Do this during the fast, so that you see how your body changes and processes the change and to keep you focused on why you're doing this.
Prepare yourself physically. This means following your doctor's advice and specifically following the pre-fast and fasting rules for your preferred fast. Deviating from these can make your fasting time much more difficult and uncomfortable.

, Although there may be good health reasons for fasting, it is not a good weight-loss tool, because so often you simple gain the weight right back once you finish fasting and you can't add the healthy exercising as well.Fasting can get rid of toxins, especially for people who have diets that are low in good nutrients, like processed foods. Fasting burns through fat, which is where the body stores a lot of toxins. Fasting, when combined with improved diet may eliminate lupus, arthritis and chronic skin conditions like psoriasis and eczema and may help heal the digestive tracts of those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and help lower blood pressure
Some things to watch out for are heartburn (the stomach will produce more acid during a fast when you think about food, or smell food) so if you take medication for indigestion, you should continue to take it. You can also have trouble with dehydration during a fast, so make sure that you drink extra water and fluids. Constipation can be troublesome, as well, as you won't be exercising as regularly (or eating foods that help constipation).People who shouldn't fast are those with compromised immune systems, diabetes, kidney problems, who are pregnant, who have cardiac arrhythmia, and so on.

Give yourself time.",How to Reduce Salt in Your Diet," Whenever you're monitoring your intake of certain nutrients or foods, it's important to get familiar with the food label on packaged items. You can figure out how much sodium is in foods and decide whether or not they're appropriate for your diet.


Reading the food label is very important when you're trying to limit sodium. The first thing you need to look at is the serving size. This will guide you when you're figuring out how much sodium or other nutrients are in the food.The total sodium amount is listed underneath ""total cholesterol"" and above ""total carbohydrates.""The amount of sodium listed here is for one serving. If you eat more than one serving, you'll need to multiply this number by however many servings you consume.
Foods that are labeled as low-sodium (usually advertised on the front of the package) cannot contain more than 140 mg of sodium per serving.;
, Most of the sodium in Westernized diets doesn't come from the salt shaker. Much of this nutrient is actually coming from restaurant foods — especially fried foods and fast foods.


Many foods from a fast food restaurant are high in sodium — especially if you get a meal or combo. You're not only getting sodium in the sandwich, but also from the fries or other sides you may consume.
Many fried foods also contain high quantities of sodium. About six mozzarella sticks have over 2,500 mg of sodium.Even fast food sandwiches that seem ""healthy"" like a turkey sandwich with cheese and bacon contain over 2,800 mg of sodium.Fast food sub places also can rack up high-sodium contents. Deli meats, processed meats and cheeses — especially when piled high on a sub roll — can total up to 1,500 — 3,200 mg of sodium., If you were to think of some of the foods with the highest amount of sodium, you'd probably think of canned foods and some frozen foods. And you'd be right: both of these foods can tip the scales in terms of sodium.


If you're choosing to purchase canned foods, always look for the words ""low-sodium"" or ""no salt added."" This generally means these foods are relatively low in sodium.
Note that if you're buying low-sodium canned soup, you need to make sure you only eat one serving of soup. Some soups have over 1,600 mg of sodium per serving.If you eat more than one serving, you're consuming more sodium than what's listed for ""one serving"" on the food label.
Frozen foods like frozen meals, pizzas, breakfast foods or veggie burgers also contain a high amount of sodium. Some frozen meals can contain up to 1,800 mg of sodium per meal.Again, it's important to look for ""low-sodium"" on these items as well.

, If you love having a ham and cheese sandwich at lunch, you may want to rethink your choice of deli meat. These types of meats in addition to other sources of processed meat is a major source of sodium.Limit or avoid deli meats like ham, turkey, roast beef, or pastrami. Three slices of deli turkey can have over 1,000 mg of sodium.If you do choose to have these items, look for ones that are labeled ""low-sodium.""
Also limit or avoid meats like sausage, bacon, hot dogs or canned meats. Again, these foods are high in sodium. One small hot dog has over 500 mg of sodium.Choose low-sodium options if available.

, Other common high-sodium culprits are snack foods. Whether it's a treat from a vending machine or items you purchase from the grocery store, many common snack foods are very high in sodium.Foods like chips, crackers, popcorn, salted mixed nuts and pretzels frequently have higher levels of sodium. In addition, these foods are generally higher in calories and fat but low in any valuable nutrition.
Salted nuts can have about 200 mg of sodium per ounce.In addition foods like potato chips, crackers and popcorn can have over 20% of your daily recommended allowance for sodium — about 500 mg per serving.
Although you may find some chips, crackers or popcorn without added salt, it's best to limit these foods anyways. Even low-sodium versions are still fairly high in calories and low in nutrients.

, You may be surprised to find out that grains — like breads or pasta — also contain high amounts of sodium. Be mindful when purchasing and consuming these foods.


One slice of bread can contain over 200 mg of sodium.If you're making a sandwich, which generally requires two slices of bread, your sodium intake is already up close to 400 mg. This is without the deli meat or cheese as well.
If you think you're making a better choice by choosing a tortilla or wrap, think again. A 6 inch tortilla has about 200 mg of sodium while a 10 inch tortilla has over 500 mg of sodium.Choose items with lower sodium content per slice, or choose to make a sandwich with only a half a slice of bread or make it open-faced.

, One particularly sneaky place that sodium frequently hides is in condiments, sauces, salad dressings and marinades. Make sure to thoroughly read the food label on these items so you know exactly how much sodium you're getting from these items.


Some of the sauces and condiments containing the highest amount of sodium include: pasta sauce, ketchup, hot sauce, salad dressings (especially light or fat-free dressings) and soy sauce.
Many common condiments, like ketchup and mustard, offer low-sodium options or ""all natural"" options that have considerably less sodium per serving. Regular ketchup can have 150 mg of sodium per tablespoon.If you purchase store-bought salad dressings, be wary that the fat-free or light versions typically have significantly more sodium than the originals. Stick to the original version or make your own at home.
Soy sauce is known for being high in sodium. Regular soy sauce packs about 1,000 mg of sodium per tablespoon.Limit the amount you use.

, Limiting or reducing the amount of sodium in your diet is common. Many people are looking to improve their diets or chronic health conditions by avoiding this nutrient. Speaking to your doctor can be helpful when reducing your overall sodium intake.


Since cutting sodium is a common practice and something frequently advised by physicians, your doctor can be a great source of guidance, advice and provide additional resources.
Also ask if reducing sodium is appropriate for you. Although it's typically safe, and even advised, there are some health conditions that require you to maintain a certain sodium intake.
Also consider speaking to a registered dietitian. These nutrition professionals can help design a low-sodium meal plan for you, give you low-sodium recipes and help teach you how to track your sodium intake.

, Another important part of following a low-sodium diet is tracking your foods and overall sodium intake. This can show you whether or not your diet is meeting your goal.


A good idea to start with is keeping a food journal. Start by noting the types of foods and amounts of them you eat on a typical day. Using a food journal app or online program, determine how much sodium you typically eat.
If your total sodium intake is under 2,400 mg on average each day, you're actually consuming an appropriate amount; however, if you're looking to decreasing your intake further or you're eating more than 2,400 mg, continue tracking your intake.
Set yourself a goal or limit for your sodium intake. It could be the recommended allowance of 2,400 mg or it could be lower like 1,800 mg daily.
Continue to track your intake and total intake over time. Total your sodium each day to see if your low-sodium diet is helping you meet your goals. If you keep going over your limit, recheck your food journal and identify sources of sodium in your diet and continue to work on cutting those foods out.

, If you want to cut out large quantities of sodium from your diet, consider making more meals and snacks at home. If you cook from scratch you can control the amount of salt and sodium-containing ingredients in your foods.


People who eat out on a regular basis ate 50% more calories, sodium and fat than those who ate meals at home.The occasional meal out isn't a big deal, but if you're eating on a regular basis, these restaurant foods are most likely a big source of sodium in your diet.
Cooking your meals at home allows you to choose what ingredients you use and to control how much added fat, sugar or sodium you add to your foods. You can choose to add little or no salt to items and only use ingredients that are low-sodium or have no sodium.
If you find yourself eating out frequently, start cooking one meal at home a week. Maybe you start by eating every breakfast at home. Then you can work on packing your lunch everyday and so on until you're preparing most meals at home.
Since eating out is fun and enjoyable for most people, give yourself a limit of how often you eat out so that you don't overdo it with sodium.

, Another sure-fire way to reduce the total sodium in your diet is by choosing more whole foods over processed foods.


Whole foods are considered minimally processed foods that have little or no added ingredients. Items like an apple, head of broccoli, a raw chicken breast or egg are considered whole foods. They go through minimal processing and have only one ingredient.Processed foods on the other hand generally have multiple ingredients, many additives and preservatives and are generally higher in sodium.Try to limit the amounts of foods and types of foods that you purchase that are processed or come in a box or package.
For example, instead of buying ketchup from the store, consider making your own from scratch. Or instead of buying salad dressing or pasta sauce at the store, make your own. You can even bake your own bread, roast your chicken or turkey for sandwiches or make your own ""freezer meals"" by freezing leftovers of your dinners.

, Although using salt at the dinner table or during cooking isn't the biggest source of sodium in most American's diets, it can still add unnecessary amounts of sodium to your overall diet.Consider getting rid of your salt shaker completely, as it can encourage you to add salt to meals that don't need it.


If you typically use salt to flavor your meals while cooking and add salt to your foods at the dinner table, consider choosing only one or the other. If you use salt during cooking, keep the salt shaker off the table.
If you enjoy salting your foods at the table, then do not cook with salt. You can measure out how much salt you're using per meal.
You can also use half the amount of salt you typically use in cooking or at the table to slowly bring down the amount of sodium you use.

, Salt provides a lot of flavor to foods, so if you're cutting down on the amount of salt you're using, you'll need to replace that with other flavors. Try cooking with fresh or dried herbs for an extra hit of flavor.


Both fresh and dried herbs are full of flavor. In addition, you can use as much as you want without needing to worry about how much sodium you're adding to foods — they're naturally sodium-free.
In particular, basil, garlic, turmeric, coriander and ginger have been shown to be the best herbs that pack the most flavor and help replace the taste of salt.Be sure to skip sodium-containing herb blends or seasoning blends. Check the label to make sure there is no sodium or MSG in the seasonings.

, In addition to herbs, certain spicy foods can help give foods a lot of flavor without having to add any sodium to the meal.


Both black pepper and cayenne pepper can add a kick of heat, but have been shown to be the best at reducing the need for salt.You may also want to consider adding a little low-sodium hot sauce to meals to add a kick to meals as well if you don't have any dried spices at home.

, In addition to spices and herbs, acidic foods or flavorings can really increase and brighten the flavor of many foods.


Try adding a splash of lemon juice, vinegar, lime juice or the juice from pickles or pickled vegetables.
Many times when you're cooking and think your meal or recipe needs some salt or is ""missing something"", adding a touch of something acidic like lemon juice fixes the problem. It's more flavorful and bright without added sodium.

, With any diet changes, it can take time to get used to new flavors, recipes or meal plans. The same goes with a low-sodium diet — you'll need to give yourself some time to get used to your new eating pattern.


Since salt provides a lot of flavor to many foods, you will most likely notice the lack of salt when you initially begin cutting it out.
It can take a few weeks for your taste buds and palate to adjust. But if you're patient and give yourself time, you'll notice eventually you adjust to your lower sodium diet. You may even become more sensitive to salty foods and dislike the foods you used to eat regularly.

Avoid foods that are rich in purine.,
Consume liquids that lower uric acid in your blood.,
Exercise regularly.,
Work with a trainer to design an exercise routine that is right for you.,
Start slow, and work your way into more challenging exercise regimens.,
Drink more water and less sugary drinks.",How to Prevent Gout Recurrence1," Purine is a chemical that is found in most foods. However, foods with high amounts of purine can cause your gout to flare up again. Because of this, try to avoid foods that are high in purine like:


Beer, anchovies, game meat, liver, mussels, livers, and sardines.
Look for foods that are very low in purine like spinach, mushrooms, beans, peas, cauliflowers, lentils, asparagus, red meats, fish, and chicken.;
, Water, dairy products, and coffee can help to dilute the uric acid in your blood. Drink plenty of liquid regularly.

, Being obese can lead to having gout. Because of this, it is important to exercise and keep off any excess weight you may have. Exercising regularly can also help to lower your cholesterol, improve your cardiovascular health, and lower your blood pressure.


Try to exercise for thirty minutes, five times a week., If you have not exercised frequently recently, a training coach can help you to create a regimen that will help you to lose and keep off the weight that may be playing a part in your gout recurrence.

, Stick to a pace that you feel comfortable with when you first begin exercising again; do not push yourself so hard that you injure yourself or lose steam.


For example, begin by walking on a flat surface for 150 minutes each week. The next week, try walking much more quickly for the same amount of time. The following week, try jogging slowly 150 minutes throughout the week., Drinking plenty of water each day will keep you hydrated and will help to dilute the uric acid in your system. Choose water rather than sugary sodas and other carbonated beverages.


While everyone requires a different amount of liquid to stay hydrated, adult males generally need to drink 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water each day, while adult females generally need 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water each day.

Complete your diet with low-fat proteins.",How to Plan a Low Calorie Diet," This will allow you to make sure a low-calorie diet is right for you, and to avoid any unwanted health complications. Ask your doctor specifically if you need to be concerned about high cholesterol or high blood pressure, as these may have an effect on how many calories you can safely cut you’re your diet., The key to losing weight on a low-calorie diet is to burn more calories daily than you take in.There are a number of calorie calculators (or websites that describe calculation methods) online. These are useful tools to calculate how many calories you should cut, and will let you take your lifestyle and activity level into account as well.Individuals who lead a largely sedentary lifestyle burn relatively few calories during the day compared with more active individuals.
If you are active during the day (work at a physically strenuous job or exercise frequently), you will need to cut fewer calories from your diet in order to lose weight.
Alternately, if you are largely sedentary (work at a desk and seldom exercise), you will need to cut more calories from your diet.

, Figure out how many calories you are currently eating on a daily basis to maintain your current weight — a good rule of thumb is to take your current weight (in pounds) and multiply that by 12.For example, a 180-pound man will need to eat about 2,160 calories a day (180 x 12 = 2,160) to maintain a weight. To begin your low-calorie diet, cut 15% of those calories.


So, if the 180-pound man is active and eating 2,160 calories a day, then he would cut out 324 calories from his daily intake, or 15% of 2,160.
If you lead a sedentary lifestyle, plan to cut closer to 25% of your daily caloric intake. The same man, if he is sedentary, would cut out 540 calories from his daily intake, or 25% of 2,160.
It’s important to cut the right amount of calories, but it’s just as important to eat a wide variety of whole, nutritionally dense foods. Eating a low-calorie diet of processed, unhealthy foods will lead to poor nutrition and hunger, making it hard to continue on the diet.

, This is relatively easy when you eat packaged food, since you can simply read the label. When you cook your own meals, estimating calories can be more complicated, although you still need to determine the calories you eat with every meal.


Check the labels on each individual ingredient you use, and use that to roughly calculate the calories in a meal. You will need to keep track of the amount of each ingredient you use, and then total the number of calories., Cutting calories takes daily dedication and planning, and a good way to do this is by physically journaling each day.Your diet will be more successful if you keep track of your daily calorie intake.


You’ll also be able to identify spots in your diet where you can cut further. For example, if you have a tendency to have a large dessert after dinner, or to have a calorie-heavy brunch on weekends, your food diary can help you identify and correct those trends.
Use a food tracker app on your smartphone, like MyFitnessPal, or a pen and paper journal.

, Just because you’ve chosen to cut 15% of your daily calories doesn’t mean you’re locked into this plan permanently. Keep an eye on your weight loss (assuming that you want to lose a certain number of pounds while on a low-calorie diet), and adjust your diet accordingly.If you’re losing weight too slowly, consider cutting an extra 5% of your calorie intake.
If you’re losing weight more quickly than anticipated, constantly hungry, or having difficulty maintaining the low-calorie diet, consider adding back 5% of your calorie intake.

, Exercising is a crucial part of weight loss, and should be paired with your low-calorie diet, especially if you have a sedentary lifestyle.To burn large numbers of calories, focus on aerobic exercises. Jogging or running and rowing are effective, as they raise your heart rate and circulation.
If you’re substantially reducing your calorie intake, you will have less energy to expend on exercise. Stop exercising immediately if you begin to feel light headed or nauseous.

, It’s important to eat nutritionally dense, whole foods while on a low-calorie diet.These types of foods help you feel fuller longer, compared to highly processed foods like chips, cookies, etc.


For example, instead of a sugary cereal for breakfast, have a bowl of oatmeal.
Grains such as brown or black rice are flavorful and provide great fiber.

, Vegetables are low in fat, often high in protein, and contain very few calories compared to proteins and carbs. Some vegetables, like broccoli, asparagus, celery, and cauliflower, actually burn more calories when your body digests them than they contain in the first place.Eating vegetables will make it easier to consume fewer calories in day, but still feel full at the same time.

, Decrease the amount of unhealthy fats (saturated and trans fats) you eat. Instead of saturated fats, choose unsaturated fats. Unhealthy fats are found in baked goods (look for the word ""hydrogenated"" on the label), in fatty meats, and in fried foods.


Only 20 – 35% of your daily caloric intake should come from fats.It is important to note that fats are still an important part of your diet and should not be completely eliminated.
Unsaturated fats include olives, nuts, and seeds, and oils made from these foods (such as olive oil).
To decrease sugar intake, drink water, flavored water, or tea instead of soda.
Since much of the flavor in fatty foods comes from the fat itself, cutting back on fat consumption can reduce the amount of flavor you eat. To counter this, especially if you’re cooking your own meals, try adding more spices for flavor.
While it’s fine to eat dairy and drink milk on a low-calorie diet, try to find low-fat dairy products., These complex carbohydrates will provide plenty of nutrition and energy, will keep you full in between meals, and are low in fat. Plan for carbohydrates to constitute 45 – 65% of your low-calorie diet.Complex carbohydrates often go well in soup. For example, a soup with brown rice and non-starchy vegetables will be high in complex carbs and low in fat.Water-dense foods like fruits, vegetables and soups are an excellent choice for those wanting to consume less calories, but still feel satisfied. The water in these types of foods helps fill you up without the added calories.
Try eating a broth-based (and not cream-based) soup before your dinner so you fill up on the soup before you start eating the calorie dense main dish.

, Instead of eating fatty red meats, focus on low-fat meats like poultry and fish.Protein provides much of your energy during the day. Eating fatty meats will increase your unhealthy fat intake, so limit fatty meats like bacon, sausage and 80/20 ground beef. Always trim off any visible fat.


10 – 35% of your daily calorie intake should come from proteins.Legumes like beans and lentils are also an excellent source of protein, and they contain relatively little fat."

Drinking two cold glasses of water before meals helps fill you up so that you eat less, and it can help you lose weight as part of a low-calorie diet.A fuller stomach and a higher calorie burn means a slimmer you. Does it get much simpler than that?


Men need to consume more water than women, in general. Men should aim for around 3 liters (13 cups) of water a day, and women 2.2 liters (9 cups) a day.Of course, the bigger you are (man or woman), the more water you need to drink.;
, We've all been there, and this happens to some of us after about practically every meal. We've filled up on our main meal, and now we're eyeing dessert – even if we're not technically that hungry. Before you slice into the chocolate cake, have a piece of fruit. Odds are your sugar craving may get sated.


Fruit contains fructose, which is a type of sugar, but it's a healthier sugar that won't spike your insulin as much and get turned to fat. Fruit also contains fiber and beneficial vitamins and minerals. The fiber will slow absorption of sugar to help you maintain normal blood sugar levels when compared to a typical dessert. Besides, you're supposed to get 4 servings of fruit a day., When your diet is full of greens, yellows, and oranges, you know you're getting plenty of fiber and other nutrients, and not a lot of simple carbohydrates and bad fats – that translates to fewer calories and weight lost. Five servings of veggies a day keeps your body running on premium fuel, keeping it full on lower-calorie foods, and may even help prevent disease.Not only are veggies great for you, but when you're eating them, you're not eating other things, like processed goods (chips, candies, etc.). And the greener the better – green beans, broccoli, kale, spinach, and green peppers are all chock-full of body-healthy and waistline-trimming benefits.

, Some people swear off carbs, and if you want to do so, great. You may experience swift weight loss results. But if that seems a little less than simple, just make sure your carbs are from whole grains. That is, you want brown carbs, not white. Think whole wheat pasta and bread, oatmeal, and quinoa. Avoid white bread, white rice, too many potatoes, and processed baked goods.


Simple carbohydrates, such as sugar, have the unfortunate tendency of spiking our insulin levels, raising our blood sugar, and making us fat. Complex carbohydrates, like whole grains, on the other hand, don't do this nearly as much. They're a good source of fuel and energy without the unnecessary sugar explosion.

, There are fats that are good for you, like the unsaturated kind found in olive oil, avocado, and nuts. These leave you sated (fat does a great job of filling us up) and don't spike your sugar levels, keeping your insulin levels steady (and thus avoiding weight gain).It's why the no-carb diets push eating lots of healthy fats; your body actually likes it. So instead of grabbing that low-fat granola, try a handful of nuts instead.


For a long, long time, fat has gotten a bad rap. The low-fat craze was huge and is still going strong. In reality, low-fat items have been processed with extra sugar to taste good (by and large, anyway), removing their ""healthy"" label. New research is springing up all over the place that fatty items, like red meats and cheeses, may not be that bad for us., Protein is the building blocks of the body. Without protein, your body can't repair itself and get through the wear and tear you put on it every day. Carbohydrates are fuel that your body turns to sugar when not used. When your body has no carbs to run on, it turns to fat and then to protein. Cut out the carbs, and your body will start burning your fat stores. And what should you replace carbs with? Protein – the ultimate tummy filler and muscle builder.


One simple step you can take to eating healthier and losing weight is to cut out your lunchtime sandwiches and replace them with either a hearty salad or chicken or fish. Even just skipping the side of french fries can do your body good, though it's best if you can replace it with nuts or cheeses to keep your body feeling fueled. If losing weight isn't a good enough reason to cut the carbs, know that it can also severely reduce your risk of getting diabetes., How great would it be if you could lose weight by just eating more often? If you do it right, it could work. Eating more often (smaller meals with snacks in between) keeps us full and away from unhealthy cravings, prevents the binge, helps us feel satisfied, and may even lead to benefits like a reduction in cholesterol.As long as you're eating healthy, of course!


This is only effective if you're not eating more. Make sure that if you start snacking, your actual meals become a bit smaller. Your general caloric intake should remain the same, if not a bit lower.

, One of the simplest ways to stay on your dieting regimen is to plan out what you're going to eat through the course of the week. You go to the grocery store and buy everything on your list (for your healthy meals), and there are no surprises because you're sticking to your plan. Tempted to order pizza? Nope – you know you have that salmon in the fridge just waiting to be eaten.


This helps you stay at home, too. Going out to restaurants is a huge culprit in the obesity epidemic. Portions are huge, calorie counts are huge, there's added sugars and salts, and it's too easy to go overboard without realizing it. When you cook at home, you control every calorie that goes into your dishes.

, Another easy trick to losing weight doesn't even deal with things you can't eat. In fact, nothing is off limits. All you have to do is watch your portions. A few bites of that chocolate cake is okay, but the whole slice? Nope, you'll pass. You got your fix. Talk about will power!


To keep on the portion train, aim to eat half of your meal and box the rest up for leftovers. If you get hungry, you can eat it – or you can save it for tomorrow. It's easy on your budget, too.

, How many times have you been guilty of staying up late, having an extra drink, or snacking the night away without even really thinking about it? Most of us have and it's a regular habit. However, if your dieting plan is to ""not eat after 8 pm"" that cuts out a lot of potential eating. You eat whatever you want throughout the day, but you cut yourself off. That could be thousands of calories you're missing out on, and some serious weight lost.


The main struggle with this aspect of dieting is that it gets difficult socially. You want to go out and drink and eat and have a good time, but it's hard with a glass of water in front of you. This comes down to your will power. If you can't do it, try to come up with a compromise. Allow yourself diet soda or tea and veggies after hours, for example. That way you don't feel as excluded when you're out with friends.

, Five days a week, put some serious work into your diet. Here are examples for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.


For breakfast, eat a bowl of oatmeal with low-fat milk with a few raisins or cranberries. You may also opt for a couple of eggs, a piece of fruit, or a piece of whole wheat toast with almond or peanut butter.
For lunch, include a lean protein like chicken or fish, with plenty of vegetables (or a salad) with beans or sprouts (a great fiber source), and an optional piece of fruit.If you need a drink other than water, go for unsweetened teas or juices.
For dinner, have a bowl of broth-based soup, a wrap or half a sandwich, brown rice or quinoa, and more fruits and vegetables (fresh, ideally).
Snacks should be protein and calcium rich, like nuts, cheeses, or yogurt.

, It is recommended to get 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise or 75 minutes per week of vigorous exercise. You can do it all at once or divide it up into 5-minute chunks or anything in between. A mixture of weight-training and cardio is best.Sprinkle into your normal routine activities like fast walking or running, swimming, or cycling. Keep in mind that everyday activities, like walking the dog, vigorously cleaning the house, and gardening count, too.

, You've put a lot of hard work into the week, and here is your reward. Don't gorge yourself, but do treat yourself to whatever you've been craving. And don't feel guilty about it – there's a lot of science to back up the idea of calorie cycling, or eating more one or two days a week.Use Saturday night to be your go-out night, where you can finally hit up that restaurant you've been dying to go to. Getting the craving out will keep you from rampaging through the kitchen and eventually destroying all the progress you've made.

, Sometimes when a diet suits you, it becomes simple. No-carb can be really easy if you love meat and cheese. Low-cal can be easy if you adore fruits and vegetables. Take a look through the articles on wikiHow (or the linked comprehensive guide) and see if something calls out to you that you think you could be successful with.


What it comes down to is that we're all different. Even twin studies support the idea that we all respond to diets differently (and that certain types of dieting can actually be bad for us).So if one diet doesn't work for you, it may just be because you're body doesn't jive with it, not because you're meant to be bigger. Keep trying, and you'll find something manageable.

Be Overweight


The first step for losing weight with the HCG diet is to have weight to lose.,
Have the Desire To Lose Your Extra Weight


It's one thing to be overweight, but it's a completely different different thing to actually want to lose that extra weight.,
Buy Your HCG Drops


There are dozens of HCG suppliers out there, but some of them offer better quality products than the others.,
Begin Taking Your Drops


The HCG drops do not need to be mixed.,
Start The Fat Loading Stage


This stage is very important, so please don't skip this.,
Begin The 500 Calorie Diet

500 Calories A Day Without HCG Drops


The last 3 days of your 500 calorie a day diet will be without taking the drops.,
Maintenance


Congratulations!,
What's Next?",How to Lose Weight With the Hcg Diet," The main focus of the HCG diet is healthy weight loss, and it is counter productive if you don't have the weight to lose.;
, Dieting is difficult, and while the HCG diet is one of the simplest diet programs around, it still requires the dedication to actually want to get rid of your fat.

, Do your research and find the most suitable supplier with the highest quality product.

, They are to be taken 3 times a day, before meals. Try not to eat for 15 minutes after taking your drops, though. Each dose is .38 ml under your tongue. Some companies only supply a small dropper, leaving you to guess, and often resulting you in running out of HCG before you should. The higher quality companies will supply you with a clearly marked oral syringe, making measuring your dose extremely easy.

, For the first 2 days of taking the drops you will be consuming full portions of high fat foods, such as: eggs, avocado, dairy, nuts, fatty fish, and olive oil. This loads your normal fat cells, preparing your body to burn off the abnormal fat you are trying to get rid of. The average American diet is sufficient for this stage, but stay away from fried foods and fast food.

, You will remain on 500 calories a day for the remainder of the diet, save for the last 3 days of drops, which we will cover in the next step. There is a plethora of cook books and recipes available specifically for use on the HCG diet. Acceptable foods could include lean beef, chicken, lean fish, egg whites, citrus, green vegetables, shrimp, etc.

, This step is to clear the HCG from your system, and prepare you for your maintenance phase.

, You made it through the most difficult part, but you aren't out of the woods quite yet. You lost all that weight in such a short amount of time, but this next step is to make sure it remains gone. For 3 weeks, you will bump your caloric intake up to 1500 calories a day. This is to train your body to remain at it's current weight and to prepare your body to reintroduce starches into your diet.

,


You have a couple options now. If you are happy with your new weight, you can begin to reintroduce healthy carbs back into your diet. If you still have more weight you would like to lose, you can start the diet again from the start (the fat loading stage) Be wary though. If you have been on the drops for 40 days or more, you will need to wait 30 days before you can begin taking the drops again.

Eat the correct amount of the essential macrobiotic food groups.,
Prepare and consume the food mindfully and with a positive attitude.,
Chew the food thoroughly to optimize digestion. 

,
Prepare the grains using a pressure cooker.,
Steam or stir-fry vegetables, or consume them raw.,
Prepare the protein by baking or lightly sauteing.,
Make miso soup, which is a common soup in the macrobiotic diet.,
Prepare sea vegetables including Nori and kelp.",How to Prepare a Macrobiotic Diet," Electric stoves, microwaves and plastics can have negative effects on the food you cook. It is necessary to acquire utensils that will have minimal negative impact on the energy stored in the food. It is best to use a gas stove, cast-iron pans, a pressure cooker for grains, stainless steel, wood, glass, and ceramic utensils and bowls. Cooking this way will help preserve the natural energy and nutritional value in the food, which will then be more efficiently absorbed into the body.;
, Buying in bulk can save a lot of money and time when shopping, and it can assure that you always have something to eat. It can be a challenging task to find a wide variety of organic vegetables from season to season. Seasonal foods are more nutritious because they grow in fertile soil and aren't doused with pesticides and other chemicals.

Purchase grains such as short-grain brown rice, quinoa, corn, millet, barley, rye, buckwheat and oats.






Shop at local farmer's markets and the organic section of the local grocery store for in-season organic vegetables.







, The macrobiotic diet has relatively specific proportions. The percentages are broken down as follows - 50 percent grains, 25 percent in-season vegetables, 10 percent protein, 5 percent soups, 5 sea vegetables and 5 percent nuts and fruits. Aim to consume 50 percent of your diet from grains, 25 percent from seasonal vegetables, 10 percent from protein, 5 percent in soups, 5 percent from sea vegetables and 5 percent from nuts and fruits.

, If you prepare food under stress or aggravation, the negative vibrations can resonate and affect the meal.

,, The steaming process and fast cooking time helps maintain the nutrients in the grain.

, Don't boil or bake vegetables as that can diminish their nutrient content.

, Sources of protein include beans, lentils, tofu, chickpeas and occasionally fish. Do not heavily season the protein. You can boil lentils, beans and chickpeas. Tofu should be stir-fried and not heavily oiled.

, This soup can be made from scratch, and there are many recipes available. It includes fermented soy (miso), mushroom and spices. The simple ingredients provide many vitamins and minerals needed for a healthy mind and body. Be sure to not over-season and use organic ingredients when making the soup.

, These nutrient-rich underwater plant sources can be used in salads, with rice dishes or eaten by themselves.

Most typical cabbage soup diet recipes have a variety of vegetables, large quantities of cabbage, water or broth and tomato juice.Some recommend different seasonings or provide seasoning suggestions to help make the soup more flavorful or palatable.
Since most cabbage soup diets suggest eating large quantities of this soup, you may need to make several batches or one very large batch of soup.

, Depending on the particular cabbage soup diet you follow, you may choose to replace all or just some of your meals with your cabbage soup.


Some diets suggest that you only eat a mixture of fruits, vegetables and your soup for the first few days. Then meat and other foods are slowly added back in.Other diets suggest completing swapping out two to three meals with cabbage soup for the first few days and then adding back other foods slowly.

, If you're allowed to include some meals on your cabbage soup diet, choose lower calorie, nutritious meals to complement your diet.


Meals should range between 300 – 500 calories total. This will depend on what diet you're following and your total daily calorie allowance.
Be sure to include lean protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. These foods together will make up a balanced meal., In addition to being a healthy choice, many cabbage soup diets don't allow for any other beverages outside of sugar-free, decaffeinated liquids.Most health professionals will recommend that you drink between eight to 13 glasses of water daily.Stick to allowed beverages during your diet. These typically include: water, unsweetened decaf tea and coffee, 100% cranberry juice or 100% tomato juice., Some of the cabbage soup diets promote very low calorie and very low carbohydrate diets.

Soups are notoriously high in sodium. You can choose homemade and low-sodium options to reduce your salt intake, but if your body has trouble processing sodium, it's best to avoid soup diets altogether.
Congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and chronic kidney disease make it difficult for your kidneys to process sodium. Additionally, excess sodium can actually contribute to heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and congestive heart failure.Additionally, the cabbage soup diet and other soup diets low in carbohydrates are considered dangerous for individuals with diabetes.People with diabetes need to be on a set meal pattern in which carbohydrates are consistent at each meal. If you have diabetes, you should not attempt any ""fad"" diet.

, The cabbage soup diet can help you lose up to 10 lb (4.5 kg) in one week.While most people can follow this diet for one week with only limited risk to their health, it is important that you follow this diet for only one week.


Cabbage soup diets are low in protein, complex carbohydrates, and other vital nutrients. In addition to losing fat and water weight, you'll likely lose lean tissue following this diet. Since you'll lose nutrients and muscle while on this diet, following it for more than one week can result in moderate to severe health problems.Due to its short-term nature, cabbage soup diets have no long-term effect on heart disease, cholesterol, or blood pressure.You should also avoid following any other fad diets extremely low in calorie immediately after ceasing the cabbage soup diet since your body will need to replenish the lost nutrients., While soup diets don't often present a serious risk to most healthy individuals, it's always a good idea to check with your doctor before starting a major weight loss program like this. Checking with your doctor is especially important if you have any pre-existing conditions, but it's still a good idea even if you have no known issues.


Your doctor should be able to work with you to determine if a soup diet is a good choice for your health needs. Additionally, your doctor may also be able to help you determine the safest way to attempt a soup diet.
Seeking advice from a registered dietician is also a good idea, but do so only after checking with your doctor first. Your doctor will help you determine if the diet is safe for you; a registered dietician can then help you determine the healthiest options for your soup diet.

, Canned soup and cabbage soup diets are classified as fad diets. While canned soup diets may offer more potential long-term benefits than cabbage soup diets, you should supplement either one with long-term lifestyle changes, including nutritional food choices, moderate exercise, and adequate sleep.It can be easy to regain lost weight after you stop your soup diet. As such, relying solely on soup diets or other fad diets can result in yo-yo dieting or weight cycling, which can have negative effects on your health, including a loss of white blood cells, higher blood pressure, higher cholesterol, and an increased risk of gall bladder disease.If you choose to follow a soup diet, reduce the risk of weight cycling by maintaining healthy long-term lifestyle choices.

Black Forest Ham (4.5 grams total fat, 290 calories when served on a 6-inch nine-grain wheat bread with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and cucumbers, with no cheese or dressing)Oven Roasted Chicken (5.0 grams total fat, 320 calories when served on a 6-inch nine-grain wheat bread with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and cucumbers, with no cheese or dressing)Rotisserie-Style Chicken Chicken ( 6.0 grams total fat, 350 calories when served on a 6-inch nine-grain wheat bread with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and cucumbers, with no cheese or dressing)Roast Beef (5.0 grams total fat, 320 calories when served on a 6-inch nine-grain wheat bread bread with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and cucumbers, with no cheese or dressing)Subway Club (4.5 grams total fat, 310 calories when served on a 6-inch nine-grain wheat bread with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and cucumbers, with no cheese or dressing)Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki (4.5 grams total fat, 370 calories when served on a 6-inch nine-grain wheat bread with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and cucumbers, with no cheese or dressing)Turkey Breast (3.5 grams total fat, 280 calories when served on a 6-inch nine-grain wheat bread with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and cucumbers, with no cheese or dressing)Veggie Delite (2.5 grams total fat, 230 calories when served on a 6-inch nine-grain wheat bread with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and cucumbers, with no cheese or dressing);
, In order to keep to the 6 grams of fat maximum, you should choose one of the low-fat bread options. You'll also want to choose low-fat and low-calorie contents. There are numerous bread choices that fall under 6 grams of fat, but it's worth remembering that your fillings and toppings will add some fat and calories to your sandwich. The six-inch breads that fall under 6 grams of fat are:


Nine-Grain Wheat Bread (2.0 grams total fat)Flatbread (4.5 grams total fat)Hearty Italian Bread (2.5 grams total fat)Honey Oat (3.0 grams total fat)Italian (White) Bread (2.0 grams total fat)Multigrain Flatbread (4.5 grams total fat)Parmesan Oregano Bread (2.5 grams total fat)Roasted Garlic (2.5 grams total fat)Sourdough Bread (3.0 grams total fat)Garlic Bread (2.5 grams total fat)Mini Italian (White) Bread (1.5 grams total fat)Mini Wheat Bread (1.5 grams total fat), There are numerous vegetable options at the Subway counter.

In order to achieve the desired nutritional value of being under 6 grams of fat, it's best to avoid most dressings and cheese slices.Vinegar, spices, and mustard are all low-fat, low-calorie options that can add flavor to your sandwich.

, Ordering sweetened drinks, cookies, or chips can quickly derail your diet. Choose a low- or no-calorie beverage (such as unsweetened tea or water with lemon). If your sandwich is not quite enough food, have a piece of whole, fresh fruit as a snack., In order for any diet to be successful, the goal is to burn more calories than you consume each day. This creates what is called a ""caloric deficit.""The total caloric intake on the Subway Diet will vary, depending on which bread, vegetables, and meat (if any) you add to your sandwich.

, Walking was part of the original Subway Diet. In addition to eating low-fat Subway sandwiches, the diet requires regular exercise. The Subway spokesman who pioneered the Subway Diet walked 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) each day while keeping his fat and calorie intake low.How many calories you burn while walking will depend on how far you walk, how fast you walk, and how much you weigh.A 160 pound (73 kg) individual who walks for one hour at 2 mph will burn 204 calories. At 3.5 mph, that individual would burn 314 calories.A 200 pound (91 kg) individual who walks for one hour at 2 mph will burn 255 calories. At 3.5 mph, that individual would burn 391 calories.A 240 pound (109 kg) individual who walks for one hour at 2 mph will burn 305 calories. At 3.5 mph, that individual would burn 469 calories., While the diet's pioneer and Subway spokesman consumed fewer than 1,200 calories each day, many medical experts caution caution against a diet so low in calories. Aim for at least 1,200 calories per day to prevent a deficiency in iron, calcium, and protein, and to prevent slowing down in your metabolism.The diet's pioneer lost 245 pounds.However, Subway cautions that these results are not typical.Talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian before beginning this or any other weight loss plan.

Give up the junk food.,
Enjoy your fruits and vegetables.,

Eat whole grains.,
Get a recipe book.,
Above all else, the Asian diet advocates clean living, balanced eating, and a healthy lifestyle.",How to Lose Weight with the Asian Diet," These foods are highly processed and contain large amounts of fats, sugars and oil. This is a very important step as nearly all diets require it, and if you can't accomplish this, then it's safe to say that no diet will work for you.;
, These make up a large part of the Asian Diet, so get to know them really well. Asians usually eat fruit as a snack or right before a meal (as it aids digestion). Vegetables are usually cooked as part of a stir-fry dish, or eaten as an appetizer.

, There are many problems with the Western diet, but the biggest problem I see is that it contains far too much meat. You actually don’t need to eat very much meat at all to meet your nutritional needs. Chinese health experts recommend eating 3-4 ounces of meat per day.

, Rice has been the staple grain across Asia for thousands of years. There are many kinds of rice available in grocery stores and supermarkets, but you will usually have to decide between brown rice and white rice. The difference between these two is akin to the difference between whole wheat bread and white bread. Brown rice is more nutritious and leaves you feeling full for longer, but is harder to digest and has a shorter shelf life. There are also many other types of grains eaten as part of the Asian diet, such as barley and oat.

, One of the most enjoyable things about the Asian diet is that you get to create your own meals. If you have little experience cooking Asian meals, it’s best to buy a recipe book (or download an ebook) containing simple and healthy Asian recipes suited for beginners. You’ll find that most recipes are actually very simple in nature (sometimes even more so than the recipes you’re used to!).

, Few other diets support such a natural way to go about things, but this has been the tried and true method for thousands of years. In our modern world, this becomes even more important. Get started today, and experience its benefits for yourself.

Understand one single and very real fact.,
Do not shame yourself into exercising or eating healthier.,
Be kind to yourself.,
Focus on becoming healthy rather than on losing weight.,
Find time to do workouts during the day.,
Do multiple short spurt of workouts spread across your day.,
Join a weekend yoga, dance, zumba or aerobics class.,
Have fun by adding variety to your workouts.,
Do not overdo your exercising.,
Download an app for recording or write note in your diary of everything you consume every day.

,
Count your calories.,
Observe your hunger patterns.,
Read the ingredients of everything you buy.,
Reduce processed food in your kitchen as much as possible.,
Stock your kitchen with fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, nuts, whole grains, edible seeds.,
Start your day with a hearty, balanced breakfast.,

Add salads to your meals.,
Eliminate the three whites from your life as much as possible.,
Be mindful while eating.,
Plan your meals in advance.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Do not compromise on your sleep.",How to Lose Weight While Living a Busy Life," It is this: There will never be time unless you make it.;
, Shaming never works long term and can actually have very negative consequences, such as resenting the diet or stubbornly refusing to participate any further in something that causes you to feel so ashamed.

, Nobody is perfect and there will be times in any person's diet when slip-ups occur. This is normal and easily remedied––when you slip and go back towards working your goal, be kind and realize it for the tiny detour that it is on your longer journey towards well-being.

, By shifting the focus from ""diets"" to ""healthy lifestyle approaches"", you will feel more inclined to take care of yourself and take the changes gradually rather than trying to fix things instantly with a sure-to-fail diet.


Turn living a healthy lifestyle into a mantra.

, Simple but effective changes to your daily schedule can include:


Wake up 10 minutes earlier in the morning. This will give you time to do some basic stretches.
Use the stairs instead of the elevators where possible.
Make time for a short walk during lunch but do not skip your lunch!
Get off an earlier bus stop or park further away, so that you have to include a walk to get home or to your car.
Go for a short walk post dinner as well.

, These workouts can be as short as 10 minutes and they are as beneficial as spending an hour at the gym. So skip, run upstairs, running, swimming, cycle, squats, pushups etc. Think of creative ways to do a workout in your environment.

, Anything that you like. Or take up a sport instead. Not only will you get exercise but you always have the potential to make new friends at these occasions.

, Doing the same thing day after day not only gets boring, but stops having any effect. Switching it up by mixing the exercise forms is a way to keep you anticipating the workouts rather than dreading them, and will work out different parts of your body.

, Too much of anything in life is excess. It is also important to have a day set aside each week dedicated simply to rest. This gives your muscles time to recover and reduces the risk of injury.

,, Consuming too many calories is as harmful as having too few.


If you really hate counting calories, learn to judge portion sizes for healthy, nutritional foods.

, This will help you to plan your meals around when you are most likely to feel the hungriest. Shifting a mealtime to suit your body's natural rhythm can be a really good way of staving off snacking and feeling bad. The important thing is to tune into that rhythm.

, A lot of processed food is loaded with sugar and salt. Try to cut down on processed foods and eat more wholefoods in your daily portions.

, Such foods are dense on calories and have nothing healthy about them.

, Just as with candies, if the healthy foods are there, you'll snack on them (just don't have those candies there).

, It is the most important meal of the day because it restores your energy after sleeping. It helps you kick start your day and helps to reduce any sugar cravings.

, This means: Breakfast, mid morning snack (fruits, nuts, milk, smoothie without sugar, etc.), lunch, afternoon/early evening snack and dinner. Smaller and frequent meals keeps you full and reduces sugar and junk cravings., Toss those dressings though, as they contain a lot of fat and sugar, empty calories. Add a dash of lime or Greek yogurt as a dressing instead.

, These are: plain/all-purpose flour (and its products like cakes, white breads, croissants, etc), white sugar and white rice. Try to replace them with healthier options like wholewheat flours, buckwheat flours, brown rice, quinoa, and honey.

, If you eat in front of a TV, you are bound to overeat or eat junk, as it's a mindless activity with your attention focused elsewhere. Make it a rule that it's only certain healthy snacks that you can have, or discrete portions––don't leave the whole package or plate of snacks out to dip into. Have plenty of green tea, de-caffeinated tea or coffee, water or water flavored with citrus slices. Often the action of drinking calorie-free drinks can be sufficient to keep you content––try it for a few nights in a row before considering it unlikely.

, Cook at least few meals and snacks in advance and keep in your fridge for the times when your are too tired to cook and are most likely to reach for junk. Cut up carrot and celery sticks, freeze half a healthy lasagna made from doubling up a recipe or keep healthy leftovers ready for reheating.

, Keeping your body hydrated is a must. Its flushes out the toxins from your body and also helps your muscles work better., If you do not sleep enough, your body does not get time to recover from the day's activities. A lack of sleep will also lead to cravings.

Rate your hunger on a scale of 1 to 10.,
Avoid waiting until you’re starving to eat something.,
Eat when you’re slightly hungry and stop when slightly full.,
Drink water when you feel hungry.,
Ask yourself if you’re really hungry before you snack.",How to Lose Weight with Mindful Eating1," Take a minute to think about how hungry you are, with one being “starving” and upset about it and ten being “so full you’re about to fall into a food coma.” Pay attention to your more moderate hunger pangs and feelings of fullness. This would be about a three (“I am ready to eat”) and a six (“I’ve eaten enough to feel satisfied”) on the scale., Never wait until you’ve hit the dreaded one on the hunger scale to start your meals! At this point, you’re hungry enough that you’re going to stuff food in your face just to fill your rumbling and rebellious stomach. Before you know it, you’ll be at the other end of the scale.Waiting until you’re starving to eat can cause you to binge and eat way more than you need. This is the kind of eating that causes weight gain, so avoiding it should help you begin to move in the opposite direction.

, Aim for three to start eating and six to stop. This means that you’re allowing yourself to pay more attention to the food than your hunger pangs or painful fullness., Sometimes, you’ll mistake thirst for hunger. When you start feeling hungry, drink a glass of water. If you feel satisfied, you may just have gotten your body signals crossed.If you still feel hungry twenty minutes after you drank water, either have a healthy snack or get ready to have a full meal.

, Step away from the pantry. Take a minute to question whether you actually want food.Being mindful about your snacking habits will eventually help you overcome emotional eating.You may need to ask yourself this question out loud to make it effective. You can even refer to yourself in the third person, saying something like: “Jenna, do you really want that cookie right now?”
If the answer is “yes,” ask yourself why. Especially when you’re starting out, you may need to have a whole conversation with yourself to get to the root of your cravings and resist them.
Mindful eating is especially effective at dealing with cravings, especially if you work at it. Given that cravings can be a major source of weight gain for a lot of people, nipping these in the bud is super important when you’re trying to lose weight.

Use a timer to eat for at least 20 minutes.,
Take small bites and completely chew your food.,
Switch your utensil to the other hand if you’re going too fast.,
Eliminate distractions while you eat.,
Notice details about your food to enjoy it fully.",How to Lose Weight with Mindful Eating2," If you can take longer, that’s even better! It takes at least twenty minutes for your brain to tell your body that you’re full. If you’re finishing your meals faster than that, you’re missing out on crucial signals that may be telling you to eat less.Use a kitchen timer, your smartphone, or a wristwatch to keep track of the time.
You should begin to notice that you’re naturally eating less. These smaller meals should really help you lose weight.

, To slow down your eating, cut your food into very small bites. Eat these bites one at a time, and chew each one completely. Take a sip of water when you’ve swallowed your food.You don’t have to count your chews, but you can if you’re struggling to slow down. Try for 30-40 chews per bite for weightloss., If you’re right-handed, move your fork or spoon over to your left hand. (Vise-versa for lefties.) You’ll automatically slow down, and you’ll focus more on your meal as you try to avoid spilling it on the table!, Don’t eat in front of the TV or browse through the internet on your phone while you eat. Instead, have your meal at a table dedicated just to eating. Turn your attention away from the world and pay attention to what’s on your plate.If you don’t have space for a table meant only for eating, use a countertop in your kitchen. You can also use the coffee table in your TV room, but resist the urge to turn it on while you’re eating.

, Think through the food’s journey to your plate, from its place in the field, to the sun and rain that made it grow, to the harvest.Pay special attention to texture, taste, smell, and color.As you think about your food and what it took to get it you, you’ll eat more slowly, appreciate how the food is making you feel, and stop as soon as you’re satisfied.

You can also keep a food journal to get in the habit of pausing to ask questions about your food. If you don’t want to write in it while you’re eating, make entries after you’ve finished your meals.
It may seem a little weird that you’re supposed to appreciate food more to eat it less. But because mindful eating is all about taking the time to enjoy meals, you should eat smaller (but better) meals naturally.

"
"
Eat balanced meals to feel full.,
Plan to indulge at special events.,
Think about eating out ahead of time.,
Travel with healthy snacks.",How to Lose Weight with Mindful Eating3," Foods that contain fibers, healthy fats, and proteins are especially good for making you feel full. Get fiber from vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. Eat avocados, nuts, nut butters, and olive oil to add healthy fats to your meal. Choose lean proteins like chicken and fish.For an example of a balanced dinner, try some grilled chicken marinated in olive oil, rosemary, a pinch of sea salt, and ground pepper. Slice up some avocado to go on top. Have some quinoa or brown rice, and finish it off with about a cup (236.89 mL) of steamed lima beans (a great source of fiber).

, Maybe you’re going to a baseball game, carnival, or wedding. This is the time to plan to have some popcorn, cotton candy, or cake. Eat these unhealthy (but delicious) foods mindfully as well, and notice how much more you enjoy them!, Social situations can be especially hard to handle when you’re trying to lose weight. Look up the menu and pick a meal before you arrive. Eat slowly at the restaurant, and box it up when you feel full.If you can’t find anything healthy on the menu, eat a small meal before you go out. You can then just get an appetizer, or only eat half of an entrée.Don’t feel weird about eating slowly in front of your friends, family members, or a date. If they ask about it, tell them about mindful eating. It’s a perfect time to talk about something that’s making you feel healthier with people that are close to you!

, Traveling when you’re working on weight loss is also tough. Bring along small, balanced snacks when you’re getting from place to place. If you can, book hotels with small kitchens to make your own meals. Search online before you depart to find healthy eating-out and grocery store options.For healthy snacks, go with a piece of fruit or an almond butter sandwich on whole-grain bread.

Stay patient as you adjust.,
Practice to develop your new mindset.,
Find a buddy to eat mindfully with you.,
Discuss your new habits with friends and family.",How to Lose Weight with Mindful Eating4," If you feel like you’re not “hearing” your body’s signals at first, don’t get frustrated. It may take some time before you’re fully tuned in. No matter what, be sure to eat slowly and pause after 20-30 minutes during meals to ask yourself if you’re full., Like anything else, mindful eating takes a lot of practice. You won’t automatically feel like an expert at this on day two. Stick with the adjustments to get better.Think of yourself as in training. You’re teaching your brain and your body to get in closer touch with each other while you eat, and that’s hard work!

, Everything’s easier when you have a friend by your side! A buddy can help you follow the rules of mindful eating, plan healthy meals, and go out with you to healthy restaurants. You can also support each other through any setbacks you experience.Buddies may be especially helpful if you struggle with cravings. They can talk through the craving with you and help you get over it.

, Since mindful eating is all about changing the way you eat instead of just regulating what you eat, you’re likely making a lot of lifestyle switches. Make the people who are close to you aware of these changes. This will allow you to avoid any confusion, and they can help you through this process."

Talk to your doctor.,
Consider following a low salt diet if you have high blood pressure.,
Follow a low salt diet if you retain excess fluid.,
Stick to a low salt diet if you have cardiac problems.,
Avoid a reduced salt diet if it will be a danger to your health.,
Calculate your current sodium intake.,
Decide whether you'd benefit from removing excess sodium.,
Determine a sodium guideline for yourself.,
Note the most common sources of sodium in your diet.,
Write up a meal plan.,
Plan to cook more from home.,
Keep a food journal.,
Purchase low-sodium or no-salt added products.,
Avoid high sodium foods.",How to Know if a Low Salt Diet Is Right for You," There's no one better to help you decide if a low salt diet is appropriate for you than your doctor. Make an appointment to discuss your current diet and plan to reduce your sodium intake.


There's been some conflicting studies on the recommended sodium intake. Recommended intakes range from 1400-2500 mg daily. Speaking with your doctor can help you decide what an appropriate sodium intake is for you.
Talk to your doctor about why you want to follow a low sodium diet. Are you retaining fluid? Do you think it's affecting your blood pressure? These are issues that should be discussed with your physician.
If a low salt diet is appropriate for you, ask your doctor to give you some advice on how to cut out excess sources of salt in your diet.;
, Sodium regulates the amount of water that your body retains. If there's more sodium in your body, your body will retain more water. This puts stress on blood vessels and the heart, as your blood pressure rises with more fluid in the system. One of the most common reasons for following a low or reduced salt diet is to help treat or prevent high blood pressure. If you have or are at risk for high blood pressure, consider adopting this eating pattern.


Studies have shown that reduced salt diets, can help reduce your blood pressure by about 14 points in just a few weeks.This can make a significant change in your overall pressure readings.
When you consume excess amounts of sodium, your body retains excess fluid which increases not only your blood pressure, but the amount of work your heart has to do.
Reducing your salt intake can help you get rid of excess fluid which overtime, can reduce your overall blood pressure.

, Even if you do not have high blood pressure, excess salt can still cause you to retain excess fluid. This can cause a host of health problems.


On the less severe side of fluid retention is weight gain, puffiness, bloating and swelling in your feet and lower legs.You may notice after a salty meal that your eyes are puffy or it's difficult to put on or take off your rings. This means you're retaining fluid and are sensitive to salt.
If you notice or have been told that you retain water when eating larger amounts of salt or sodium, you may want to consider following a reduced salt diet.

, A high salt or high sodium diet doesn't affect your heart directly. However, it will effect your blood pressure which can damage your heart.


When your blood pressure is elevated (which can happen as you age or if you eat a high sodium diet), it causes your heart to work harder.
In addition, the elevated pressure can damage your cardiac artery walls and the actual heart muscle itself.
If you are at risk for cardiac problems, have a family history of problems or already have some cardiac health issues, a low sodium diet may be appropriate for you.

, Although many people would benefit from a reduced salt diet, some people will not. Review your health and evaluate with your medical provider whether or not a low sodium diet is safe for you.


If you have any type of cardiac condition, like heart failure, you'll need to maintain a constant sodium level in your diet. Reducing sodium may cause additional problems.If you have problems maintaining appropriate electrolyte levels, especially sodium levels, you may actually need to consume higher amounts of sodium every day.
If you deal with low blood pressure regularly or have certain kidney conditions, following a low sodium diet may not be appropriate for you.

, When evaluating whether or not a low salt diet is safe for you, you'll need to calculate your current sodium intake. This will give you a basis of where to start.


To calculate your current sodium intake, you'll need to keep a food diary. You can keep a paper and pen journal or download a food journaling app. Many apps will automatically calculate your sodium intake for you, so this might be helpful.
Keep track of each breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack and beverage you consume everyday. Even small nibbles or bites are important to record.
Keep your food journal for at least 3-4 days. Track a few weekdays and weekend days as your food choices may differ when you're off of work.
Total your sodium intake for each day and then come up with an average. This can give you an idea if you are over or under the recommended sodium intake.

, Now that you've calculated your total sodium intake, found which foods contribute the highest salt content and talked to your doctor, it's time to decide whether or not a low salt diet is right for you.


If your daily sodium intake is surpassing the recommended 2500 mg limit, you may benefit from cutting down on the salt.If you notice that many foods that contribute the highest amount of sodium in your diet are also highly processed foods, high fat foods or just not the most nutritious foods, you may benefit from limiting these foods and salt in your diet.
Lastly, if it's appropriate for your current health and a low sodium diet will not negatively impact your health, you can decreasing your sodium.

, If you've decided to follow a low salt diet, start by determining a personalized guideline. This will be what you follow when you write up your meal plan during the week.


Most health professionals recommend that you do not consume more than 2500 mg of sodium daily. However, other health professionals suggest that you keep sodium below 1400 mg daily.
Figuring out the appropriate sodium level for you is something that you should talk to your doctor about.
For example, if you have high blood pressure and diabetes, your doctor may suggest limiting your sodium to 1400 mg daily. However, if you're young and have no health issues, your doctor may suggest following the standard 2500 mg rule.
Also, if you are a competitive athlete or work in environment where you sweat, reduced salt diet may not be right for you.

, In addition to calculating your total sodium intake, you need to be aware of where your sodium is coming from. If you do end up following a low salt diet, you'll know which foods to cut down on.


Some foods that are high in sodium may need to be limited in your diet as they are frequently high in other not great for you nutrients like fat, preservatives or calories.
Review your food journal and look over what foods are contributing the highest levels of sodium to your diet. Again, a food journal app might make this really easy as they will give you the sodium content of each food you input.
If you notice much of your salt intake is coming from fried foods, chips, crackers, restaurant foods or processed meats, it may be beneficial to cut down on these foods. Not only are they high in sodium, but they are also high in calories and fat.
When you're shopping for food, pay attention to the labels. Foods with 140mg of sodium (or 5% of your daily value) are considered low in sodium. Also, look for the words “soda” or “sodium bicarbonate” or “baking soda,” as well as symbol “Na” and “sodium,” all of which mean salt., Before starting any type of diet, it'll be beneficial to write up a meal plan for yourself. This will make following a low salt diet a little easier.If you've decided to do a low salt diet, start by writing out all the meals, snacks and beverages you'll be eating.
Take an hour or so in your free time to design your meal plan. Write out every breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks you plan on eating. This will give you a blueprint to follow during the week.
If you want to a little extra work, consider plugging this information into your food journal and see what the sodium totals are for the day. This can help you make any changes or swaps in your meal plan to keep your sodium where you want it to be.

, Although managing your overall sodium intake can be difficult, the more you cook from home, the easier it will be. Try to plan to eat out less often and make your foods from scratch.


Studies have repeatedly shown that when you cook from home you can easily follow a variety of diets including a low salt diet.You have full control on the types of ingredients you use, the amounts you use and how much actual salt you add to different foods.
Remember that Kosher salt and sea salt have the same amount of sodium as regular salt! They should also be counted toward your total salt intake.
Start trying to cook more foods from home. Try reducing your meals away from by 1-2 meals a week until you're mostly eating from home.
Foods that are processed, canned, and prepared outside of your home often have MSG monosodium, too.

, If you want to begin managing your sodium intake a little better, consider keeping a food journal. This can help you constantly stay on track of your intake.


When you keep a food journal, make sure to stay consistent. You'll want to track everything that you eat and drink during the day.
Try to be as detailed and thorough as possible. The more you are, the more accurate your journal will be.
Continue totaling your sodium intake each day. You can catch yourself going back to old habits quickly if you do this., Another way to manage your overall sodium intake is to purchase low sodium or no salt added products from the grocery store.


It won't do you any good to start cooking more from home, but end up using foods and ingredients that are really high in sodium.
When you're purchasing foods at the grocery store, look on the label for wording link ""no salt added"" or ""low sodium."" This will help keep your homemade dishes low sodium.No salt added means that there is not salt added during the processing of the food. Low sodium means that there cannot be more than 145 mg of sodium per serving of that item.

, You may benefit from cutting out specific high sodium foods from your diet. Many foods that are known ""salt bombs"" are also not very nutritious.


Avoid frozen and canned meals, even the healthy ones. These are notoriously high in sodium. They can get as high as 1,600 mg of sodium per meal.Also limit the amount of processed meat you consume. Whether it's deli meat, hot dogs, sausage, pepperoni, bacon or canned meat, these can also spike your total sodium intake. Just a few slices can have half of your intake for the day.Also be aware of restaurant foods. Items like pizza or burgers can contain more than half or your daily sodium needs.
Salted nuts, too, can contain a lot of sodium. Look at the nutrition facts to determine whether or not they are high in sodium.
Don't forget to look at the amounts of sodium in your over-the-counter medications, too.

, These foods can lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, according to research compared to modern diet fare.,, In the Danish study, researchers assigned people a score from 0 to 6, keyed to how closely each person followed the traditional Nordic eating style. For each point earned, mortality dropped by 4 to 6 percent over the course of the term of the 12-year study overall.


The study used diet records provided by 57,053 Danes who participated (beginning ages were 50-64 years) for the 12 year process. The data was ""associated with diet"" (of dead and living) ""with mortality by Cox proportional hazard models"" by the 0- to 6-point system explained.

, Get plenty of vitamin C, B-complex and extra B-12 -- such neurotropic (neuro-) vitamins are especially indicated in cases of general fatique/weakness and chronic illnesses, including neuropathy (a common diabetic or alcohol problem). Get enough magnesium and potassium rich foods. Don't cut out salt, but use it moderately. Table salt (sodium chloride) is essential -- no, not optional.

Keep a food journal.,
Learn which grains contain gluten.,
Understand what types of food contain gluten.,
Plan to supplement gluten with healthy alternatives.,
Consider other diets if you’re trying to lose weight.,
Avoid a gluten-free diet if you’re at risk for vitamin deficiency.",How to Know if a Gluten‐Free Diet Is Right for You2," An easy way to decide if you should eat a gluten-free diet is to try it out at home and record the results. Start by recording your symptoms – what they are, when they occur, how long they last, and what you ate that day. Then start to eliminate gluten from your diet and continue to record information about your digestion. If you find that you feel better once you eat gluten-free, stick with it!

Don’t make any other changes to your diet at the same time; for instance, don’t eliminate gluten and dairy simultaneously. You need to do one product at a time to see what causes changes.

, A gluten-free diet can be pretty limiting, so consider where you live and what products are available to you. To stick to a gluten-free diet, you HAVE to avoid eating barley, malt, rye, wheat, triticale (a cross between rye and wheat), durum flour, farina, graham flour, kamut, semolina, and spelt. You should also avoid oats, because oats are often contaminated with gluten products., Gluten appears in many different types of food. If you go on a gluten-free diet, you will have to avoid these foods, unless you can find gluten-free versions. These foods include:Beer
Bread, cakes, pies, cookies, and crackers (including Communion wafers!)
Cereals
Candy
Croutons
French fries
Gravy, salad dressing, soy sauce (and sauces in general), and foods in sauces
Imitation meat and seafood
Pasta
Matzo
Processed lunch meat
Seasoned rice mixes
Seasoned snack food like potato chips
Soup, soup base, and self-basting poultry

, Don’t replace gluten in your diet with more fats or sugars – it’s important to continue eating a balanced diet. Choose gluten-free alternatives like corn, rice, buckwheat, and quinoa.Again consider where you live and what food products are available to you, and whether you’ll be able to replace gluten with healthy alternatives.

Gluten-free alternatives are often more expensive than their counterparts.

, Going gluten-free won’t necessarily help you lose weight. Some of the gluten alternatives contain even more sugar than their gluten-containing counterparts. Eliminating carbohydrates from your diet isn’t the best way to drop weight – aim to avoid bad fats, eat lots of fruits and vegetables, opt for whole grains, and decrease your portion size instead., You may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies if you eat a gluten-free diet. Many gluten-free products are stripped of important nutrients like iron, fiber, folate, calcium, and more.Some medical conditions can also contribute to vitamin deficiencies, so avoid going gluten-free or work closely with a dietitian if:You’re anemic
You’ve ever had weight-loss surgery
You have problems absorbing or digesting food
You’re pregnant or want to get pregnant

When you're trying to lose weight and cut calories, you'll need to choose nutrient dense foods. These are items that are relatively low in calories, but also high in nutrients.
Produce (fruits and vegetables) are high in a variety of nutrients including fiber. Higher amounts of fiber helps you feel full and stay satisfied for longer. This may help you eat less and snack less throughout the day.Include one to two servings of fruits or vegetables at each meal. Make sure to measure your portions to 1/2 cup of fruit,1 cup of vegetables and 2 cups of leafy greens.Protein is another type of food that can help you feel satisfied longer throughout the day and moderate your appetite. It also helps support your metabolism during the day.Include a source of lean protein like chicken, fish, tofu, beans, shellfish or low-fat dairy at each meal. Stick to a 3–4 oz portion of these lean proteins.;
, Including a few servings of whole grains helps balance out your diet. These foods also contain moderate amounts of fiber and may help you stay more satisfied.Although whole grains are more nutritious compared to refined grains (like white bread or white rice), they do not offer as many nutrients as protein, fruits or vegetables.
Choose whole grain foods over simple carbs, or refined grains, as in white bread, crackers, baked goods. Try: brown rice, quinoa, oats, farro, whole wheat bread or whole wheat pasta.
Measure your portions of whole grain foods to help you lose weight. Measure out 1 oz or about 1/2 cup of grains.Remember that one slice of bread is one serving but a bun or bagel is two servings.

, Highly processed foods include bread, pastries, sweets, fast food, and frozen prepared meals. Try to avoid these often as they are typically more calorie dense compared to less processed foods.Eating many processed foods throughout the day may prohibit weight loss. Many processed foods are higher in calories, fat, sugars and other additives.If you currently rely heavily on processed foods, slowly make the switch to less processed foods. Start by making one meal or snack at home or pack to bring with you.
Also, meal planning and meal prep can help you be more prepared and have meals and snacks ready-to-go which may make it easier to pass up processed items.

, Drink adequate water is great for your overall health; however, it's also great for weight loss.


One way in which water can help you lose weight is by making you feel physically full. Like food, water takes up space in your stomach. Drinking a large glass before a meal can help you feel satisfied before your meal starts. Also, drinking a glass of water when you're feeling hungry before a meal can help you feel satisfied without a snack.
Drinking adequate fluid all day can also help your weight by maintaining adequate hydration. Even when you're slightly dehydrated, you may feel hunger signals when in fact you're only thirsty.Aim for at least 64 oz (2 litres) of clear fluids each day.Stick to no-calorie and decaffeinated beverages like water, flavored water or unsweetened decaf tea.

, Eating slower may help you eat smaller portions, fewer calories and lose weight.It gives your body time to register that you are satiated.


Most health experts recommend to take about 20–30 minutes to eat a meal. This allows your GI system to send satiation or satisfied signals to your brain.When you eat much faster than this, you're more likely to overeat or eat too much in one sitting.
Try setting a timer, putting your fork down in between bites, taking a sip of water in between bites and talking to your friends or family. These tricks can help slow you down.

, Taking a daily multivitamin may be a good idea when you're trying to lose weight. This will not speed weight loss, but may help meet nutrient needs when you're cutting calories.Multivitamins and any vitamin doesn't cause weight loss. Only cutting out calories and exercising can cause weight loss.
However, if you're cutting out a significant amount of calories (500-1,000 to lose 2 pounds in a week), you may not be able to eat enough to meet your daily nutrient needs.
Always talk to your doctor prior to starting any supplementation. He or she will be able to tell you if this is safe and appropriate for you.

, Your basal metabolic rate or BMR is how many calories you body burns per day performing basic metabolic functions, such as breathing, digesting food, or blinking.This calculation is important for determining your basic caloric needs. You can do it by hand or use an online calculator, like the one here.


If you are a woman, calculate your BMR using the following formula: BMR = 655.1 + ( 9.563 x weight in kg ) + ( 1.850 x height in cm ) – ( 4.676 x age in years ) 655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) – (4.7 x age in years)
If you are using metric measurements, use the following formula:
Example: A 5'7"", 135 pound, 30-year-old woman's BMR would be 655 + (4.3 x 135 pounds) + (4.7 x 67) – (4.7 x 30) = 1408.5.
If you are a man, calculate your BMR using the following formula:66 + (6.3 x weight in pounds) + (12.9 x height in inches) – (6.8 x age in years)
If you are using metric measurements, use the following formula: BMR = 66.5 + ( 13.75 x weight in kg ) + ( 5.003 x height in cm ) – ( 6.755 x age in years )
Example: A 6', 180 pound, 30-year-old man's BMR would be 66 + (6.3 x 180 pounds) + (12.9 x 72) – (6.8 x 30 years) = 1924.8.

, After you've determined your BMR, you'll need to account for your physical activity during the week. Multiplying your BMR by a physical activity number results in an estimate of the number of calories you burn per day.


If you are sedentary, multiply your BMR by 1.2.If you are moderately active, multiply your BMR by 1.3–1.4.If you are very active multiply your BMR by 1.4–1.5.Example: If you, like the above man, had a BMR of 1,924.8 and lived an active lifestyle then you would need to multiply your BMR by 1.4. If you did this, you would find that you burn approximately 2,694.72 calories per day.

, You can use the number of calories you burn everyday to help you calculate a calorie limit to help you lose 1–2 pounds per week.


There are approximately 3,500 calories per pound of fat. In order to lose a pound of fat you must consume 3,500 less calories than you burn. To lose 2 pounds of fat in a week you must consume 7,000 less calories than you burn in that week. In other words you must have a daily deficit of 1,000 calories to lose 2 pounds of fat in a week.BMR = 66.5 + ( 13.75 x weight in kg ) + ( 5.003 x height in cm ) – ( 6.755 x age in years ).To calculate how many calories you should eat to lose 2 pounds per week (given your current activity level) subtract 1,000 calories from the calories you burn in a day as calculated in the step ""Account for how active you are.""
Example: If you normally burn about 2694 calories/day then you would need to eat 1694 calories per day to lose 2 pounds per week.
Note that smaller women will have a difficult time achieving a 1,000 calorie deficient. If your calorie intake is less than 1,200 calories/day after subtracting 1,000 calories for weight loss you might want to consider a slower weight loss plan. Eating less than 1,200 calories a day can lead to nutrient deficiencies and inhibit your long-term weight loss goals.Example: If you are a women with a BMR of 1,408 who is mildly active (x 1.3) and therefore burns about 1,831 calories per day, a deficient of 1,000 calories would require that you eat only 850 calories per day. This is too low for a long-term diet and will prevent you from getting the the nutrients your body needs.

, In addition to counting calories, you can also pay attention to how your body feels when you're eating. It has a natural way of telling when you've eaten just the right amount (without calorie counting).


Our bodies have many mechanisms to help tell us when we've eaten enough food at one sitting. There are cells in both the stomach and intestines that help tell our brains that we've had enough food and we're satisfied.Listening and paying attention to these cues can help you stop eating when you're satisfied — not full or overly full. This is your body's natural ""calorie counter.""
Aim to stop when you're satisfied. This feels like a lack of hunger, general sense of contentment and a knowledge that you won't be hungry for another few hours. You should not feel uncomfortable.
If you feel full, you might have had a few bites too many, finished the entire serving or had second servings. If you feel full or uncomfortable, you have had too much and you've overeaten.

, To help maintain your muscle mass while in a caloric deficit, consider taking up weight training.


When in a caloric deficit, your body will burn its reserves for energy — both fat as well as muscle. Ideally you want to burn fat, not muscle. Including regular strength training can help minimize the loss of lean muscle mass.Health experts recommend including at least one to two days of strength training.Ensure that you work each major muscle group when you're exercising.
Try lifting weights or using weight machines, doing yoga or pilates or using isometric exercises to help maintain or build lean muscle mass.

, Cardiovascular exercise is good for overall health. However, it also helps your body burn calories and fuel weight loss.Regular cardiovascular or aerobic exercise has been associated with a variety of health benefits in addition to weight loss. It has been shown to help improve mood, decrease your risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes and high blood pressure, helps improve circulation and improves your energy.Cardio is also the main form of exercise that will burn calories and help support weight loss. The combination of a diet and physical activity is the best for weight loss.Include 5 days of cardio for at least 30 minutes. This will help you meet the minimum guideline set of adults in the US.Include exercises like: jogging, fast walking, dancing, using the elliptical or swimming.

, In addition to strength training and cardio exercises, also try to just move more or take more steps in the day. Studies have shown that lifestyle activities can also help support weight loss.Lifestyle activities are those that you do on a normal day. These could be walking to and from destinations, taking the stairs, vacuuming the floor or mowing the lawn.
Lifestyle activities burn small amounts of calories; however, if you're moving more all day long, you can make a significant impact on your weight.
Try to move or walk more throughout your day. Take a walk break at lunch, take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk further than needed when you are walking, park farther away or even do jumping jacks during commercial breaks.

Have fun along the way.",How to Lose Thirty Pounds in Two Months," Starting off an article about weight-loss this way is hardly motivating, but it helps to cut to the chase: It's extremely difficult to lose 30 pounds in two months. Expert doctors and dietitians agree that losing 1 to 2 pounds per week is healthy.Even if you lose 3 pounds per week for 9 weeks, you're still short of hitting your weight-loss goal. While it's certainly possible to lose 30 pounds in two months, whether or not it's healthy is another question.


Healthy weight loss comes from trimming pounds off of fat reserves without triggering the starvation response. When you cut down your caloric intake so low that your body thinks you're starving, it actually begins shedding muscle instead of fat. This is not a healthy trend.
It's hard to drop pounds simply by eating less, too which is unhealthy depending on what kind of food it is. Fat is needed, but it isn't healthy to overdose the amount. Protein is needed significantly for your health. They are used to make muscles,tendons, skin, and organ. When you cut your calories significantly, your body actually has a harder time shedding pounds. This phenomenon is called diet induced adaptive thermogenesis.Perhaps it's a mechanism for survival, or perhaps it's a way for our bodies to maintain a comfortable body weight. Whatever it is — and as crazy as it sounds — you need to take in calories in order to lose weight.;
, There are 3,500 calories in a pound. This means that you need to burn 3,500 more calories than you take in during the day in order to lose a pound of weight.That's a lot of calories to burn.


For reference, you can expect to burn between 100 and 125 calories running a mile at a semi-comfortable speed.At that pace, it would take about 28 miles (45 km), or more than a marathon, in order to shed a single pound of weight.

People who run marathons routinely lose 7 pounds during a typical race, but much of that loss (~6 lbs.) is water weight., Luckily, humans can shed weight several different ways. There's muscle loss, fat loss, and water loss. Much of the weight you can expect to lose during your two months will come from water loss, and that's fine. If you combine a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and a Spartan workout routine, you'll be able to achieve your goal.

, Many people start exercising and fail to see immediate results. When they're planning on shedding 15+ pounds, that sort of stalemate is incredibly discouraging: They soon give up because their goals are too lofty and their results are too few. Instead of falling victim to this dieter's dilemma, break down your goals into more manageable chunks so that if you fail to see immediate results, you don't get discouraged and quit.


You want to lose 30 pounds in two months, so your mini goals are losing 15 pounds per month or 3.3 pounds per week. Losing 30 pounds can seem daunting. Losing 15 sounds more manageable. Losing 3.3 sounds downright doable.

, Your basal metabolic rate is a calculation of how many calories you typically burn during the day. In fact, it's part of how the 2,000 calorie per day diet was devised.As we learned earlier, the key to weight loss is taking in fewer calories than you burn during the day, so knowing how many calories you burn in a day is an essential part in tailoring your diet in order to lose weight.


Calculating your BMR is very simple. Type in ""basal metabolic rate calculator"" into a search engine and enter in information relating to your gender, age, height, weight, and pregnancy status.

, Even if the key to successful dieting is taking in less than you burn, the way to do it doesn't involve skipping meals. Skipping meals is likely to trigger the starvation response (see above), as well as making binge eating more tempting.

, A high-protein diet is essential to losing weight. Studies have shown that participants following a high-protein diet eat fewer calories, report greater satisfaction, and feel more satisfied (and less hungry) than they had before starting the diet. Sources of great protein include:


Lean meats, such as turkey and chicken breast
Fish, such as tuna
Lean dairy, such as skim milk or cottage cheese or low fat yogurt
Soy-products, like tofu
Beans and legumes, such as kidney beans and lentils

, There's a world of difference between complex carbohydrates and simple carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates, like white bread, soda pop, and cookies, have a simple chemical structure and are digested by our bodies relatively quickly; the excess is often stored as fat.Complex carbs, like yams, brown rice, and zucchini, have a more complex chemical structure and are assimilated into the body over a longer period of time; that means you stay full for longer and there's less chance that carbs you eat get stored as fat. When choosing between simple and complex carbs, go complex:


Choose whole wheat bread over white bread
Choose whole wheat pasta over ""normal"" pasta
Choose brown rice over white rice
Choose veggies like broccoli over starches like potatoes
Choose nuts, beans, and legumes over sugars, sodas, and sweets

, Not all fats should be shunned. Broadly speaking, there are two ""healthy"" fats and two ""unhealthy"" fats. Getting some healthy fats into your diet can help you stay healthy while you lose weight.



Mono- and polyunsaturated fats are considered healthier for humans and can be safely incorporated into diets.Examples of monounsaturated fats include avocados, nuts, olives, and pumpkin seeds. Examples of polyunsaturated fats include Omega-3 fatty acids such as salmon and flax seeds.
Avoid saturated and trans fats. These fats are not only bad for cholesterol levels, thereby increasing your risk of cardiovascular disease, but also have no real nutritional benefit. They should generally be avoided, but especially when you are dieting.

, Even if you eat healthy, it is possible to overload on a specific type of food and neglect the healthful benefits of other types of food. If you're trying to lose weight, maintain a good balance in your diet by eating fresh fruits and veggies, whole grains, legumes and nuts, fish, and lean meat. Try to avoid eating especially fatty foods, overly processed foods, fast foods, ""snack food,"" sweets, and baked goods.

, A low-carb diet, the Atkin's diet recommends restricting net carb intake in favor of proteins and even certain fats. Atkin's dieters are encouraged to eat foods with a low glycemic index. An example of the Atkin's diet would be eating a hamburger with the patty and vegetables but without the bun.


, Although the south beach diet is remarkably similar to the Atkin's diet, there are two notable differences:


The south beach diet bans ""unhealthy"" fats but encourages adoption of healthy ones;
The south beach diet does not count carbs. Instead, it encourages dieters to only go for carbs that are low-sugar or on the low-glycemic index., The Mediterranean diet seeks to expose dieters to foods that are commonly eaten in places such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Crete. Many peoples in this region regularly eat:


Moderate amounts of fish and poultry and less red meat
Many seasonal plant foods and vegetables
Fresh fruits as dessert
Olive oil
Cheese and yogurts as main dairy foods
Small to moderate amounts of wine

, Weight watchers is a popular weight loss program that individuals sign up for. In it, they are given ""pro points"" based on several key factors such as age, gender, and weight; foods are assigned points based on a scale. Individuals are allowed to eat any food, provided they stay within their point allowance.

, Although not a traditional ""diet,"" vegetarianism has its advantages when it comes to losing weight. Vegetarians weight less over a five-year period than people who eat meat, studies have found.(Vegans weigh even less than vegetarians.) At the same time, just because you're a vegetarian doesn't mean you necessarily eat well. There are plenty of junk foods that can cause weight gain while being strictly vegetarian. Consider becoming a vegetarian if you think it will help you eat healthier.

, The key to cutting pounds is consistency. Consistently carving out time in your day to walk, play sports, or otherwise exercise will help you when it comes time to step on the scale, for two reasons:


You'll shed weight a little at a time instead of in big bursts. It's easier to lose 1/4 pound per day and exercise every day to exercise twice a week and and lose 1 pound per day.
It's easier to get into a routine. Once you're in a routine, it'll be easier to find the motivation to work out every day and harder to justify skipping a day.

, It's harder to skip a day when your friend is expecting you at the gym. Not only this, but it's an excellent opportunity to strengthen the relationship with your friend. Nothing makes buddies more than sweat and tears.

, Interval training involves short bursts of fiendish activity spread out over a longer period of time, and has been found to be particularly effective in burning calories.For example, instead of running around a track the same speed four times to complete the mile, run around the track at regular speed three times, and for the fourth, sprint as fast as you can.


Interval training is not only more effective at burning calories than traditional exercise, it's also more efficient. Interval trainers burn more calories quicker than traditional trainers.

, Some people perk up like birds in the morning; others are night-owls, and take a little longer to rev up. Whatever type person you are, try to exercise whenever you really start going. It doesn't make sense to work out when your tank is empty; you'll get far more return on your investment if you choose to work out at the right time.

, You want to lose weight, and you want to do it fast. Whatever your reason is, keep it close to your heart, and let it motivate you to keep on trying when you think you can't. Because there will come a time when you want to quit, when you feel like you've given it everything you got, and the desire to quit will be stronger than ever. That'll be when you need to summon up the motivation to continue. Your motivation can be:


A friend or a family member; maybe you're losing weight because you were inspired by them.
A professional athlete; maybe you've always looked up to them.
An idea or cause; maybe you care deeply about improving your health and feeling better every day.
The challenge itself, because you know you can.

, Researchers at the University of Chicago have found that people who sleep for 8.5 hours a night were able to lose 55% more body fat than those who only slept 5.5 hours.Getting insufficient sleep can increase the hormone ghrelin. Ghrelin makes individuals hungrier and can affect how fat is stored in the body. In order to get the most out of your workout routine, be sure to give yourself enough time catching zzzs.

, Cardio has a number of very specific health benefits, in addition to being an excellent way of burning fat and losing weight. It improves respiration, strengthens the heart muscle, reduces stress as well as the incidence of depression. Here are some cardio exercises that you can try to lose weight quickly:


Swimming
Running
Cycling
Boxing
Walking

, Team sports are great at motivating people to go the extra mile when it comes to working out. Much of the time, people lose themselves completely in the competitive aspect of sports, burning plenty of calories over several hours. Try joining a local intramural team, or make your own league playing with friends or co-workers. Here are some popular sports that are also great at burning calories.



Basketball. Running up and down the court is said to help burn between 812 and 946 calories per hour.

Soccer. Notorious for its grueling pace and non-stop running, playing soccer can help you burn between 740 and 860 calories per hour.

Ice hockey. A downright physical sport, hockey is expected to help you burn approximately 500 calories per hour.Play football or flag football. Although it's difficult to say exactly how many calories you can burn playing football, a general estimate is that football players weighing 200 pounds burn upwards of 900 calories, while flag football players weighing 200 pounds burn upwards of 700 calories., Test your own determination and enduring by competing in an individual sport. Individual sports are, in many ways, a test of how far you're willing to go in order to achieve your goal. They're tests in which you often put your body on the line, but come away with something very tangible to show for it: Glory, or in our case, gutted calories.


Try rock climbing. Although it doesn't sound as intense a workout as basketball or soccer, rock climbing is indeed a calorie buster. Expect to burn between 810 and 940 calories for each hour of intense rock climbing.
Try skiing or snowboarding. Even though it's hard to ski or snowboard the year round, there's a lot of diversity here: You can ski slalom, downhill, cross-country, or board through powder. Expect to burn anywhere from 640 to 980 calories per hour.

Pick up tennis. Tennis can be a grueling sport. Necessitating short bursts of speed and great hand-eye coordination, tennis can help individuals burn about 400 calories every hour., As alluded to earlier in the article, a half- or full marathon is a great way to lose pounds. Yes, it is grueling. It is punishing to your body. And at the end of the day, it's more a test of the will than it is of the body. But if you complete a marathon, prepare to be incredibly uplifted and feel like the sky is the limit.


Of course, one of the big sells about marathons, calorie-wise, is that you have to train for a marathon. You can't just expect to push your body to the limit without any training. Training requires long hours of running, burning countless calories. As you ramp up training, expect to see more drastic results., When combined with effective dieting and targeted aerobic exercises, strength training can significantly help you drop the pounds, which is why many fitness experts incorporate it into their training regimen.Not only will you burn fat if you begin strength training, but you'll also replace that fat with lean, sexy muscle. Additionally, strength training will reportedly help you continue to burn muscle even after you've finished working out.When strength training, remember to choose exercises that target a large muscle group. These exercises include, but are not limited to:

Squats
Lunges
Kettlebell swings
Squat thrusts
Burpees
Inverted rows
Pull ups
Push ups



, Two months is a long time — even if you don't end up shedding 30 pounds, it's plenty of time to make a significant difference in how you look and how you feel. That being said, too many people expect to see immediate results and are disappointed when they don't. They work out for a week and barely make a budge on the scale. They think: ""What's the use in me punishing myself this way if it doesn't make a difference?"" They quit.


This is called the plateau effect.In order to beat the plateau effect, you need to introduce variety into both your diet and workout regime. Switch things up in your diet and workout routine; avoid getting too complacent with one set of foods and one set of exercises.

, The idea that you can only lose weight in, say, your belly without losing weight elsewhere is called ""spot reduction."" Spot reduction has been proven to be a myth.The fat broken down by the body for fuel can and does come from anywhere. Don't set yourself up for failure by only hoping to lose fat from your thighs and belly and not from anywhere else on your body.

, If you're serious about shedding 30 pounds, you won't be able to do it without nature's favorite hydration source. Water is clean, refreshing, plentiful, and — most importantly — calorie free. Substituting water for soft drinks, energy drinks, fruit juices, and other caloric drinks can ultimately be the difference between making your goal and missing it.


Here's one trick that you can use to feel more full before meals. Down an 8-ounce glass of water right before you eat. The water will take up extra space in your stomach and make it harder to eat as much as you might on an empty stomach. Be sure to eat nutritiously, however, so that you don't get hungry in another hour.

, Ever hear the phrase ""Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper?"" Eating a complete breakfast will help your body jump-start its metabolism, prepping it for the day to come. Skipping breakfast means you're asking your body to fast to 15 to 20 hours. When this happens, your body can't produce the necessary enzymes to metabolize fat efficiently, setting you up for failure.If you get hungry, eat a healthy, nutritious snack in between meals. Carrots and hummus, or celery and tuna mixed with olive oil and lemon juice. Get creative, but be sure that the ""snack"" you choose for yourself falls within whatever diet you've given yourself.
Try as much as possible to take a light dinner. Many people say that your metabolism slows down during the night, taking it harder for your body to digest large amounts of food eaten during dinner. While there's no conclusive scientific evidence to suggest this, there is good reason to keep dinner light. The types of foods that we eat later on an night tend to be worse for us: snacks, ice-cream, candies, and other indulgences.

, We all know that dieting can be a chore. But if you have the opportunity to make it fun and rewarding, it can be. So make the diet into a game — challenge yourself to stay under 1,500 calories for 5 out of the 7 days in the week. Reward yourself when you break a milestone — if you're on pace after the first month, treat yourself to a shopping spree. Whatever you do, have fun doing it and your body will reward you.

Choose fresh colorful food.,
Eat more fruit.,
Include more vegetables in your diet.,
Eat nuts.,
Drink tea.,
Consider taking a supplement.,
Include flavonoids for the antioxidant benefit.,
Improve cell communication.,
Improve vitamin C transportation in the body.,
Improve your heart health.",How to Include Flavonoids in Your Diet," Foods, particularly fruits and vegetables, lose their flavonoids over time, so choose fresh produce and use it quickly. To avoid losing flavonoids, avoid overcooking or boiling your produce.Bright color is a good indicator of high flavonoid content, so pay attention to color when you're cooking.


Since flavonoids are highest in the skin of produce, try not to peel your fruits or vegetables. For this reason, you should also purchase organic produce in order to cut back on pesticides.;
, Fruits are one of the biggest food sources of flavonoids. They contain a variety of flavonoid types including anthocyanidins, flavonols, flavon-3-ols, flavonones, and flavones.Try to eat two or three servings of fruit every day. Eat more:Berries: blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, huckleberries, cranberries, blackberries
Stone fruit: cherries, plums, peaches
Bananas
Pears
Apples
Citrus (and juices): grapefruit, oranges, lemons, limes
Melon: watermelon, cantaloupe
Red grapes

, Vegetables contain several types of flavonoids, including flavonols, flavonones, and flavones. Try to eat at least three servings of vegetables a day. You should aim for a combined five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Good vegetable sources of flavonoids include:Red or yellow onions and leeks
Leafy greens: turnip greens, mustard greens, lettuce, beet greens, spinach, Swiss chard, collard greens, kale)
Tomatoes
Parsley
Peppers: chili peppers, bell peppers
Celery
Red or purple cabbage

, Eating a handful of nuts every day is a good way to get a variety of minerals and vitamins. Several nuts contain high sources of flavonoids. Pecans, almonds, pistachios, and hazelnuts have the highest concentrations of flavonoids.While they're not nuts, you should also include garbanzo beans and quinoa to get anthocyanodins and flavonols in your diet. Legumes and soy are good sources of isoflavones.

, Tea is the largest source of flavonoids for many people. It's one of the best studied flavonoids, containing catechins, including epigallocatechin gallate or EGCG. These flavonoids act like antioxidants which may protect your heart health. Try to drink one to three cups of tea a day.Green and white teas contain high levels of flavonoids, although black teas also contain other helpful flavonoid components (like thearubigins).Red wine and red grape juice are other good source of flavonoids. Drink wine in moderation (one drink a day for those under 65 and up to two drinks for those over 65) for the health benefits., If you're ill, you may want to take a flavonoid supplement. Always talk to your doctor before taking a supplement. Since there's no recommended daily intake for flavonoids, your doctor may prefer that you continue to get flavonoids from your diet.


To ensure you get the most benefits from flavonoids, try to eat a variety of fresh foods. Unfortunately, most nutrient databases do not provide significantly useful information about the flavonoid content of foods.
Some people are not able to eat fresh fruits and vegetables due to certain health conditions, like diverticulitis or Crohn's Disease, and they may benefit from taking a supplement as they cannot consume the flavonoids through dietary sources.

, Antioxidants can fight a substance called free radicals which damages cells and causes oxidative stress (the imbalance between the production of free radicals and the ability of the body to counteract their harmful effects). Your body usually makes its own antioxidants (like glutathione, and uric acid). But, environmental stresses, poor diet, and illness can all overwhelm the antioxidant systems in your body. Eating flavonoids can increase the antioxidants in your system.Oxidative stress is correlated with the development of cancer, atherosclerosis, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases.
Studies are still needed to determine if flavonoids can grab and bind dangerous metal ions, reducing free radicals., Cells and tissues communicate with each other using routes or pathways. Flavonoids can change these pathways, which may improve cell to cell communication. Flavonoids can:Increase detoxification
Maintain normal cell growth and prevent abnormal (cancerous) cell growth
Decrease inflammationDecrease the risk of clotting

, The combination of flavonoids and vitamin C can prevent damage to DNA.Some of the foods highest in Vitamin C are also very high in flavonoids. These foods include:Papayas
Bell peppers
Broccoli
Brussels sprouts
Strawberries

, Flavonoids may reduce LDL cholesterol by relaxing the arteries, improving blood flow, and by preventing platelets from sticking.Fruits and vegetables are good sources of flavonoids that lower cholesterol.But, studies also show that some of the best sources of flavonoids to reduce cholesterol include cocoa products, like chocolate.To get the most benefits, choose dark chocolate (with at least 55% cocoa solids). Milk or white chocolates contain lower amounts of cocoa and higher amounts of sugar.
Some flavonoids promote the relaxation of arteries and allows blood to flow easier throughout the body. This decreases blood pressure by helping to prevent atherosclerosis."

Include steady state cardio.,
Work out in the mornings.,
Include abdominal- and core-toning exercises.,
Run or jog.,
Do a spin class or include high intensity biking.,
Step aerobics.,
Do high-intensity interval training (HIIT).,
Limit carbohydrates.,
Monitor calories.,
Eat the right types of fat.,
Increase the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat.",How to Lose Stomach Fat With Cardio," Steady state cardio is any aerobic exercise that keeps your heart rate at a relatively stable level for at least 10 minutes. This type of exercise will help burn calories and support your metabolism.In general, it's recommended to get at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week (or 30 minutes five days a week). Aim for a mix of moderate- and high-intensity activity. This combination will burn calories from fat in addition to providing cardiovascular benefits.A variety of activities can be considered moderate-intensity cardio including: jogging/walking, running, biking, hiking, use the stair master or elliptical, swimming or dancing.
Some studies even suggest up to 60 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio daily for the most effective reduction in stomach fat.;
, Try to get in your cardio exercises in the morning before eating your first meal. Exercising in this fasted state means your body will be using energy from its storage form — fat.Try to include any type of cardio exercise in the morning. Even a quick 20 – 30 minute walk can help your body use its excess fat stores for energy.
Getting up earlier in the morning may be difficult. Make it a priority and after a few weeks your body and mind will get used to getting up earlier.
Make sure you go to bed earlier as well. It's important to get adequate rest, so you may need to move up your bed time if you're planning on an AM workout.

, Although cardio is responsible for burning and reducing overall body fat, adding in some light strength training can help tone your stomach.


Include a variety of core strengthening and toning exercises. When you've reduced the amount of stomach fat, toning your abdominal muscles will give you a more defined look.
Try toning exercises like: crunches, planks, bicycle crunches, or v-sits.
Toning exercises will help strengthen muscles; however, it is not possible to ""spot treat"" this particular area. It is a myth that you can target where on your body you will lose fat, so doing abdominal exercises won't cause you to lose fat only around your waist., Running and jogging is a great steady-state cardio exercise to burn fat. If you can jog fast or run, you'll burn more calories and help decrease body fat.In general, you can burn about 100 calories per mile when you're running. In addition, running is a great exercise for cardiovascular health.If you're not a runner, start slow. You can start with jogging a mile first and slowly increase your distance or pace over the course of several weeks.

, Spin classes and high intensity biking is another great exercise that will burn large amounts of calories and fat.


Spin class is done indoors on a stationary bike. You can control your speed and resistance on the bike. However, the harder you work and the faster you pedal, the better fat burn you'll get.
If you haven't tried a spin class before, it's important to take your first few classes slowly. They are very high intensity and it may take a few weeks to bring up your fitness levels.
Spin is also generally done inside in a closed room. You can get very hot and sweat a lot. It's important to re-hydrate continually throughout a spin class.

, Step aerobics is a another great cardio class to help you burn calories and fat.


It's particularly effective due to it's focus on your legs and glutes. These large muscle groups make you work up a sweat causing you to burn calories and fat.You may burn up to 400 calories in 30 minutes if you work out at your hardest intensity.
Again, if you haven't done a step aerobics class, start slowly. Use a smaller step and any modifications to movements that are too difficult for you. Over time, you can use a bigger step or do movements without modifications.

, Another type of cardio activity is HIIT. This type of cardio burns more calories from fat and also raises your metabolism for about 24 hours after you've completed the workout.During HIIT you alternate between short bouts of very high-intensity cardio and short bouts of more moderate-intensity cardio. You do not spend as much time doing HIIT compared to steady state cardio exercises, usually about 20 minutes (with an additional 5 minutes at the beginning and end for a warm up and cool-down). They are intended to be shorter, more vigorous exercises.
Studies have shown that there is a close relationship between the intensity of cardio exercises and the reduction of stomach fat. Participating in HIIT may be very effective for reducing abdominal fat., Studies have shown that low-carb and low-calorie diets resulted not only in faster initial weight loss, but also were the most effective at reducing stomach fat.Carbohydrates are found in a wide range of foods including: dairy products, fruits, starchy vegetables, grains and legumes.
Focus on limiting carbohydrates from foods like: sweets or sweetened beverages, breads, rice, pasta, chips, crackers or pastries. While these foods do contain other nutrients, these same nutrients are also found in other food groups. This makes it OK to restrict these particular foods.
Consume carbohydrates that also provide your body with a lot of other nutrients like fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, or antioxidants. Foods like fruits, starchy, vegetables, and dairy all contain a lot of other vital nutrients and should be included in your diet.
Low-carb diets focus on minimizing carbohydrates, not eliminating them. Some carbohydrates are necessary for your body to function optimally.

, In addition to following a low-carb diet, it has also been shown to be beneficial to follow a lower calorie diet.Studies have shown that the combination of low-calorie and low-carb diets result in the highest reduction in stomach fat.


A low-calorie diet refers to a variety of differing calorie levels. The total amount of calories recommended will be different for everyone based on age, gender, weight and activity level.
In general, it's safe to cut out about 500 calories daily from your diet. This usually results in about one pound of weight loss each week.Use a calorie tracker or online program to count how many calories you currently consume in a day. Subtract 500 from that number to figure out your initial daily calorie goal.
When cutting calories, it's important to not cut out too many calories. Eating less than about 1,200 calories daily puts you at risk for nutrient deficiencies, loss of muscle mass, and fatigue., There are a few different types of dietary fat that you can consume. Some have been shown to be healthier, whereas others have been shown to increase fat around your stomach and abdominal organs.Studies have shown that regular consumption of saturated fats was related to increased stomach and visceral fat.Saturated fat is found in foods like: full fat dairy products, processed meats, fatty cuts of meat, butter, and fried foods.Instead of eating foods higher in saturated fat, choose leaner sources of some foods. For example, choose lean cuts of beef or low-fat dairy products.
Also, use fats like olive oil or canola oil for cooking instead of butter.
Instead of foods higher in saturated fat, consume foods that are higher in heart healthy unsaturated fats and omega-3 fats. These foods include: fatty fish (like salmon, mackerel, tuna or sardines), olives or olive oil, nuts and nut butters, seeds and avocado.

, When you're following a lower carb, lower calorie diet, it's important to focus on eating an adequate amount of fruits and vegetables each day.


Both of these foods are very nutrient dense — they contain a lot of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants for very few calories.
In general, it's recommended to consume about five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day. However, when you're also focusing on limiting carbs, do not consume more than one to two servings of fruit daily or one to two servings of starchy vegetables daily.Include a lot of non-starchy vegetables like: leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, tomatoes, brussels sprouts, zucchini, green beans, asparagus, mushrooms or eggplant.

Although studies show that weight gain can be contagious, they show it's equally likely that you'll engage in healthier eating behaviors around those that eat well and eat smaller portions.Think about your current group of friends, family members or co-workers that you normally eat with. Who has healthy eating patterns? Who chooses a side salad instead of fries? Who offers to split larger portions? Who indulges in treats more often?
Make a mental note or list in your head of those people that you think already engage in healthy behaviors. These may be people whose behaviors you envy — like going to the gym regularly or having the motivation to eat healthier on a consistent basis.;
, Your core support group can also influence you in other ways outside of eating. Take advantage of their healthy lifestyle and ask to join them for more physical activity.


If some of your core support group is active regularly, consider asking to join them. Go to the gym at the same time, ask to sign up for a race together, or make a plan to go for afternoon walks together.
Studies have shown that those who work out together are more likely to stay consistent with their exercise plan.In addition, you may work out longer or at a higher intensity when you're with other people.
Similar to eating patterns, you may mimic exercise patterns of those that are active regularly.

, Don't forget about your other friends or family members that you'll still socialize with and eat with. Although they may not exhibit healthy behaviors, its important to still connect with them.


Think about your other friends and family members that you hang out with on a regular basis or eat with. You'll need to come up with strategies to help you stick to more positive eating behaviors around these people.
First, try to engage in other non-food related activities together. Instead of avoiding certain people, ask to go to the movies or go for a hike instead of going out to eat.
If you eat meals regularly with someone who doesn't have the healthiest eating habits, try to take note of how they influence you. You'll need to try harder to make sure you don't change how you eat when around these people.

, One very common behavior of those that already have unhealthy habits, is that they can enable you to adopt those same unhealthy habits. Limit your time with those that are enablers.


Enablers are those friends or family members that encourage or suggest bad eating patterns or behaviors.For example, an enabler may say, ""Let's both get dessert and we'll get to try two different items"" when you suggest splitting dessert. Or, ""Come on! You should have another helping"" after you've said you are full
Although some enablers are harmless and don't suggest poor behaviors frequently, some friends or family members do this on a regular basis. Be aware of these enablers and try to avoid eating with them if they have a significant influence on your habits.

, One of the most common mimicked behaviors is eating style.When you're with your core support group, pay attention to how they eat and try to mimic their eating behaviors.


Eat a smaller portion. One common trait of those who are at a healthy weight is that they tend to eat smaller portions and only eat until they're satisfied.Mimic these small portions and leave some food on your plate.
Eat slowly. Try to mimic other's eating speed as well. You may need to try hard to slow down your pace, but this can help you feel more satisfied with less food.
Take small bites. If you normally fill your fork up with a big bite, watch how much food your friends or family choose to have per bite. Try to make your bites smaller and match their size.
Try taking a sip of water between each bite, putting your fork down after each bite, or chew a certain number of times before swallowing to slow yourself down.

, Another easy way to improve your health is by copy catting your friend's orders. Try to mimic what they're ordering or choose a similar meal or snack.


Those who are more slim may be more likely to eat more fruits and vegetables compared to those that are overweight.Let your friends or family members order first or serve themselves first. Look at what they chose and either order that same meal or something similar.
If you don't want to order exactly the same meal, order something very similar. For example, if someone ordered a grilled chicken salad, you may order a grilled steak salad or grilled salmon and steamed vegetables. All are lean proteins and vegetables.

, To help you eat slower and be more mindful about your food choices, engage in more conversation. If your friends are usually the ones talking, this may be why they have an easier time eating less or smaller portions.


If you eat more slowly, your GI system and brain have more time to communicate about your level of satiation. The longer it takes you to eat, the more likely you are to feel satisfied with less food.Engaging in conversation is a natural way to slow yourself down at a meal. Ask questions, bring up complex topics or take the opportunity to vent to a good friend. These are all ways to help keep you talking and slow down your eating pace.

, You can also use your core support group to help you cut down on your own portions of food. If they're already eating smaller portions, they may be more willing to split items with you.


Some friends or family members may enjoy eating larger portions and not want to share or split items with you. This may make it easier for you to order too much or eat too much at meals.
If you want to focus on eating smaller portions, ask your core group to split items with you. You can split an entree, appetizer or dessert.It'll cut down on the overall amount of calories you're consuming at that meal.
These smaller portions will help you stick to an overall more balanced diet and improve your health.

, Also follow your core support group's method on indulging and including treats in their diet. Just because they eat well most of the time, doesn't mean they avoid the occasional treat.


When your friends or family members are ordering food, watch how they include a higher fat or higher calorie option to their meal. Try to mimic their behavior when it comes to indulgent treats. Ask for smaller portions or request a healthier side.
For example, do they order a cheeseburger but swap the fries for a side salad? Do they order a child sized dessert? Do they order a more indulgent appetizer as their main course?
Including some favorite comfort foods is appropriate even when you're trying to improve your health. The key is to be able to do it in moderation and with control.

, Whether you're eating out or going to a friends house for dinner, stick to foods that are prepared with low-calorie cooking methods.


When you're eating with others, try to focus on choosing a meal item that has been prepared without a lot of added fat, oils or sugar. This can help your overall meal be slightly lower in calorie.
The lowest calorie cooking methods to pick include: grilled, sauteéd, boiled, poached, steamed, baked or roasted.
Try to avoid foods that have been deep fried, ""smothered"" or pan-fried. This usually indicates a higher calorie option.

, Even if other people choose something unhealthier or higher in calories, you should still choose nutritious, lean sources of protein at your meal.


Lean proteins are naturally lower in calories and fat. This can help control the overall calorie content of your meal.
Lean protein options include: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, lean pork, seafood, legumes or tofu.
When you're eating around other people, try to see what sources of lean protein they are choosing for their meal. Mimic their choice or choose another lean option for yourself., Another way to keep your meals more nutritious is by making half of them a fruit or a vegetable.


Both fruits and vegetables are naturally lower in calories. When you make half of your meal a fruit or a vegetable, it helps control the overall calories of that meal.Watch and listen to what your friends order in regards to fruits and vegetables. Are they choosing to order a vegetable over a higher fat item like fries, potato salad or macaroni salad? Try to mimic this behavior.

, If you have friends that eat well-balanced and nutritious meals, they're most likely choosing 100% whole grain foods. Copy this behavior when you're ordering your meals.


100% whole grains are less processed and contain more fiber, protein and other nutrients compared to refined grains.When you're ordering foods or serving yourself, watch what types of grains your friends take. Do they order brown rice or white rice? Do they ask to swap out the plain pasta for whole wheat?
If your foods are served with a grain, try to eat 100% whole grains like: brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread or whole wheat pasta.

Set your weight goal.,
Find a coach.,
Measure up.,
Work out regularly.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Never give up.",How to Lose Weight (Men Above 25)," When you set your weight goal, make sure not to set it up too high. Because it might discourage you to stop losing weight if you can't reach your targeted weight. For example, if you weigh about 256 pounds, you should probably set it to about 220 or 225 or if your stomach ratio is about 60 inches (152.4 cm), than try to reach for 45 or 50 inches (114.3 or 127.0 cm). But if you're willing to reach a bigger goal, that's your choice if you can handle it. But don't expect that you'll reach that target so quickly.There are plenty of apps on the appstore that could be helpful for you.;
, When you chose someone to be your partner, make sure you have a strong bond with each other, rather than hiring a personal trainer which cost thousands of dollars. Your partner should be the same gender as you. He could be your brother, your best friend or even your son. Just make sure he is in top physical shape. Do not choose someone who is also losing weight, then he won't serve as an inspiration for reaching your goal.

, This step is very important and must be done annually. There are two methods of measuring you. You can use a weighing scale or measuring tape. The measuring tape is better, because it easily measures the ratio of your stomach but the weighing scale only measures mass and it doesn't really determine if someone is overweight or not, because muscle weighs more than fat. When measuring with a weighing scale, your partner must observe the number being shown as you step on the scale. Make sure to put the scale on a flat surface. When you use the measuring tape, you must remove your shirt as your partner wraps the tape around your abdomen which is located at your belly button. Make sure to record the sizes every time you exercise.

, When you and your coach exercise, you have to be in full cooperation with him. If you're too conscious of people watching you exercise then you should exercise in a place where you feel most comfortable at like your house, a gym or a park. Before you exercise, make sure to do a little stretch exercise and limber up before doing intense movement like push-ups, cardio or sit-ups. Once you're done stretching, run a couple of laps around a track or your house. Wherever you are. The most recommended exercise would be sit-ups because it directly targets your mid-section giving you a better chance of shedding pounds.

, Since you're on this weight loss journey, you must observe a strict diet in order to attain the goal weight you want. This means no junk food, soft drinks, fast food and other unhealthy products. Eat a high fiber and sodium rich meal at least five times a week and just drink water, milk and juice made from natural ingredients as your beverages.Avoid eating food that have too much oils in them. If you crave to eat these fatty foods, don't give up, just remember the reason why you chose to change your life.Your coach could decide what diet is most suitable for you.

, This is the most important step of them all. Just never give up. You have the encouragement of your coach. Inside of you there is a new you trying to struggle free and you are the only one who can let him out. It may seem that your coach may torture you with all these exercises and not let you eat your favorite food but he actually cares for your health. Just believe in yourself and you can become like these changed men.

Drink 2 to 5 cups of green tea daily.",How to Lose Belly Fat Fast (For Women)1," If you do not eat a well-balanced diet, this step is extremely important.;
, Reducing sugar and empty calories from white processed carbohydrates will allow you to burn fat faster.


This includes liquid calories like sodas, coffee drinks and alcohol.






Most nutritionists consider it impossible to lose belly fat quickly and healthfully without removing processed foods.

,


A woman between the age of 19 and 50 needs at least 2.5 cups of vegetables per day.






Choose your vegetables for their color. Try to make a colorful plate, and you will get more nutrients.






Women between the ages of 19 and 50 need between 1.5 to 2 cups of fruit per day.





*Eating your favourite fruits will help boost your appetite for healthy foods.

, Choose grains like quinoa, brown rice and barley over whole grain bread. The less processed the grain is, the better it will be for your body.


Choose whole grains that have a low glycemic index. This means they don’t spike your blood sugar, and they will make you fuller for longer.
Go to glycemicindex.com to view how your favorite foods fit onto the glycemic index.

,


Eat quality protein, like salmon, tuna, turkey, chicken and legumes every day (women who are pregnant, nursing, or considering getting pregnant should be careful about the amount of mercury in their diet and avoid eating excessive quantities of some fish).






Add in low-fat dairy in the form of yogurt. Yogurt helps lower cortisol levels with calcium. Greek yogurt has more protein than regular yogurt, and 1 serving per day, as part of a balanced diet, can help you burn off belly fat faster.







,


Studies have shown that people who ingested 600mg of catechins, an antioxidant found in green tea, lost 16 times more visceral fat than those who did not drink it.
Look for green tea that has high levels of anti-oxidants.
You must drink it hot to receive these benefits.

Do 1 hour of cardio exercise daily for fast fat loss.,
Opt for interval training.,
Do bodyweight exercises before you do traditional crunches.,
Stretch your abs before you exercise them.",How to Lose Belly Fat Fast (For Women)2," Although 30 minutes of moderate cardio exercise daily can stop the production of additional visceral fat, a full hour is required to burn it. You cannot “spot reduce,” or simply burn stomach fat without burning other body fat. However, 90 percent of people notice a reduction in belly fat first.

, Short (1-5 minute) bursts of high-intensity cardio during a 1-hour session will boost your metabolism and reduce fat faster.


Try a boot camp, circuit training or fat burning class, to learn how to incorporate high intensity exercises into your routine.
You can also look for interval settings on most cardiovascular machines.

, Do planks, side planks, push-ups, squats and lunges every other day.


Try to incorporate 30 minutes of bodyweight exercises every other day.
These static and dynamic exercises burn more fat than crunches because they engage your core muscles, such as the abdominals longer and more intensely.
Add in strength training with machines or free weights when your body is used to the increased exercise. Do 30 minutes of weightlifting, with abdominals flexed, 3 times per week.

, Try to do your cardio before you do abdominal exercises and stretch, so that more of the work will focus on your core, rather than tight hips, legs or the neck.


Take a Pilates class to learn how to target the deep abdominal muscles.
Do 15 to 30 minutes of abdominal exercises every other day.
Make sure to include exercises that work the obliques (side-abs) and transverse abdominis (lower abs). Good exercises include side plank dips, reverse crunches, the bicycle and roll downs.

Identify causes of stress in your life.,
Reduce stressful situations at home and at work immediately.,
Start deep breathing exercises.,
Take Vitamin C supplements.,
Devote 7 to 8 hours to sleep.,
Try yoga or meditation.",How to Lose Belly Fat Fast (For Women)3," Stress has been linked to increases of visceral fat in both men and women.


Stress causes your body to produce more stress hormones like cortisol.
Cortisol sends signals to your body to store fat. The stress is a signal to your body that food may be scarce in the future.
Many studies suggest women show more physical symptoms of stress than men, including weight gain in the belly.

, Regulating stress in your life will help you lose belly fat faster than diet and exercise alone.

,


Do 10-second breaths. Sit in a comfortable position. Inhale for 10 seconds, and then exhale for 10 seconds. Breathe in this manner for 2 to 5 minutes.
People who are stressed usually breathe rapidly in and out and take shallow breaths, without even realizing it.
Do 10-second breathing every time you are stressed or at 5 different interval throughout the day.

, If you are not able to get enough Vitamin C through food, taking a Vitamin C supplement can help manage the cortisol in your blood and regulate the effects of stress on your body.


Try to eat more cantaloupe, oranges, red and green peppers, kiwi, broccoli or tomatoes. A serving of each has between 40 and 100mg of Vitamin C.






Eat 500mg of Vitamin C daily. Try to get the majority of your Vitamin C from food sources.
Take a 200mg supplement of Vitamin C if you are not reaching your 500mg goal. You may take a 500mg supplement for a week, if you feel you are getting very little Vitamin C in your diet.

, Sleeping well manages stress and hormone levels.


People who sleep less than 7 hours per day can also raise cortisol and ghrelin levels, causing you to gain belly weight.
Ghrelin is a hormone that brings cravings for sweet and fatty foods.

, If deep breathing is helping, then yoga and meditation may be the best way to regulate cortisol, ghrelin and other hormones that produce weight gain.


To lose belly fat fast, you should try doing several different types of yoga for exercise and stress reduction. Flow yoga burns fat while reducing stress.
If you choose to try meditation, it can also help you sleep. It should be added to your schedule in addition to increased exercise.

Indulge in the right types of fat.,
Eat lean protein.,
Add in fresh fruits and vegetables at every meal.,
Choose whole grain foods.,
Drink adequate amounts of water.",How to Lose Belly Fat in a Week1," Studies have shown that eating the right types of fat, like monounsaturated fats, can help reduce belly or visceral fat by up to 20% over low-fat diets.Monounsaturated fats are a type of fatty acid that has been linked to decreased risk of heart disease, improved management of diabetes, and improved function of your blood vessels.Although monounsaturated fats are considered healthy, they are still very calorie dense. Do not add these in addition an to an unhealthy diet or in addition to unhealthy sources of fat. These should replace those unhealthy sources of fat like trans or saturated fats.
Monounsaturated fats are found in a variety of foods including: olive oil, olives, nuts, seeds, nut butters, avocado and canola oil.
Ideas to try include: replacing butter or lard with olive oil, grapeseed oil or avocado oil.;
, Lean sources of protein will help you stay satisfied longer throughout the day and help fuel your weight loss.Make sure that you eat a source of lean protein at each meal. Measure out a 3-4 oz (21-28 grams) serving to stay within your calorie limit.Replace all fatty proteins like high-fat cheese, red meat and sausage with leaner cuts of protein like: chicken, turkey, fish, beans/lentils, eggs, low-fat dairy and nuts.

, Make sure at least half of your plate is filled with produce. These low calorie foods are high in nutrients and can help you lose weight and reduce belly fat.The best way to lose belly fat is through calorie reduction. When you make half your plate a fruit or vegetable, the low calorie nature of these foods helps lower the overall calorie content of your meals.
Measure out 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of leafy greens or 1/2 cup of fruit. Include 1-2 servings at each meal., When you're trying to reduce belly fat and get rid of dangerous visceral fat, you'll need to choose 100% whole grain foods when you're eating a bread, rice or pasta.100% whole grains are significantly higher in fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals compared to more refined grains. They are a much more nutritious choice.Refined grains are those that are overly processed and their vital nutrients are removed. Items like white bread, white rice, plain pasta or crackers should be limited.
Include a serving or two of 100% whole grains daily. Measure out 1 oz or 1/2 cup (125 ml or 25-30 grams) of items like: quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat pasta, whole wheat bread or millet., Help keep your body feeling more satisfied and hydrated by drinking adequate amounts of water and other clear fluids each day.


It's typically recommended to drink at least 8 glasses of water daily. However, even amounts up to 13 glasses per day have been recommended.Water is essential for hydrating your body.

Try a core class.",How to Lose Belly Fat in 2 Weeks," Belly fat, like other body fat, cannot be spot reduced. Body fat will need to be removed with a combination of diet and exercise from all areas of your body where it is stored. , Eating too little will tell your body to go into fat storage mode, so eat breakfast, healthy snacks and fresh meals. Women should not eat less than 1,500 calories per day, while men should not eat less than 1,700 calories. , Even though these are essential parts of the equation, sleep and stress play crucial roles in reducing belly fat. Little sleep and high stress, tell your body to produce cortisol hormone, which tells your body to store fat in your mid-section.

, Cleanses are usually only effective for weight loss when combined with a healthy diet, while liquid diets do not give you the nutrients you need for lasting weight loss. Choose to change your eating habits to fresh produce, lean protein and whole grains instead.

, You are going to lose more inches on your belly in the first 2 weeks than subsequent weeks if you stay dedicated to a weight loss routine. If you are at least 15 lbs. (6.8 kg) over your ideal weight, you should see significant results in the first 2 weeks and belly reduction may be harder afterward. , Belly fat that is stored around your organs is called visceral fat, and it increases your chances of diabetes, heart disease and cancer. If you store fat in your thighs, buttocks or arms, scientists believe it may be more healthy for you than a “beer belly.” , Ideally, all your proteins should be lean, such as egg whites, fish, chicken or cuts of red meat with very little marbling or fat. Protein requires more energy for your body to digest it and it builds muscle.


Building muscles will help you burn fat. They speed up your metabolism, burning fat exponentially as you grow stronger. Remember this when you plan your exercise routine.

, Replace white breads, pastas, fatty meats and sugars with fruits and vegetables. Your plate may be more full than it was before, as long 1/2 to 2/3 of the meal is vegetables.

, Shop along the perimeter of the grocery store and shop for produce with a wide variety of colors. For the next 2 weeks, only buy whole grains, fruits, vegetables and lean proteins.

, Protein-rich Greek yogurt, skim milk and even low-fat cheese can make you feel full and reduce calcitriol, a hormone that increases fat storage. Eat at least 6 oz. of yogurt per day, choosing unsweetened or minimally sweetened products over sweeter versions.

, However, instead of simply buying whole wheat bread, eat quinoa, oatmeal, apples, bananas, flax and wild rice. These fiber sources appear to help digestion, flush the system and help with fat reduction.

, Try to replace all of your fat with monosaturated fat for the next few weeks. This is the fat in nuts, olives and olive oil, flaxseed and avocados.


Choose snacks that are rich in whole grains, protein and mono-saturated fat. For example, a protein smoothie with Greek yogurt, almond butter and oatmeal or a slice of seeded whole grain bread covered in peanut butter will fill you up longer and provide much-needed nutrients.

, When it comes to burning body fat, not every exercise is created equal. For the next 2 weeks, choose high-intensity workouts like running, swimming laps, road cycling, rowing or boot camp over easy to moderate exercise.

, This works out to 3 times a week, every other day. Start with 4 to 5 lb. (1.8 to 2.3 kg) free weights and move up to 7 lbs. (3.2 kg) if you are comfortable with it.


Choose weight machines over free weights, if you do not know proper form.
Always flex your core as you do the exercise. Don’t arch your back. The act of flexing your stomach will help you build stomach muscles and define your belly.
Lift weights for at least 30 minutes at a time.
Start with simple and well-known exercises like bicep curls, push-ups, pull-ups, tricep curls, flys, chest presses.
Do 3 sets of 8 to 10 exercises. You should use enough weight to fatigue your muscles and need a rest after each 3-set exercise.

, This means you incorporate the act of sprinting during your cardio session for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Give yourself 2 to 4 minutes between sprints. Remember to include a 5-minute warm up and cool down where you remain at an easy to moderate intensity during your workout.


Even walking can be adjusted for an HIIT workout. Do 3 shorter, fast-paced interval walks (alternating faster walking with a few slower periods) and 2 walks at moderate intensity each week. You will burn 3 to 5 times more visceral (belly) fat. After 2 weeks of belly fat burning, you can reduce your workout time to 20 minutes and increase the vigorousness of your sprints to get similar benefits. , You usually burn carbohydrates until you hit the 20-minute mark and start to reduce your fat stores. For bigger weight loss, extend your high-intensity training to 45 minutes 5 times per week over the next 2 weeks.

, Pilates, barre, core burning classes and some yoga styles focus on building your stomach and back muscles. Building these muscles through special exercises, in addition to weightlifting, will help you burn more fat each week.

Cut out sugar and refined white flour.,
Cut out alcoholic drinks.,
Limit high fat foods.",How to Lose Belly Fat in a Week2," Studies have shown that one of the biggest culprits of visceral fat is sugary beverages, sweets and foods made from refined white flour.Limit or cut out these foods to help reduce belly fat.


Sweetened beverages like sodas, fruit juices and sports drinks in addition to candy, desserts or pastries can increase visceral fat. In addition, foods made with white flour or are highly processed carbohydrates are also responsible for packing on fat. Look out for crackers, white bread, plain pasta, and white rice.If you crave sugary sweets, try replacing your typical snack or treat with a more nutritious food. For example, try: low-fat Greek yogurt or fruit.

, Many studies have shown that increased alcohol consumption is linked to increased amounts of visceral fat.Limit or cut out alcoholic beverages to help reduce belly fat.


In addition, many alcoholic beverages are mixed with sugary, sweetened beverages. The combination of sugar and alcohol together increase your risk for visceral fat.
In general, women shouldn't drink more than 1 glass of alcohol daily and men should limit their alcohol to 2 glasses daily., In addition to choosing sources of healthy fats to include in your diet, you should also try to limit or avoid certain types of fat that can increase belly fat and the chronic conditions associated with it.


Avoid all trans-fats. These fats are man-made and can cause hardening of the arteries, increased LDL (the bad cholesterol) and decreased HDL (the good cholesterol). Avoid all products that contain partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils. These are found in fried foods, processed foods and processed meats.Eat only moderate amounts of saturated fats. There has been a lot of back and forth research over whether or not saturated fats are unhealthy. Since fats in general are higher in calories are you're trying to reduce weight and body fat, limit these types of fats. They are found in animal products like butter, full fat cheese, red meat and lard.Make sure to limit fatty cuts of meat, fast foods, fried foods, processed meats as these types of foods are the highest sources of unhealthy fats.

Do interval workouts 2-3 days this week.,
Commit at least 30 minutes of cardio 5 days a week.,
Increase your daily activity levels.,
Do strength training exercises 1-3 times this week.",How to Lose Belly Fat in a Week3," Higher intensity interval workouts have become more popular. They are known to torch calories, but specifically burn higher amounts of body fat compared with traditional cardio.A study conducted by the University of Virginia found that people who had 3 out of 5 cardio sessions per week with intervals burned more belly fat, although they technically burned the same calories during the workout itself. Most gym machines come with interval programs. You can do interval programs on treadmills, stationary bikes and elliptical machines.
You can create your own high intensity interval program by alternating between short bursts of very high intensity exercises with longer bouts of more moderate intensity exercises. For example, you can try alternating between 1 minute sprints and 5 minutes of jogging.

, In addition to interval training, studies have shown that it's equally important to do at least 30 minutes of cardio exercises each week to help reduce belly fat.To specifically decrease visceral or belly fat, some health professionals even recommended doing up to 60 minutes daily of aerobic activities to have more significant effect on visceral fat.Try walking, biking, swimming, hiking, running, working out on an elliptical or rowing machine.
Aim to do these activities at a moderate pace. This is usually described as when it is possible, but difficult, to keep up a conversation as you perform the activity.

, Lifestyle activities are a great way to add more exercise to your day. Being more active throughout the day has been shown to have similar benefits to 150 minutes of planned cardio each week.


Choose times when you are sedentary, such as watching TV, break time at the office or commuting and insert activity into the mix. Think of times when you can move more or take more steps.
For example, do sit-ups, pushups and planks during commercial breaks. Stretch while you are stuck in traffic and walk around the office during break time.
You can also consider buying a pedometer or downloading a step counter app on your smart phone. These will help track how active you are during the day and a good way to see how much you've increased your activity level.

, Weightlifting builds lean muscle mass which can help increase your body's metabolism and ability to burn calories at rest.In addition, resistance training helps increase bone density and reduces your risk for diseases like osteoporosis.Include body weight exercises, such as pushups, planks, squats or lunges. These are great toning exercises but also increase your heart rate.
Learn to use free weights or weight machines. Start with popular exercises like chest presses, rows, pec flys, overhead presses, front and side arm raises, lunges and squats or the leg press machine, calf raises, and biceps/triceps last. Tricep exercises include the tricep overhead press, tricep pull downs on a cable pull, and tricep kick backs.
You may want to consider investing in a session with a personal trainer if you have never used weights before. They will be able to show you how to lift weights and provide you with an appropriate weight lifting program.

Calculate your resting metabolic rate (RMR).,
Do the math.,
Address the hidden culprits.,
Find your motivation.,
Set goals.,
Seek support.",How to Lose a Pound a Week1," RMR is often used interchangeably with basal metabolic rate (BMR). Although they are slightly different, estimating either is sufficient for the purpose of losing weight. To calculate your RMR, use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation (which is more reliable than the Harris-Benedict equation). There are also calculators online that can do this for you:


RMR = 9.99w + 6.25s - 4.92a + 166g-161

w = weight in kilograms; if you know your weight in pounds, divide by 2.2 to get your weight in kilograms
s = height in centimeters; if you know your height in inches, multiply by 2.54 to get your height in centimeters
a = age in years
g = gender = 1 for males, 0 for females


Knowing this number will help you calculate how many calories you burn while pretty much doing nothing. While websites and treadmills can give you numbers, they're never entirely accurate.;
, Losing a pound a week is totally reasonable and totally doable. In fact, much more and you'd be losing muscle and water. In order to lose this pound in 7 days, you need to cut 500 calories a day.


That's because one pound is 3,500 calories. 500 x 7 days = 3,500. You can do this with eating, exercise, or both. However, know that it's probably easiest to make a few diet tweaks and get a little active rather than starving yourself or spending hours at the gym.

, If you're going to keep it off, it will take time effort, and permanent lifestyle changes. Is there anything in your life keeping you from your goals? Be sure that you're in a place to successfully make these changes and that you're doing this for you, not anything or anyone else.


To stay committed and be successful, it's imperative that you stay focused. Changing habits is something that takes diligence 24/7. Because making these changes will affect your entire lifestyle, it's important to address everything else in your life, too. If you're worried about money or a relationship, you may need to take a step back. Tackle any other obstacles first -- not doing so will decrease your chances for success. Then when you're ready to concentrate on your weight, you'll be set up on the right track.

, This should come from you and you alone. After all, you're the only one who has to go through all the effort. What will make you stick to it? Keeping certain things in mind may help you stay motivated. Are you worried about health? Making a trip to the beach? Wanting to be able to be more active?


When you feel yourself slipping, call on these motivations. Put a note on your refrigerator, bathroom mirror or pantry door. If you're away from home a lot, tag an encouraging note on your computer. Do whatever would work best for you.

, Alright, so you're probably here to ""lose a pound a week,"" we've determined that much. But how? Getting things as concrete as possible will help you know what to do (and what not to do).


Think about process and outcomes goals when you're nailing down what you want to accomplish. A process goal is what you do -- for example, ""Do cardio 5 times a week."" ""Lose a pound a week"" is an outcome. You don't necessarily need an end point (an outcome goal), but process goals are key to changing your habits. As long as your goals are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-limited (SMART!), you're set. And don't forget to record your progress!, While, yes, this is ultimately your responsibility, having support can keep you going and going strong. Surround yourself with others who will encourage you and make it easier to meet your goals. If they can exercise with you or create meal plans, all the better. They'll also keep you accountable, providing you an extrinsic motivation you wouldn't otherwise have.


If you're not ready to go public about your weight-loss, keep yourself accountable by regularly weighing in and recording your diet and exercise progress in a journal.

Include strength training into your routine.",How to Lose the Last 10 Pounds," It isn't your imagination—those last 10 pounds really are harder to burn than the pounds you burned before them. That's because your body has a harder time losing weight the leaner it becomes.


When you're at a heavier weight, your body uses more energy to complete various tasks, including both daily tasks and intentional exercise. As you lose weight, you actually reduce the amount of work your body must complete to accomplish the same tasks. Doing less work also means that you're burning fewer calories.
When you lose weight, the hormones that control energy use are down-regulated, which causes a decrease in your body's overall metabolism. As a general rule, your metabolism slows down by as many as 20 calories per day for every 1 pound you lose.;
, If you've already lost weight, you may already understand that weight loss requires you to burn more calories than you intake. Since you're burning fewer calories now than you did before, however, you'll need to make some adjustments to the intake-output ratio before you can lose those final pounds.


Typically, most people can lose the final bit of weight without crunching these numbers as long as they make small adjustments to their dieting routine. Others may find it beneficial to understand the math.
Since the body burns roughly 10 to 20 calories fewer for every 1 pound lost, you can use that to help calculate the difference in your metabolism by multiplying your weight loss by 10 to 20 calories.

For example, if you started at 150 pounds and are down to 140 pounds, you've already lost about 10 pounds. This means that your body is losing 100 to 200 calories less when it performs the same activities it performed at 150 pounds.
Under these circumstances, you'll need to burn approximately 100 to 200 calories more each day to lose weight at the same rate as before.



, If you've never actually calculated how many calories you should consume each day, it might be helpful to do so now.


These numbers are based on age, activity level, and the median BMI for men (22.5) and women (21.5) at a healthy weight.

If your BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, this information should be fairly accurate. If your BMI is above this range, however, these estimates might actually be somewhat lower than necessary. Note that if you don't know your current BMI, you can calculate your BMI by looking at a standard height/weight BMI chart.These numbers also apply most accurately to people who are moderately active. If you're very active, you'll need to consume 200 to 400 calories more. If you're sedentary, you'll need to consume approximately 200 calories less.


To lose roughly 1 pound per week, your daily caloric intake should be:Women, ages 19 to 30: 2000 to 2200 calories
Women, ages 31 to 50: 2000 calories
Women, ages 51 and older: 1800 calories
Men, ages 19 to 30: 2600 to 2800 calories
Men, ages 31 to 50: 2400 to 2600 calories
Men, ages 51 and older: 2200 to 2400 calories



, As you shed pounds and get closer to your ideal weight, it's easy to let your guard down and become more relaxed about your diet and exercise plan. Since losing weight is more difficult during this time, though, you should actually become more vigilant and intentional than before.


Stay accountable by keeping a food diary or using a calorie-counting app. Record the things you eat and the exercises you perform, along with the estimated number of calories you consume versus calories you burn. Be as honest and accurate as possible.

, Instead of eating before you feel hunger, try to let a little hunger develop before grabbing any food. Doing so will ensure that you don't eat more often than your body actually needs.Additionally, train your body to eat every three to four hours. This includes both meals and snacks. When it's time to eat, make sure you're legitimately hungry and not just bored or thirsty.
Take your time while eating so that your body can begin digesting the food. Doing so will help you fill up on less. As a general rule, you should also eat until you're only about 80 percent full—not 100 percent stuffed—and avoid finishing everything on your plate if you don't feel hungry for it.

, Low-calorie diets are more effective than other diet trends, but some people do have sensitivities to carbohydrates and dietary fats that can make weight loss difficult. Consider adjusting your diet so that you consume more protein and fewer carbohydrates.Most of the extra protein you consume should come from non-meat sources, however. Meat introduces more unhealthy fats and calories into your diet, so it can hinder your weight loss efforts when consumed in excess.
Instead of eating more meat, try eating things like nuts, lentil soup, chickpeas, whole wheat pastas, and vegetables.

, Fiber cleanses your digestive system and helps reduce visceral fat around the abdomen, which also reduces your risk for health concerns like high blood pressure and diabetes.


You can get more fiber through food sources or dietary supplements. Good food sources include beans, vegetables, fruits, and seeds. Either way, try to get 21 to 38 grams of fiber each day.

, Regardless of how much water you're currently drinking, you should try to increase the total amount to about 80 oz or 10 cups (2.5 L) each day.


Drink the majority of your water and other fluids immediately before or during a meal to maximize the benefit. Drinking two glasses with a meal will help fill your stomach and may make it easier to consume 75 to 90 calories less.

, Watch your sodium intake carefully. Salt forces your body to retain fluids, which will increase your weight and make it harder to drop those 10 pounds.


Since most foods contain some sodium, read the nutrition labels to know how much you're consuming. Be especially vigilant about breads, soups, poultry, and cured meats. Try to cut down your total sodium intake to roughly 1000 mg per day., Both add empty calories to your diet. Even if you were able to enjoy them during the early stages of your weight loss, you should reduce or remove them from your diet now that your calories count more than ever.


Processed foods include any food or drink that's been altered from its natural state. This includes most canned foods, boxed meals, and refined grains. Whenever possible, opt for fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, fresh dairy, and whole grains over their processed counterparts.
Most alcoholic beverages are relatively high in calories. Moreover, alcohol promotes fat storage, decreases muscle growth, and makes you feel hungrier. Since it also affects your decision-making abilities, drinking alcohol will make it harder to resist temptation, too.

, Eating a low calorie snack 15 minutes before sitting down for a major meal is a good way to control your portion sizes. The snack will partially fill your stomach, making it easier to get full on less food during lunch and dinner.


Apples are an especially good choice. They only contain 65 calories apiece on average, and as long as you eat both the peel and flesh, your body expends nearly the same amount of calories digesting it.

, Completely cutting fats and sugars from your diet is a bad idea since it can negatively impact both your help and your morale, but you also need to be smart about how you satisfy your body's cravings for them.


Omega-3 fatty acids are especially beneficial for your body. They make it easier for cell membranes to develop insulin receptors, which then allows your body to lower its insulin levels. Lower insulin means less abdominal fat. One fish oil capsule and one 3-oz (85-g) serving of fatty fish provides roughly the same amount of omega-3.
Other sources of healthy fats and oils include nuts, seeds, and avocados.
If you have a notorious sweet tooth, consider appeasing it with a protein-rich, low-calorie sweet. Options include a single scoop of light ice cream, a single serving size carton of low-fat yogurt with fresh fruit, or a glass of low-fat chocolate milk.

, Poor sleep decreases your metabolism, so sleeping better will make it easier for you to burn calories. Aim for eight hours of sleep each night.


Lack of sleep also stimulates the appetite and increases the rate at which you lose lean muscle tissue.
Intentionally set aside at least eight hours for sleep each night, and try to fall asleep and wake up at the same time each day. If you have difficulty sleeping, you may need to research techniques to improve the amount and quality of sleep you get each night.

, Standing burns more calories than sitting. No matter what your life is like, try to replace one hour of sitting with one hour of standing throughout the course of each day.


Making this switch can burn an extra 100 calories, which can help offset the drop in your metabolism caused by your current amount of weight loss.

, Wear a pedometer to keep track of how many steps you take each day. Walking more often will burn more calories, and counting your steps will let you know how much walking you actually do.


Wear the pedometer and walk your usual amount for at least three to four days. Once you figure out your average number of steps, you can set goals for increasing that amount.
Start by getting an extra 2000 steps each day. After several days of adjusting to that amount, increase your steps by a similar interval. Continue along in this manner until you're walking roughly 10,000 steps on a daily basis.

, Interval training is the practice of mixing short bursts of intense exercise into moderate exercise routines. When done right, it can boost your metabolism and allow you to burn more calories during low and moderate levels of activity.


During any cardiovascular exercise you perform (jogging, swimming, cycling, etc.), switch back and forth between moderate effort and vigorous effort.

For example, try running for 5 minutes after jogging for 10 minutes. Reduce your speed back down to a jog for another 10 minutes, then finish up with another 5 minutes of running.


A 30-minute interval workout can help you burn 20 percent more calories than you'd expect to burn when exercising at a consistent pace.

, If you already perform some regular form of cardiovascular exercise, consider boosting the time spent on that exercise by 5 to 15 minutes.The exact amount will vary based on the intensity of the exercise. For vigorous exercise, an extra 5 minutes should suffice. For gentle to mild exercise, you may need to boost the amount to 15 minutes.
To make the biggest difference, you'll need to do this for each exercise you already perform. In other words, if you take a power walk in the morning and go for a run at night, add 15 minutes to your power walk and 5 minutes to your evening run.

, Cardiovascular exercise burns more calories in the short-term, but strength training increases your metabolism, which helps your body burn more calories in the long-term.


Try to do an equal amount of both types when you're working on those final 10 pounds. After a month or so, you may notice your body burning up to 30 percent more calories for the exercise you do.

, It might seem counterproductive to eat if you're trying to lose weight, but studies show that eating breakfast within an hour of waking up keeps your insulin levels steadier and your LDL cholesterol (the bad kind) levels lower.

, Get a pedometer and try to increase the number of steps you take each day. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk instead of driving. Stand up and walk for 30 steps every 30 minutes.

Devise a diet plan.,
Speak with a doctor or dietitian.,
Drink lots of water and take vitamins.,
Eat breakfast.,
Eat lunch.,
Eat well-portioned dinners.,
Avoid unhealthy snacks, soda, and alcohol.",How to Lose 60 Pounds1," The most important first step in shedding pounds through dieting is to select a dieting plan. Tailor that plan to your lifestyle, and establish clear weight loss goals. It is essential to construct a plan that is appropriate for your goals and medical/health history. This is sometimes best done by a dietitian. There are many different ways to achieve weight loss through dieting. Below, a few different diet plans are listed.


Keep in mind that, whichever dieting method you choose, dietary and medical specialists suggest that losing more than an average of one to two lbs. a week is not safe for your body. Also, some studies suggest that rapid loss increases the risk of gaining weight back. In order to lose one to two pounds per week, average adults need to cut 500 to 1,000 calories per day from their diet.Low- or No Carb Diets: These diets utilize a method of eliminating carbohydrates from your diet and replacing the nutritional value of those carbohydrates with protein-rich foods. These diets, while helpful with losing weight, can lead to nutritional deficiencies, as carbohydrates are a natural part of human health requirements.Low-Fat Diets: These diets are designed to cut the overall intake of fats from your diet, thus eliminating excess calories that can lead to weight gain. Also, decreasing fat intake lowers the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease.Low-Calorie Diets: These diets control the overall intake of calories, found in all types of food, to help produce a reduction in the overall body mass of an individual. These types of diets can often lead to fatigue, as an individual’s overall caloric intake and, thus, energy are reduced.;
, It is always important to speak with your doctor before beginning a weight loss program.

, Drinking water is not only healthy, but can also reduce hunger and the urge to eat by making you feel full. Also, taking a daily regimen of multivitamins can help replace the extra nutrients that you may be missing from your diet.Doctors recommend that adult males drink at least 3 liters (0.79 US gal) of water a day and adult females drink 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water of day.Vitamins are essential as many people who start diet plans tend to cut out foods their bodies are used to eating, thus creating deficiencies.

, Dieting does not equate to skipping meals. Eating breakfast, contrary to popular belief, actually helps to kick-start your metabolism, which assists in burning excess calories throughout the day.Start off the day with a 500 to 600 calorie meal. A very healthy and filling meal at that falls in line with this calorie intake would include a banana, a bowl of oatmeal, whole grain toast with one to two tablespoons of peanut butter. This will provide you with a mix of carbohydrates and protein. Carbohydrates give you quick energy and protein will provide energy throughout the day., If you have eaten breakfast and plan to eat dinner, there is no reason to eat a large lunch. However, you can still eat a healthy and filling meal at lunch time.


For lunch, eat 300 to 400 calories. Salad, yogurt, salmon, chicken (not fried, but grilled), fruit, cottage cheese, steamed vegetables, or soup are all good choices. Avoid foods that are heavy in saturated fat or high in calories. This would include fried foods, heavy sauces and creams,

, For most Americans, dinner is the largest meal of the day. As a result, it is very important that you limit the portions of food you eat at dinnertime. Don’t overindulge and avoid following-up dinner with a desert.


You should eat a dinner that falls somewhere around 400 to 600 calories. Roasted chicken with whole wheat pasta, mahi mahi tacos, beef stir fry with broccoli and shiitake mushrooms, or pork medallions with pomegranate sauce are all tasty choices that provide the necessary nutrition while still falling in this calorie range., Snacking on chips, candy, other unhealthy foods in between meals is devastating to one’s diet. All of the ""unhealthy"" snacks, or those that contain high levels of “empty” calories or high levels of fat, are deemed excess calories by your metabolism and stored for later use. Also, soda and alcohol, especially beer, are high in calories and generally unnecessary for your body’s nutritional requirements.As an alternative, try snacking on a handful of almonds, carrot sticks and hummus, calorie-limited snack packs, or yogurt.It is critical to point out here that diet sodas have never been proven effective as weight loss tools. Actually, the sweetness of the diet soda tricks your body into thinking it is getting high-calorie input, without providing any actual calories. Because of this, drinking diet soda is likely to increase hunger as well as the desire for sweet, high-calorie foods."

Understand the science behind weight loss.,
Keep a log of your normal caloric intake for 1-2 weeks before starting.,
Drop carbs from your diet.,
Stick to vegetables.,
Eat lean proteins to feel full and get lasting energy.,
Reschedule your meals for intermittent fasting (IF).,
Keep snacks below 150 calories each.,
Have a glass of coffee or green tea.,
Drink water regularly to ease hunger pains.,
Know that an effective diet will contain very few calories.",How to Lose 7 Pounds in 7 Days1," Knowing why you must cutting carbs, start exercising, and eat differently will help you adapt your diet accordingly. There are 3,500 calories in a pound of fat, and losing weight rapidly requires dropping a lot of these calories from your diet. For the rest, exercise burns calories and kick starts your metabolism to burn more calories while you sleep. 3,500 calories a day is a lot -- and you need to be ready to sacrifice to make this possible. It won't be a comfortable 7 days, but you can get through it if you keep your end goal in sight.A calorie is a calorie. This means that, at the end of the day, weight loss is about decreasing the number of calories you eat, no matter what source they're from. A professor in Kentucky once ate Twinkies and lost 27-lbs to prove this point. How? He ate very, very few.If you feel dangerously nauseous, light-headed, woozy, or tired while on this diet. stop and have a snack. You can still lose a lot of weight by following the basic tenants of this diet, even if you need to ""cheat"" for your safety once or twice.;
, Get a dieting app, use a calorie counting website, or simply write down your calories in a journal. You need to know how many calories you eat each day to figure out where your diet can change. You will need to eat roughly 1,000 or fewer calories a day to drop a pound every day for a week.

, If you can do this slowly, before your one-week challenge, you'll have the best results. Carbs are a dietary staple, but they hold a lot of water weight (binding to more water than fat or protein) and are easy to overeat. Try to get yourself below 50g of cards (roughly a scoop of pasta) a day.


Switch spaghetti squash for pasta -- it contains less than 1/4 of the calories.
Swap an English Muffin for bagels or hamburger buns to save 100 calories.
Make a taco salad instead of a burrito.Try to slowly lower your carb diet in the 2-3 weeks before the major weight loss. You body will adapt to the change, and by the time your ""7 days-7pounds"" comes around your body will be ready to drop the weight. That said, dropping carbs for one week will still make a difference., It is very hard to overeat vegetables. That's not a joke about how vegetables taste bad, that's actual science based on the concept of a ""bliss point,"" which is the amount of calories you need to eat to feel full. Processed foods are specifically made with higher bliss points, but the all-natural goodness of vegetables allows you to eat fewer calories and still feel full.


Make a salad with your favorite fruits and vegetables: lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, kale, celery, apples, strawberries, red onions, etc. Keep the dressing to a bare minimum;1-2 teaspoons of oil and vinegar is your best bet.

, Once you've subbed out carbs, you'll likely feel constantly hungry. You can avoid this, however, by making a source of lean, fat-free protein a part of every meal. Some proteins to include in your diet are:


Grilled or baked chicken.
Beans, chickpeas, and legumes.
Tuna and other white fishes.
Nuts
Eggs, IF is one of the best ways to lose weight fast, but no one ever said it was fun. Most commonly, IF involves skipping breakfast, leading to 18 hours or more between meals. Instead of breakfast, eat a single banana when you wake up as a snack. Then you can eat lunch and dinner, with a small snack in between (especially if you're exercising) and start again the next day.


This is only a strategy for short-term weight loss. A balanced breakfast each morning is important for long-term dieting, as skipping breakfast often leads to overeating later on.
Fasting can increase fat oxidation, helping you shed fat weight much quicker., Many companies make ""snack packs,"" and low-cal options, and indulging in something sweet, if in moderation, can actually prevent overeating later.That said, you want to space these snacks out. Instead of having that single low-cal cookie right after lunch, as dessert wait 1-2 hours and have it as a snack. This will keep you less hungry for longer and make it easier to space out your calories. Some good snacks include:


A banana
A handful of berries.
1-2 tablespoons of nuts.
Low-cal bars, snacks, and energy drinks., Caffeine, when taken in moderation, is an effective appetite suppressant.While there is no strong evidence that caffeine consumption leads to long-term weight loss, it can help you make short term gains by increasing your metabolism and simultaneously turning down your appetite.

, Regular water drinkers have a much, much easier time avoiding snacks or overeating, so keep a water bottle on hand throughout the entire day.When you're hungry in between meals, sip some water-- it will likely hold you over until meal time.

, You will not be eating a whole lot of food to lose weight. A diet for rapid weight loss should be around 1,000 calories a day, which is eaten up faster than you might think. A sample diet (including breakfast) could include:



Breakfast: An apple, a hard boiled egg, and a handful of nuts.

Lunch: Small piece of grilled chicken, 1 cup of low-fat yogurt, banana.

Snack: Small salad.

Dinner: 1-2 hard boiled eggs, cucumber, pepper, and chickpea salad. You can also try out these meals, each under 300 calories."

Know what a healthy weight is for your body type.,
Figure out how many calories you need to eat and burn.,
Understand and track calorie intake.,
Plan to keep a log.,
Get support.,
Consult a physician.",How to Lose a Lot of Weight over the Summer1," To determine what your healthy goal weight should be, use the body mass index (BMI), which is an indicator of body fatness. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of the person's height in meters (m). Identify the weight you would like to be in kilograms and then divide that by your height in metres to see whether it is healthy. Increase or decrease that goal weight so that it fits within the BMI range considered healthy:A BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight.
A BMI of 18.5-24.9 is a normal or healthy weight.
A BMI of 25-29.9 is considered overweight, while a BMI greater than 30 is considered obese.
Along with finding a healthy weight, also realize what is realistic. If you are 100 lb away from your healthy body weight with only a month before summer, consider setting a smaller, more attainable goal.;
, The more calories you cut back, the more weight you will lose; however, it is important that you do not eat less than your Basal Metabolic Rate, the amount of calories your body needs to function effectively when at rest. This number can be calculated using an online BMR calculator.


In general, don't aim to lose more than one to two pounds per week. A loss of one to two pound per week is a healthy rate at which to lose weight; any more than this could be too drastic a change and may signify that your body is not getting what it needs. To do this, try to eat 250 fewer calories per day and burn an extra 250 calories a day. This ratio will create enough of a calories deficit that you should lose one pound per week., During the summertime, you are surrounded by opportunities to eat, whether it’s at a barbecue, pool party, ice cream party, or summer luau. However, if you want to lose weight over the summer, it's important that you cut back on the number of calories you eat. As a general rule, weight loss occurs when you burn more calories than you consume.


To help figure out how many calories you normally eat each day, track your food for a day by writing down the number of calories on everything you eat and drink. Calories are listed on the back of food labels. For foods that do not have labels, you can find information about the caloric value of certain foods online through the USDA Food Database.Pay attention to the number of servings you eat and multiply this by the number of calories per serving. For example, if you at 30 chips and a serving size is 15 chips, you need to multiply the number of calories by two since you ate two servings.
Once you have figured out how many calories you normally eat, cut down this number by 500-1000 calories per day in order to lose weight.

, In this log, record what you eat and the type and duration of exercise you're doing every day. This is a simple yet very powerful tool to keep yourself accountable. The log will help you track your progress and see whether you are keeping to your healthy diet and exercise regimen.This is a wonderful way to hold yourself accountable and stay on track. There are many apps for smart phones that have capabilities to track food intake, energy expenditure, water intake and more!
Often, we tend to overlook the snacking we do between meals and instead think our diet is not working. Studies have shown that most people underestimate how much they eat by 25 percent.In addition, many of us think we get more exercise and burn more calories than we do.Use the log to identify how many calories your exercise—whether it be a run on the treadmill or a spin on the bike—is burning. If you use cardio machines at a gym, the number of calories is usually digitally calculated and displayed. Make sure to put in your particulars, such as weight and age, to achieve an accurate count. There are also online charts that can help tell you how many calories a half hour or an hour of a given exercise burns.
You might also discover useful information about your daily habits and a reality check about how many calories you actually consume and burn off through exercise. Once you know your habits and patterns better, you can begin to address problem behaviors that are hindering your progress.

, Find a partner—whether that be a spouse, friend, or family member—who wants to join you during outdoor activities, hit the gym with you, or join your healthy eating plan. Having social support will make it easier to lose weight because the other person will also keep you accountable and be a sounding board for any obstacles and struggles you face along the way.


If you cannot find a friend or partner to help you with your weight loss journey, utilizing the services of a personal trainer or registered dietitian will keep you accountable and help you stay active and eat healthy. A trainer can also be a huge support system. Think outside of the box for your support system!

, Always consult your physician before beginning any type of weight loss and/or exercise program. You should also consult your physician throughout your weight loss program and keep him updated of any changes or symptoms you may be experiencing, such as constipation thanks to your new diet plan or lethargy due to not getting enough food.


In addition, you should also talk to your doctor if you are eating well, tracking your calories and watching what you eat, exercising, and are still not losing weight. This could be indicative of a more serious underlying medical condition, such as a thyroid problem.

Eat more plant-based foods.,
Eat breakfast.,
Opt for healthier oils.,
Cut back on sugar.,
Skip the restaurants.",How to Lose a Pound a Week2," Fruits and vegetables are part of a well-balanced and healthy eating plan. There are many different ways to lose or maintain a healthy weight and eating more fruits and vegetables along with whole grains and lean meats, nuts, and beans is a safe and healthy one.


Fruits and veggies are generally dense and still low-calorie. That means you'll feel full even though you're eating less. And that means you'll lose weight.
Helping control your weight is not the only benefit of eating more fruits and vegetables. Diets rich in fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer and other chronic diseases. Fruits and vegetables also provide essential vitamins and minerals, fiber, and other substances that are important for good health., It may seem a bit counterintuitive (even though you've heard it a million times before), but those who eat breakfast, in general, weigh less. And people who have successfully lost weight and kept it off especially abide by this mantra.


It's tempting to think that skipping breakfast means consuming fewer calories, but you'll probably end up picking up your morning slack by eating more for lunch and dinner. In general, those who play hooky at breakfast nibble more during the day and binge at both later meals. If you skip breakfast, you're pretty much setting yourself up for weight gain., Most commercial vegetable oils are a mixture of unidentified oils (fat, fat, and more fat) that have been extracted with chemicals.Definitely not good for you or your waistline. Compared to their other oily friends, canola and olive oils are rich in the good fats -- the monounsaturated kind -- and keep LDL levels low and HDL levels high. That's good, by the way.Whenever you can, make the switch.


Keep in mind that olive oil, even though it's chock full of healthy fats, is still high in calories (this goes for other healthy oils, too). Use them only in moderation and as substitutes for other fatty foods, like butter or margarine. Don't use them on top of what you're already eating. And unhealthy foods, for the record, aren't any better when soaking in olive oil.

, The easiest way to do this is to ditch the processed foods. The more processing that a food goes through, the more additives and less nutrients it contains. Processing removes a great deal (if not all) of the vitamins, minerals and fiber in most foods. And then, processing adds in unhealthy fats, a ton of sugar or sugar substitute and synthetic vitamins and minerals.


Most of these ingredients, including artificial sweeteners, artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrup, are not even recognized as edible by your body. Think about that. You wouldn't eat a bowl of paper clips, so why would you eat something else that wasn't actually food? These non-food ingredients are considered toxins and most will end up languishing in your system, often stored with fat.No thank you.
Processed generally means something that's gone through packaging. Yep, that even goes for diet meals. If it's been vacuum-packed, those nutrients have been vacuumed out.

, When you cook yourself, you get to control every calorie that goes into your meal; not so with restaurants. Even something that sounds healthy by name might have been fried in butter or oil, doused with salt, or packed with preservatives to keep it fresh longer. To know exactly what you're getting into, it's just easier to make it in your own kitchen.


Alright, so it's a little unreasonable to ask you to skip the social aspect of many activities (eating, that is). So when you do find yourself in that booth faced with a menu full of meals over 1,000 calories, make it easy and take half to go. Odds are the portions are two serving sizes, anyway.

Start moving.,
Add on weight training.,
Don't forget about the small stuff.",How to Lose a Pound a Week3," To scorch that body fat, doing steady aerobic exercise is rule #1. A brisk walk most days of the week is a good place to start. And if you can run, even better. Aim for at least 30 minutes of activity 5 days a week to make your goal easily achievable (and to reap the health benefits).


Dancing, swimming, boxing, basketball, and tennis are all great cardio workouts, too. To make it a bit more enjoyable, grab a buddy and hit the floor, the pool, the arena, or the court.

, So cardio may be the quickest way to blast away calories, but when you do both, the effect is even better.And when you do start losing weight, you'll want to lose fat, not muscle. Aim to weight train a couple times a week.


While cardio can (and should) be done most days of the week, keep working with weights to 2 or 3. Your muscles need time to heal themselves.

, When you work 9 to 5 (or even longer), sometimes being asked to work out sounds like a joke. Cooking your own meal is a big endeavor after a long day; running for half an hour is just out of the question. So take little efforts all throughout the day instead -- the effect does add up over time.


Skip out on the elevator and park far away from the entrance at work or while shopping. Go out of your way to keep moving when at all possible. This goes double if you work at a desk all day -- your brain will feel invigorated with the movement, too.

"
"
Switch up your exercise routine.,
Don't sweat the setbacks.,
Think forward.",How to Lose a Pound a Week4," As you become more fit, your body will grow accustomed to the workouts you're putting it through. If you only read one genre of books, would you be well-read? No. So keep surprising your body -- it needs to be as well-balanced as you are.


Vary the duration, intensity, and frequency, and type of activities you do. If you like walking, do it uphill, downhill, inside, and outside and for different amounts of time. If you're a swimmer, try rowing. Dancer? Take a step class. Your attention will last longer to boot.

, In this path to weight loss, there are gonna be days where a candy bar can and will solve all your problems. That's fine. Just make sure you realize that after the candy bar, you're gonna start fresh. Don't let the occasional setback tell you to give up.


Staying positive is key to maintaining motivation. If you're hard on yourself, it'll be that much easier to give up. Concentrate on your progress, not what you wish you were capable of. In addition to writing down what you eat and drink in your journal, write down the milestones you've hit and the new things you've accomplished, exercise-wise.

, Sometimes our current situation just stares us in the face and it's hard to remember that our current selves determine our future selves. It may seem like a lot of work now, but the benefits in the future are truly great. Remember who you're on the path to being and keep your head up. Eventually the future will be now.


Focusing on the future will orient you to your goals. If you concentrate too much on the present, it's easy to get bogged down by worry or complacency. Unfortunately, immediate gratification isn't how worthwhile things work. Remind yourself of why you started this journey in the first place and how good it'll feel to meet your goals.

Set reasonable weight loss goals.,
Ensure your body can handle exercise.,
Stretch before and after working out.,
Employ “low-impact” workouts.,
Monitor how your body is feeling throughout the workout.,
Be consistent.,
Assess your progress.,
Do not be discouraged.",How to Lose 60 Pounds2," Your body can only take so much exercise before it breaks down. As such, it is important not to set workout regimens that are far beyond your body’s physical capabilities. Also, keep in mind that changing your lifestyle in minor ways (walking or biking instead of driving, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, etc.) can increase the amount of physical exercise you get throughout the day, making intensive workout sessions less necessary.Setting goals that are too steep can create a negative environment and cause you to give up. Try setting smaller goals, week-by-week, instead of big goals that seem unobtainable.

, It is important to know what your body is capable of with regards to exercise. If you have bad knees, avoid running or jogging on hard surfaces. If you have a heart condition or other ailment, be sure to check with a medical professional about workout regimens that will be safe for you., Make sure you prepare your body for the workout ahead by stretching your muscles prior to exercising. This will help you avoid injuries. Stretching afterwards will help prevent soreness.


Be aware that injuries while working out essentially put your weight loss plans on hold. A pulled muscle or torn tendon will stop you from working out for weeks or months at a time and you will gain all the weight you lost right back., While a “low-impact” workout might sound detrimental to losing weight quickly, this simply means avoid unnecessary strain on your joints and muscles during workouts. Walking and jogging are effective and proven alternatives to running. Various machines, such as ellipticals, stair-climbers, and rowing machines, will ensure your body is not taking on unnecessary strain during cardio workouts.In addition to running, jogging, swimming or walking, simple exercises like arm circles, up down planks, squats, leg lifts,plie squat rises,bench dips, kicks, duck walks, lunges, and other exercises can all be useful techniques to help you lose weight.

, Make sure you keep track of your pulse, breathing and heart rate during the workout to be certain your body is handling the strain of the exercise properly. If you notice any sudden or irregular changes in your body functions, see a doctor or medical professional immediately., Working out every once in awhile will have little to no impact on your body weight. Once you have established an exercise plan, stick to it on a daily basis. There are two reasons for this. First, you will only lose weight when exercise is carried out consistently. Secondly, intermittent or periodic workouts will ultimately make it harder for you to achieve your weight loss goals because they do not contribute to increasing the time or intensity you can put into exercise.Results can take time. Stick to it and remember that all things worth having may take a while. It will be challenging but worth it.

, If you don’t have a scale, get one! In order to ensure that your workout is helping you lose weight, you need to be able to track your weight.

, Weight loss through exercise will not happen instantaneously. It takes a long time to see measurable results and, on some occasions, you may gain weight before you lose it. Stick to your exercise plan and give it a chance to work."

He or she may recommend alternative treatments, diets, therapies or workout programs that will help you avoid the complications and limitations of gastric bypass surgery.Also, some people who would be prime candidates for gastric bypass surgery are actually too large to undergo the procedure. This is an equally important reason to visit your doctor and discuss the realities of surgery as a solution to your weight problem., A doctor will tell you if you are an eligible candidate for gastric bypass surgery and should also inform you of the limitations you will face after the surgery. These limitations often include extremely limited ability to intake food, severe dietary restrictions on the types of food you can eat, and discomfort in the stomach during or after eating., Gastric bypass surgery is not to be taken lightly. It is an invasive medical procedure that will require you to take time off of work for recovery and will likely require the assistance of a friend or family member in the hours and days after your procedure. So, be sure to plan ahead., Once you have undergone the gastric bypass surgery, you will need to closely follow your doctor’s recommendations for recovery to ensure a successful outcome. Also, gastric bypass surgeries require follow-up appointments to gauge how you are recovering from the procedure.If you are undergoing this procedure ostensibly to improve your appearance, be aware that other surgeries are often required to remove excess skin and to reshape the affected area so that it will be pleasing to the eye."

Knowing your BMR is essential to determining how many additional calories you need to burn through exercise. For example:


You've cut your diet to a measly 1,200 calories a day for the week.
Your BMR is 2,200 calories a day. This means that, if you didn't move all day, you'd burn that many calories.

Step on the scale in your underwear and make a note of your current weight. Keeping a small journal of your weight fluctuations is proven to keep you on track with your weight-loss goals., It doesn't have to be the same routine that you used to burn the weight, but you need to do something. People who have gained significant weight and spent months not exercising have slower metabolisms, and will have to work harder than someone who was never overweight to keep the weight off. While this is not a fun reality to face, knowing this fact is important to prevent regaining your 7 lbs.Walk 2-3 miles a day, 4-5 days a week.
Sign up for a yoga, aerobic, or spinning class to ensure an hour of exercise 1-2 times a week.
Aim to work out 4-5 times a week, not 1-2 for a long period of time. Regular exercise is better for your metabolism than occasional long runs.

, Muscle building, through weight lifting and strength training, is essential for a fully functioning metabolism that keeps the weight from coming back. You should build muscle 2-3 times a week, work on push-ups, sit-ups, dips, and planks, all exercises you can do at home.If you can, get a gym membership so you can work on muscle building every week.


, Keeping chips and soda in the house, even if you tell yourself they are ""just as an occasional treat,"" means that you will eventually eat them. But if you cut the temptation before the chips even enter the house you will be much more successful at dieting. Just don't buy junk food, and don't keep it in the cabinets. You'll be surprised how little temptation you have when there is nothing around to tempt you.

Limit alcohol consumption.,
Avoid fast food and most processed foods.,
Add good fats to your diet.,
Opt for lean meats.,
Incorporate more fish into your diet.,
Choose low-fat dairy options.,
Eat more whole grains.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Eat foods with a high water content.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Lose a Lot of Weight over the Summer2," Research has shown that alcohol can increase appetite and how much food you consume. Moreover, most types of alcohol, including beer and liquor, have been associated with belly fat specifically. (Wine appears to be an exception.) However, you don't need to cut out all alcohol, but instead limit yourself to one to two glasses of wine or clear liquor a day. Remember that when the liver is focused on processing alcohol, it cannot be focused on fat loss. To keep the liver focused on fat loss, consider eliminating alcohol altogether and taking a liver cleansing supplement to keep it in tip-top shape.
Stick to wine and liquor. A 5-ounce glass of wine or 1-ounce shot of liquor has about 100 calories, while a standard 12-ounce beer has 150 calories.
Avoid mixed drinks and summer favorites like margaritas and daiquiris, which are usually loaded up with sugar.
One 2010 study showed that women who consumed a light to moderate amount of alcohol actually gained less weight and had a reduced risk of becoming overweight than non-drinkers across a 13-year period., Most of these are empty calorie foods. ""Empty calorie"" foods are those which have calories (from sugar and/or solid fats) but little to no nutritional value. Further, many processed and refined foods, like white flour, white bread, and white rice, also lack B vitamins and other nutrients. Many also often contain partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats) or refined sugars (think high fructose corn syrup), which are extremely unhealthy.Foods and beverages that provide the most number of empty calories for Americans include cakes, cookies, chips, pastries and donuts, sodas, energy drinks, fruit drinks, cheese, pizza, ice cream, bacon, hot dogs and sausages. You can see how this is an especially big problem in the summer!
Sometimes you can find better or alternate versions of these foods. For example, you can purchase low-fat hot dogs and low-fat cheese at grocery stores. You can also have sugar-free drinks. In other foods, like candy and regular soda, all the calories are basically empty.Avoid saturated fats, like those in animal products, such as red meat, butter, and lard.

, Replace those bad fats with good fats, though you'll always need to keep even the good fats in moderation. Monounsaturated fats have been clinically proven to help you burn fat, especially in your midsection. So, add foods like avocados, kalamata olives, olive oil, almonds, walnuts, and flaxseed to your diet to help facilitate weight loss.Fats are our friend! Healthy fats can provide satiety, eliminate cravings, improve joint pain, promote hormone production and more!
Try to make healthy substitutions wherever you can, such as olive oil instead of butter in your cooking or a small handful of 10 to 12 almonds instead of a pre-packaged cookie for a snack.

, Meats are a popular food found at summer barbecues and parties. In order to lose weight over the summer, it is important to choose meats that are lower in fat, which most red and processed meats, like hamburgers, hot dogs, sausages, and steaks, are not. Leaner meat options include turkey, chicken, center cut pork loin, or extra lean ham steaks.Remove any skin or visible fat before cooking and eating meat. You can also purchase some meat, such as chicken or turkey breasts, skinless.
You don't need to cut out red meat entirely but instead make better choices. For instance, when buying ground beef or turkey, choose meats that are 93% lean or higher (in other words, 7% fat or less). If you are grilling steaks, choose a leaner cut of steak, such as a top sirloin steak or round steak.

, Try and eat fish at least twice times per week. Fish, particularly salmon, mackerel, and tuna, is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which our bodies cannot make and get from our diet.These omega-3 fatty acids may also help you lose weight.Fish is also an excellent source of protein and a good choice if you're looking to phase out fatty meats.

, Opting for lower fat dairy options will help reduce the amount of saturated fat you consume, thereby helping you lose weight (since saturated fats contribute to weight gain).Buy milk and cottage cheese with 1% fat or less. Choose low-fat or fat-free yogurts.
When buying cheese, pick hard cheeses that are lower in fat, such as cheddar or parmesan Avoid the soft and gooey cheeses.

, Whole grains are loaded with fiber and minerals that are essential for a healthy body weight. Not to mention, whole grains fill you up and keep you full.


Eat 100% whole wheat bread instead of white or wheat bread, brown rice instead of white rice, whole wheat pasta instead of white pasta.
Eat more oats such as steel cut oats, old-fashioned oats, or quick oats.

, Fruits and vegetables are an essential part of a nutritious diet; they're low in calories and packed full of important vitamins, nutrients, and minerals. Adding more fruits and vegetables will help you lose weight and also make you healthier in the long run in part because they are high in fiber that can help you feel full longer and prevent you from overeating. In addition, Many fruits and vegetables are in season during the summer making it easier to add them to your diet since there are more available and they tend to be less expensive.Children aged nine and older and adults should consume 1.5 to 2 cups of fruit and 2.5 to 3 cups of vegetables every day. A good way to achieve these recommended amounts is to make sure that at each meal, your plate is 2/3 loaded up with fresh produce.
Try color blocking. Make sure your meals have lots of colors; the best way to do this is by adding lots of fresh produce, from eggplant to beets to kale to yellow peppers. This color blocking usually helps you eat more produce and makes the meal look appetizing and appealing at the same time!One way to add more fruits and veggies to your diet, cut calories, and still enjoy the foods you love is to add or ""hide"" veggies to dishes. Researchers have found that adding pureed vegetables to dishes (e.g., cauliflower to mac and cheese) helped people eat a few hundred calories less of the dishes.Veggies add but bulk to a dish but not really a ton of extra calories.

, Studies have shown that people who eat foods with high water content have lower body mass indexes. The water in these foods helps keep you full for longer so you eat less overall. Unsurprisingly, foods with the highest water content are fruits and vegetables, thus hitting two birds with one stone!Watermelon and strawberries have about 92 percent water per volume. Other fruits with high water content include grapefruit, cantaloupe, and peaches. Remember, though, that many fruits are high in sugar, so try to limit how much fruit you eat daily. For vegetables, cucumber and lettuce have the highest water content at 96 percent. Zucchini, radish and celery have a water content of 95 percent.

, Staying hydrated over the summer is extremely important. With higher temperatures and more physical activity, your body needs more water due to excess sweating. Drinking water has been shown to increase weight loss in women who are also dieting to lose weight.Although the exact mechanisms as to how water aides in weight loss are unknown, it may be that water consumption facilitates weight loss because it keeps you full for longer and gives your body energy and provides your water with enough water to efficiently burn fat. Drink the recommended 13 cups per day for men and nine cups per day for women to help you lose more weight over the summer.If you have a hard time drinking enough water, you can also try to stay hydrated and nourished with these fun, summer ideas:


Make your own smoothies. The perfect way to make a single serving smoothie is to fill the container halfway with leafy greens (such as spinach or kale), fill the other half with fruits (banana, berries, mango, etc), add some type of nutritional boost (such as flaxseed, chia seeds, or almonds), pour 8 fluid ounces of liquid on top (such as water, 1% milk, almond milk, or soy milk), and blend together until smooth.
Make homemade popsicles. Homemade popsicles are an excellent way to stay hydrated as well as stay cool during the summer heat. They can be made just like a smoothie and then poured into a popsicle mold and frozen overnight. Another healthy and refreshing way to make popsicles is to fill up the mold halfway with water and the other half with 100% fruit juice (not fruit cocktail or any other juice ""blend"". These have additional sugars that will not aid in weight loss). Freeze overnight.
Make infused water. Infused waters are an excellent way to add flavor to your water and make it more palatable if you're not a fan of drinking plain water. Infused waters are made by soaking freshly chopped fruits and vegetables in water for a minimum of 30 minutes to add flavor to the water. Some popular combinations for infused water include raspberry-lemon, strawberry-kiwi, and cucumber-lime.

Eat slowly.,
Create an environment conducive to eating.,
Stop eating when you feel full.,
Drink water while eating.,
Manage eating out.",How to Lose a Lot of Weight over the Summer3," Most people take eat too fast and take in too much food and too many calories before they actually realize they're full. Your brain takes around 20 minutes to register feelings of fullness, suggesting that you need to slow down so that your brain can properly communicate that you're full. And remember, feeling full usually means eating less or stopping eating.Mindful eating is a tactic that many use to stay at a healthy weight. You simply eat when truly hungry and stop when full. The brain will let you know when you're full as long as you give it time to do so. Also, differentiate between true hunger and boredom/habit/emotional hunger.
If you don't feel full immediately after a meal, wait. The chemicals your brain releases when you eat or drink take time to rise and to communicate that sense of fullness. As the chemicals increase, your hunger dissipates; this is why you should pause for a little bit after eating and before having a second helping.

, Use utensils and sit at a table when eating. Eating with your hands will mean that you take in more food in one scoop. Don't turn on a TV or anything that may distract you. Typically, people who eat in front of a television tend to eat more because they're not focused on what they're doing and how much they're eating.


Studies also show that people who eat with larger utensils eat less than those who eat with smaller utensils. Another good idea is to put your food on a smaller plate so it looks more full and tricks your mind., When you feel comfortably satiated after eating, stop and put your utensils and napkin on the plate to signal that you're finished. This is also a signal to yourself that you're done with your meal as well as to those around you.


Remember, you don't have to eat all of your meal once you feel satisfied. Satisfied and satiated is different than feeling stuffed. Eat until you are 80% full. No one should feel stuffed and sick after eating., In many cases, we mistake thirst for hunger which means we eat when it's not necessary. By keeping yourself well hydrated you'll feel hungry less as well as getting a clearer complexion and shinier hair. Sip water as you eat as well to ensure proper digestion and also to help with fullness.


If you're not sure what you're feeling is actually hunger, try drinking a big glass of water and then wait a few minutes. If you don't feel hungry anymore, it's because your body was actually in need of water, not food., Eating in restaurants or at other people's homes during the summer season can be a real challenge. You want to eat, but you also don't want to eat the wrong things and risk backtracking on your progress.To avoid overeating when out, eat a small and healthy snack at home beforehand. Try some carrots and hummus or an apple. A small snack before hand will curb your hunger and keep your head clear while you make healthy and informed choices at a party, BBQ, or restaurant.
At the beginning of the meal, ask for a doggie bag, and put what you aren't going to eat in the bag. If you're at a friends, only eat until you're full and avoid filling up your plate to the brim; your eyes are most definitely bigger than your stomach!
Be wary of fatty foods masked as healthy. Many salads with dressings can be very fatty and full of calories. Your seemingly ""healthy choice"" of a salad can pack as many calories as a burger if it’s swimming in a fatty dressing. Be also wary of other high-calorie additions like bacon bits and cheese."

Make physical activity part of your everyday routine.,
Get aerobic activity.,
Do strength training.,
Consider joining a gym.,
Do at-home workouts.,
Get outside.",How to Lose a Lot of Weight over the Summer4," While changing your diet and cutting calories typically has a stronger effect on weight loss than physical activity, daily physical activity, including routine exercise, is more significant in maintaining your weight loss and avoiding weight regain. Aim for at least 30 minutes of overall physical activity per day.Log all of this activity, even strength training.


Physical activity is not only important for weight loss but has also been shown to help prevent a number of diseases and medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and type II diabetes. It can also reduce symptoms of depression or anxiety, which will make your summertime more enjoyable if you suffer from these things., Spend 150 minutes each week doing moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Note that this is just a guide; the exact amount of physical activity required to lose and maintain weight is unclear and varies from person to person. If you're not seeing results (and are sticking to your healthy diet plan), then consider increasing your aerobic activity until you see a weekly weight loss of a pound or two per week.Moderate-intensity exercise means that you can still carry on a conversation while performing the activity even though your heart rate is elevated and your breathing becomes more intense. Examples include brisk walking (15-minute mile), light yard or outside work (raking leaves, shoveling snow, mowing the lawn), biking at an easy pace, etc.
Vigorous-intensity exercise means that you are breathing too heavily to maintain a conversation. Examples include jogging or running, swimming laps, jumping rope, biking at a faster pace or on an incline, competitive sports, such as football, basketball or soccer, among other activities.

, Strength training is also important for weight loss and preventing loss of muscle and bone mass.Strength training can be done in your day-to-day life, such as lifting heavy boxes and groceries or doing heavy gardening or other yard work. Pushups, sit-ups, and plank poses are also great exercises which require no special equipment or environment and instead use your own body weight as resistance. You can also use weight machines or lift free weights at a gym to build strength. Make sure to focus on all muscle groups when doing strength training.


If you're interested in strength training but aren't sure how to build muscle in all areas of your body, consider getting a personal trainer, who can show you the different types of exercises needed to strengthen all muscle groups. While this is an added cost, a trainer will also ensure that you are doing exercises correctly and in proper form, thereby reducing the risk of injuring yourself.

, Joining a gym is an excellent way to stay active during the summertime. Some gyms even have specials for students as a way to encourage young people to keep active; in addition, there may also be other summertime specials or discounts to encourage people, who are often busy and out of town in the summer, to get back into the gym. Try to find a gym in your neighborhood; if it's too far away you likely won't be motivated to go as frequently.Gyms usually also have personal trainers available for consultation and hire. Some gyms also have exercise classes that can help you diversify your work out and work different muscle groups. Some people also find exercise classes to be more motivating than exercising on their own. Another benefit of a gym is that you may make new friends!If personal trainers and gyms are not your thing, consider group fitness such as dance, aerobics, and more.

, You can also get more exercise without becoming a gym rat by doing exercise right into the comfort of your own home. Thanks to the internet, there are tons of workout routines and videos available online; you can do everything from a 10-minute cardio work out, to a hips, thighs and legs workout to a one-hour yoga class right in your own home.Exercising at home is ideal for people who can't afford to join a gym or sports club or who are concerned about exercising in public. At-home routines enable you to get a fun, studio-quality workout in the comfort and privacy of your own home.
Remember, however, that if you're following a video to only do what you're capable of and to try to maintain proper form. If you injure yourself, there is no one there to help, so be cautious about what activities or videos you follow online. A good idea is to watch the video or read the full exercise plan before undertaking it to ensure that this is something you feel comfortable and safe doing.

, Working out in a gym isn’t the only way to stay active and participate in physical activity during the summertime. With the nice weather that often accompanies summer, there are many opportunities to go outside and be active. In so doing, you can both take advantage of the amazing summer weather and also work to lose weight! Here are some fun outdoor activities you can partake in during the summer:Remember to MOVE. Keep your body moving. If you have a sedentary job, make it a priority to take the stairs, park further away and walk around on breaks.
Play a sport. Join a summer sports league or find friends to play a friendly game of soccer, volleyball, football, baseball, and more.
Go for a brisk walk, jog, or run. Find a trail, track, or other scenic area in your neighborhood to go for a walk or run and build up your cardiovascular strength.
Go for a bike ride. Find a bike path, park or bike-friendly road to go for a ride and work your legs in the fresh air.

Cut out between 500 – 750 calories each day. This will help you lose anywhere from 0.5 – 1.0 kg (1 – 2 pounds) per week.In combination with exercise you may be able to lose 1.3 kg (3 pounds) per week; however, this not a guarantee.
Use a food journal, calorie tracking website or smartphone app to help get an idea of how many calories you currently consume. Subtract 500 or 750 from this number to get a new calorie limit to help you lose weight.
Do not eat less than 1,200 calories daily. It's generally thought that eating less than this is not safe as its difficult to consume the recommended amount of nutrients you need daily.;
, Protein is a great food group to help support weight loss — especially if you're looking to lose weight quickly.


Protein is an essential nutrient to any diet. Studies have shown that it can keep you satisfied longer and with less food in addition to supporting your metabolism.To help you reap the weight loss benefits of protein, try to include at least one serving (75 – 120g or 3 – 4.5 oz) at each meal and snack.Eating protein throughout the day can help spread its satiating effect over the entire day.Stick to lean protein choices as these foods also contain fewer calories. Go with: skinless poultry, lean pork, seafood, legumes, tofu, low-fat dairy and eggs.

, Fruits and vegetables are great food groups to eat regularly when you're trying to lose weight. Fill up on these foods at each meal and snack.


Both fruits and vegetables are fairly low in calories, but high in fiber and other essential nutrients. They are filling and add bulk to your meals without adding many calories.
Make half your plate a fruit or a vegetable. Or, include one to two servings of either per meal. One portion is equal to four heaped tablespoons of cooked kale or spinach, one medium fruit (like an apple or pear), 30 g dried fruit (like raisins), or a 5 centimeter (2 in) slice of a large fruit (like melon or papaya)., 100% whole grains are a more nutritious choice compared to refined grains like wheat bread, white flour or white rice. Choose these types of grains more often.100% whole grains are less processed and are typically higher in fiber, protein and other beneficial nutrients. Processed grains have these nutrients stripped and are therefore less nutritious.Keep your grain intake to a minimum. There has been some research that lower carb diets or those that limit grains result in faster weight loss than low-calorie diets alone.Also, stick to the appropriate servings of grains. Measure out about 28 g (1 oz) of grains like cooked oats or quinoa when you choose to eat them., Drinking enough water is great for your health and may also help support your weight loss.


Some studies have shown that when you haven't consumed enough water and are dehydrated, your body sends signals to your brain that feel very similar to hunger.Many people may eat when they think they're hungry when they're actually just thirsty.
Also, filling up on water can help decrease hunger throughout the day can help decrease snacking or nibbling on extra calories.
Aim to drink at last 2 liters (0.53 US gal) (eight 8-oz glasses) of water and other hydrating fluids daily.You can try flavored water and unsweetened decaf coffee and teas as well.

, The best combination for weight loss is monitoring your diet and exercising regularly. Add in physical activity most days of the week to help support your weight loss.The number one calorie burner for physical activity is cardio. Aim for 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity activities or 75 minutes of high-intensity exercise.Also try adding in one to two days of strength training.These exercises don't burn as many calories, but may also help support a faster metabolism over time, as muscle burns fat, even while you are at rest.Take more steps during the day. Moving as much as you can throughout the day can also add to your total calories burned throughout the day. Try parking farther away, taking the stairs instead of the elevator and standing more than you sit.

, Even in a short 30 day period, inadequate sleep may have an affect on your weight loss. Get enough sleep each night to help you reach your goal.


Most health experts recommend getting at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night for adults.Work on improving your sleep hygiene, which includes going to bed earlier and making your bedroom a good environment for sleep.
Some studies have shown that when you do not sleep enough, your body has a difficult time losing weight, has increased secretions of hunger hormones and may even begin to crave higher fat, higher carb foods.In addition, if you're feeling tired and fatigued you may be less motivated to stay on track with your exercise and healthy eating plan.

, Like sleep, chronic stress or low-grade stress can work against your weight loss. This is especially true if you're trying to lose weight in 30 days.


Stress has a major effect on your ability to lose weight. Even minor daily stresses can increase your body's cortisol level, which is a hormone linked to stress. Sometimes this makes it difficult for your body to lose weight and can increase your hunger levels.In addition, stress can make you feel tired and fatigued which can throw you off track from your meal prepping, exercising and other healthy lifestyle changes.
Try doing some relaxing, stress-relieving activities like: meditation, listening to music, talking to a supportive friend, or taking a walk.

, Within your 30 day period, it might be helpful to start a weight loss journal. You can take notes about your food intake, exercise and overall progress. You can also write about any challenges or successes you have during your 30 day diet.


When trying to lose 6 kg in 30 days, you may realize you cannot make your exact goal at the end of that 30 days — that's okay. If you've kept a journal about your successful diet and exercise plan, you can continue with these notes until you actually do meet your goal.
Write down your meal plans or record what you eat in your journal. This will be very helpful to you along your diet and if you continue with your weight loss. You'll be able to see what works and what doesn't.
You may also want to write down notes about what exercise plan or pattern works best for your as well.
You can also use websites or apps on your smartphone to track your calories and exercise.

, It can be difficult to follow a strict diet for an entire month. Keeping your goals and motivations front and center can help keep you focused.


You can write out these little motivational sayings in your journal or on post-it notes and stick them on the fridge, on your desk at work or by your bedside.
Think about why you want to lose weight. Is it to get into a smaller pant size? Is it to help you feel more confident? Or to help you manage a chronic disease? Write out these reasons so you can be reminded of the reason why you want to lose weight.
When you're feeling challenged or down about your diet, review these little quotes and motivational sayings. Repeat them to yourself so you can start to feel a little more positive about sticking to your plan.

, Whether it's with a friend, family member, your food journal or the scale, it helps to keep accountable when you're trying to lose weight.Tell friends and family members about your 30 day diet and desire to lose some weight. You can have them support you but you can also call, text or email them your progress.
Getting on the scale regularly is another way to stay accountable. Those who weigh in regularly generally see more weight loss long-term. Don't weight yourself too often, though — once or twice a week is enough to track your progress.

Calories, simply put are units of energy; in nutrition speak, they are units that are used to measure the amount of energy you take in through food and burn through physical activity.;
, The amount of calories a person needs to consume each day will change from individual to individual based on the person’s age, height, weight, amount of activity they do throughout the day, etc. There are plenty of caloric intake calculators online. You can also click here to find out how to find your caloric intake number., To lose one pound a week, you need to create a calorie deficit of about 500 a day, or 3,500 a week. To lose 50 pounds in three months, you will need to create a weekly calorie deficit of at least 14,000 calories, in order to lose about four pounds a week. That means you will need to create a 2,000 calorie daily deficit.In terms of pounds, losing 50 pounds in 3 months translates into losing 16 pounds each month (For 3 months) or losing 4.17 pounds each week (For 12 weeks).

, The very first thing you need is a diet and fitness plan. Without it, you may not be able to track your weight loss progress. The plan you come up with should be:


Specific and measurable: This means that your weight loss plan should be personalized (Specific). Everyone has a different physique, eating habits and limits to physical exertion. This is why your weight loss plan should be focused and personalized according to your weight loss and fitness needs.
Time framed and broken into milestones: Break down your ultimate goal into smaller milestones and track them over time to make sure you are on the right path. A weekly breakdown is recommended.

, Try your best to eat small meals throughout the day rather than eating three big meals. Eating small meals throughout the day will help you keep your metabolism more active and prevent hunger. Try your best to eat five meals, each around 300 calories.During each meal, try to eat one protein-rich item, a fruit or some vegetables, and one starchy carb (rice, pasta, bread, small potato, etc). This will keep your meals balanced.

, Drink eight or ideally more cups of plain water a day to keep yourself well-hydrated and flush out water weight. Believe it or not, your body will hold on to water if you do not drink enough water. So, just drink lots of water and your body will stop holding on to water weight.

, These foods are guaranteed to keep you fuller for longer and you consume fewer calories in doing so.

These foods pack up a whole lot of calories in a small serving.

, Unhealthy snacks can upset your daily target calories when you are trying to lose weight. If you are a person who eats a lot of junk food, or drinks a lot of soda or alcohol, you will need to get rid of these diet-sabotaging habits. These foods and drinks contain a lot of empty calories, and will not nourish your body in a healthy way. So cut them out of your diet completely, and try to incorporate more whole foods into your diet rather than processed junk.


Rather than munching on some chips, stock up on your favorite fruits and vegetables to snack on when you get hungry.

, Soft drinks, smoothies and all beverages with sugar are off the table. Learn to cut back on your calories by restricting calorie dense drinks. Try to go for plain water, unsweetened lemonade, black coffee (Or with skimmed milk).

, The most convenient way to keep a food journal is by using apps on your phone; there are a multitude of apps both paid and free that let you key in the foods you eat and which automatically display the calorie counts of your meals. Be sure to be diligent with your tracking, as you may overeat if you are lax with tracking.

, Try to shoot for 5 - 7 hours of exercise per week to achieve a weekly weight loss of around 4 pounds. Each session (An hour long) should burn around 400 - 600 calories. The type of exercise may vary your results but cardiovascular training is a must as it is a great calorie burner., Cardio exercises are exercises that elevate your heart rate and increase blood circulation throughout your body. Examples of cardio exercises are running, cycling, using the elliptical machine, and swimming. You will need to workout to burn around 1,500 calories a day if you are to reach your goal of losing at least 4 pounds a week.If you only have two hours to workout, then you will have to do higher intensity exercises that burn at least 750 to 800 calories each hour. Examples of high intensity workouts include spinning, high intensity Zumba, high intensity interval exercises, intense kickboxing, and running at higher speeds.
If you feel like your fitness level might not allow you to jump into extensive cardio workouts, you can start with lower impact exercises such as swimming, brisk walking (4 to 5 mph (6.4 to 8.0 km/h) pace), low impact aerobics, and so on, but do them three hours per day instead of two.

, While doing cardio is great for a big calorie burn, it does have its drawbacks. Doing a lot of cardio can cause you to lose lean muscle mass instead of just fat, which is something that you do not want. You need lean muscle to keep your metabolism at optimum levels and also give you a better looking, toned body. To maintain your muscle despite the intense cardio you will be doing, incorporate moderate weight training three times a week.You can use resistance machines at the gym, or simply work out with dumbbells at home. While strength training will not burn as many calories as cardio, it is very important to build muscle and thus boost your metabolism.

, Take the stairs, walk your dog, play with your kids; simple changes like these may not seem much but they make a big difference in the bigger picture and help you move closer to your goal of 50 pounds in 3 months.

Calculate your daily calorie allowance.,
Shop ahead for your week of meals.,
Find a weight loss buddy.,
Record what you eat in a journal.,
Go to sleep early.,
Weigh yourself in the morning.",How to Lose 5 Pounds in a Week1," Losing 5 pounds may be accomplished by fixing weak spots in your diet and exercise regime. Create a list of everything you ate in the past week. Include your daily schedule so that you can see how much activity you do. You can start recording this a week before your diet, or you can recall it from memory.


How much soda and juice do you drink?
How much sugar do you eat every day?
How much white bread and pasta do you eat?
How much do you exercise every week?
Do you sit for long periods for work?
How often do you eat out?;
, This will tell you how many calories you can eat every day. Aim to hit an area between 1,200 and 1,800. Smaller women should aim for between 1,200 and 1,500, and men should aim for 1,600 to 1,800., Buy all of your food at one time to avoid buying junk food later in the week when you might be having cravings. Shop along the perimeter of the supermarket where the whole foods and produce are located. Don’t forget to pick up berries, green, leafy veggies, whole grains and low-fat yogurt.

, Whether it’s your husband, best friend, mom or co-worker, morale helps boost weight loss results. Workout buddies can help motivate you to exercise longer. They can also help spot you on weights or split the cost of a personal trainer., As you progress through the week, write down everything you eat and drink throughout the day. Note how much of it you ate and how many calories were in the meal. Add these up at the end of the day to see if you are within your calorie allowance.You may also want to record all of your physical activity so that you know how many calories you are burning.
There are many apps for your smartphone that can help you track diet and exercise. Some even have a database of common meals and foods with the nutritional information and calorie count available to make it easier to watch your calorie intake.

, Set a bedtime for every night of the week to make sure that you get plenty of rest. Sleep is one of the secret ingredients in achieving any weight loss goal. When you are low on sleep, your body releases cortisol, a hormone that makes you store weight.When setting your bedtime, be aware that you may have to wake up earlier than usual to exercise.

, Weight can fluctuate throughout the day, so you should try to weigh yourself right after you wake up for consistent results. Aim to have lost 2 pounds (.91 kg) by Wednesday. If you do not see the results you want, check back over your activities and food journal to make sure that you were burning more calories than you were eating.

Don't weigh yourself every day.",How to Lose 50 Pounds in 2 Months," Forget diet and exercise---the hardest part of losing weight is actually making the decision to do it. You've probably told yourself you're going to lose weight in the past but never followed through; that's because you didn't really mean it. Vowing to make a change means being willing to give up what you want now (unhealthy foods) for something even better (the body you've always wanted). Once you have made an honest promise to yourself to make a change, the weight will take care of itself.;
, If you don't already know how much you weigh, then step on the scale and find out. It's important to know how much you weighed at the start of your journey so that you can better track your progress.


Use a digital scale for the most accurate results.
It's best to weigh yourself in the morning before you have eaten anything, and with little or no clothing on.
You may also find it helpful to take measurements so that you can track inches lost, especially if you plan on gaining muscle (remember that muscle weighs more than fat). Use a tape measure to measure the circumference of your arms, legs, chest, waist, and/or hips. Where you measure is up to you, and will depend on your specific weight loss goals and problem areas.

, When it comes to losing weight, diet is the most important factor. The less food you eat, the more weight you will lose; it's as simple as that. It's important that you're eating enough to sustain yourself, though. Starving yourself will only lead you to have more cravings, binge eat, and eventually fall back into old habits.


Many medical experts believe that most adults, regardless of their current weight, will lose weight if they eat about 1,200 calories per day. It may take some trial and error to find your magic number, so be sure to pay attention to how much you're eating in relation to the number on the scale so that you can make the necessary adjustments.
Start keeping track of the calories in everything you eat, including the things you would normally overlook like salad dressings, cooking sauces, cooking oils, and beverages. Read the nutrition labels on everything you buy and measure out your portion sizes. You can also use online nutritional references like Calorie King and My Fitness Pal to find the calorie content of vegetables, fruit, meat, and other foods that aren't labelled.

, Cardiovascular exercises that increase your heart rate can help burn calories and temporarily speed up your metabolism in the several hours following exercise so that you lose weight more quickly.Keep in mind, though, that exercise alone will not make you lose weight.You absolutely must change your eating habits in order to lose weight.


Aerobic exercises like jogging, biking, walking, swimming, dancing, and kickboxing are all great for burning calories while improving your overall health. If you are new to exercising, then start off slow and ease yourself into a regular workout routine. It's important to find an exercise that you genuinely enjoy so that you will actually do it every day.
Aim to get at least 20 minutes of aerobic exercise 5 days a week. If you don't have time to exercise every day, then find ways to incorporate more movement into your daily routine by making simple changes like taking the stairs rather than the elevator.
Building muscle through resistance training can also help you lose weight. The more muscle mass you have, the more calories your body burns, even at rest.Keep in mind that muscle weighs more than fat, though, so you may want to hold off on resistance training until you have already lost some weight.

, Staying properly hydrated is crucial to maintaining your overall health, but it has also been proven to aid in weight loss.This is perhaps due to the fact that water helps keep your stomach full in between meals and prevent mindless snacking.


Drinking water before a meal has been shown to aid in weight loss by reducing the amount of calories consumed during the meal.Try drinking one or two glasses of water 20 minutes before each meal to feel fuller faster.
If you don't like the ""taste"" of plain water (even though there's no taste) then infuse your water with lemon juice, lime juice, fruit, or mint leaves to add some flavor.

, Studies have found that people who keep track of what they eat by writing it down lose more weight, and keep it off, than those who don't.That's because writing down what you eat holds you more accountable to the decisions you make and helps you notice patterns in your diet so that you can determine what works and what doesn't.


Be sure to include the calories in everything you consume. That includes the calories in beverages, oils, dressings, sauces, spices, and garnishes.

, Even with the best intentions, eating out can ruin your diet quickly. Cooking meals at home makes it easier to choose healthy options and control your serving sizes. Plus, you'll be saving lots of money by eating at home!


When you do eat out, you can cut down on calories by asking for sauces and dressings on the side.
Use cooking sprays rather than olive oil or butter when cooking at home. If you do use olive oil to cook, be sure to measure out how much you are using as one tablespoon contains more than 100 calories.Pack a healthy lunch and bring it with you to work or school, and be sure to include healthy snacks like carrots, celery, and apples to keep you satisfied in between meals.

, No matter how committed you are to dieting, it's inevitable to have a slip-up every now and then. For many people, social events like birthday parties or picnics make it difficult to eat healthy--remind yourself that it's okay to indulge every once in a while. Giving up your social life for a diet will make you feel miserable and you'll be tempted to quit before reaching your goals.

, If you are clinically obese and have serious medical conditions related to being overweight, you might consider bariatric surgery. There are a few different kinds of bariatric surgery, but most methods involve either decreasing the size of the stomach or the length of the small intestineso that patients are forced to eat less.


Candidates for weight loss surgery have a BMI of 40 or higher, have been overweight for several years, and have never been able to permanently lose weight through diet and exercise.
Talk to your doctor if you think that you might be a good candidate for weight loss surgery. Remember that like any other surgery, there are risks involved. Weigh the pros and cons of the procedure before agreeing to go through with it.

, If you have the will power to lose weight the natural way but need some guidance, then joining a weight loss program may be the best choice for you. Some programs, like Jenny Craig, do most of the work for you by preparing low-calorie meals that you eat throughout the week. Others, like Weight Watchers, teach you how to make your own healthy meal choices using a ""points system"" that is based on caloric intake.


Weight loss programs help keep you accountable for the choices you make and allow you to connect with nutritionists and other dieters.

, The caffeine in tea and coffee can help curb your appetite. If you struggle with nighttime snacking, then sip on herbal tea in order to keep your mouth and mind occupied.

, Being sleep deprived not only inhibits your ability to think and function properly, it can actually increase your appetite and slow down your metabolism.Aim to get at least 7 hours of sleep every night.


Adjust your schedule if necessary. If you have to wake up very early for school or work, then slowly get in the habit going to bed earlier each night to compensate.

, Some stress is inevitable, but excess stress releases the hormone cortisol, which is responsible for fat storage, particularly in the midsection.Stress may also be an underlying cause of your overeating, since food has a calming effect for many people. Remember that eating only offers temporary relief from stress and anxiety, but doesn't actually solve any of your problems.


One way you can help relieve the amount of stress you feel on a daily basis is to learn to better manage your time. Avoid procrastinating and saving your tasks for the last minute, and keep your eye on the clock throughout the day so that you aren't constantly rushing to get to where you need to be.
Cleaning your environment can also have a tremendous impact on your stress and frustration. Set time aside every single day to clean up your environment; whether it's your bedroom, your office, your kitchen, your car, etc.
Take up meditation, yoga, or other relaxation practices to help you stay grounded and relaxed on a daily basis.

, Dieting doesn't have to mean constantly feeling miserable or deprived. If food is your main source of joy and comfort, then it's important to find something that you love even more than, or just as much as, eating to keep you feeling satisfied. This might be spending time with friends, indulging in a hobby,  going shopping, playing an instrument or sport, or even just relaxing in front of a movie or in the tub.

, The scale is a great way to track your weight loss in the long run, but weighing yourself every day will drive you crazy. Remember that everybody's weight fluctuates a few pounds throughout the day for a variety of reasons, and much of the fluctuation can be attributed to water weight. Weigh yourself twice a week at most.

This includes cereal, baked goods, cheese, lunch meats, frozen vegetables, canned soups, canned vegetables or beans, and sliced bread. Salt is a preservative (as well as a flavoring), and processed foods are rich in salt.

Recover in the steam room.",How to Lose 5 Pounds in 5 Days," In order to lose weight, you’ll need to cut out some calories from your diet.


Typically, cutting out about 500 calories daily will result in a 1-2 pound weight loss per week. However, if you’re aiming to lose 5 pounds in 5 days, you may need to cut out more calories.
Most health professionals recommend not limiting calories to less than 1200 daily. When you consume less than this amount is difficult to get adequate amounts of the required nutrients you need each day.However, if you want to follow a very low-calorie diet just for a few days, you most likely will not have many adverse side effects.
Typical side effects of very low-calorie diets (diets that are about 800 – 1,000 calories daily) include tiredness, fatigue, headache, mental fogginess, and lack of energy.Always consult your physician first. Do not start a very low-calorie diet without medical supervision.;
, Studies have shown that one of the quickest diets for weight loss is a low-carb diet.It helps you lose more fat mass and also helps you lose some water weight. Although this is not recommended as a long-term diet, following this plan for five days should be safe.


A low-carb diet is one that limits or restricts foods that contain carbohydrates. These types of foods include grains, starchy vegetables, dairy products and fruits.
It’s not healthy or smart to avoid all foods containing carbohydrates.You’d be limiting four out of the five food groups and be unable to consume the vital nutrients your body needs to function.
Limit foods that are mostly carbohydrates and do not provide a significant amount of other nutrients. These include grains and starchy vegetables. Nutrients from these foods can also be found in other food groups.
If you choose to include some carbs, aim to only have one to two servings daily. This would be 1 ounce or ½ cup of grains, ½ cup of fruitor 1 cup of starchy vegetables., For fast weight loss, limit carbs and make most of your meals “lean and green.” This means focusing mostly on lean proteins and green or non-starchy vegetables.


Include a serving or two of lean protein at every meal. One serving is typically about 3 – 4 oz or the size of a deck of cards.Lean protein foods include eggs, poultry, lean beef, pork, nuts, and seafood. Low-fat dairy products and legumes can also count as lean protein, but you may be limiting these due to their carb content.
The other half of your meal should be a non-starchy vegetable. Aim for one to two servings at each meal. One serving is 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy greens.Examples of meals fitting the “lean and green” criteria include grilled salmon over a spinach salad, stir-fry vegetables and grilled chicken or zucchini spaghetti and meatballs.

, It’s very important to stay adequately hydrated – especially when you’re trying to lose weight quickly. The myth is that dehydrating the body is a good way to lose water weight, but limiting salty foods and cleansing out the body with plain water is what can help reduce excess ""water weight.""


Hydration plays a very important role in your overall health. It helps maintain your body temperature, protect your organs and even lubricates your joints.
Most health professionals suggest consuming about eight to 13 glasses of water or other hydrating fluids daily.This amount will vary depending on your age, gender and activity level.
In addition to maintaining adequate hydration status, drinking fluids can also aid in weight loss. It’s been suggested to drink one to two glasses of water before a meal to help cut down on your portions or if you’re feeling hungry.Aim to only consume no-calorie, hydrating beverages like water, flavored water, unsweetened coffee and tea. Pass on drinks like juices, sports drinks, energy drinks, sodas, and alcohol.

, If you’re interested in losing 5 pounds in five days, it’s best to cut out or significantly limit snacking.


Although snacks can be a part of a healthy diet, they may not allow you to lose the 5 pounds in five days.
If you’re choosing to snack, stick with your focus of “lean and green.” Choose foods that are higher in protein and lower in carbohydrates.
Also, keep snacks to 150 calories or less. This will help keep you on track with your overall calorie limit.Appropriate snacks include 1 hard boiled egg, 3 oz of beef jerky, 2 ounces of cheese or 1 high-protein bar/shake.

, Some foods are more prone to causing gas or bloating. Although this doesn’t necessarily account for weight loss on the scale, limiting these foods can help you feel slimmer.


When digested, some foods create excess gas.This may make you feel or look bloated and make it more difficult to fit into or feel comfortable in a tighter pair of pants or skirt.
Gas-forming foods include broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, beans, lentils, garlic, and onions.
Chewing gum or drinking carbonated beverages can cause also unwanted gas or bloating.

, In addition to cutting calories, you can use cardio exercise to help increase your overall calorie burn or deficit for the day.The USDA recommends performing a minimum of 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercises each week, or working out for about 30 minutes five days a week.Aim to do moderate-intensity activities. These are exercises that should cause you to sweat, be slightly out of breath and feel tired when you’re finished.Depending on your current fitness level, there may be a variety of activities that could be considered moderate intensity for you.
Examples of exercises include walking, jogging/running, swimming, using the elliptical or rowing machine, doing an aerobics class or dancing.
You can increase this to 300 minutes weekly if you can. There is no safe upper limit for exercise; however, note that if you’re following a very restricted diet or a very low-calorie diet, you may feel too tired to exercise or fatigue quickly when you’re exercising. If you notice these side effects be mindful and take care. If you’re feeling pain or any discomfort, ease off on the intensity of your exercise. If the pain is severe, seek medical assistance.

, In addition to cardio exercises, it may also be helpful to increase your baseline activities. These are things you do every day and can increase with minor changes.


Baseline activities (like doing household chores or walking to and from your destinations) do not burn many calories by themselves; however, if you ramp up your baseline activity all day long you may see significant increases in your total daily calorie burn.Think about ways you can move more and be more active. This might mean parking farther away from your destination, taking the stairs, standing or doing exercises during TV commercial breaks or standing at your desk.

, High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a newly popular type of exercise. It burns a large quantity of calories in a shorter time and also helps increase your overall metabolic rate.Typical HIIT workouts are shorter in duration than steady cardio (like going for a jog) and involve short bursts of very, very high-intensity activity, followed by short bursts of more moderate-intensity activity.
HIIT workouts are typically only geared towards those individuals who are already maintaining a fitness level to support higher-intensity activities or are active on a regular basis.
You can do a variety of cardio activities for an HIIT workout. For example, on a treadmill you could alternate between jogging and sprinting or running uphill.

, Many gyms now offer a steam room or sauna for their customers. This may help you relax and recover from your workout but also support a quick weight loss.As you sweat you may lose excess water weight. This can help the numbers on the scale drop more quickly and may make you feel less bloated.
Relax in the steam room for 10 – 20 minutes. Spending more time than this may cause you to become dehydrated.
Be very careful when using the steam room, especially for weight loss. This is not a recommended method for weight loss and should be used with caution.
In addition, excess sweating can lead to dehydration which can be dangerous. Always follow a steam room sensation with plenty of hydrating fluids.

You might have certain underlying conditions that would make a detox diet problematic for you. Perhaps weight loss shouldn't even be your priority. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for a healthy life.


A registered dietitian is also a good resource for getting information on a diet program that will work well for you. Registered Dietitians are experts with training and certification in nutrition.;
, Juice diets are one of the most popular types of detox programs. Drinking juice allows you to take in nutrients even as you limit your consumption of hard foods. Part of the purpose of a juice diet is to consume a wide variety of nutrients. Be sure to research juice recipes that incorporate a wide variety of fruits and vegetables.


On a juice diet you will not receive some important nutrients, like protein. You should refrain from staying on a pure juice diet for more than three days. For longer fasts, you should consider a regimen that incorporates other nutrients.
Because fruits have a high sugar content, juice diets are not be a great way to lose weight. But a short juice diet might help you get a lot of nutrients that you would otherwise be short on., The Master Cleanse is a 10-day-long all liquid detox. The basis is a combination of lemon juice, grade B maple syrup, and cayenne pepper. The lemon juice provides vitamins, the syrup provides calories, and the cayenne pepper flushes out your system.Additionally, the diet recommends that you consume either laxative tea or a combination of sea salt and water. Both will function to flush out your system.
After the initial ten days are over, you will want to gradually return to eating solid foods. Begin with juice and fruit, eventually moving on to raw fruits and vegetables. You want to refrain from eating meat or dairy until your system becomes acclimated to food.Medical professionals suggest that weight lost during the Master Cleanse will typically return., There are a variety of diets that claim to detox you by eliminating certain processed and unhealthy foods from your diet. Typically they involved the consumption of juice, protein shakes, and some hard foods like raw fruits and vegetables. This is sometimes the best option when you want to detox, especially if you want to conserve muscle mass. This allows you to get more whole foods, protein, and nutrients.


Examples include “The Fast Track One Day Diet,” “Dr. Joshi’s Holistic Detox,” and the “Three Day Fruit Flush Diet.”
This diets are more likely to be healthy in the long term than juice diets and the Master Cleanse, but because they vary so much, so too do their merits. Do research into any plan that you decide to follow and be conscious of the credibility of sources., Detoxing can produce several unpleasant side effects. You probably won’t be surprised to find that it will make you hungry. You will also, however, experience fatigue, and possibly headaches, diarrhea, and flatulence.

, Without any food in your system, even alcohol and caffeine can have a harmful effect. You should certainly avoid hard drugs. Consult your doctor about how prescription medications will affect you during a fast.

, Doctors warn that you should never try to exercise during a cleanse. Because you will likely be fatigued, you should have easy recreation available. Have some books or movies around to keep you busy., When fasting it is common to develop a coated tongue, which is a layer of bacteria on the tongue that causes discoloration and bad breath. A tongue scraper can help fix the situation. A good brushing of the tongue can also help., Your system might have difficulty dealing with solid foods after a detox. For the first couple days stick to a small portions of vegetables, soups, and nuts. Introduce fruit and then light proteins like fish, cheese, and eggs after four or five days. Chew slowly whenever you eat.


Detox diets double as an elimination diet, so use this to your advantage by slowly reintroducing foods, so that you can determine how each type of food impacts your body. You might find that when you reintroduce dairy, for instance, you are more prone to stomachaches.

Keep in mind that you only have two days so don’t go overboard with how much you exercise or what foods you limit yourself to.;
, By keeping track of your exercise and food intake, you can take responsibility for your efforts to diet. If you can answer to yourself for the amount of work you are putting in to reach your goal you will feel more satisfied when you reach it. Weigh yourself once daily, in the morning right when you wake up and after you go to the bathroom. Weight shifts throughout the day weighing yourself multiple times a day could cause you to feel you weigh more than you actually do.

Consider how will you achieve your goal. Be as specific as possible to know what is exactly the right course for you.
Your goal could be, for example, to lose 5 pounds. Include information on how are you going to do it and by what type of diet.
A good example of a goal is: ""My goal is to lose five pounds in two weeks by sticking to a balanced 1,200 calorie-a-day diet and exercise for at least 30 minutes a day."";
, If you want to lose five pounds, you'll need to cut out a significant amount of calories each day.


To lose 1 – 2 pounds per week, you'll need to burn 500 – 1,000 calories every day. This can be done through cutting calories and adding in exercise.When cutting out calories, you must be extremely careful to make sure you are still getting enough nutrients and vitamins from your diet. Working with a dietitian can ensure you get adequate nutrition while dieting.
Cutting more calories results in more weight loss. Experts do not recommend consuming fewer than 1,200 calories per day except in medically supervised weight loss programs.

, This is probably the hardest part — just sticking to it. If you're severely limiting yourself, it'll be even harder. That's why it's important to not only make efforts to reach your goal, but to make efforts to stick to it.



Start a food journal. Make yourself write down everything you eat, drink, and how much exercise you do. Your weak points will stick out and you'll be able to see where you can improve to maximize your results.Employ a friend. Just having another opinion helps build your confidence. If you have someone else keeping an eye on you (and your journal), you'll be more likely to stay on track.They'll help to provide you with motivation when yours is lacking.
Think about rewards. Have one set out for when you hit the halfway mark and for when you complete your goal.This could be anything — a mini vacation, a shopping spree, a movie. Just don't make your reward food-related.

, Losing weight quickly is all about the short-term. The weight a person loses very rarely stays off (especially when they cut carbs for a period of time and then reintroduce them to their diet) — it is often regained rapidly, which is known as ""yo-yo dieting."" This can lead to coronary heart disease and sudden cardiac death in post-menopausal women.Weight loss should be treated as a long-term commitment and should be the result of lifestyle changes if you want to stay healthy and keep it off.

, Many studies show that if you want to lose weight quick or get thin quickly, you should focus on making lean protein a major component of all your meals and snacks.Lean protein helps fuel your metabolism and can help you feel more satisfied throughout the day.
Include a minimum of one to two servings of lean protein at each meal. Measure out at least 3 – 4 oz of protein per serving.This is generally about the size of a deck of cards or the size of an adult palm.
Lean proteins to include in your diet are: poultry, eggs, lean beef, pork, seafood, legumes and tofu.

, In addition to lean protein, eating a large amount of fruits and vegetables is an easy way to keep calories low and support a quick weight loss.


Both fruits and vegetables are fairly low in calorie but also high in fiber, vitamins and minerals. They can add bulk to your meals and keep you feeling more satisfied with lower calories.Focus mainly on non-starchy vegetables (like lettuce, broccoli, brussels sprouts or green beans). Starchy vegetables (like carrots, peas or potatoes) and fruits have a few more calories and carbohydrates which can slow (but not stop) quick weight loss., If you want to get thin quickly, you'll need to make some significant cuts in your diet. Cutting out grains can help you lose weight quickly, but it comes with some serious risks. Instead of cutting them out completely, avoid white or processed grains and stick with whole wheat.


Studies have shown that low-carb diets help you lose weight the quickest; however, if you go back to eating carbs after your diet is over, it is extremely likely you will gain the weight right back, which leads to dangerous yo-yo dieting.Focus only on your lean protein and non-starchy vegetables most of the time.Grains, especially whole grains, can be a part of a healthy diet and are a major source of energy for most people. If you choose to eat them, choose the whole grain options as they have higher fiber and other essential nutrients., Drinking adequate amounts of fluid is essential for overall health. However, increased water intake can also help support your quick weight loss.


Drink two glasses before each meal to reduce your appetite. When your stomach is more full of water, you may be less likely to overeat and be satisfied with less food.
Also, when you're dehydrated you may feel hungry, when you're actually just thirsty.
Aim for at least 8 glasses of water daily, but some experts recommend up to 13 glasses daily, depending on body size and activity level., Many processed foods are laden with sweeteners, salt, artificial flavors, fat, and preservatives. They are also typically higher in calories and lower in nutrients.Give these up if you want to lose weight quickly.


In addition, processed foods are often stripped of nutrients such as fiber, antioxidants, and “good” fats.Processed foods typically include: frozen meals, crackers, chips, candy, sweetened beverages, desserts, processed meats and canned foods.
Cook more often at home instead of relying on restaurant foods or other processed foods. You'll have more control over everything that goes into your meals.
Also pass on the alcohol. Drinking alcohol is another item that should be given up if you want to get thin quickly. It's extra calories you just don't need.

, There are many diets on the market that promise quick weight loss in very short time periods. These diets may not be safe or appropriate for you.Some examples of more common fad diets include: cleanses, juice diets, diet pills, plant extracts or injections. Many promise quick weight loss without much effort on the part of the dieter.
Most health professionals recommend not following these types of diet plans. They're generally not considered safe due to their very low nutrient content (which could lead to nutrient deficiencies over time). The weight lost is also generally not kept off for long periods of time.If you're interested in one of these programs, always talk to your doctor first.

, Cardio is one of the best ways to burn extra calories and support your goal of getting thin quickly.


At a minimum, you should perform at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity cardiovascular exercises per week.Increasing your intensity or performing more than 150 minutes weekly can help you burn even more calories.Try activities like: running, cycling, swimming, boxing, or playing a sport.
Note: if you're severely cutting calories, be careful. Too much exercise may shut your body down. Consult your doctor before undertaking any extreme changes to your routine.

, To help tone your body add in weight lifting exercises. Together, cardio and resistance training offer an unbeatable combination.


Include at least 2 days of weight training during the week. You should aim to work each major muscle group for a well rounded workout.Participating in regular strength training can help maintain lean muscle mass, especially when you're dieting.

, Adding in more baseline activity is another good way to burn more calories throughout your day.Increase your steps and movement as much as you can.


Baseline or lifestyle activity are the activities you do on a typical day. For example: walking to and from your car, taking the stairs or running errands all count as lifestyle activities.
Think about your day and see if you can find any ways to add in more steps or move more often. You could park farther away from your destination, take the stairs instead of the elevator or do knee raises during commercial breaks.

, Some foods, especially vegetables, have the tendency to produce more gas in your digestive system. This can cause you to look and feel bloated.


Limit foods like beans, lentils, salads, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and Brussels sprouts to reduce gas.
Limit these foods a few days prior to your event or occasion. That way you don't feel bloated and can fit into small pants or dresses easier.
In addition, you can take some mild over the counter medications that help prevent gas and bloating or get rid of it if you already have it.

, There are a variety of undergarments that have become very popular for men and women. Shapewear or very tight fitting items help you look much thinner instantly without you having to lose any weight.


Not only does shapewear help you look thinner, it also smooths the curves of your body. It takes care of any ""muffin top"" issues as well.
You can purchase items that shape just small parts of your body or larger areas. For example, you can shape your stomach, bust, thighs and buttocks.

, Wearing black or even wearing only one color helps you look thinner instantly. This is one of the oldest ""fashion tricks"" in the book, but it works.


Not only black makes you look thinner. All dark hues (like dark navy jeans) produce a slimming, slender look.
Try to stay away from paler colors like white - especially in your bottom pieces of clothing.

Eat out on the Volumetrics diet.,

Support someone on the Volumetrics diet.",How to Follow the Volumetrics Eating Plan," Dr. Rolls’ 12-week weight loss plan will teach you how to adapt your diet to Volumetrics principles, guiding you through gradual changes that will help you to lose about 5 to 10 percent of your body weight. No foods are banned or classified as “good” or “bad.” You simply learn to choose more of the types of foods that you can enjoy in larger quantities. Having the freedom to eat more will help to alleviate feelings of deprivation.;
, Volumetrics divides foods into 4 categories according to their calorie density, or the number of calories per gram of food. You will learn to eat larger portions of foods in the lower density categories, like fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean meat, and to limit portions of foods that have a higher calorie density.

, Dr. Rolls includes many healthy recipes in her Volumetrics books. She presents the healthy recipe and explains how the recipe was altered from its original high calorie density version. You will not only have recipes to utilize; you will also learn how to adapt your own favorites to the Volumetrics lifestyle by substituting high calorie density ingredients for ingredients with a lower calorie density.

, You don’t have to limit yourself to Dr. Rolls’ books to enjoy recipes that are Volumetrics-friendly. Choosing cookbooks that fit the Volumetrics plan means choosing cookbooks that emphasize fresh ingredients and plant foods, are low in fat and sugar, and contain thorough nutrient information. Good cookbooks also include recipes plus easy-to-understand explanation of techniques. Additionally, make sure that the recipes look appetizing.

, Volumetrics books provide lists of foods and organize the foods into categories. The categories range from very low calorie density to high calorie density foods. Additionally, the food lists help you to measure the appropriate portions of food. Again, you will see that you can eat much larger portions of low calorie density foods.

, Eating foods that are rich in water, like broth-based soups, salads and fruits and vegetables will ensure that you can enjoy larger portion sizes without packing in a lot of calories. To eat more, you choose low calorie density foods and limit portions of high calorie density foods. No food types are banned on this diet, but you can sometimes double and triple your portions by choosing low calorie density foods.

, Eating out on Volumetrics involves portion control techniques as well as tricks for feeling full. For example, Dr. Rolls recommends starting your restaurant meal with soup or a salad so that you are less hungry when the main entrée arrives. You’ll also learn tips for how to visualize appropriate portion sizes so that you can eat a single serving at the restaurant and pack up the rest to save for later.

, Satiety is the heart of Volumetrics. Instead of stuffing yourself with fat or sugar-laden foods and beverages that will cause you to lose weight, you will learn that you can still enjoy big portions as long as you are eating the right foods. You will also learn to listen to and respect your body’s hunger signals so that you don’t overindulge on any foods.

, Maintaining your weight on Volumetrics is a combination of continuing to follow Volumetrics eating principles as well as performing exercise regularly. Dr. Rolls suggests strategies for increasing the number of steps that you take each day, including using a pedometer. You will continue keeping a diary to record your diet and exercise. Additionally, you will learn steps for shedding pounds if your weight starts to creep back up.

, In addition to offering support to someone who may be attempting the Volumetrics diet, you need to educate others so that they know how to support you if you are attempting the diet yourself. Dieting is challenging, particularly when people have a troubled relationship with food. Friends, family and co-workers should respect what you are trying to accomplish and avoid sabotaging your success.

Subtract the amount of dietary fiber from the amount of total carbohydrates.
Look for sugar alcohols. Sugar alcohols do not count against your net carb total.
Use a carbohydrate-counting guide for further help.

, Atkins International produces a variety of low-carb shakes and protein bars. Learn how to read the labels to determine the right products. Try some of the following foods that are approved by the Atkins diet.Vegetables low in carbohydrates - these are the foundation of the Atkins diet
All fish.
All fowl.
Meat and Eggs
Fats and Oils

, The Induction phase is designed to kick-start the Atkins diet by putting the body into a state of ketosis, which metabolizes stored fat. Some people lose as much as 15 pounds (6.8 kg) in 2 weeks, but only if they have an extreme amount of weight to lose, usually 100 pounds or more. It is normal to lose 4 to 6 pounds on Induction.Ketosis occurs when your body has no sugar based energy and uses fat instead.
Ketosis has some side effects such as nausea, headache, mental fatigue and bad breath. Not everyone enters Ketosis.
It is not uncommon to get sick during any dietary changes, especially if you have been eating unhealthy foods for some time. Remember to hydrate your body, take your vitamins and get adequate sleep.

, After removing unhealthy carbs, replace them with vegetables and some proteins and fats. Atkins is diet based on VEGETABLES, unlike any other diet out there. Eating more healthy carbs from vegetables will bring nutrition to your body and still let you lose weight. Try to eat the following foods to obtain these fats and proteins:You can eat chicken, red meat, fish and eggs, including egg yolks.
Aim for at least 4 ounces (113 g) of protein at each meal.
You may enjoy fats including olive oil and mayonnaise during this phase.
Consume more mono and polyunsaturated fats instead of saturated fats and trans fats.
Avoid processed meats, as they may be cured with sugar and count as carbs.

, The main focus of Atkins is to eat healthy carbs from vegetables. Strive to get 12-15 grams of healthy carbs from vegetables like leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower, and others listed on the Atkins Phase 1 (Induction) List here: https://www.atkins.com/how-it-works/atkins-20/phase-1/low-carb-foods. Keep the amount of other carbohydrates that you eat every day as low as possible. This will help you to lose weight at this stage of the diet.Consume 20 grams of carbohydrates or fewer during this phase. 12-15 grams should come from healthy vegetables. Remember, Atkins is a VEGETABLE-based diet. No other diet puts such an important emphasis on healthy veggies!
Avoid fruits and grains such as bread and pasta during Induction.
Make sure that 12 to 15 grams of your daily carbohydrates come from foundation vegetables.Foundation vegetables are vegetables with next to no carbohydrates. Examples include pickles, spinach, broccoli, sauerkraut, avocado, Daikon radish, red or white onion, and zucchini.

, Eat at least once every 2-3 hours when you are awake. You can choose to eat five to six smaller meals to jump-start your metabolism. Eating only 3 times per day will not yield as good results for most people, though it will still work.When you do eat, make sure to only eat until you feel full.
Do not overindulge.

, Eat at least one mid-morning and one mid-afternoon snack to help conquer cravings and to help maintain energy levels. Keeping energy levels up is important.Choose snacks that are high in fat and protein. Fat and protein help to maintain blood sugar and extend satiety. This is critical during any weight loss program, but especially in one where carbohydrates are limited.
Make sure your snacks have minimal carbohydrates.
Don't be afraid to make changes to how you were snacking before.
Try snacks such as vegetables with hummus, a deviled egg, or even beef jerky.

, Drink 64 fluid ounces (1.9 L) of water daily during your low-carbohydrate diet. In addition, drink 2 cups of broth or eat 2 tablespoons of soy sauce to help your body retain sodium and potassium., Surviving the big changes of the first days of Atkins may require support. Preparation for certain physical challenges, like lagging energy and dizziness, is also important.Watch your food budget to accommodate for more vegetables, protein, and other whole foods.
Keep your meals interesting by trying new foods that fit with the Atkins diet.

, Certain uncomfortable physiological symptoms and potential nutritional deficiencies can be avoided by taking a few precautionary measures while you’re on the Atkins diet.Avoid staying on Induction for more than 2-4 weeks. Some people try to stay on Induction for months or even a year or more, and this is VERY unhealthy for your body. In fact, it is NOT recommended by Atkins nor anyone at Atkins. If you are on Induction for longer than a month, you are no longer doing Atkins. Atkins insists on moving forward and adding more healthy carbs back to your diet.
Drink plenty of water.
Take supplements such as vitamins and minerals.
Get plenty of rest.
Eat plenty of fiber

, Monitor your weight and pay attention to exactly how much you have lost. Weight loss is NEVER the only gauge and tell if you it's time to move on to the next Phase of the Atkins diet. Remember to take measurements, check how your clothes fit, and if you have been on Induction for a month, move on to the next Phase. There is NO minimum weight loss to reach before moving on to step 2.
Stay in Phase 1 for NO MORE than 4 weeks.
You should NEVER stay on Inductions for 6 months or more. That is NOT Atkins. Anyone who states that you ""should"" lose a certain amount of weight like 15 pounds or that you should stay on Induction for 6 months or a year is NOT doing Atkins. They are advocating a dangerous and unhealthy diet. Please consult Colette Heimowitz, the nutritional expert at Atkins for more information.

, You should continue to lose weight during Phase 2, but the weight loss may occur at a slower pace than it did during Phase 1. During Phase 2, add 5 grams to your daily carbohydrate total each week as long as you continue to lose weight., The critical rule is to not exceed your maximum number of allowed daily carbohydrates. You can add the following foods at this point:


Nuts
Fruits
Soft cheeses

, Boost the quantity of carbohydrates that you eat based on your body’s reaction. If you stop losing weight after eating 30 grams of carbohydrates daily, then you should scale back to 25 grams. You may, however, eat as much as 50 grams as long as you continue to lose weight.Adjust your carbohydrate intake according to weight loss or gain.
If weight gain occurs, lower the level of carbohydrate intake.

, Diets low in carbohydrates tend to be low in fiber, which will contribute to constipation. However, you can combat these symptoms by taking the following actions:Drinking plenty of water.
Eating foods containing healthy carbs and fiber, like vegetables.
Take a fiber supplement or a probiotic.
While Atkins does not require you to exercise, it does encourage it as you will not only have more regular bowel movements if you do engage in regular exercise, but there are tons of other healthy benefits of exercising. Exercising and lifting weights will also help you avoid baggy skin or other issues that can occur if you have a lot of weight to lose.

, You may encounter weight loss plateaus. Feeling like you are getting stuck on one of these plateaus can be demoralizing. However, most people define a ""plateau"" as not seeing the scale move for 2 or 3 days. An actual plateau means there is no loss in weight or inches for at least 2 weeks. You can encourage yourself through these tough moments by taking the following actions.


You can focus on the other benefits of the diet, such as lost inches and added energy.
Compare your blood tests from now to before you started Atkins. You should notice a positive change in your good cholesterol and a drop in your triglycerides.
It is important to note that plateaus are not always a bad thing. Plateaus can sometimes be the body's way of adjusting to the new body weight and creating a new 'normal.' Embrace plateaus!

, Calorie-free sugar substitutes can do wonders for baked goods and for beverages.Watch for hidden sugars by reading labels on your food.
Be careful with labels such as ""No sugar added"". This does not mean ""No Sugar""
Try using sugar replacements such as Stevia or Splenda (in small amounts).

, Sometimes, cravings for carbohydrates are actually thirst in disguise. At other times, you may simply be craving the experience of eating or the habit of eating more than you are actually craving food. Learning to recognize your true hunger signals and how to strategically handle cravings will ensure that you are successful while following the Atkins diet.


Pay attention to your body's signals to see if you are actually experiencing hunger.
Plan your meals ahead of time if possible and eat every 2-3 hours. This should stave off severe hunger. As your metabolism speeds up and you become used to eating throughout the day, you may find yourself beginning to get hungry every 2-3 hours. This is natural. Just eat your healthy snack or meal and enjoy!

, You can still enjoy eating out even when you are on the Atkins diet. Most restaurants serve low-carb options and are willing to accommodate special requests. Atkins is one of the EASIEST diets to maintain when eating out. Always order a salad or extra portions of vegetables at your meal. Restaurants will often replace the side carbohydrate (baked potato or rice) with a double portion of veggies.
Skip the bread basket. If the waiter brings one, just ask that it be removed from the table.
Be aware of what you are ordering, avoid any items high in carbohydrates.
If you aren't sure about an item, ask for more information.

, One of the main concerns of following a low-carb diet is that the lack of certain vegetables and fruits, particularly during Induction, can cause you to be deficient in vitamins. Also, low-carb diets tend to cause your body to shed sodium and potassium. Avoid these side-effects by taking the following actions: Eat a large variety of foods and take supplements.
Taking sodium in the form of broth, soy sauce or salt will also keep your kidneys healthy.

, Phase 3 should begin when you are about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) from your goal weight. You will start adding carbohydrates back to your diet until your weight loss slows to a crawl., Eat an additional 10 grams of daily carbohydrates per week. Watch the scale and pay attention to your cravings so that you know when you are eating too many carbohydrates.Weight gain indicates too many carbohydrates are being consumed.
Weight loss should slow greatly during this stage, but still be at a loss.

, If certain foods make you start to gain weight, then you will have to eliminate the foods from your diet. Watch the scale carefully for any fluctuation.During diets such as these, you've unintentionally created an elimination diet-type environment for your body. This is a good thing! This means that your body has been rid of the foods/substances that had been plaguing it before. So, when adding foods back in, do them one at a time so you know how each food impacts your body.

, In Pre-Maintenance, you can add starchy vegetables, such as sweet potatoes and winter squash, and whole grains like oatmeal back into your diet. Again, keep a close eye on your weight as you add more variety of carbohydrates., During Phase 4, you will discover your Atkins carbohydrate equilibrium so that you can maintain a healthy weight throughout your life. Balance and careful attention to your carbohydrate levels are key in this stage, as well as paying special attention to how different foods affect your health and overall well-being. , You do not ""stop"" the Atkins diet - it is a healthy plan that can be continued life-long. Continue to eat plenty of vegetables as well as fat and protein during the Maintenance phase of the low-carb diet even as you add more carbohydrates back to your diet.At this stage of the diet, Atkins is extremely similar to what is known as Clean Eating, a diet that has been used by body-builders and health and fitness proponents for decades. It is a very healthy lifestyle.

, You can add carbs to your diet as long as you don’t deviate from your goal weight. This helps you find your equilibrium number.If you notice weight gain, scale back the amount of carbohydrates you are consuming.

, You can enjoy the occasional slice of pizza or chocolate cake during Maintenance. Make sure the splurge happens only occasionally and you aren’t tempted to continually overindulge.Overindulging will undo all of your hard work.

, If you gain or lose more than 5 pounds (2.27 kg), then you need to lower or increase your carbohydrate intake to compensate.


Pay careful attention to your weight and the connection to the foods you are eating. Over time you will have a clear understanding of how different foods affect you and you will no longer have to measure or weigh food or monitor it as often.

, As long as you stick to the principles of low-carb, high protein and fat eating, you can make some variations on the Atkins diet and still lose weight.


People say boredom causes more people to rebound from diets than anything else, but in the case of Atkins it is actually lack of following the diet appropriately. They feel so deprived during a diet that they binge when they get off of it. This has to be a lifestyle with small splurges in moderation. Staying on Induction for too long and not adding more foods and carbs back to your diet as prescribed in Atkins is NOT Atkins. It is a very unhealthy version of dieting and should be avoided. Following Atkins is very healthy and safe and will ward off boredom.

, Dr. Atkins prepared a section in one of his earlier books about a technique called the Fat Fast, which is based on the Kekwick diet. This jump-start method is only for people who follow Induction to the letter and cannot lose weight because of metabolic resistance.


The vast majority of dieters should simply start with Induction.

, You can do Atkins as a vegetarian or vegan, though you'll need to start at Phase 2 with around 30 grams of healthy carbohydrates per day. This article will help you to identify good sources of protein and fat. You’ll also learn exactly how to get started with Atkins depending on your weight loss goals.


Choosing good vegetable proteins and fat sources will enable you to follow Atkins even if you don’t consume animal protein.
Many plant proteins contain carbs. This may cause you to skip the induction phase.
You can start with OWL or Pre-Maintenance and still meet your weight loss goals.

, While no official guidelines for Eco-Atkins have been issued, there are still some guidelines to follow.Eat 25 percent of your calories from carb-rich foods.
Eat 30 percent of calories from proteins.
Eat 45 percent of calories from vegetable fats.

, You can modify Atkins to match your own weight loss goals, regardless of the amount planned. The Atkins diet is modified by starting or maintaining a certain phase for differing periods of time.For small weight loss goals, you may start with Pre-Maintencance or OWL.
For large weight loss goals start with Induction and move on to the Phase 2 after 2-4 weeks.

, This article will teach you how to get started with Atkins Advantage. The new Atkins Advantage program can take you through a 12-week cycle of the Atkins diet starting with Induction and ending with Maintenance.


The new Atkins Advantage also includes exercise tips and journaling ideas to help your mental and emotional outlook.

Stock up on all the ingredients you will need. If you are going to stick to this diet all week, you will need to make a lot of cabbage soup. It's simple to make and you can start by making a big pot, which you can store in the fridge or even to freeze to keep fresh. The ingredients you will need are:


6 green onions, chopped
2 green peppers, diced
2 cans of tomatoes (diced or whole)
250g mushrooms, sliced
1 bunch celery, chopped
1/2 head cabbage, chopped
3 carrots, sliced
1 or 2 cubes bouillon/vegetable stock (optional), plus salt and pepper to season.
For added flavour: Cayenne pepper, curry powder, mixed herbs or any other seasoning.;
, With the cabbage soup diet you eat the soup as your main meals during the day, but you also add in some fruit and other vegetables on fixed days. Before you start on the diet ensure you have a good supply of leafy greens and mixed fruits at home.


Broccoli and spinach are good choice which can add some iron to your diet.
Avoid starchy vegetables such as dry beans or sweetcorn., On certain days you will add some meat to your diet, typically beef one day and chicken another day. Buy one or two 300g packets of lean beef mince and a packet of chicken breasts. You will eat the meat on day 5 and day 6 of your diet, so be sure it will still be good to eat by then.Check the best before dates on the packet, and put off buying until later in the week if necessary.
Always look for lean meat.

, Before you start the diet it can be helpful to draw up your food schedule and pin it up on the fridge or somewhere in the kitchen. The constant is cabbage soup which is supplemented with extras on different days. Write up the schedule detailed below.

, The soup is easy to prepare. First of all you need to chop up all the vegetables and lightly fry them in some olive oil in a big pot. Put the chopped onions in first and allow them to begin to become translucent before adding the green pepper and cabbage. Stir them a little in the pot so they begin to wilt. Then add the chopped carrots, mushrooms and celery. Add some seasoning at this point and stir well.If you are using tinned tomatoes, pour these into the pot.
Add a covering of water and bring to the boil.
Consider adding some bouillon or a stock cube for flavour.
Allow it to simmer for a couple of hours.
Taste and season when it has reduced to the consistency you like.

, It's important to get off to a good start. On day one you should eat cabbage soup as your main meal throughout the day. Add some spice and seasoning to give it a bit of a kick; you are going to be eating a lot of it, and it would otherwise get boring. On day one you can add fruit to your diet.Eat fruit throughout the day
But don't eat bananas on day one.
Stick with apples, oranges and other fruits.

, Hopefully by the second day you won't be completely sick of eating cabbage soup already. Keep eating the soup for your main meals. Instead of adding fruit to your diet, on day two you should add some leafy greens either raw or cooked.


For example you could boil or steam some broccoli or spinach.
Have a baked potato with a little soup.Don't eat any fruit.

, By day three you will be growing increasingly put off by the sight and smell of cabbage soup. Today you can supplement the soup with all sorts of fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are very low in calories so eat plenty of them to give yourself some different tastes.Don't eat potatoes on this day.
You should also avoid bananas on this day.
All other fruit and veg are fine.

, You have now reached the halfway point and the end is looming a little closer. On day four you will have a change and add bananas and skimmed milk to your diet. You keep eating the cabbage soup for your main meals, but eat some bananas and drink skimmed milk during the day.Be sure to get skimmed or at least semi-skimmed milk.
You might like to combine the bananas and milk for a basic milkshake.

, Once you have reached day five you can add something with a bit more substance to your diet. Today you get to eat some meat and tomatoes. You can choose either chicken or lean beef. If you go for chicken, boil it skinless to cook it the healthiest way possible. Skinless chicken breast with sliced tomatoes made a good combination.Eat up to six tomatoes.
You can eat the tomatoes raw, or grill them. Don't fry them.
You should still eat the soup at least once today.
Be sure to drink 6-8 glasses of water on this day.

, On day six you will eat meat again. If you had chicken on day five, go for lean beef on day six. Combine lean beef with plenty of vegetables or salad. You should eat leafy greens with the beef, such as kale or spinach.The beef and veg should supplement not replace the cabbage soup.
Don't eat potatoes on this day.
Try not to use too much oil when you cook the beef.

, Now you have reached the final day of the cabbage soup diet. You can celebrate by eating some brown rice and vegetables alongside your cabbage soup. Just one modest bowl of brown rice with leafy greens should be enough to complement your daily soup intake.You can also drink some unsweetened fruit juices on this day.
Juicing fruit at home will guarantee there is no added sugar and give you fresh delicious fruit juice.
Don't continue the diet beyond seven days.

, To get the greatest benefit from the cabbage soup diet you need to be able to stick to it for the full week. This is first and foremost a question of willpower and commitment, but there are things that you can do to help give yourself the best chance. Having a clear plan for your diet, with your meals organised in advance, will help you stick to it. Organisation and planning are crucial for any weight loss programme.Any gaps in the plan or uncertainties about what you should be eating could easily lead to you slipping from the programme.
Having a prominent and detailed meal plan will help you take control of the diet and track your progress.

, If you are dieting you will be paying close attention to what you eat, but don't forget about the calories contained in what you drink. Alcoholic drinks in particular are loaded with calories and you would be undoing all your good work if you don't cut out the alcohol while you diet.


This also applies for sugary soda drinks. You might not immediately associate what you drink with your weight, but it's a crucial element that you shouldn't overlook.Drinking lots of water throughout will keep you hydrated as well as helping to control your appetite.

, Undertaking the diet will result in you not getting proper nutrition for a week, so you may begin to feel tired and weak.It's important that you take steps to maintain your overall health while you are dieting. One way to help you consume nutrients while sticking to the diet is to take a multivitamin tablet daily. This is a quick and easy way to help you maintain a reasonable intake of the nutrients you need to keep your body functioning well.Given the severity of the diet it is unlikely that you will have the energy to do strenuous exercise, but try to maintain a reasonable level of gentle physical activity.
For example, go for a casual walk in the evening.
If you feel too tired or lethargic then reconsider the diet and replace it with a more balanced approach to healthy eating and exercise.

, One of the elements of the diet that make it easier to stick to is its short duration. You might find it easier to stick to a severe diet for a week than a more balanced one for longer, although for long-term results a more balanced approach is far more beneficial. If you do find yourself struggling to stick to diet and the prospect of another bowl of cabbage soup is hard to take, try to stay positive.


Visualise the end day getting closer all the time and tick off each mealtime with a flourish.
It is an achievement to get to the end of the week so you should be proud of your willpower and commitment.
Now to see lasting benefits adopt a balanced diet and take regular exercise.

This will serve as your blueprint throughout each week while you're on the diet.The Cinch Diet is only for 30 days. Make a meal plan for about four weeks. To make this easier, do only one week at a time.
Write down every breakfast, lunch, dinner and afternoon snack that you'll consume for a week. The Cinch Diet book provides sample recipes and meal ideas that you can use to help you create your meal plan.
If you're having difficulty, just use some of the meal plans that are provided for you. After you get comfortable using these, get a little more creative and make some of your own.
For example, one day could be: Meal one: scrambled egg with spinach and a Greek yogurt with raspberries and almonds. Meal two: cottage cheese, blueberries and almonds. Meal three: 2 cups of raw spinach with a hard-boiled egg, almonds and olive oil. Meal four: fish tacos with guacamole and raspberries. Dessert: 1 oz dark chocolate.;
, One particular component of the Cinch Diet is your eating schedule and timing. Stock up on some reusable and to-go containers to help pack extra meals or snacks.


This diet has you eat more than the typical three meals a day. Eat every three to five hours during the day.There is evidence to support this type of eating pattern for weight loss.Some of the sample meal plans mention having a breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner.
If you're at work during the day, have these containers to help you pack your lunch and afternoon snack.
Choose containers that are reusable, have a tight fitting lid and can be reheated if needed.

, In addition to creating a meal plan, consider creating an exercise plan or schedule. The Cinch Diet recommends this to help you stick to a consistent activity routine.The Cinch Diet doesn't focus too much on physical activity and exercise. However, you do need to make an exercise schedule.
When you make a schedule for your activity, you're more likely to stick to you plan.
Schedules make it easier to fit in activity and you'll know each day that you've set aside the appropriate time to exercise.
The same time that you're making your meal plan, also sit down to do your exercise schedule. Look for times when you have about 30 minutes to do some activity.

, The Cinch Diet comes with a variety of resources to help you successfully follow the plan. Consider purchasing or downloading some to help you.


Many diets, including the Cinch Diet, have a book associated with them. If you purchase the Cinch Diet book, you'll have recipes, meal plans, preparation tips and information on healthy eating.There are a lot of variety in food choices, but having a book that can give you some starting points will be helpful.
There are also some websites that can give you more appropriate recipes and meal plans. Consider downloading and printing these to help you get started.

, The Cinch diet only consists of two phases within the 30 day plan. The first phase is for five days and is called the Fast Forward phase.The purpose of the Fast Forward stage is to help you jump start weight loss and detox your body from old or bad eating habits.
Your foods are limited, but are supposed to help you improve your energy, concentration and overall well-being.
You are restricted to these five foods: almonds, eggs, yogurt, spinach and raspberries.
Recipes and meal plans with these foods are included in the book. Vegetarian and vegan ideas are also included if they're needed.
A big plus of following the Cinch plan is that you don’t have to count calories.

, The second and last phase of the Cinch Diet will continue for the remaining 25 days. The Cinch Diet Core phase will help you continue to lose weight while building healthy eating habits.The Cinch Diet Core phase is easy to follow. Pick foods from five different food groups. There is no calorie counting or points to measure which can make this feel simpler to follow.
Choose a variety of foods from these groups: lean protein, whole grains, vegetables, fruits and plant-based fats.
You will have four meals per day during this phase. Any foods you want to include in those meals need to come from the approved five food groups.

, A unique requirement of the Cinch Diet is that you need to include both vegetarian and vegan meals throughout the week.If you currently eat meat, incorporate at least five vegetarian meals per week.
If you're currently a vegetarian, incorporate at least five vegan meals per week.
The book provides both vegetarian and vegan menus and recipes for your convenience. However, as long as you're choosing foods from the approved food groups, you're still within the boundaries of the diet.

, A tasty and delicious component of the Cinch Diet is that dessert is included. Have a sweet treat each night while on this particular diet.This will help you feel more satisfied overall.


Sometimes referred to as your ""daily chocolate escape,"" the Cinch Diet strongly recommends that you indulge in some dark chocolate every day.
This theory is backed by science that says one ounce of dark chocolate may help you lose weight and maintain it long-term.
The time of day does not matter - you can eat your chocolate in the afternoon or late evening.
Choose dark chocolate only. Choose a bar that's at least 70% cocoa. This may be a little bitter, but it is still enjoyable.

, Like many diets, there are some restricted foods on the Cinch Diet. Try to avoid these as much as possible, especially during the full 30 days of the diet program.


There are just a few foods that are not recommended on the Cinch Diet. Any type of sodas (even diet sodas), alcohol, red meat, and pork are not permitted on this diet.Even leaner cuts or cuts of beef or pork that are cooked in a nutritious manner are not permitted even in moderation.
Avoid these foods for the full 30 days of the program. After you've completed the diet, choose whether or not you want to bring these foods back or continue to avoid them long-term.

, The Cinch Diet focuses mainly on eating patterns, foods and the timing of meals. There is very minimal information on exercise in this diet.Although exercise is not a main focus in the diet, the topic is discussed briefly. Aim to walk for at least 30 minutes on five or more days during the week.
It also teaches you about how regular and consistent exercise is a key part of losing and maintaining your weight loss long-term.
Use your exercise schedule and calendar to help you stay consistent with this form of exercise during the Cinch Diet.

, Another unique component of the Cinch Diet is the focus on how you feel during the day. It has worksheets and information on journaling about your hunger levels.Hunger plays a huge part in how often we eat, what we eat and how much we eat at one sitting. The Cinch diet reviews this information and how to deal with your hunger.
Part of the reason behind this particular meal plan (eating four meals plus a dessert) is to help you manage your hunger throughout the day.
If you're having difficulty managing hunger, consider using some of the worksheets in the book to help you.

, Since the author is a Registered Dietitian, there is a focus on emotional eating in this diet. It's important to connect why you're eating or what you're eating with how you are feeling.


Like some of the hunger worksheets, the Cinch Diet also provides information on how to manage and deal with emotional eating.
Use the worksheets, journaling pages and tips to help manage your emotional eating during the diet and afterwards.

Once you've decided to follow this brain-healthy diet, sit down for a few minutes to create your meal plan. Write down every breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack that you'll have for an entire week.
Make sure that each meal contains one or more of the suggested brain-healthy food groups.
Although the MIND diet is incredibly flexible, your meal plan should have the following each day: three servings of whole grains, one serving of dark greens, a glass of red wine, an additional serving of other vegetables. You should also include 1/2 cup of beans every other day, a serving of either poultry at least twice per week, and a serving of fish at least once per week.For snacks, you can enjoy a serving of nuts or berries, especially blueberries.;
, The MIND diet doesn't give very many suggestions when it comes to your eating pattern. However, there are some guidelines when it comes to pairing certain foods.


When you're meal planning, try to make your main meals (especially lunch and dinner) a combination of a carbohydrate and protein.The MIND diet focuses on consuming carbohydrates from foods like whole grains, fruits and starchy vegetables. Pair these nutritious sources of carbohydrates with a protein-based foods.
For example, pair a sweet potato (a carbohydrate and starchy vegetable) and a piece of salmon (a protein), top a bowl of quinoa (a carbohydrate and whole grain) with some grilled chicken (a source of protein), have a serving of seasoned black beans with a serving of brown rice, or top a salad with a can of tuna.
Although this is a suggested practice, it's not necessary to see the results of this diet. It's only suggested as the combination of protein and a high fiber carbohydrate helps keep your appetite more stable during the day.

, Once you've created your meal plan and meal ideas, check for what you need to purchase and then make a run to the grocery store to stock up.


Review the list of foods for the MIND diet and see which ones you have at home. This will help you formulate your grocery list and prevent you from buying unnecessary items.
With your list, go to the grocery and stock up on your foods. Since many of the foods are fresh fruits and vegetables, only buy enough for the week.
One of the benefits to the MIND diet, is that there aren't a whole variety of foods that are required or suggested. In addition, the foods that are suggested are easy to find.

, Outside of your grocery store trip, you might also want to consider buying either a food scale or measuring cups. It'll help you make sure you're eating the right amounts suggested by the MIND diet.


The MIND diet is very easy to follow. However, it is recommended that you measure your portions.
It'll help you meet the recommended amounts of certain foods, but is also a suggested way to cut down on calories if weight loss is something you're interested in.
Check out your local grocery store or cookware store. Both a scale and measuring cups will work well. You may want to get both - measuring some foods is difficult with measuring cups (like measuring bulky foods like apples or carrots).

, Unlike many diets, the MIND diet is incredibly flexible and allows you much more dietary freedom. The downside of this is, that there are no recipes or meal plans suggested.While it's nice to not have to follow a very strict diet, the MIND diet can leave you hanging when it comes to recipes. You'll need to do a little research yourself.
When looking at the ""foods to include"" list, try searching for recipes that focus on these items.
For example, it's suggested to eat a serving of dark greens daily. Outside of salads, you might want to do a quick search for ""dark greens recipes"" to help give you more of a variety in your meals.
Use food blogs, cookbooks or food magazines to help you collect a few different recipes to use during this diet.

, One of the main food groups that is suggested on the MIND diet is vegetables. You have many choices and no limitations here.The MIND diet advises to have one serving of leafy dark green vegetables everyday. Include foods like: spinach, kale, swiss chard, arugula or collard greens.
Also measure the correct portion size of dark greens. Your serving should be 2 cups.You also need to have an additional serving of other vegetables. These include veggies like: green beans, eggplant, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, asparagus, mushrooms, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers or peas.
These vegetables should also be measured. Include at least one 1 cup serving daily.

, In addition to vegetables, the MIND diet suggests incorporating fruit into your daily diet. Again, there are no limitations here, but some specific suggestions.


Include at least one serving of fruit everyday into your diet. You can choose any type of fruit you want. Try: bananas, apples, pears, peaches, grapes or oranges.
Measure the appropriate portion size of fruits. It's 1/2 cup or one small piece of fruit per serving.Any type of fruit is great. However, the MIND diet does emphasize berries. Blueberries and strawberries in particular have been shown to have a variety of beneficial effects on brain health.You can include a 1/2 cup of either blueberries or strawberries every day, but at least two to three times a week.

, The MIND diet advises to eat certain types of protein during the day. Avoid fattier cuts of meat, red meat, and fried meats because these can increase your risk of dementia. Instead, leaner protein is emphasized.The protein group is important on the MIND diet. You still have a lot of freedom of choice, but this group of foods does have some more specific restrictions.
The types of protein foods suggested are: poultry (chicken and turkey), fish (especially fatty fish), nuts and beans.
Measure out the appropriate portion sizes of these foods as well. Protein should be measured to 1/2 cup or 3 to 4 oz per serving. This will be about the size of your palm.You need to eat protein at every meal on the MIND diet. The suggestions are: have a serving of nuts daily, beans three to four times a week, fish one or more times per week, and poultry two or more times week.

, Included in the both the DASH and Mediterranean diet, whole grains are a great, nutrient-dense food to include in your diet. The MIND diet specifies to have a few servings daily.


Whole grain foods are less processed than refined grains like white bread or white rice. This lack of processing helps them be higher in fiber and protein.The MIND diet suggests including up to three servings of these fiber rich foods every day.Choose whole grain foods like: quinoa, brown rice, oatmeal, whole wheat bread or whole wheat pasta.
Like all foods, you still need to measure the appropriate portion size of grains. Serve yourself about a 1/2 cup or 2 oz of whole grains per serving. These should be cooked before measuring., Like the Mediterranean diet, the MIND diet wants you to use olive oil as your main source of fat. Skip other types of fats and oils and only use olive oil in your cooking.Since olive oil or any fat for that matter is not a food group per se, you should try to incorporate this by using it as your main cooking oil.
For example, if you're sautéing vegetables, use olive oil. Or, if you're making a salad dressing for your dark greens, use olive oil as the main type of oil.
You can also just drizzle on olive oil to steamed vegetables, baked potatoes or over your protein at meals.
Since olive oil is high in calorie, it's suggested to measure your portion sizes (especially if you're watching your weight). Use a tablespoon per serving., A common suggestion on the Mediterranean diet, the MIND diet also suggests incorporating a glass of red wine on occasion.


Include a glass of red wine into your diet. Have a maximum of one glass daily or just a few a week.
When you're having a glass of wine, stick to a 5 oz pour of wine. This is just over a 1/2 cup total.Like many foods, red wine is only good in moderation and in the appropriate serving. Too much alcohol is never recommended or considered a method to improve health.

, One of the benefits of the MIND diet, is that the foods that are restricted are few and easy to limit. Plus, it's suggested to only limit these foods, not completely avoid them.Like many diets, there are a few foods that are suggested to reduce in your diet. These foods include: red meat, butter, stick margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets, fried foods and fast foods.
These foods are avoided because they're overly high in saturated fat, sugar and calories.
Studies have shown that people who have diets high in these types of foods are more at risk for cognitive decline and the formation of Alzheimer's Disease.
Although these foods should be avoided, the MIND diet does say that moderation is key. Having one serving of these foods per week is acceptable if you do want to include them.

, One specific lifestyle component that is not addressed in the MIND diet is exercise. Although it's not covered, it's still essential to include regular aerobic exercise each week.


Studies have shown that those people who had higher aerobic fitness levels (from working out regularly) had lower levels of brain atrophy compared to those with lower fitness levels.To help support your brain-healthy diet, include at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity each week.Try exercises and activities like: dancing, running, walking, using the elliptical, taking an aerobics class, rowing, swimming or hiking.

, In addition to aerobic exercise, you should also include a few days of strength training. There is an additional benefit to your brain by including both forms of exercise.


Studies have shown that a combination of both aerobic exercise and resistance training have the most dramatic effect in preventing cognitive decline and the formation of Alzheimer's Disease.Include one to two days of strength or resistance training each week. You should do these types of exercises every other day and ensure there's a day of rest in between days of work.Work every major muscle group and make sure your exercise routine lasts for at least 20 minutes. Try: weight lifting, yoga, pilates or body weight exercises.

, It's also frequently recommended to increase your lifestyle activity. This does produce additional aerobic benefits, but has a unique effect on your brain health.


Studies have shown that regular daily lifestyle activities, when a part of your routine, help preserve brain size and efficiency.The fact that these things can become a routine for you is why this helps improve your brain health.
Lifestyle activities are those things you do on a daily basis: doing the laundry, sweeping the floors, cleaning, gardening, and walking to and from your car.
See if there are ways in your life to be more active by taking more steps during the day. Park father away, skip the elevator or escalators, clean more regularly and walk more often.

, Although not mentioned or addressed in the MIND diet, you should give up smoking. This will help decrease your risk for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's Disease significantly.


Smoking increases your risk for a variety of devastating diseases long-term. However, studies have specifically shown that smokers are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's Disease.
If you currently smoke, consider quitting cold turkey. Although difficult, this is the quickest and fastest way to remove those harmful and toxic chemicals from your body.
If you're having difficulty quitting, talk to your doctor about prescription medications or a referral for a smoking cessation program.

Talk to your doctor.,
Go grocery shopping.,
Plan for side effects.,
Drink a variety of fluids.,
Consume appropriate foods.,
Spread calorie-containing liquids throughout the day.,
Restrict physical activity.",How to Follow a Clear Liquid Diet," Most likely, a doctor or surgeon is requiring you to follow a clear liquid diet. However if you are doing this for yourself for other reasons, it's important to talk to your doctor about whether or not a clear liquid diet is safe for you.


Ask your doctor the purpose of the clear liquid diet, how long it needs to last and what exactly you're allowed to consume during that time.
Also ask if you should limit physical activity, discontinue supplements or discontinue or change any medications you're currently taking.
Ask your doctor to review any potential side effects your doctor may expect you will experience during your clear liquid diet.;
, Once you're clear with what you can and cannot have during your liquid diet, take a trip to the grocery store. They key to success is being prepared; have the right clear liquid foods on hand.


Stock up on the items you're allowed to have so you have all the necessary items at home ready-to-go.
It's helpful to have everything you need at home. It may be hard to follow the prescribed diet if you don't have adequate supplies at home or at work.
Stock up on items like: broth, popsicles, jello, flavored waters, tea, coffee, and clear juices (like apple juice or white grape juice).

, Clear liquid diets may be associated with some side effects. It'll depend on what you can have on your clear liquid diet and how long you're supposed to follow it.


Side effects are usually mild and may include: hunger, headache, nausea, fatigue and diarrhea.
Call your doctor if symptoms worsen or if you're feeling sick. Tell them when the symptoms started and how they're affecting you.

, When you're on a clear fluid diet, you can have other fluids outside of water. It'll be easier to follow if you include some variety.


Having a variety of fluids throughout the day can help you manage hunger and any other side effects.
Beverages can include: water (plain, carbonated, or flavored); clear, pulp-free juice (like apple juice); fruit flavored juices; sports drinks; sodas, broth; coffee and tea (without added dairy products)., Even when you're on a clear liquid diet, there are a few foods that you can eat.


Eating some of these foods may help you feel a little more satisfied while drinking mostly fluids throughout the day.
Foods you can have include: gelatin, popsicles (without dairy, fruit pieces, chocolate or nuts) and hard candies.Make sure to include some savory liquids like chicken or beef broth.

, If you're able to have calorie-containing foods and beverages on your diet, it's important to spread them out throughout the day.When you're on a clear liquid diet, your overall calories will be low. This can lead to low blood sugar which may make you feel lightheaded, dizzy, or nauseous.
A sample menu of how to lay out your day can be: Breakfast: one glass of pulp-free juice, one cup of coffee or tea without dairy products (sweetener optional), Morning Snack: one cup of gelatin, Lunch: one cup of broth, one cup of pulp-free juice, Afternoon Snack: one cup of broth, Dinner: one cup gelatin and one cup of broth, Evening Snack: one cup pulp-free juice.
Diabetics will need to ensure they communicate frequently with their physician. In addition they should drink enough sweetened beverages to get around 200 g of carbohydrate total throughout the day., When you're following a clear liquid diet you're not able to consume many calories and other nutrients that support physical activity.


If you're normally a very active person, you may need to reduce or restrict the amount of physical activity you typically do. For example, if you normally run for 45 minutes, you may need to go for a 30 minute walk instead.
Light activities like walking and your daily lifestyle activities should still be OK to continue even on a clear liquid diet.
If you are feeling overly tired, nauseous or lightheaded during or after physical activity, stop immediately and discontinue exercise while on your clear liquid diet.

Cut out carbohydrates.,
Include lean protein at each meal.,
Make half of your plate a vegetable.,
Drink adequate fluids.,

Go for 150 minutes of cardio.,
Do two to three days of interval training.,
Increase your lifestyle activity.,
Skip snacks.,

Take an OTC diuretic.",How to Lose 5 Kilograms in One Week," Studies have shown one of the quickest ways to lose weight is by following a low-carb diet.Limit carbohydrate-rich foods if you want to come close to losing 5 kg in one week.


Carbohydrates are found in a wide variety of foods. Only limit those that are mostly carbohydrates like grain-based foods. Bread, rice, pasta and other grains are carbohydrate-rich and can be limited safely, as many of their nutrients are present in other foods.
Dairy products, starchy vegetables, and fruits also contain carbohydrates. Minimize these in your diet, but do not completely cut these foods out. They provide valuable nutrition to your diet.;
, In addition to following a low-carb diet, focus on consuming adequate amounts of lean protein. Higher protein diets in combination with low-carb are good for quicker weight loss.Focus on leaner sources of protein. They are lower in calories which can help support weight loss. Try: skinless poultry, eggs, lean beef, seafood, legumes, and tofu.
Include a source of protein at each meal and snack. This will help you reach your daily recommended amount. One serving of protein is about 3–4 oz or about the size of a check book.Protein will also help support weight loss by keeping you feel more satisfied longer which can help manage your hunger and desire to eat.

, To round out your meals, make the remaining half of your plate mostly vegetables and the occasional serving of fruit. These low-calorie foods will provide you with many vital nutrients.


The USDA recommends that you make half your plate a fruit or a vegetable. This is acceptable for most diets, even if you're trying to lose weight; however, fruits are also higher in carbohydrates and sugars, so should be limited.
Include at least one serving of vegetables at each meal. One serving is generally about 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy greens.If you do go for fruit, stick to 1/2 cup chopped or one small piece.Both fruits and vegetables are very low calorie. Making half of your meal a low-calorie food can help cut down on overall calorie intake and support your weight loss.

, Regardless of whether or not you're trying to lose weight, it's important to drink adequate fluids. However, drinking enough water does support weight loss.


Most health experts will recommend you drink a minimum of 2000 ml (about 64 oz or eight glasses of water) daily; however, this is just a rule of thumb. Recommendations even go up to 13 glasses of water daily.Stick to calorie-free, hydrating fluids like water, flavored water, decaf coffee and decaf tea (with no milk or sugar).
When you're even slightly dehydrated your body sends signals to your brain that feel and seem very much like hunger. This can trigger you to eat or snack and consume more calories than you need.Also try drinking a glass or two of water prior to eating. This may help you feel fuller and more satisfied with less food.

, Most health professionals and dietitians will tell you that losing 5 kg in a week might not be a safe or realistic goal; however, using meal replacement shakes or bars, you may be able to come close to your weight loss goal.Meal replacements are generally very low-calorie and high-protein shakes and bars. They are acceptable as meal replacements because they contain enough protein, carbohydrates, fiber and other essential vitamins and minerals similar to food.There are a variety of meal replacement plans available. Some are offered through doctors offices and are medically supervised by the physician and a dietitian. These programs are generally more expensive; however, they are considered safer.
You can also consider purchasing meal replacements at a grocery store or health food store. Research the products online first and choose a plan that will fit into your budget and lifestyle.
Meal replacements are only meant to be a very temporary diet program. Do not follow these low-calorie diets for more than one to two weeks.

, Cardio or aerobic exercises are the activities that are responsible for higher calorie burns. Combined with a diet program, cardio can help you lose weight quickly.The USDA recommends participating in at least 150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity physical activity each week. But if you're looking to burn even higher amounts of calories, aim for 300 minutes each week.Moderate intensity activity will differ for everyone. You should aim to be out of breath and sweating slightly and be able to sustain the activity for at least 20–30 minutes.
Include exercises like: fast walking, jogging/running, swimming, kick boxing or using the elliptical.

, In addition to your cardio, you may want to consider incorporating higher intensity interval training, or HIIT. HIIT can help burn additional calories each week.HIIT is a newer type of exercise. The studies that have been done show that you can burn a significant amount of calories in a shorter amount of time. In addition, your body burns more calories from fat.HIIT is also great for increasing your overall metabolism or your body's ability to burn additional calories for hours after you've completed the exercise — sometimes up to 24 hours.An example of a HIIT exercise would be: 1 minute of sprinting followed by 1.5 minutes of a moderate jog. These activities would be repeated for about 20 minutes, plus a 5 minute warm up and a 5 minute cool down.

, To continue to increase your overall calorie burn for the week, try to increase your movement throughout the day. The more mobile and active you are in general, the more calories you burn per day.


Lifestyle or baseline activity are things you do on a typical day — walking to and from your car or doing household chores.
Increase your participation in these types of activities and increase your steps as much as possible. Try taking the stairs a few extra times, walking the long way to and from your destination, parking father away or doing a quick jog in place during a commercial break.

, Including a healthy snack or two can be a part of a weight loss plan. But if you're interested in losing a lot of weight quickly, ditch the extra snacks to help control overall calories.


If you're feeling hungry in-between meals, try having a glass of water or unsweetened decaf coffee or tea. The fluid and flavor can help trick your brain that you're feeling satisfied.
If you must snack, keep your food choices under 100-150 calories. Also make sure they're mostly lean protein to help you meet your protein goal.
Examples of appropriate snacks include: a handful (8) almonds or other nuts, a glass of soy milk, a tablespoon (15ml) of hummus, a hard boiled egg, or a fat free greek yogurt., Sleep is very important for your health. It takes an even more critical role when you're trying to lose weight. Even if you're only dieting for a week, adequate sleep is vital.When you don't sleep well, your body fights against you to lose weight. For one, lack of sleep can trigger your body to release higher levels of hormones that cause you to feel hungry. In addition, those who are sleep deprived typically crave higher fat foods.Aim for at least 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Try to go to bed earlier and sleep in later if possible. Also try to reduce devices that make sound or light to help ensure you get a sound sleep.

, Like sleep, excess stress can make it more difficult for your body to lose weight.Manage and reduce stress as much as possible.


Stress is something everyone experiences. When you have continuous stress, even minimal stress, your body produces extra cortisol. This hormone makes it difficult for you to lose weight. In addition it can make your feel more tired and hungry.Incorporate de-stressing techniques and activities into your daily routine. Try: going for walk, taking a hot shower, talking to a friend or family member, watching a good movie or reading a book.
If stress is something that's difficult to manage and is causing emotional eating or disrupting your ability to eat healthy and lose weight, consider seeing a life coach for additional support and counseling.

, Since larger quantities of weight loss in short amounts of time is difficult, you may want to consider taking an over-the-counter or OTC diuretic. This may help the number on the scale continue to decrease.


A diuretic is a medication that helps your body excrete excess water. Sometimes due to diet or lifestyle, your body may be hanging onto excess water. This may make you feel puffy, bloated or make the scale reflect a higher weight.
Take the OTC medication just for a few days. You may notice your body releases enough water to reflect a weight loss of a few pounds over the week.It's not safe or recommended to take them long term especially without the supervision of a physician. Always talk to your primary care doctor prior to taking any OTC medication to make sure they are safe and appropriate for you.

Add in strength training.",How to Lose 30 Pounds," You will need a good idea of the calories you are consuming before you start any type of reduced calorie diet plan.


Start keeping a food journal by noting everything you eat and drink in one day. Note your breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, drinks and anything else you eat throughout the day.
Be as accurate as you can.The calories you calculate from these typical days will be your starting point for figuring out a level that will help you lose weight.
Continue your food journal after you've begun your weight loss plan as well. Studies show this keeps you accountable to your diet and can help you lose weight and keep it off.;
, After you've kept a food journal for a few days, you'll be able to determine a calorie goal to meet each day to help you lose weight.


Most health professionals recommend aiming for a one to two pound weight loss each week. This is gradual, but safer and more sustainable weight loss.You'll most likely have an easier time maintaining a weight loss that was more gradual.
Take your food journal and average the total calories you typically eat. Subtract 500 to 750 calories from this number.This lower calorie level is what you should aim for if you want to lose one to two pounds per week.
If you subtract 500 to 750 calories but you get a value less than 1,200 calories, then make 1,200 calories your daily target.
Eating less than 1,200 calories daily isn't considered safe. Your metabolism can slow and you're at a high risk for nutrient deficiencies., Set up a weight loss calendar or schedule to help get you going and keep you on track for weight loss within a specific time period.


If you're going about weight loss with the mindset of losing one to two pounds per week, you'll need about four months to lose 30 pounds.
However, you may want to consider giving yourself a few extra weeks to lose that weight. You need to plan for slip-ups, holidays and unplanned stressful events that could set you back a few days or week with your weight loss.

, Another thing that will be beneficial to plan as part of your weight loss diet is finding and building a support group.Studies have shown that those who have a support group tend to stick to diets long-term and are able to lose more weight and keep it off compared to those who do not have a support group.Talk to friends, family members or co-workers about your weight loss goals and ask them to be your support group and keep you accountable.
Also, be your own support group by writing down your motivations for losing weight in your food and fitness journal. Return to this journal daily and weekly to plot your goals, weight and inch reduction.

, Many studies show that a higher protein diet can help you lose weight, but also make it a bit easier to keep the weight off long-term.Protein is an essential nutrient to your diet. Focus on getting a little more than average to help you increase your overall satiety and better manage your appetite.
If you make sure to eat a source of protein at each meal, you'll be able to meet your protein needs with ease. Plan to have at least one or two servings of leaner protein per meal and one serving with snacks.
One serving of meat protein, is about 85 to 120 grams by weight (or 3 to 4 oz), which delivers 20 to 25 grams of protein.Choose leaner protein sources as these are lower in calories and can easily fit into a low-calorie diet plan.
Alternate between different sources of protein to maintain a varied diet. Try: seafood, tofu, legumes, lean beef, eggs, low-fat dairy and poultry.

, Another easy trick to maintaining a lower calorie diet, without feeling like you're starving yourself is to fill up on lots of fruits and vegetables.


These foods are low in calorie which means you can eat a fair amount and still be within your target calorie goal.
In addition, these foods are high in fiber. They provide bulk to meals so you'll feel more full during meals and stay satisfied longer after your meal is completed.Make half of your meals and snacks a fruit or vegetable. Aim for one cup of dense vegetables, two cups of leafy greens and 1/2 cup of fruit per serving., In addition to fruits and vegetables, another fiber-packed food group are grains.


Add a serving or two of whole grains to your day to help you increase your fiber intake so you'll feel more satisfied with your meals.
Its recommended to go for 100% whole grains over refined grains because they are higher in fiber, protein and other essential nutrients.Avoid refined grains like white bread, white rice, plain pasta or baked goods made with white flour.
Instead, try a variety of whole grains like: oats, quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat bread or whole wheat pasta.
Also, always measure portion sizes of whole grains. Stick to 1/2 cup or 1 oz per serving., Although snacking might seem counter intuitive to weight loss, they can actually be an appropriate part of your weight loss plan.If you feel like you'll need a snack, aim to make snacks 150 calories or less.Also, make sure they contain some lean protein and a fruit or vegetable to make them a nutrient-packed addition to your day.
Also, only snack if you need to. For example, if it's been more than four hours since you ate and your stomach is growling or you need a little something before your workout. Try to avoid snacking out of boredom.
Place 100 to 150 calorie snacks in small baggies to bring to work or keep at home for a quick on-the-go snack choice.

, When you're trying to lose weight, it is a smart idea to make some lifestyle changes in addition to following a reduced calorie diet.


Eating mindfully can be a great tool to use in addition to following a specific diet or exercise plan to lose weight. You'll be forced to pay attention to what you're eating, how you're eating and why you eat.
Take at least 20 minutes to eat your meals. This slow method of eating helps give your body enough time to feel satisfied and can help prevent you from overeating.Use smaller portions and smaller plates. Using salad plates at dinner can help you control portion sizes better.
Also remove distractions while you're eating. Turning off the TV and your cell phone can force you to pay attention and get more enjoyment and satisfaction from your meals.

, Water is essential to keeping you hydrated throughout the day. However, it's also a key factor in your weight loss.


When you're dehydrated, which is fairly common, many times you may confuse thirst for hunger. You may eat or have a snack when in reality you just needed to sip on some water.In addition, drinking a large glass of water prior to meals can help fill you up and make you feel full on a no-calorie fluid.
Aim for a minimum of eight 8 ounce glasses of fluid daily. However, some health professionals believe you may even need up to 13 glasses daily. This will depend on your age, gender and activity level.Aim to have you urine the color of lemonade or very pale yellow by the end of the day. In addition, you shouldn't feel thirsty throughout the day.

, When you're aiming to lose a larger quantity of weight and are planning to use exercise to support that weight loss, it might be beneficial to set up an exercise plan for yourself.


Write up a little schedule or calendar that shows what type of exercise you'll be doing, what time of day, how many days a week and for how long.
Plan to start with low-impact workouts. Try swimming, walking, water aerobics or elliptical use during the first month. These types of exercises might be better on your joints or be easy for those suffering from arthritis.Also plan to slowly increase the duration or amount of time spent exercising. You may start out by aiming to work out for 20 minutes three days a week. Slowly advance to 30 minutes three days a week and then 30 minutes four days a week.
You may want to considering meeting with a personal trainer or physical therapist if you haven't exercised before or want additional guidance.

, An easy way to begin exercising and just being more active is by increasing your lifestyle activity. This is an especially good place to start if you aren't currently doing any planned or structured exercise.


Lifestyle activities are those you do on a regular basis. Walking to and from your car, mopping the floor, taking the stairs in your office or even shoveling snow.
Some studies show that those people who do a lot of lifestyle activity reap similar benefits to those people who do structured aerobic activity.Try to add more movement or steps to your day. For example, go for a 10 to 20 minute walk after dinner or on your lunch break. Micro walks during the work day, in the morning or during your lunch hour will also help you lose weight.
Also, try planning activities, rather than television watching. Encourage your entire family to be more active. Go mini golfing, dog walking or play sports.

, After you've worked on increasing your lifestyle activity start making strides to participating in some planned and structured cardio exercises.


Most health experts recommend participating in about 150 minutes of activity each week. This is about 2 1/2 hours.If you haven't been exercising or have difficulty with exercising, start with a smaller goal like 1 1/2 hours a week.
Many activities can count as cardio exercises. Try: water aerobics, using the elliptical, going for a walk, doing a dance class or riding a stationary bike.

, Strength training helps build lean muscle mass and can help increase your body's ability to burn calories during rest over time.


Lift free weights or use weight machines for at least 30 minutes two to three times per week. Aim to work each major muscle group. Lift free weights or use weight machines for at least 30 minutes two to three times per week.
Sign up for a personal training session to learn proper form. You should be very careful to avoid injury. Review your form and new exercises with the personal trainer frequently.

Visit the sauna.,
Exercise.,
Try a sauna suit.,
Know the risks and costs.",How to Lose 2 Lbs in One Day1," One of the most straightforward ways to quickly lose water weight is to simply sweat it out. This is a short-term technique that is commonly used by boxers and other fighters to shed extra pounds before a weigh-in. You can make yourself sweat in any number of ways, but arguably the most time-efficient way would be to spend some time in a sauna. Here you will quickly sweat and drop water weight.


Because saunas can be intense, you should only sit in them for short periods of 15 minutes to half an hour.
After each short interval check your weight to see how much you have lost.If you sweat a lot in the sauna and become dehydrated your body may start retaining water, so have some water handy and monitor your weight loss regularly.A hot bath will work in the same way as a sauna.;
, An even more simple way to make yourself sweat is to exercise. If you try running, cycling, or any other kind of strenuous physical activity, you will begin to sweat which will result in you temporarily losing some water weight. Some athletes will train in extra layers of clothing to provoke more sweating, but this can be dangerous and lead to overheating which can be fatal.Bikram yoga is an example of exercising in a heated environment that will cause you to sweat much more than normal.
The heat and humidity mean there is a potential for heat-related illness and you are advised to check with your doctor before undertaking such a workout., Another way to provoke sweating is to exercise while wearing a sauna suit. These suits simply make you sweat more when you exercise than you would if you were wearing more appropriate clothing. As with all the sweating techniques, you can lose a number of pounds of water weight very quickly, but these will be regained even more quickly once you eat or drink something., With all of these sweating techniques, the dangers of dehydration, heat-related illnesses, and an electro-deficit are very real. You should speak with a medical professional before considering any of these options. If you are trying to drop weight for a boxing match or a wrestling bout, be aware that sudden weight loss can make it harder for you to think clearly, cause you to lose power, and lead to sudden mood changes."
"
Adjust your carbohydrate intake slowly.,
Add nuts, seeds, fruits, fruit juices and dairy back into your daily meals.",How to Follow Dr. Atkins' Four Part Program2," Atkins recommends you start with 25 grams of net carbohydrates each day and slowly increase the gram count. If weight loss stalls or slows down drastically, you may have reached your ""Carbohydrate Level for Losing"" or CLL. In order to jump start your weight loss again, adjust your net carbohydrate level by lowering it 10 grams.

, These foods have higher net carbohydrates per serving and can be added to the list of allowed foods used during Phase 1.

"
"
Move to Phase 3 when you have only 10 more pounds to lose or when you have reached your personal weight loss goal.,
Add high carbohydrate fruit, starchy vegetables and whole grains back into your daily diet, along with the allowed foods from phases 1 and 2.

",How to Follow Dr. Atkins' Four Part Program3," You will figure out your Atkins Carbohydrate Equilibrium, or ACE, in this phase. The ACE is the total amount of net carbohydrates you can safely consume each day that allows you to neither lose nor gain weight.

,"
"
Incorporate all of the foods from phases 1, 2 and 3 into your daily meals when you have reached your goal weight.",How to Follow Dr. Atkins' Four Part Program4," There are really no foods that are off limits during lifetime maintenance, but if you see yourself gaining weight, go back to phase 2 before the total amount gained reaches 5 pounds.

"
"
Keep drinking water.,
Cut down on salt.,
Eat less starchy carbohydrates.,
Consider a healthier, sustainable way to lose weight.",How to Lose 2 Lbs in One Day2," If you want to lower the amount of water weight you retain, you should keep drinking plenty of water. By keeping up your water intake, you will help enable your body to effectively flush out the excess salt that was causing water retention. If you consistently drink at least 8 glasses of water a day your body will learn that it does not need to retain as much water to deal with salt.Drinking plenty of water also helps increase your metabolic rate which will help you burn fat faster in the long run.It is possible to drink too much water and suffer water intoxication, which can be fatal. This can occur when someone compulsively drinks water or over-hydrates after a heat-related illness.Drink enough fluids so that you rarely feel thirsty and your urine is light yellow or colorless.If you are trying to lose a few pounds very quickly, then you might not consume any liquids for a day. This might see you temporarily drop a few pounds of water weight, but is not advisable for your health., The amount of salt we have in our bodies influences our level of water retention and in turn how much excess water weight we hold. Your body needs around 2000–2500mg of sodium a day to function and if you consume much more than that then water will be retained.If you limit your salt intake to between 500 and 1500mg a day, equivalent to around two teaspoons, then you may retain less water.You can replace salt with spices to season your food, such as ginger, and black pepper.

, Cutting down on the amount of carbohydrates and starchy food is a well-known facet to many diet plans. Sticking to healthy whole grain carbohydrates, and fibre-rich fruits and vegetables can help you to maintain a healthy diet and weight. Limiting your intake of refined grains and sugars can help you to stay healthy, but you should remember that carbohydrates are an important part of a balanced healthy diet.Starchy carbohydrates lead to water retention, water weight gain, and bloating.

, If you are trying to lose weight, even if it is to make a weigh-in for a fight, you should try to avoid rapid weight loss as the costs can outweigh the benefits. Boxing and wrestling coaches recommend that fighters always stay within five or 10 pounds of their fighting weight so they can safely and gradually lose any extra pounds before a weigh-in.Rapid weight loss is controversial even in these sports and should not be undertaken lightly or without expert guidance.The potential costs to performance, as well as health, can make rapid weight loss counter-productive.
To lose weight in a sustainable and manageable way, combine a healthy diet with plenty of exercise.

Talk to your doctor.,
Consider the health benefits.,
Understand that anyone can follow the DASH diet.",How to Follow the DASH Diet1," Changing the way you eat can have multiple health benefits. It is important, however, that you talk to your doctor first. This is especially critical for individuals with pre-existing health conditions. Before you begin the DASH diet, or any dietary plan, make an appointment with your doctor to discuss it.;
, DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. If you suffer from hypertension, or high blood pressure, changing your diet is one of the best ways to treat your condition. Following the DASH diet can help you reduce your blood pressure.By following the DASH diet carefully, you may benefit from a reduction in your blood pressure of up to 14 points.

, You don’t have to suffer from hypertension to follow the DASH diet. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest that the DASH diet can be a healthy choice for all individuals. This means that your whole family can join you!Most Americans get too much sodium, so following a low sodium diet can be a healthy choice for most people. Even reducing your sodium intake to below 2,400 mg can improve your blood pressure and support a healthy heart."

Consider HIIT.",How to Lose 25 Pounds in Two Months," Losing 25 pounds in two months is a lofty goal. Due to the type of diet and exercise plan this type of weight loss requires, it's going to be a smart idea to talk to your doctor prior to starting your weight loss.


A low-calorie diet paired with a lot of exercise is generally safe for most people; however, talk to your doctor about exactly what type of diet and exercise you plan on doing. They will be able to tell you whether or not this is safe for your current health conditions.
Speak to a registered dietitian. These nutrition professionals will be able to guide you on an appropriate eating pattern to meet your goal. They may be able to give you an specific meal plan, types of foods to include and what to avoid.
Discuss with your doctor whether this is truly an attainable goal. Someone who is 50 pounds overweight might be able to lose 25 pounds in two months, but someone who is 20 pounds overweight cannot. It is unrealistic for most people who are overweight (as in BMI over 25 but under 29) to lose 25 pounds in two months.
In addition if you are obese (BMI over 30), it may be difficult for you to incorporate the exercise necessary for such a diet. Running, jogging, aerobics, and exercise that requires major exertion may cause too much discomfort for someone who is obese.
In addition, you need to discuss the risk of yo-yo dieting. Rapidly losing weight only to put it back on causes some major health risks, and is actually considered quite dangerous. You can put yourself at risk for heart disease, cancer and diabetes; damage to arteries; less energy; muscle wasting; and higher levels of body fat.;
, Starting a journal will be a good tool for your diet and exercise program. Use a pen and paper journal or a smartphone app to track a variety of factors that will help you monitor your progress.


Log everything you eat in your journal. This will help you stay accountable but also provide you with good information if you're not seeing your desired results, as you can look back and see where you can possibly reduce more calories.Consider tracking your exercise as well. Again, this can help keep you on track and help you calculate how many calories you are burning.
Lastly, keep track of your progress. This may mean your weight loss or measurements. If you're not seeing your results, you may need to go back and analyze your food and exercise journal.

, Losing 25 pounds in two months will be difficult. You'll need to make a variety of changes to your diet and lifestyle. These changes may be difficult to maintain every day for two months. A support group can help you stay strong the entire two months.Find friends, family members or co-workers that will be positive support. Look for people that will help you stay on track. Some people may not encourage you through your tough moments and should not be included in your support group.Also ask if anyone wants to join you on your new plan. Losing weight and getting in shape is a common goal and finding a friend to go along with you makes the journey more fun.
You can also check out online support groups or forums of others trying to lose weight. This may allow you to connect with other people any time of day.

, To keep yourself organized and on track, take the time to write up your desired diet and exercise plan. These blueprints will answer all your questions of how you're going to lose 25 pounds in two months.


Start with your diet plan. To lose that 25 pounds, you'll need to make the most changes to your diet. You'll also need to be the most strict with your diet. Diet has the greatest effect on your weight loss.Write out your calorie level for each day. Then construct a meal plan that fits into that calorie plan. Include each meal, snack and beverage you plan on consuming throughout the day.Write down what type of exercise you're going to be doing, how much to aim for each week and how you're going to divide that up between seven days.

, To lose weight, you'll need to modify your diet by cutting down on the total amount of calories you eat each day. To lose 25 pounds in two months, you'll need to cut out a significant amount of calories each day.


In general, safe weight loss is considered to be about 1 – 2 pounds of weight loss each week.To lose 25 pounds in two months you'll need to lose about three pounds per week. Although this is technically outside of the ""safe weight loss"" limit, it's a may be a realistic goal for those who stick to a strict diet plan the entire two months.
You'll need to cut out at least 750 calories daily. One pound is equivalent to 3,500 calories, so you'll need to lose 87,500 (3,500 x 25) over 60 days. To achieve this goal, you will need to lose 1,458.3 calories per day.
Although you'll need to cut out a significant amount of calories each day, it's not typically recommended by health professionals to eat less than 1,200 calories daily. A calorie level lower than this may not allow you to consume enough vital nutrients that your body needs to function normally each day.
In addition, consistently following a calorie limit that is too low may result in the loss of lean muscle mass, not fat mass. It may slow down your metabolism and cause your body to actually cling to the fat instead of shedding it, because your body will enter ""starvation mode.""

, Many studies show that one of the dieting plans that results in the fastest weight loss is a low-carb diet. These diets not only help you lose weight faster, but typically result in the loss of more fat mass compared to lean muscle mass.To follow a low carb diet, you'll need to focus on minimizing the amount of carbohydrates that you consume each day.
Carbs are found in a variety of foods including: starchy vegetables (like potatoes or peas), legumes (beans and lentils), fruits, dairy products and grains.Because carbohydrates are so widespread through a variety of food groups, it's not ideal or realistic to cut out each of those food groups. Focus on minimizing the most carbohydrate-rich food groups like grains, starchy vegetables and some fruits.
Many nutrients found in foods like grains or starchy vegetables are easily consumed from other food groups. Limiting these for a short time period like two months isn't considered unhealthy.
Although fruit is a carbohydrate-rich food, you should not avoid all fruit. Choose to have minimal, small amounts of fruit each week. Also choose lower-sugar fruits like: cranberries, raspberries, blackberries and strawberries.Also keep fruit to the appropriate serving size of 1/2 cup chopped or small fruit or one small piece., If you're following a low-carb diet, there are two food groups that are left that are considered low-carb. Protein and non-starchy vegetables are low-carb, low-calories and nutrient-dense, making them an excellent pair for rapid weight loss.


Aim for one to two servings of lean protein at each meal or snack. One serving is about 3 – 4 oz or about the size of a deck of cards.Fill up on as many non-starchy vegetables as you'd like. It's typically recommended to make 1/2 of your plate a vegetable.In general, you may notice that half of your plate is a source of lean protein and half is a non-starchy vegetable and the occasional piece of fruit.

, When you're cutting a significant amount of calories from your diet each day and participating in a higher amount of physical activity, there is a chance that you'll feel more hungry or need an extra boost throughout the day. Planning healthy, weight-loss-friendly snacks is a must.


If you're trying to follow a more rapid weight loss plan, you'll need to make sure that your snacks fit into your daily calorie goal. Typically a snack of 100 – 150 calories will work well in your plan.Try to stick to one snack daily. Including two or more might put you over your daily calorie goal.
To fit in with your high-protein, low-carb diet, choose snacks that also feature higher protein amounts.
Examples of low-calorie, low-carb snacks include: 1/4 cup of almonds, 1/2 cup plain low-fat greek yogurt, 3 oz of beef jerky or one hard boiled egg.
Also, only snack if you're feeling truly hungry or need a boost for a workout. If you snack unnecessarily that may lead to slower weight loss or a plateau.

, Drinking enough hydrating fluids each day is essential for overall health. It'll also become even more important with rapid weight loss and higher amounts of physical activity.


When you're losing weight, especially when paired with higher intensity or higher amounts of cardio, you'll need to make sure that you're drinking enough to rehydrate after workouts and stay hydrated throughout the day.Aim for a minimum of eight glasses daily or about 64 oz (1.9 L); however, if you're including more physical activity you may need to drink up to 13 glasses daily. This will depend on your exercise, gender and age as well.Stick to low- or no-calorie fluids to help you meet your daily calorie goal. Beverages like water, flavored water, decaf coffee and tea are the best choices.

, Although exercise is not responsible for a large part of weight loss, when you have a lofty weight loss goal, you'll need to really increase the amount of cardio exercise you do each day.Cardio or aerobic activity is the type of exercise that's responsible for larger calorie burns compared to strength training.
Most health professionals recommend including at least 150 minutes of cardio exercises each week;however, because losing 25 pounds in two months is considered a rapid weight loss, you'll need to add in additional activity to help you reach your goal.
Consider doing at least 300 minutes of cardio each week. This is a lot of exercise, but will really burn additional calories to help you lose weight more quickly.Include exercises like: jogging/running, swimming, using the elliptical, aerobics classes, cycling or doing spin class.

, Strength training or resistance training does not burn many calories per session; however, it is important component of overall exercise.


Strength training helps build and support lean muscle mass during weight loss. In addition, the more lean muscle mass you have, the more calories you'll burn at rest, meaning you'll be burning more calories overall.
Most health experts recommend including at least two to three days of strength training each week. Work each major muscle group in your body each day you do strength work.If you're having difficulty meeting the 150 – 300 minutes of cardio each week, cut down on the amount of time you spend doing strength training. In the short-term of two months, you'll benefit more from doing higher amounts of cardio., Lifestyle or baseline activity are the types of exercise that you include in your everyday life. These types of activities do not burn many calories by themselves, but added up at the end of the day, they can have a significant effect on the total amount of calories you've burned.Lifestyle activities include things like: doing household chores, gardening, walking to and from your car, walking throughout the day and taking the stairs.
Spend some time when you're coming up with your exercise plan to add in ways you can be more active throughout the day or just move more.
For example, can you park farther away when you're at the store or at work? Are there ways you can take the stairs instead of the elevator? Can you stand or move more while you're watching TV?

, A more trendy form of exercise is called HIIT or high-intensity interval training. This type of exercise burns a lot of calories in a short amount of time and can help you reach your weight goal.


HIIT is a form of exercise that combines bouts of very high-intensity cardio activities with short bouts of more moderate-intensity activities. HIIT sessions are usually shorter compared to more steady cardio (like going for a 45 minute jog).Although HIIT sessions are shorter, they burn higher amount of calories compared to steady cardio. In addition, studies have shown that they keep your metabolism (your body's calorie burner) raised long after the workout has been completed.In addition to your regular cardio and strength training, consider adding one to two sessions of HIIT throughout the week. This extra calorie burn can help you reach that 25 pound goal in two months.

Vegetarians can consume protein sources like tofu or tempeh instead of protein sourced from animals.A serving size is 1 ounce of cooked meat, poultry, or fish. That means that if you eat a 4 oz chicken breast, you have had four of your six meat servings for the day.

, On the DASH diet, you will eat a variety of legumes, seeds, and nuts each week. Keep in mind that these guidelines are per week, as opposed to daily. Nuts, seeds, and legumes are rich in energy, protein, and fiber. They also contribute magnesium and potassium to your diet.A serving is 1/3 cup of nuts, 2 tablespoons of nut butter, 2 tablespoons of seeds, or ½ cup cooked legumes.
Good choices include peanuts, walnuts, sunflower seeds, lentils, and kidney beans.

, The DASH diet requires that you limit the amount of fats and oils you eat each day to between 2 and 3 servings. You should aim for healthy sources of fat, like olive oil, and avoid unhealthy fats, such as hydrogenated fats and oils.Examples of servings include one tablespoon of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of low-fat mayonnaise, or 2 tablespoons of light salad dressing.

Reduce your sodium intake.,
Consume 5 or fewer servings of sweets each week.,
Limit foods high in saturated fats.,
Watch out for the “salty six.” There are six foods that are notorious for having high levels of sodium, and it is important to watch out for these foods when attempting to follow the DASH diet.",How to Follow the DASH Diet3," The DASH diet is a low sodium eating plan. On this diet you will be consuming large amounts of foods that are naturally low in sodium, and avoiding high sodium foods like processed foods. On the DASH diet, you should limit your sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day, or to 1,500 mg per day if you are:Over 51 years old.
Have high blood pressure or hypertension.
Diabetic.
Have chronic kidney disease.
African American., On the DASH diet, you will need to keep your consumption of sugar and sweets in check. This means consuming 5, but preferably fewer, sweets per week that are low in fat.Examples include 1 tablespoon of maple syrup, 1 tablespoon of jelly or jam, or 1 cup of lemonade.
Opt for low fat sweets when you do indulge, such as jelly beans and low-fat frozen yogurt.
Watch out for added sugar in everything from dry cereal to condiments. Always check the label to find out what the sugar content is before you decide to eat something.
Try replacing sugar with artificial sweeteners. For example, if you usually take sugar in your coffee or tea, replace it with stevia or Splenda. You can also opt for sugar-free versions of things like diet soda.Make sure that you check the sodium levels of any sweets that you eat as well. Add these amounts to your daily sodium intake tally.

, The DASH diet requires you to limit foods that contain high amounts of saturated fats, such as fatty meats and dairy products that contain full fat. You should also avoid tropical oils like palm oil, coconut oil, and palm kernel oils, which are all high in saturated fats.Cut back on your intake of meat, cheese, butter, and other fatty animal products.
Try substituting for healthier options wherever you can. For example, you can opt for lean meats, low-fat cheeses, and even light butter.
Be sure to check the sodium content of all of these foods as well. These amounts must be included in your daily sodium tally.

, These foods include:Cold cuts and cured meats. Deli meats and cured meats can be extremely high in sodium, with up to 1,050 mg of sodium per serving. Read the labels and look for low sodium options.

Pizza. Pizza has a high sodium content due to the sauce, cheese, and even the dough. Some of the toppings can also add extra sodium, like pepperoni and olives. One slice may even have up to 760 mg of sodium. Try making your own pizza at home with a low sodium sauce and by using fresh cut veggies as toppings.

Soup. One can of soup can contain half of your daily sodium requirement! Read the labels on soup cans and look for low sodium options. You can also try making a low-sodium version of an old favorite at home, like split pea soup.

Breads and rolls. Always check the packages of any bread you buy in the grocery store. They can contain up to 230 milligrams of sodium per slice!

Chicken. Processed chicken like chicken patties, chicken nuggets, and other fast food chicken concoctions can contain a large amount of sodium. Try to stick with fresh chicken breast and avoid eating chicken that has been breaded or marinated in a salty sauce.

Burritos and tacos. The seasoning often used for preparing burrito and taco meat fillings is loaded with sodium. Avoid using these seasoning blends or opt for a reduced sodium version.

Use herbs and spices to flavor your foods.,
Squeeze some lemon or lime juice over foods instead of adding salt.,
Add hot peppers to recipes.,
Season food with vinegars.,
Cook with flavorful oils.",How to Follow the DASH Diet4," Fresh and dried herbs and spices add flavor to food without adding sodium. Make sure that you always have a good selection of herbs and spices available and add them to recipes to add flavor.Herbs like oregano, basil, thyme, rosemary, and garlic are great additions for Italian dishes.
Try cumin, paprika, chili powder, and marjoram for Mexican and Southwest dishes.
Use curry powder, garam masala, and mustard seeds to season Indian dishes.
You can also look for sodium-free spice blends in the spice sections of grocery stores.

, Instead of dousing your food in salt right after you put it on your plate, try squeezing a lemon or lime wedge over it. These citrus fruits can add flavor without adding sodium to your meal. You can also cook with citrus juice and zest to add flavor., If you enjoy spicy foods, then you can also spice up your dishes to add flavor without adding salt. Try adding a chopped jalapeno, Anaheim pepper, or a habanero pepper to your recipe., There are lots of different kinds of vinegars that you can use in your cooking and this can add extra flavor without adding sodium. Some vinegars to try in your cooking include:White.
Red wine.
Balsamic.
Rice.
Flavor infused vinegars, such as citrus, cherry, herb, and garlic.

, You can also add flavor without adding sodium by using a small amount of a flavorful oil while cooking your food. Some oils you can try include:Sesame oil.
Extra virgin olive oil.
Coconut oil.
Peanut oil.
Oils infused with garlic, truffles, or herbs.

"
Calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).,
Calculate total calories burned per day.,
Calculate your calorie goal.",How to Lose 20 Pounds2," Your basal metabolic rate or BMR is how many calories you body burns per day performing basic metabolic functions, such as breathing, digesting food, etc. This calculation is important for determining your basic caloric needs.


If you are a women, calculate your BMR using the following formula : 655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) – (4.7 x age in years)

Example: A 5'7"", 135 pound, 30-year-old woman's BMR would be 655 + (4.3 x 135 pounds) + (4.7 x 67) – (4.7 x 30) = 1408.5.


If you are a man, calculate your BMR using the following formula : 66 + (6.3 x weight in pounds) + (12.9 x height in inches) – (6.8 x age in years)

Example: A 6', 180 pound, 30-year-old man's BMR would be 66 + (6.3 x 180 pounds) + (12.9 x 72) – (6.8 x 30 years) = 1924.8.



, If you are sedentary, multiply your BMR by 1.2. If you are moderately active, multiply your BMR by 1.3-1.4. If you are very active multiply your BMR by 1.4-1.5. This resulting number is an estimate of the number of calories you burn per day.


Example: If you, like the above man, had a BMR of 1924.8 and lived an active lifestyle then you would need to multiply your BMR by 1.4. If you did this, you would find that you burn approximately 2695 calories per day.

, A reasonable calorie goal would be to consume 15-30% less calories than you currently burn per day. To perform this calculation multiply how many calories you burn per day (as calculated in the the ""Calculate total calories burned per day"" step) by 0.70 - 0.85.


Example: If you, like the above man, burned approximately 2695 calories per day then you would want to eat between 1886 (2695 x 0.70) and 2291 (2695 x 0.85) calories per day.
The larger your deficit, closer to 30% (1886 calories/day), the quicker your diet will be but the harder it will be to maintain. The smaller your deficit, closer to 15% (2291 calories/day), the easier your diet will be to maintain but your weight loss will be slower.

"
"
Understand how to set a reasonable diet timeline.,
Calculate your daily caloric deficit.,
Calculate your timeline.",How to Lose 20 Pounds3," Often it is tempting to set a diet timeline first, then figure out your calorie goals. However, this often leads to unrealistic dieting expectations, crash dieting and yo-yo dieting. To avoid this, figure out a healthy calorie deficit first in the ""Calculate your calorie goal"" step, then use this section to calculate how long it will take you to lose 20 pounds.

, To calculate your timeline subtract your calorie goal (from the ""Calculate your calorie goal"" step) from how many calories you burn per day (from the ""Calculate total calories burned per day"" step). This will give you how many calories you should be burning per day.


Example #1: If you burn 2695 calories a day (as calculated from the ""Calculate total calories burned per day"" step) and decided on a 30% deficit for a caloric goal of 1886 (from step ""Calculate your calorie goal"") then you would have a deficit of 2695 - 1886 = 806 calories per day.
Example #2: If you burn 2695 calories a day (as calculated from the ""Calculate total calories burned per day"" step) and decided on a 15% deficit for a caloric goal of 2291 (from step ""Calculate your calorie goal"") then you would have a deficit of 2695 - 2291 = 404 calories per day.

, There are approximately 3,500 calories per pound of fat . Therefore there are 70,000 calories per 20 pounds of fat. That means in order to lose 20 pounds you will need to burn 70,000 calories more than you consume. To calculate your timeline, divide 70,000 calories by your daily calorie deficit (from the ""Calculate your daily caloric deficit"" step) to determine how many days your diet will take.


Example #1: If you have a daily caloric deficit of 806 calories you would need to divide 70,000 by 806 to get ~87 days. In other words, it will take you about 87 days (or 12.5 weeks) to lose 20 pounds if you are a a 6', 180 pound, 30-year-old, active man at a 30% deficit.
Example #2: If you have a daily caloric deficit of 404 calories you would need to divide 70,000 by 404 to get 173 days. In other words, it will take you about 173 days (or almost 25 weeks or about 6 months) to lose 20 pounds if you are a a 6', 180 pound, 30-year-old, active man at a 15% deficit.

From these above examples you can see that a larger deficit results in faster weight loss.


Your actual timeline will vary, depending on your own factors, height, age, weight, current exercise patterns. However, in general the more overweight you are the faster you will lose weight, but as you approach your ideal weight, fat loss usually slows.

Calculate how much protein you need in a day.,
Calculate how much fat you need in a day.,
Calculate how many carbohydrates you need in a day.",How to Lose 20 Pounds4," In general you want to consume between 0.5–0.77 grams (0.02–0.03 oz) of protein per pound of body weight . The more active you are, especially if you do strenuous exercise, the more protein you should eat. Protein is needed to repair your muscles as you age and after workouts.


To calculate how many grams of protein you need a day, multiply your weight by 0.5-0.77.

Example: If you weigh 180 pounds, you would need to multiply your weight by 0.5 to calculate your lowest protein need as 90 grams of protein/day. To calculate your highest protein need, multiple 180 pounds by 0.77 to find you need up to 138.6 grams of protein per day.


To convert protein grams to protein calories, know that there are 4 calories per gram of protein. Therefore to convert grams to calories, simply multiply by 4.

Example: If you are 180 pounds you should eat between 90 x 4 = 360 calories and 138.6 x 4 = 554 calories of protein per day.



, When dieting it is often tempting to cut all, or nearly all, fat from your diet. But fat is necessary for your long term health. Fat is a necessary building block of healthy tissues and needed for proper hormone production. Not eating enough fat can actually hamper weight loss, not to mention make you really hungry. So plan on 20-35% of your calorie intake being from fat .


To calculate how many calories of fat you should eat in a day, multiple 0.20 and 0.35 by your calories goal.

Example: If you are planning a 1886 calorie diet multiply 1886 x 0.20 to get 377 calories, and 1886 x 0.35 to get 660 calories. From this you now know that if you are planning a 1886 calories per day diet, you should get between 377-660 of these calories from fat.


To calculate how many grams of fat you should consume, know that there are 9 calories in a gram of fat. Therefore to convert calories to grams, simply divide by 9.

Example: From the example above, you now know that if you are planning a 1886 calorie per day diet, you should get between 339-593 of these calories from fat. 377 calories ÷ 9 = 42 grams, 660 calories ÷ 9 = 73 grams. So if you are planning a 1886 calories per day diet you should eat between 42-73 grams of fat per day.



, Unlike protein and fat, which are both needed to build structures in your body, carbohydrates are not needed for structural components. Carbohydrates are just used for energy. Therefore your body does not have strict carbohydrate needs. Instead the amount of carbohydrates your body will need is calculated from the calories left over in your diet after you meet your daily fat and protein needs.


Example: If you are a 180 pound, 30-year-old active man who is planning 1886 calories per day. From the ""Calculate how much protein you need in a day"" step you know that you need 360-554 of your calories from protein in a day. From the ""Calculate how much fat you need in a day"" step you know you need 377-660 calories from fat in a day. Therefore the remaining calories up to 1886 will be from carbohydrates.

To calculate the minimum number of carbohydrate calories you are allowed, subtract your highest protein and fat needs, 554.4 calories from protein and 660 calories from fat, from your daily calorie allotment of 1886 calorie per day (1886 - 554 - 660) to get 672 carbohydrate calories per day.
To calculate the maximum number of carbohydrate calories you are allowed, subtract your lowest protein and fat needs, 360 calories from protein and 377 calories from fat, from your daily calorie allotment of 1886 calorie per day (1886 - 360 - 377) to get 1149 carbohydrate calories per day.


To change carbohydrate calories to grams, know that there are 4 calories per carbohydrate gram. Therefore to convert calories to grams, simply divide by 4.

Example: If you are allowed 1149 calories of carbohydrates per day, you would be allowed 1149 ÷ 4 = 287 grams of carbohydrates in a day.

Make it a lifestyle.",How to Lose 20 Pounds5," Now that you have your target calorie and macro ranges, it is time to re-analyze your old eating habits. Look at your previous diet, as recorded in section ""Understand Your Current Lifestyle"", and figure out what you need to cut or change in order to meet your new goals.


This takes some time, play around with menu ideas and calculate the calorie and macronutrient content. Find a diet that fits your taste and lifestyle but is within the nutrition guidelines.
Good foods you may want to consider adding or substituting into your diet are as follow:

Good protein sources include skinless chicken breast, ground turkey, bison, egg whites, Greek yogurt, and tofu.
Good fat sources include almonds, peanuts, flax seeds, chia seeds, fish, egg yolks, and olive oil.
Good carbohydrate sources include unprocessed carbohydrates such as sweet potatoes, brown rice, fruit, oatmeal, bran, wheat germ, Bulgarian wheat, beans, and vegetables.


Try to minimize highly processed foods, such as bread, pastries, pasta, fast food, and frozen prepared meals.

, It helps to diet with the people you live with. It is easier to eat clean if you are not surrounded by temptation and bad influences. Try to enlist family and roommates to join your diet.

, Do yourself a favor and throw out any junk food in your house. It is easier to stay on your diet if tempting junk food is not in easy reach.

, Go to the store and stock up on the food you need for your diet, lean proteins, vegetables and complex carbohydrates.

, Spread your calories out throughout the day. Consider eating 5-6 small meals a day instead of just three. Also make sure to eat breakfast when you first wake up.

, Drink water with and between meals. This will help you feel fuller while dieting.

, With a long term diet, like 20 pounds, the hardest part is being consistent. Few people have the willpower to be perfect for the 3-6 months it takes to lose 20 pounds. Therefore it is advisable that you build into your diet a ""cheat meal"" once a week.


A cheat meal does not mean that you get to eat an entire pizza and a carton of ice cream in one sitting. But it is an opportunity to eat something that is not on your diet. So have two slices of pizza and a reasonable bowl of ice cream.
Have your cheat meal guilt free, after all it is a planned part of your diet, then immediately get back on your diet for the next meal. A regular and reasonable cheat meal may even help boost your metabolism .

, Not enough sleep can hamper your weight loss efforts. Try to get 8 hours of sleep per night.

, Log your food intake throughout your diet. If you eat as prescribed and maintain your current activity level or more, you should be able to successfully lose 20 pounds.


Keep in mind that as you lose weight you may want to recalculate your macronutrient and caloric needs.

You will probably feel low on energy when eating this little, so try to plan your life accordingly and avoid vigorous physical activity.;
, With such a strict calorie restriction, it's important that you write down what you eat and plan out your day accordingly so that you don't ""use up"" all of your calories at once.


Get in the habit of reading all food labels, measuring out your portions, and keeping track of the calories in salad dressings, cooking sauces, oil, and beverages.

, Foods like bread, rice, pasta, cookies, and ice cream are packed with calories, don't fill you up, and provide little in the way of nutrition. Your diet should consist primarily of vegetables, lean protein, and fiber-rich fruits like apples.

, Intense aerobic exercise can help you lose weight more quickly in the long run, but in the span of two weeks, exercise will have little impact on how quickly you lose weight. Your best bet is to conserve your energy and stick with walking, biking, swimming, and light jogging to help burn extra calories without wearing you out.


A one hour walk burns between 200 and 300 calories.The calories you burn with exercise will depend on your current weight.
It's always good to exercise, but you should focus most of your efforts on eating right as that will play the biggest role in your weight loss.

, If your goal is to eat around 1,000 calories a day, then virtually anything you order at a restaurant will come close to reaching, or potentially exceeding, that calorie limitation. Your best bet is to prepare your meals at home so that you can control the ingredients as well as the portion sizes of your meals.


Switch to cooking spray rather than olive oil, vegetable oil, or butter. While olive oil is a healthy fat, it contains about 120 calories per tablespoon, which you really can't afford on a 1,000 calorie per day diet.
Pack your lunch in the morning before work or school. Be sure to include healthy snacks to munch on when you get hungry, like celery and carrots.

, Water helps fill you up in between meals, and is a good way to keep your mood and energy levels up when dieting. Carry a water bottle around with you at all times, and sip on it throughout the day.


Don't waste what little calories you have on soda, fruit juice, and alcohol. Eliminate these unhealthy drinks from your diet, at least for the next two weeks.
If you are used to drinking soda, switch to diet soda or sparkling water, both of which have zero calories.

, These drinks have zero calories and the caffeine they contain will help curb your appetite.


If you have issues with nighttime snacking, make yourself a cup of decaffeinated coffee or tea to help curb your cravings.

, The act of chewing gum will trick your body into thinking that it is eating something, and you will be less likely to snack if you already have something in your mouth.

, Not only will this improve your tooth and gum health, you will feel less inclined to snack out of boredom when your mouth feels clean and fresh.

, The most effective way to diet is to keep yourself distracted and busy so that you aren't constantly thinking about food (or the lack thereof). Make plans with friends, focus on your hobbies, take a hot bath, watch your favorite movie or television show, read a book, go swimming, etc.

One pound is equivalent to 3,500 calories, and to lose 10 pounds in seven days you'll need to lose about 1.4 pounds, or burn about 5,000 calories each day.Know that you will need to exercise a lot in order to burn 10 pounds in one week. Starving yourself is not an option. In fact, starving yourself makes weight loss harder, especially after you're done with your diet.Remember that you'll be burning calories while doing daily activities such as walking around, walking up stairs, and even breathing. It won't be many calories, but you don't have to expect to burn all your calories doing hard exercise.;
, If you want to lose 10 pounds in a week, you'll need to burn 5,000 calories more than you take in per day. That's a lot. That's not meant to discourage you; it's only as a reminder of how hard losing 10 pounds in a week actually is. Prepare yourself for a tough, tough journey!


Just to give you bit of an idea about how much that is, consider this: a 160 pound person burns about 1,000 calories playing competitive soccer for 90 minutes.That means you'd need to play competitive soccer for 7.5 hours during the day to burn 5,000 calories.

,


If you're trying to lose weight, as you probably do, a healthy person should consume at least 1,200 calories per day, regardless of what their diet is. If you eat 1,200 calories, you'll have about 4,000 calories to burn a day to meet your goal.

, Water is the dieter's best friend. Sweet, sugary, or caffeinated drinks are the enemy of the dieter. A simple sweet ""energy"" or ""sports"" drink can be as much as 400 calories. That's a third of your total calories for the entire day. Stay away from any drink but water, with one exception.


Unsweetened green tea is acceptable to drink, on occasion. If you're sick and tired of drinking just water day in and day out, the occasional green tea is fine. Green tea has lots of antioxidants and 0 calories, which makes it fine to drink.
If you're really hungry during meals, down a nice big cup of water right before you eat. This will help trick your stomach into thinking that you're more full than you actually are, making you less hungry.

, Simple carbs, also called refined carbohydrates, are usually not very nutritious for our bodies and get absorbed by the body very quickly.Stay away from simple, refined carbohydrates such as these while on your diet:


Cookies, candies, cakes, and other baked sweets
Honey, molasses, and syrup
White bread, white rice, and normal pasta
Many packaged cereals

, Complex carbohydrates, unlike simple carbohydrates, are full of fiber as well as other nutrients, and get digested by the body and released into the blood stream far slower.Examples of complex carbs include:


Whole grain bread, whole grain pasta, brown rice
Beans and legumes, such as lentils, carrots, and sweet potatoes
Veggies and fruits like asparagus and apricots

, Go for beef that is 98% lean and only 2% fat. Go for chicken breast without the skin attached. Soy products like edamame or tofu are also high in protein, as are many types of fish, including salmon.

, In addition to cooking everything in trans fat, fast food burgers, fries, and shakes (or burritos, mac 'n' cheese, or sandwiches) are whoppers when it comes to salt and sugar. They are essentially empty carbs, with no real nutrients to them. If you're serious about shedding those pounds and getting your weight back on the right path, you'll stay away from fast food.

, Ever hear the phrase? It has some truth behind it. Eat early on to jump-start your metabolism and give you enough energy to last comfortably until lunch, and then for dinner begin to wind down and eat the smallest meal of the day. Here are some examples of meals you could cook for yourself during the day, with one snack in between:


Breakfast: egg-white omelet with spinach and chicken breast, along with a banana and some fresh blueberries.
Lunch: leftover salmon steak over quinoa, with a small salad
Snack: handful of pistachios
Dinner: bok choy, carrot, mushroom, and pepper stir-fry
Some foods that help you lose weight or have fewer calories are:

peanut butter
rice cakes
berries
green vegetables
green tea
water
Greek yogurt
unsalted nuts
almond milk



, Creating a calorie journal and writing in it consistently will help you know when you've gone over your limit. It will tell you what foods worked when and whether they tasted good. It will give you a record of your struggles, which are always fun to look back on after the pain has passed!


Get very good at calorie counting and serving sizes. It'll be tough to calculate everything in the beginning, but after a while it'll seem like second-nature. Be religious about estimating how many calories are in a certain food or meal. Be accurate! Lying to yourself isn't worth it if the only one you're hurting is you.

, It's okay to slip up every once in a while and eat something you know you're not supposed to. Everyone does that. But when you slip, don't fall down. Don't justify splurging and going way overboard, ever. It'll just make your goal even tougher and discourage you even more.

, Need to go the grocery store? Walk there. Need to get up to the fifteenth floor of a building? Walk there, don't take the elevator. Need to get to soccer practice? Walk there. Look at each walking opportunity as an opportunity to burn more calories and to get fitter.


Get a pedometer. A pedometer will keep track of the number of steps you take during the day, and you can hide it on your hip so that no one can see it. A good pedometer will convert the number of steps taken into calories burned. They're worth it!

, Put on some of the best, most motivating 80s dance music, and get ready to get ready. Warming up and stretching will help you get the most out of your exercise. Plus, who can exercise when they're injured? Examples of warm up exercises include:


20 push-ups, 20 sit-ups, and 20 burpees. (Burpees are when you jump in the air then drop down do a push-up and repeat.)
Running in place intensely for 1 minute, and then switching to 1 minute of light jogging in place.
Touch your toes, stretch your arms in tandem, get those quads and hamstrings loosened, and don't forget your torso and neck.

, Interval training is where you do really intense activity for only a short period of time, and then moderate or light intensity work for the majority of the time. Scientists have found, in several studies, that people who do interval training actually end up exercising for shorter periods of time and burning more calories than people who go at medium intensity for their whole workout.An example of interval training would be this: while running around the track, go as hard/fast as you can for one whole lap, then jog at light speed for the remaining three laps. Every four laps is a mile. Feel — and love — the burn.

, The great part about sports is that they're competitive. Competition makes us push ourselves harder than we would have by ourselves, for the most part. You may be thinking: I'm not good at any sports, or I'm not comfortable doing any sports. Just remember that people respect other who try hard and who respect themselves. If you think doing soccer, basketball, or swimming would be fun and keep you engaged, then go for it. Let your competitive streak burn the calories for you.

, If you don't have some cardio machines with you at home, consider joining a gym so that you can use some. Try out the following cardio machines and see which ones work best for you:


Treadmill. The treadmill might actually feel worse than free running, but it's definitely better than nothing. Try to find a nice, fast pace that keeps you sweating.
Elliptical. You can set a different resistance strength for most ellipticals, making this a good strength training/cardio dual workout.
Stationary bike. If you take a spinning class, get ready to have your butt kicked. Spinning class on the stationary bike is a great way to lose weight.

, Cross-training involves a range of different strength, endurance, and aerobic exercises that will work out many different parts of your body while generally keeping you from getting bored (which is a huge reason why people stop exercising). Cross-training regimes like Crossfit may not be the best at burning a lot of calories very quickly (they're better at replacing fat with lean muscle), but it's worth trying out. Who knows, you could find a new inspiration!

, To really get tap your aerobic ability, try dancing. No, not necessarily in your room, although that's always encouraged. What about a dance class at your local Y?


You could try something like basic jazz or pop or hip-hop classes if you're familiar already and you find the dance moves or music comforting.
You could also try something like zumba, which combines Latin and international music into one fantastic workout. Zumba, like regular dancing classes, is taught by a dance instructor.

, You'll probably need to exercise twice as much to meet your goals. Better pick a couple exercises that you really like, because chances are you'll be doing a lot of them in order to burn 10 pounds in a week.


You might want to set aside 4 hours a day in order to exercise: 2 2-hour sessions, broken up in the middle with a break. If you need any motivation, just thinking of all the weight you're saying goodbye to and the fabulous body that you'll be welcoming in no time flat. Good luck!

In order to lose 2 pounds every week, you will need to cut your intake by about 1,000 calories.Do this by eating fewer calories and by burning more calories through exercise.


If you eat between 1,000 and 1,200 calories a day and do one hour of aerobic activity, you could lose 3-5 pounds in just one week!Regardless of your weight, don't attempt to eat under 1,200 calories a day for more than one week.
Start reading food labels and using online calorie calculators to determine the calorie content of everything you eat. This includes the calories in salad dressings, cooking sauces, beverages, and olive oil.;
, Losing weight is not only about eating less, but about eating right. Nutrient-rich foods will help you lose weight and keep you feeling full for longer. Your diet should consist primarily of green vegetables, lean proteins, and some fruit.


Make salads or stir-fry with broccoli, lettuce, green beans, asparagus, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, celery, kale, and/or carrots.
Eat lean proteins like chicken, fish, tofu, turkey, eggs, and tempeh. Try to eat protein at every meal.
Eliminate sugars, salty foods, and most carbohydrates from your diet. While these foods should normally be enjoyed in moderation, you should cut them out if you are trying to lose weight quickly.

, People who calculate what they eat tend to lose more weight (and keep it off) than those who don't.You should also write down every exercise you do and calculate the amount of calories burned. Keep track of your intake throughout the day, and add/subtract calories as you go.


Try using an online calorie calculator/food diary like My Fitness Pal or Calorie King.

, Eating healthy is a lot easier when you are in control of the portion sizes and ingredients that go into your meals. Bring a bagged lunch to work or school, and bring snacks with you to hold you over until you get home. Not only will this save your waistline, it will save you some green too!


If you do eat out, your best bet is to order a green salad with protein (chicken or fish) and ask for the dressing on the side.
Skip out on pizza, pasta, and fried foods, and opt for grilled or steamed options when possible.
Some chain restaurants have the calorie content of each dish printed out on the menu, making it easier to make smart choices.

, Did you know that some Starbucks ""coffee"" beverages contain a whopping 700 calories? Many people underestimate the amount of calories contained in the beverages they drink. During this month, you should only drink water, unsweetened tea, black coffee, and sparkling water.


Add non-fat milk, soy milk, almond milk, or honey to your beverages if needed.
Skip out on alcohol. If you do decide to drink, stick to one glass of red or white wine.

, Dieting doesn't mean eating flavorless food all the time, but you will need to make some substitutions to cut down on unnecessary calories. Consider the following ideas:


Substitute Greek yogurt for sour cream and mayonnaise.
Eat shirataki noodles rather than regular pasta/spaghetti.
Switch to whole grain bread, pasta, and rice.
Substitute dark chocolate for cookies, cakes, and other treats.
Substitute one piece of fruit like an apple or banana over your regular mid-afternoon snack.
Switch to cooking spray over olive oil, vegetable oil, or butter.

, To lose weight rapidly, you should get between 1-2 hours of moderate to intense aerobic activity every single day. The following are examples of exercises that burn the most calories:


Running. Calories burned per hour: 861-1,286 for an 8 minute mile.Swimming. Calories burned per hour: 423-632.Jumping rope. Calories burned per hour: 861-1,286.Stair treadmill. Calories burned per hour: 657-981., It's important to weigh yourself at the same time of day, as everybody's weight fluctuates throughout the day. Always weigh yourself in the morning before you have eaten anything, and be sure to remove your shoes.


Don't weigh yourself every day; it will drive you crazy and cause more harm than good.

, Having somebody to diet and exercise with can help you stay motivated and make the weight-loss process more fun. The two of you can exercise together, share tips, and even place bets on who can lose the weight fastest.

, Whether it is a pair of jeans that are too snug or a bikini that you plan on wearing next summer, hang that garment up in your home in a place where you will see it every day. This will help keep you motivated and remind you why you started in the first place!


You can also use these clothes to help track your progress. Try them on every week or two and see how they fit. Scales can be deceiving, but clothing never lie!

, If you have just lost 10 pounds in one month, then it's likely that some of the weight you lost was just water weight. Continue to maintain the weight you have lost for at least two weeks before attempting to shed any more pounds.


Maintain the weight by eating around 1,200-1,400 calories a day and continuing to exercise regularly.
During this time, you'll find that your body will continue to change even though the numbers on the scale stay the same. That's because your body is adjusting for the fluid loss and gaining some muscle from exercise.

, Losing weight can oftentimes trigger overeating. The best way to prevent binges is to enjoy the foods you love in moderation, and to never starve yourself. Remember that no food is off limits, as long as you don't overdo it.


Many people binge at night if they have been hungry all day. Combat this by eating either a large breakfast or a large lunch that will hold you over until nighttime. Then eat a light dinner.

, The only way to overcome a weight-loss plateau is to surprise your body by switching up your routine.


Do resistance training. Many dieters focus all of their attention on calorie-busting aerobic workouts, forgetting that building muscle helps the body burn fat. Plus, losing weight means losing some muscle, which can slow down the metabolism.If you find yourself at a weight-loss plateau, it's time to get lifting!
If you have been doing nothing but running, then switch to swimming or cycling. If you have been eating six small meals a day, then switch to three medium-sized meals, and so on.

A combination of cardio and resistance training (weightlifting) leads to higher weight loss than either activity alone. But if you must choose one, those doing only cardio lose more than those doing only resistance training.Consider High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). That's when you alternate between going all out and taking it easy. For example, you'd run in a dead sprint for 30 seconds followed by 60 seconds of jogging. This shortens your routine and burns more fat, believe it or not. In addition, when you're chilling on the couch, your metabolism stays high and you'll be burning more calories up to 24 hours later.HIIT is great for those with hectic lives — it only takes about 15 minutes. Just remember you still need to warm up and cool down.

;
, Stress is a huge cause of overeating. 60 minutes of yoga (done in the comfort of your living room during your favorite show) burns 180 – 360 calories — but that's not all. Studies have shown that practicing yoga leads to a number of benefits:Reduced stress
Increased body awareness (specifically hunger and satiety)
Mindful eating

, Switching up your routine will keep you from plateauing and keep your body from getting used to your workout.


Varying your routine will help you stay motivated, a huge factor in success.
Turn social events into opportunities for calorie burning. Skip the movies and go for frisbee golf, tennis, or swimming.

, Any activity can turn into exercise with the right mindset.


Opt for the stairs instead of the elevator.
Use this as a reason to do chores. Do the gardening, wash your car — stay active!

, You may not see results immediately. Be patient.


As your body gets accustomed to the work out, kick it up a notch. Challenge yourself.
Only do as much as you can handle. If you feel dizzy or faint, stop.

, Each person requires a different amount of calories each day. Depending on your activity level, pick a daily allotment and stick with it.


To lose 5 pounds a week, you must burn 2,500 calories a day, which is very difficult. Calculate how many calories you need to eat and how much you'll need to exercise to meet your goal.

, This keeps you accountable, because you must record every nibble (even just a bite of a chocolate bar!). It also allows you to see any patterns or places where you can make changes if you aren't losing weight.


Don't miss a meal! Staying conscious of your eating habits is the first step to changing them.
Work with a friend. Having someone else look over your food journal (and looking over theirs) will help motivate you to stay on track.
Consider using an app on your smartphone, like MyFitnessPal, which makes it easy to track your calories throughout the day, as well as exercise and hydration.

, Healthier foods fill our stomachs up faster. If you feel full and content, you'll be less tempted to graze in front of the fridge.


Stock up on fruits and veggies. Let's say you eat 400 calories-worth of junk food. You're probably going to be going back to the fridge in minutes. That's because the oils in junk foods aren't filling. They literally take up less volume in your stomach than fruits and veggies do. To eat 400 calories-worth of lettuce, you'd have to eat about 65 pounds of it.Avoid processed goods. They've lost 90% of their nutrients already. These foods leave you craving more because they don't satisfy any of your nutritional needs.
Consume the rainbow. Americans tend to eat a very ""white"" diet. Eat foods of every color to ensure you're getting the proper amount of vitamins and minerals.
In addition to fruits and vegetables, egg whites, soy products, skinless poultry breasts, fish, shellfish, nonfat dairy foods, and 95% lean meat are all recommended for rapid weight loss. , And then drink some more. A glass of ice cold water will boost your metabolism (your body works to warm it) within 10 minutes.


Drink a glass of water before every meal. This will start up your body's CCK, the hormone that signals to your brain that you are full. You'll eat less because your body will tell you to!

, Skipping breakfast actually contributes to gaining weight because you are likely to eat more in the middle of the day. In addition, having breakfast will kickstart your metabolism for the day and get you burning calories.


Stick to a 300-calorie breakfast. This is enough to give you that kickstart and but no so many calories that you'll have to make sacrifices at lunch and dinner.
Stay away from morning carbohydrates like bagels and pancakes. Your body is more likely to turn them to fat. Instead, try a chia seed breakfast bowl, oatmeal with fruit, a breakfast burrito with scrambled eggs and veggies, or a smoothie.

, If there's something taunting you in your kitchen, throw it out.


Remove highly processed foods from your house — chips, cookies, candy, pastries, white breads, and so on.
Dispose of sodas and juice
Throw away all ""white"" carbs and high-fat dairy products

, This is one of the most common causes of weight gain.


When you're bored and would like to eat something, drink water (and go exercise a bit more).

, ""Juicing"" has become a trendy diet where your body is flushed of all toxins by only consuming fruit and vegetable juices. Specially-made juices are available in select grocery stores just for this dieting tactic.


Unless your doctor approves in advance, do not juice for longer than a few days.

, Water retention in the body will be eliminated, resulting in a slimmer waistline.


Salt-free means zero salt. There is no eating out at restaurants; in fact, there's no eating of processed foods at all.
Consuming a large amount of water is necessary on this diet. Some green tea is allowed.
As sodium is part of a natural diet, this diet is not recommended over a great length of time.

, Similar to juicing, this is a liquid diet. The drink is a mixture of the following:


2 tablespoons fresh-squeezed lemon juice
2 tablespoons grade-B organic maple syrup
1/10 teaspoon cayenne pepper
10 ounces filtered water

And herbal, laxative tea is allowed at night.


This diet should only be used for 4-14 days. Ease back into eating solid foods slowly. It mainly results in loss of muscle and water retention, not fat.



, In just a quarter of an hour, your body will already be losing water weight.


Stay hydrated. Limit yourself to one 15-20 minute session per day. Drink a glass of water afterward.
If you have health concerns, do not use saunas.

, The process claims to detoxify your body, reduce cellulite, and tone your skin.


There are many different varieties. Go to your local spa for details.
These only involve temporary weight loss and are not long-term alternatives to diet and exercise.

Strength train.,
Do a little cardiovascular exercise.",How to Lose 20 Pounds6," When in a caloric deficit, your body will burn its reserves for energy, fat as well as muscle. You want to burn fat, but you do not want to burn muscle. To help maintain your muscle mass while in a caloric deficit, consider taking up weight training.


To maximize your weight training focus on compound movements, deadlifts, squats, bench press, military press and pull ups. As you get more advanced start incorporating isolation exercises like bicep curls, tricep extensions, glut bridges, etc.
If you have not weight trained before, be prepared to be very sore the first week. Like all new exercise, introduce it slowly to let your body adapt and avoid injury.

, Cardiovascular exercise is good for overall health. Therefore if you don't do any, consider incorporating a half-hour of cardiovascular exercise into your routine a few days a week.


Do not get caught in the vicious cardio/diet cycle. The cardio/diet cycle is when you exercise to burn off calories, but this makes you hungrier, which makes you eat more, forcing you to exercise more, making you even hungrier, etc. Keep cardiovascular exercise to under 2-3 hours a week unless actively training for a fitness goal. Doing more cardiovascular exercise than this can actually inhibit fat loss by raising cortisol levels . To avoid this problem, control your calorie deficit in the kitchen, not on the treadmill.
Some cardiovascular exercise you might consider including are:

A light 2 mile (3.2 km) job before breakfast a few days a week.
20 minutes on the stairmill after weightlifting.
High intensity interval training a few days a week.

, As many people have said, it's unbelievably good for you. According to most doctors and nutritionists, you should drink at least 64 ounces (8 heaping cups) of water each day. But remember, you also consume water in your food, so don't go overboard and drink 8 cups of water PLUS all the water in the food. The most accurate calculation however, is to take your weight and divide it by 2, which will equal the number of ounces in water you should drink a day. You may want to divide that result by eight (eight fluid ounces in a cup) to tell you how many cups of water to drink daily. If you feel you are not drinking enough water, you should try to look at you urine when you use the restroom. If your urine is a pale yellow, or better yet, colorless, then you are consuming a sufficient amount water each day. If it is dark yellow or brown, you either need more water, have a serious liver disease, or hepatitis. According to a website addressing such issues, ""Brown urine can an indication of a serious condition. It could be caused by liver disease, hepatitis, melanoma cancer, or copper poisoning. Other symptoms from those ailments should also be considered as indicators. But note that if you had recently eaten fava beans or taken a laxative, your urine also could turn brown."" The benefits are countless: healthy, soft skin; clearer skin, too, and it flushes out all kinds of bad stuff, and so on...

, Eat as many fruit and veggies as you like, just try to eat them on an empty stomach (aids in digestion), fat free dairy products, and try not to have more than 3 ounces of meat a day.

, It doesn't have to be boring and hard. It's as easy as taking a 10 minute walk after each meal, or riding your bike, or even playing tag. An easy way to get motivated to exercise is to sign up at your local recreational center for some sports, such as swimming, walking, or basketball. Go for strength training! If you have muscle tone, you will naturally burn fat around the clock. The important thing is to get out there, even if it's only a 25 minute walk. The more you do, the better you will feel. Remember, the exercise time must be at least 30 minutes , because that can burn the fat.

,(It's super easy!)

, Gradually add more of the food you've been eating (that's healthy) to your diet, but keep exercising. When you have reached a point where you eat a certain amount of calories and your weight hasn't fluctuated more than 3 pounds you are done.

A single pound of weight (.45 kg) has 3,500 calories in it. So in order to lose 3 lbs. (1.36 kg) a week, you'll need to reduce your calorie consumption by 10,500 calories each week, or 1,500 calories a day.;
, In order to figure out how many calories you can realistically cut from your diet, it is a good idea to calculate how many calories you currently consume.


You may think you're only eating 2,000 calories when in fact you're eating 2,200 each day. So if you want to lose weight quickly, it's important to have an accurate idea of how many calories you need to cut from your diet.
You can calculate your daily calorie intake by eating as normal, but making a note of exactly what you ate. In addition, you will need to specify exactly how much you ate. For example: half a cup of salted peanuts or 8 oz. full fat latte. Then you can use an online calorie chart to calculate your total daily calorie intake.

, Although many fitness websites will give you the option to calculate weight loss goals by signing up for their newsletter, this site will give you some solid advice about the steps you need to take, considering your weight, height and waist size.

, Scroll through the BMI and Weight tabs until you get to “Calories.” This tab will tell you how many calories you should eat per day to meet your weight loss goal in a healthy way., Depending upon your weight and height, you may want to set this restriction at 1500 until you lose some weight, so that your body doesn’t store fat instead of burning it.


This calculator is based on the premise that you should lose no more than one to two pounds per week.
Never skip breakfast. This meal restarts your metabolism. Avoiding breakfast will tell your body to store calories, rather than burn them, during the day.

, Every person is different, so it stands to reason that the same diet plan won't work for everyone. In particular, it is important to consider your starting weight/calorie intake in order to develop a realistic (and safe) weight loss plan. For example:


If you are significantly overweight and eat over 3,000 calories per day, it should be relatively easy to cut 1500 calories or more from your daily diet.
However, if you generally only eat about 2,000 calories per day, it might be difficult to cut 1500 calories from your meals without feeling tired or out of energy.
If this is the case, aim to reduce your calorie consumption to about 1,050 to 1,200 calories per day, as this is the minimum amount necessary to keep energy levels up. Then you can just lose any additional calories through exercise., As you begin your weight loss plan, it's a good idea to keep a journal in order to track the amount of food you eat each day.Make sure to list every single morsel that passes your lips - don't forget to count that sneaky square of chocolate or extra handful of nuts. When you fail to accurately track your eating habits, you are only fooling yourself.
By writing down what you eat, you are holding yourself accountable. In fact, studies have shown that people are less likely to eat something in the first place if they know they'll have to write it down afterwards.
In addition to writing down what you ate, also try to make a note of how you felt when you ate. Were you angry, upset, bored, tired? Making a note of your feelings will help you to recognize patterns in your eating behaviors, which is the first step towards changing them.

, In order to stay on track with your weight loss plan, it's important to monitor your progress. You can do this by weighing yourself weekly.


It is recommended that you avoid weighing yourself daily, as your weight can fluctuate from day to day and seeing your weight stay the same on the scales (or worse: go up) can lead you to feel disheartened and cause you to lose motivation.
Weigh yourself on the same day each week. Try to do it first thing in the morning, before breakfast. This is when your body is at its lowest weight.
It might help to have someone else as a witness. This could motivate you to work harder during the week, as you know there is another person to hold you accountable if you haven't reached your goal.

, One of the biggest mistakes many dieters make is skipping meals in order to cut calories. This is a bad idea for several reasons:


Firstly, skipping meals will leave you feeling constantly hungry and deprived, making you much more likely to binge later in the day, or just give up on your diet completely.
Secondly, skipping meals will leave you feeling tired with no energy, which is bad for your work productivity, your stress-levels and your motivation to exercise.
It's important to eat frequently throughout the day to keep your blood sugar levels even and your energy up. It's especially important to eat breakfast (the most commonly skipped meal) as it kickstarts your metabolism and sets you up for the day.
To stick within your 1,200 calorie limit, eat three 400-calorie meals every day. In terms of quantity, you should have a large breakfast, a medium-size lunch and a small dinner - this simple change alone can help you to lose weight.

, As much as possible you should try to stick to lean proteins (chicken, turkey, fish, lean red meat) and greens (broccoli, spinach, kale, asparagus and lettuce) when attempting to lose weight.


Avoid simple carbohydrates (which are found in items like bread, pasta and white rice) as these tend to trigger your appetite, causing you to eat more.
According to weight loss experts, if you stick to eating green vegetables and lean protein at most meals, you can lose up to three pounds a week., Skip sugary drinks, such as juice or soda, and drink plain water instead if you want to lose weight quickly. You may not realize it, but you may be consuming up to 250 extra calories in sugary drinks daily.


If plain water bores you, try seltzer or unsweetened ice tea. Herbal teas are the best option if you feel like sipping a hot drink, but black tea and coffee are also acceptable. Avoid lattes, cappuccinos and blended coffee drinks, as these also contain a ton of calories.
You should also cut back on the amount of alcohol you consume - a single 6 oz. glass of red wine contains 150 calories. Plus, drinking impairs your judgement, making you more likely to binge on that bag of potato chips you've been avoiding all week., You don't need to starve in order to lose weight, you just need to make better choices.


Trade a regular potato for a sweet potato, which has more fiber and vitamins. Eat chicken or fish instead of fatty red meat. Eat lentils or quinoa instead of rice and pasta.
Instead of a cookie or slice of cake for dessert, have a handful of berries or a sliced apple. Fruit contains natural sugars, which will satisfy your sweet tooth without piling on the calories.

, There are several weight loss tricks that can come in handy when you're trying to cut back on food:


Drink a glass of water before every meal. Sometimes when you think you're hungry, you're actually just thirsty instead. Drinking a full glass of water before every meal will make you less hungry and also help to keep you hydrated!
Eat your meals from a smaller plate. Though it would look full of food the plate will actually have considerably less on it than if you were using a large dinner plate.
Put everything you eat on a plate or a bowl. When you eat chips or other snacks right out of the package, it's easy to overeat, as you have no way of tracking how much you've consumed.
Don't eat after 6pm. Eating a late dinner or snacking before bed is a major culprit behind weight gain, as your metabolism tends to slow down later in the day. Eating an early dinner, then not eating after 6pm (or at least four hours before bed) can help you to achieve your weight-loss goal.

, Although changing your diet is the most important aspect of losing weight, exercise also plays a significant role.


As you are attempting to lose quite a lot of weight in a limited amount of time, you will not be able to reduce your total calorie intake through diet alone (without starving yourself). You will need to use exercise to make up the rest.
The actual number of extra calories you'll need to burn each day to for weight loss depends on how many calories you cut from your diet. If you went down to 1,200 from 2,200 calories, you'll have to burn an extra 500 calories.
The number of calories you burn from exercise depends on your weight and metabolism. On average, a person can burn 731 calories an hour running a 10-minute mile.

, Cardio is the best type of exercise for fat loss, as it burns the most calories and helps to get your heart rate up.To lose 12 pounds in a month, you'll need to be doing 30 minutes to an hour of moderate to intense cardio exercise a day.
What counts as ""moderate to intense"" will vary depending on your current fitness level, but a good rule of thumb is that you should break into a sweat within the first few minutes of exercising and keep sweating for the duration of your workout.
Some good cardio activities include walking/jogging/running (depending on your fitness), swimming, rowing and cycling.
However, an hour-long dance class or an afternoon playing ultimate Frisbee will also provide a good cardio workout and can be a lot more fun!

, Interval training is an exercise technique which involves alternating between periods of high-intensity and moderate activity. This allows you to work out harder and burn more calories than you normally would.For example, alternating between a minute of running at your maximum pace, then doing two minutes of a slower jog is much more effective for burning calories than running at a steady pace for the duration of your workout.
You can use interval training in almost any kind of cardio exercise. To read more about interval training, take a look at this article.

, Strength or weight training is not as effective at burning calories as aerobic exercise, but it is still hugely beneficial.



Strength training helps you to build muscle and raise your metabolism. This allows you to burn more calories naturally, even at rest. Strength training also helps you to tone up and trim down, making you look slimmer, even if your weight remains the same.
Strength training exercises like squats, lunges and deadlifts are great total body exercise for both men and women. If you're not familiar with these exercises, it's a good idea to book a session with a personal trainer who can show you how to perform the safely and effectively.
Try to include two to three strength training sessions into your weekly workouts. It will give you a break from cardio, while still helping you to lose weight.

, The later you leave your exercise, the less you'll feel like doing it. It may sound like a great idea to hit the gym straight after work, but in reality you'll feel tired and hungry and going to the gym will be the last thing you feel like doing.


If possible, hit the gym in the morning when you feel fresh and motivated. You'll get your workout over and done with early, and have the benefit of the post-exercise feel-good endorphins buoying you up throughout the day.
If you're not a morning person, try doing your workout at lunchtime instead. It will help you to clear your head after a busy morning and leave you feeling re-energized when you go back to work.

, In addition to your workouts, try to come up with some small adjustments to your everyday routine that will increase your overall activity levels. Some examples include:


Walk up the stairs instead of using the elevator. Park farther away from a store's entrance so you have to walk that extra distance. Cycle to work instead of taking the car.
Even these small adjustments can significantly increase the amount of calories you burn per week, as long as you do them consistently.

Whatever it is, get it ready for when you are starting your weight loss program., One pound is equal to 3,500 calories, so to lose 1–2 pounds a week, you need to eat 500–1000 calories less per day. Knowing where you are at the beginning is essential to plotting your diet plan. You can keep a journal, do it on the website referenced below, or use one of the many apps available., If you eat out a lot, think about how you can cook at home to have more control of your diet. Look through cookbooks and online to find new recipes that sound appealing. A big part of starting a weight loss program is changing your way of eating, and new foods and dishes will be part of that. Cooking the same things you always make and just eating less can be more difficult than preparing something new with fewer calories in the same size portion., If you are exercising little, you have a lot of options to explore as you plan your weight loss. If you are already exercising, think about how you might want to add to the activities you already do. You might want to start a new exercise class to inspire you to exercise more., Try not to start at a time that you know will be stressful, like the holidays or when starting a new job. Starting it when you know you will be going on vacation in the next two months is also not advisable — you need to get into a routine at home to help you succeed in your weight loss goals.

, Some people find that being part of a group of people doing the same things with the same issues you have makes it a lot easier. Research has shown that when you do a weight loss program with a friend or as part of a group, you tend to lose more and keep it off more easily. Keep in mind, however, that not all weight loss groups are the same — some are using it as a way to sell weight-loss products, while others are non-profit. Investigate the group thoroughly before you sign up., Make a list of questions to take with you about your proposed weight loss program. Don’t be afraid to ask for suggestions about eating and exercise. If you are thinking about joining a formal weight loss program, talk to your doctor about it. She might know something you don’t and can caution you against it if it wouldn’t be a good fit., Know that there will be times you just can’t cook that healthy meal or do that long exercise period. That’s normal. Your goals should be things that are more than you usually do, but not so different that you can’t keep them up. For example, if you aren’t used to running, don’t set yourself up for failure by choosing a daily half-hour run as your exercise. Start with walking fast and then see if you want to increase your workout by running."

It's not advisable to cut out more than 750 calories daily or eat fewer than 1200 calories daily. It's too difficult to consume enough essential nutrients with a diet that is overly restricted.Restricting calories any more will not speed up weight loss. Remember that weight loss needs to happen gradually and healthfully.
You can find a relatively accurate calorie counter online which can guide you on how many calories you currently consume and how many you can cut from your diet.;
, Making your plate half protein and half fruits and vegetables is a good plan for quick weight loss. These foods are low in calories and high in essential nutrients. In addition, they will keep you feeling satisfied longer compared to carbohydrate based foods.Make sure to include a source of lean protein at each meal. One serving of lean protein is about 3–4 ounces or about the size of a check book.
Lean protein options include: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, pork, seafood, tofu and legumes.
Also include either a fruit or vegetable at each meal. Aim for 1–2 servings of fruit daily (1/2 cup or 1 small fruit)and 3–5 servings of vegetables daily (1 cup or 2 cups leafy greens).Sample meals include: baked salmon and broccoli, grilled chicken salad, shrimp and vegetable stir fry, and vegetable and cheese omelet.

, Foods that are rich in carbohydrates, especially when whole grain, are a part of a healthy diet. However, limiting these foods has been shown to help support quicker weight loss.While carbohydrates can be included when there is more time allotted for weight loss, it is essential to cut carbohydrates when trying to lose weight fast.
Whole grains are grains that are minimally processed and contain all the nutrient-dense parts of the grain (the germ, bran, and endosperm). These types of grains are typically higher in fiber and other essential nutrients.If you choose have grains, try to choose 100% whole grains like: quinoa, oats, 100% whole wheat pasta or brown rice.
Refined carbohydrates are generally very processed and low in nutrients (like fiber).Limit the following types of foods: bread, rice, pasta, bagels, crackers, pretzels, chips, muffins, tortillas, or quinoa.
You can choose to cut out these foods altogether or allow 1–2 servings daily. You may notice quicker weight loss with fewer servings of these carbohydrate rich foods.
If choosing to include grains, choose 100% whole grain options when you can. Whole grains are much higher in fiber and other nutrients compared to refined grains., Protein is an essential nutrient that will help support quick weight loss and help reach your 10 pound goal in about two weeks. Depending on your calorie level, you should include 1–2 high protein snacks daily.High protein snacks that will support weight loss include: one individual greek yogurt, one hard boiled egg, 2 oz beef jerky or protein bar, or shake.
Snacks should be between 100–200 calories per snack. Higher calorie snacks may slow your weight loss., Sodas, sugary coffee drinks, fruit juices, sports drinks, and alcoholic beverages usually contain a significant amount of calories. Drinking these daily will slow or inhibit your weight loss. Replace them with sugar-free, clear beverages.


Aim for 64 oz or about 2 L of clear, sugar-free beverages daily. This will help keep you hydrated throughout the day.Beverages to sip all day long include: water, sugar-free flavored water, and decaf coffee or tea.

, It's tempting to give in to trendy fad diets that promise great weight loss in very short amounts of time. However, many times these diets are unhealthy, unsafe, and not sustainable for long periods of time. In addition, you're more likely to gain your weight back.Avoid diets that ban entire groups of foods or encourage you to eat very, very small portions or a diet that is less than 1200 calories daily.Also avoid diets that promote using liquids or ""cleanses"" as these can cause adverse health effects.
Also be wary of diets that encourage the use of supplements or diet pills to help induce quick weight loss. Again, these are most likely not safe and will not cause long-term weight loss., Cardio exercises will help you burn additional calories to support quicker weight loss.More exercise may help you reach your 10 pound goal within a 2 week time period.


Vigorous intensity aerobic exercises are activities that raise your heart rate and breathing pace very high. You shouldn't be able to say more than a few words at one time. Moderate intensity cardio also increases your heart rate and breathing level, however you should be able to say short sentences with ease.Examples of vigorous exercise might include: running, spin classes, high intensity interval training, or boxing.
Examples of moderate intensity exercise might include: walking/jogging, dancing, or using the elliptical machine.
If you can, spend more time doing aerobic exercises each week. You can help speed up your weight loss with additional activity.
Try HIIT training, which consists of intervals of high and low intensity, is a great way to lose weight quickly as it is very good at promoting fat loss.
Be careful of high amounts or very high intensity workouts with a low-calorie diet. You need to eat enough to support your exercise. That's why it's important to never go below 1,200 calories daily — especially when you're working out.

, Strength training may not result in a quick 10 pound weight loss, but it may help tone your body. This may be desirable if you're trying to lose weight for a specific event like a wedding or class reunion.


Strength training for 30 minutes three times per week will speed up weight loss as it speeds up your metabolism. However, this happens over longer periods of time.Learn proper form with a physical therapist or personal trainer before you work out with weights on your own. Use a mirror as you begin to check your posture and avoid injury.
Do bodyweight exercises. Also ask a personal trainer to teach you how to do planks, side planks, mountain climbers, push ups and pull ups. Flow yoga, barre, pilates, and TRX bands are great ways to learn body weight exercises.

, It's important to allow your body to rest a few days a week. Constantly exercising without rest can put you at risk for overuse injuries.Active rest days help you recover from previous exercise but also keep you moving (and burning calories). You are not participating in your regular moderate or high intensity exercise, but are not taking the entire day off of activity. Schedule in low-impact or relaxing exercises like yoga or walking.
Schedule in about 1–2 active rest days each week. They should follow days of very high intensity exercise or strength training days.

, Record your starting weight. Plan to weigh yourself at least every couple days to keep track of your progress.


Studies have shown that people who weigh themselves are more conscious about their weight and their eating habits. If you are opposed to weighing yourself daily, make sure you are weighing in every week to mark your progress.Continue to weigh yourself after you meet your weight goal. This will help you notice any unwanted fluctuations — like a weight gain.

, Regular physical activity is not just for weight loss. In fact, exercise has shown to be more important for weight maintenance than weight loss.Continue with a routine that you enjoy. You may not need to workout as much or at a high intensity, but it's important to continue with about 150 minutes of moderate activity each week.
Also continue with your strength training. This will help support your weight maintenance long-term., Although you may have met your weight loss goal, that doesn't mean you can ditch the healthy eating plan. To maintain that weight loss you have to continue with a healthy, well-balanced diet. That means indulging in favorite foods, but only doing so occasionally.


An indulgence can be anything — a sweet treat, a dinner out or two alcoholic beverages at a happy hour. These should only be occurring every so often — maybe 1–2 times a week. However, you should define what occasionally means for you.
If these types of treats are popping up more often, you're more likely to gain some of your weight back.
When you do know that you'll be indulging, try to compensate in other areas of your diet or lifestyle. Perhaps you spend more time at the gym or do a harder workout or eat lighter throughout the day.

To start journaling, consider purchasing a paper and pen journal or download an app on your computer or smartphone, such as MyFitnessPal.
Write down everything you eat. Keep track of your breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and beverages that you consume on a daily basis. The advantage of an app is that it may have the calorie and nutrition information on common foods, so you can easily track how many calories you consume in a day.
In addition, keep track of your activities. This could be planned and structured exercise (like time spent at the gym) in addition to lifestyle activity (walking up and down the stairs or parking farther away). Some apps may allow you to sync with a fitness tracker, like a FitBit.
Review this information and see if there's anything that pops in your mind that may need to change in order to facilitate weight loss.
For example, you notice that you are rushed in the morning and stop at a fast food restaurant to grab breakfast each day, or you are more likely to overindulge after a particularly stressful day at work. Or you may notice that you rarely fit in structured physical activity into your free time.;
, One common roadblock to successful weight loss is what and where you're eating. If you typically eat out on a regular basis, it can be hard to stick to a diet plan.


Although there are healthy options at many restaurants, even these meals usually have a higher amount of calories compared to similar meals made at home.When you're eating out daily or even several times a week, these higher calorie restaurant meals may make it difficult to meet a restricted calorie diet plan.
Track how many meals you eat out each week. Over time, you can slowly cut back meal by meal so you're eating more packed meals or eating at home. (As a bonus, cutting back on eating out can also save you money.)

, A key player to weight loss and successful weight maintenance is exercise and regular activity; however, if you have a sedentary job, it can make staying active more difficult.


Regular physical activity, especially aerobic activity, will help you lose weight; however, it's even more important for successful weight maintenance.Sedentary desk jobs get in the way of being active. If you're tied to your desk for eight, nine, or even 10 hours a day, this can severely limit your ability to be active.
In addition, if you have a long commute, this causes you not only to spend more time sitting, but decrease your free time to exercise.
Make a schedule to help you visually see where you can add even 10 or 20 minutes of physical activity. This may help you stick to a more consistent exercise plan.

, In addition to barriers and roadblocks to weight loss, you should assess your readiness to change. This corresponds to your barriers to weight loss and will let you know whether or not you're actually ready to make the necessary changes to result in weight loss.Your readiness to change is important. You may truly want to lose weight, but you may not be ready to really change your lifestyle to result in long-term weight loss and maintenance.
If you have too many barriers and roadblocks to weight loss or do not know how to get around those roadblocks, you might not feel ready to change.
The more you work on figuring out exactly what your barriers to weight loss are and design a plan that accounts for those barriers, the more ready you will be to make changes to your lifestyle.

, Everyone will have some barriers and roadblocks to weight loss. To identify yours, start by writing out your weight loss goals. This means doing the math first, like determining your current daily calorie intake and how many calories you will need to cut out to start losing weight. It is generally considered safe to cut 500 calories each day, which results in a 1 – 2 pound loss each week. Another thing to keep in mind is that 3,500 calories equals about 1 pound.


When you write out your weight loss goals and get those specifics down pat, your roadblocks to your weight loss goals may become more clear and obvious to you.
To start this, write out your weight loss goals — but make sure you're very specific. Also, write out the specifics on how you're going to lose the weight.
For example, you might begin with a goal like: ""I want to lose 25 pounds over the next three months. My plan is to exercise four days a week for 45 minutes, download a calorie tracking app and limit myself to 1,500 calories daily, stop drinking regular soda and make sure half of my meals and snacks are a fruit or a vegetable.""
Doing the math on this goal, you may find that it is not realistic for your lifestyle. To lose 25 lbs., you need to eliminate 87,000 calories in three months, or 90 days. This means you would need a deficit of 972 calories each day for those 90 days. If you cut out 500 calories each day, you would still need to burn 472 calories each day (you might burn this by running 3.75 miles in 45 minutes — every day). This is probably not a realistic goal.
A revised goal might instead be: ""I want to lose at least 15 pounds over the next three months. My plan is to download a calorie tracking app and cut 500 calories from my daily intake, stop drinking regular soda and make sure half of my meals and snacks are a fruit or a vegetable. In addition, I will exercise four days a week for 45 minutes.""
Continue to refine your goal and change it until it is realistic. You may find that working out for 45 minutes four days a week just doesn't work for you. It's better to change your goal to something achievable than set an unrealistic goal and become frustrated when you (understandably) can't achieve it.

, When you're setting your weight loss goals, you're probably thinking about what type of diet to follow. Be aware that the type of diet you choose could actually end up being a roadblock to weight loss.


There are a variety of diets, diet plans and products on the market today; however, not all are safe or a sustainable method for weight loss.
Diets that offer a quick fix without having to change your diet or lifestyle or diets that offer large quantities of weight loss in a short diet will end up being a roadblock.
These fad or trend diets generally don't produce the advertised results and many times, dieters end up gaining back all of the weight (plus some extra pounds) after following these diets.Instead of looking to lose 10 pounds in 10 days or doing a cleanse diet, choose a safe and sustainable diet that will help you lose weight slowly over a longer period of time — make it a lifestyle change regarding how you eat and think about food, not just a temporary, unsustainable diet. You're much more likely to be successful when you skip fad or crash diets.

, You need to also take a look at your goals and see if they fit into your budget. Many diets do come with a cost and this should be considered.


The high costs of many diets and dieting products can be a roadblock to your success.
Try to avoid products that are overly expensive and won't fit into your budget. They need to be sustainable, but also financially sustainable.
Look at your weekly or monthly budget and see if the diet you want to follow to meet your goals is financially do-able. If not, you'll need to find another diet to follow.

, Once you've done some journaling and written out your specific weight loss goals, it's time to write out your specific roadblocks to weight loss.


You may choose to spend a few days contemplating your weight loss goals, your plan and overall timeline for weight loss.
You may find that some roadblocks to weight loss pop up quickly in your mind, whereas after a few days, you may come across additional ones.
Some specific roadblocks for you may include: you don't have a gym membership or have a safe place to exercise outside, you have a fixed income and cannot purchase specialty diet foods or products, you don't have a support group to encourage and motivate you, you're lacking in basic nutrition knowledge or you don't know how to cook well.
Although roadblocks to weight loss can be frustrating, they don't have to mean that weight loss isn't possible. Write out each of your roadblocks so you can eventually develop an action plan to get around them so you can successfully lose weight.

, One of the biggest lifestyle roadblocks to weight loss is finding time to exercise. The combination of both diet and exercise is the best for the most successful long-term weight loss.It's recommended to do at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity and 40 minutes of strength training each week. This amount of activity has been shown to help you lose weight and maintain weight.
If you have long work hours, a long commute, you work night shifts, have a busy family life or are managing work and school, finding the time to actually get in that amount of activity can feel next to impossible.
To help you get around this particular roadblock and get active on a more regular basis, try physically scheduling in your activity.
Health and fitness professionals note that if you actually schedule in exercise into your weekly routine, you are more likely to stick to your plan and feel like you actually have the time to spend being active.Look at your date book, smart phone calendar or email calendar. When do you have 10, 20 or 30 minutes of time? Remember, exercise doesn't have to be two hours at the gym. It can be a quick 15 minute walk. Anything counts.
To break out of being sedentary at work, talk to your boss or office manager about the possibility of installing standing or treadmill desks to get you off your feet. Set a timer that means you have to get up and walk around every few hours. There are even Try going for a walk on your lunch break.

, Another common roadblock to weight loss is preparing healthy and nutritious meals. Again, lack of time comes up as the basis of this particular roadblock.


Many people have super busy schedules and don't always have the time or energy to go grocery shopping, prep foods and then prepare healthy meals.
In addition, they may find that making foods from home and preparing three meals and snacks daily is just too much work.
Eating out on a regular basis or ordering in takeout can lead to unhealthy food choices which may lead to weight gain down the road. Instead of waiting until you're starving to decide what to eat, start each week with a detailed meal plan.
Take a few minutes each week to prepare your plan. Write out a week's worth of meals. Include each breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack that you plan on eating for the week.
This meal plan will help you devise a grocery list and give you a bird's eye view of your diet so you can make sure that your food choices and meals are nutritious and fit into your weight loss plan., Another weight loss roadblock can be specific foods. When certain foods are around or available to you, you may find it extremely difficult to say ""no"" and find yourself indulging too often in a higher calorie item.


Everyone has ""trigger"" foods. These are items that are difficult to say no to, difficult to have one bite of, difficult to to not eat if they're in your home or at your desk and are something you may go to when you're stressed, depressed, lonely, or bored.Think about your food choices and cravings. Are there certain items you tend to go for? Do you love to eat chips or popcorn while you watch TV? Do you gravitate towards something sweet after dinner? Is it hard to just have a small handful of nuts or a few crackers?
If you feel that there are some of these trigger foods in your home or office, consider getting rid of them. Many times, a slip up with these foods causes you to fall way off track on your diet. Limit your purchases of these foods and only enjoy them when you're out to eat and you cannot bring them home.
Try using your diet and activity journal to make notes about any circumstances that lead up to overeating or breaking your diet plan. Do you tend to overeat when you're bored, stressed, or sad? When you spend time with a relative with whom you have a strained relationship? After working long hours? Eliminating trigger foods is helpful, but identifying your triggers will help you address the real issue and work on the behavior that leads to you overindulging.

, Some dieting programs or products can be overly expensive. Even if they're safe and result in sustainable weight loss, their high cost can be a big roadblock to your weight loss.


If you've tried to lose weight before, you probably have come across specific diets, dieting products or suggested meal plans that are costly and expensive. Depending on your income and budget, these high-priced dieting tools may be preventing you from finding a plan that can help you lose weight.
If you know that you cannot afford or don't want to spend a lot of money on a diet program or dieting products, come up with a budget for yourself.
Consider whether you want to spend money on an actual diet program (like purchasing a Weight Watchers membership or Atkins diet book), specialty products like protein shakes or bars or if you'd want to spend money on more nutritious foods from the grocery store.
Also, consider looking for free resources online. There are endless diet recipes, meal plans and tips for healthier eating that can help you lose weight.

, One roadblock to weight loss you may not realize you have is a lack of a support group. See if you can find people to support you so you can do better with your weight loss.


Studies have shown that those who have a support group during weight loss are able to lose more weight and can keep it off more successfully long-term.If you feel like you don't have a support group, make one for yourself. Talk to friends, family members or co-workers about your desire to lose weight. They may even want to join you on your diet and share your goal to lose weight.
If you can't find people to be your support group, go online. You can join different social media groups, link up with others through online forums or join online weight loss support groups.

, If you have a current health condition that limits your physical activity or the types of diets you can follow, this can also be a barrier to weight loss. Talk to your doctor to make sure that weight loss is safe and appropriate for you.


Weight loss and exercise might not be appropriate for everyone. If you are underweight, are sick, experience extreme fatigue, or have other chronic health conditions, following a restricted calorie diet might not be appropriate for you.
For example, if you've had an injury or degenerative bone disease, exercise may be painful and dangerous. Or if you have a heart condition, certain types of exercise may not be appropriate for you.
To make sure you don't have any health-related roadblocks, talk to your doctor. Talk to them about how much weight you want to lose and how you're planning to lose it. They should be able to determine if this is OK for you.

, If you've had a lot of difficulty in the past meeting weight loss goals, it might be a good idea to see if a health professional can help you identify weight loss roadblocks. They may be able to point out specific issues you may not have been fully aware of.


A registered dietitian is a nutrition and weight loss expert and is legally allowed to make a meal plan for you to follow. Ask your doctor or search online for a local dietitian that can aid in weight loss specifically.
A behavioral therapist is another health professional that can identify weight loss roadblocks. They deal with the mental and emotional aspect of weight loss, which can both present as roadblocks.
Talk to either professional about your difficulty meeting weight loss goals. Ask them to help you identify why you have difficulty staying on track and meeting your goals. In addition, ask them to help you develop ways to get around those roadblocks.

, Once you've identified some of your roadblocks and are ready to move forward with weight loss, identify one or two small goals to start with.


When you're ready to lose weight, it's typically recommended to only choose one or two small goals to work on each week or so.
Studies have shown that if you make a lot of large changes in a short period of time, you're more likely to revert to old habits. Making smaller changes over a longer period of time is much more sustainable.Look at your weight loss goals and plan. Choose one small aspect to work on first. For example, you could start by adding in exercise two days a week to start with. After a week or two, make it four days a week. Or you can start by giving up soda and drinking only water.

, One important aspect to your weight loss plan is regular monitoring and tracking of your weight. This will help you see if your diet and exercise plan is working.


Studies have shown that regular weigh-ins help people stay on track and help them lose more weight and keep it off in the long-term.Aim to weigh yourself about one to two times per week. You don't necessarily need to weigh yourself everyday.
If you notice your weight stalling or increasing, it's time to reevaluate your diet and exercise plan. Some of your road blocks may have popped up or new ones have arisen that are stalling your progress.

, As you continue to follow your diet or exercise routine, you'll need to evaluate how you're doing and how well you're able to follow your plan.


Overtime, more roadblocks and barriers may arise. Even if you originally created a plan that seemed perfect for you, time may show that there are some flaws.
For example, exercising five days a week was fine to begin with. Now, you're realizing that this is too much time to devote to exercise and in reality, only three days a week is good for you.
Continually check in with yourself. Are you happy with your progress? Are you enjoying your eating plan? Does this lifestyle change feel natural and somewhat easy?
If you feel like something isn't working, take the time to identify the roadblock and make changes so you can continue with weight loss.

Choose whole grains.,
Consume proteins.",How to Lose 15 Pounds in 2 Months2," Take packed lunches to work or school. For some people, just this simple step can go a long way toward helping them eat less. Home-cooked food is going to be healthier than the vast majority of restaurant food, and will not have the same kinds of preservatives or high sodium levels., Consuming beverages other than water can make the calories add up. Fruit juice, soda, milk — any of these can add a great deal to your daily caloric intake. Black coffee and tea are extremely low in calories, and can be part of your daily beverage rotation if you know it won’t be possible to stop drinking caffeine., Start with seven to nine servings per day, then see if you can work up to 11. Eat the ones you know you like and take this opportunity to find tasty new fruits and vegetables. Look for new recipes and preparations to help guide you. And for fruit, if in doubt, throw it in a smoothie. For vegetables, most can be roasted successfully in the oven at high heats to cook, if you aren’t planning to eat them raw., These are grains that include the bran, germ, and endosperm. Some common ones are barley, oats, quinoa, brown and colored rices, wheat varieties like spelt, farro, and kamut, along with many others. These are going to provide carbohydrates, but in their healthiest form. Keep in mind there are many whole-grain pastas now available, and an array of whole-grain breads that are often delicious., Protein sources include nuts, lentils, eggs, fish, and lean meats. To be considered a lean meat, it has to have less than 10 grams of total fat in a 3 oz (21g) piece of meat. Turkey and chicken are lean, but some red meats are as well. Look for cuts with “top” or “loin” in the title. Fish and lean meats are a great source of protein. These are important to eat as part of a balanced diet, but they should not be the elements you eat the most. You need to eat more vegetables and fruits than lean meats.Keep your meat portions the size of your palm. Bigger than that and you are consuming more than your body can properly process, and it will just be extra calories!

Keep in mind that you also don’t have to do it all at once — ten minutes here and twenty there will work just as well., Don’t do the same thing every day (unless you love it). Walk one day, take a yoga class another, and try new activities. Check with your local gym or YMCA for their schedules and amenities. If you try and do a new activity every week or so, you might find your new favorite exercise routine., You can often eat some of the same foods you’ve always enjoyed — just not the same amounts. Rather than the focus of the meal, high-fat and high-calorie foods can be a small side, with vegetables as the main course. Sometimes a few bites is all it takes to stop a craving — not an entire portion., Having a person to talk to about your weight loss journey can be extremely helpful. He or she will be able to cheer for you on days when it all goes well, and commiserate when things didn’t go as planned and you didn’t follow your program.

Fish is the best source of omega-3s and you should eat it 2 to 3 times each week. The highest levels of omega-3s are found in mackerel, lake trout, herring, bluefin and albacore tuna, salmon and canned sardines.
Other sources of omega-3 include spinach, soybean and canola oil, mustard greens, flaxseed, wheat germ and walnuts.

Urate crystals accumulate in the joints if uric acid is elevated and this can aggravate joint pain in gout.


Also, uric acid elevation can increase insulin resistance which is a condition wherein the body do not respond to the function of insulin. This can further elevate the blood sugar levels of a person, leading to diabetic symptoms.
Purine-rich foods are mackerel, anchovies, organ meats, dried beans, peas, canned goods, instant noodles, wine and beer.;
, Foods rich in fructose consume a lot of adenosine triphosphate (or ATP) when metabolized. This ATP is an energy-supplying molecule that the cells in the body use. Over-consumption of ATP leads to its depletion and results in the generation of substances such as lactic acid and uric acid, thereby increasing the levels of uric acid in the blood.


Also, fructose is considered a sugar. Consuming foods rich in fructose can elevate the blood sugar of a person and lead to occurrence of symptoms.
Foods to avoid are apples, bananas, pears, agave, melons, asparagus, beans, broccoli, cabbage, onion, tomato, peanuts, raisins, figs, carbonated drinks, fruit drinks, ketchup, canned goods, chocolate, pastries and breakfast cereals.

, Alcohol interferes with the removal of uric acid from the body. When alcohol is converted to lactic acid, it reduces the amount of uric acid that is eliminated from the body through the kidneys. This is because the lactic acid competes with the uric acid in terms of being removed by the kidneys through urine.


Increased levels of ethanol (alcohol) in the body increase the body's production of uric acid by increasing the amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) that is converted to AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) - a precursor of uric acid.
Also, alcohol can affect the body’s sensitivity to insulin.

, Dietary fiber absorbs uric acid in the bloodstream, allowing it to be eliminated from the body through the kidneys. Also, pectin (which is a type of soluble fiber) lowers cholesterol by absorbing t from the body.


High levels of cholesterol in the body can increase the blood pressure and can lead to the occurrence of diabetic symptoms.
Include at least one high-fiber food in each major meal or snacks such as pineapple, oats, isabgol, cucumbers, oranges, barley, carrots and celery. The ideal daily intake is 21 grams.

, Anthocyanins prevent the crystallization of uric acid and also prevent it from being deposited in the joints.Also, anthocyanins encourage hypoglycemic activity that may help to lower blood sugar.


Foods rich in anthocyanins are eggplant, blueberries, cranberries, plums, black currant, grapes, pomegranates, red fleshed peaches and cherries.
You should include at least one of these foods in each major meal or snack.

, Increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce insulin resistance (a condition where the body is able to produce insulin but it is not used effectively), thereby reducing the risk or severity of type 2 diabetes.


Also, the eicosa pentanoic acid (EPA) in omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the levels of cholesterol and uric acid. The recommended dose for omega-3 fatty acids is not more than 3 grams daily.
Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids are sardines, salmon, soybeans, flax seeds, walnuts, tofu, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, shrimp and winter squash.

, This should include three regular meals and three snacks in between meals. General dietary guidelines for diabetic persons include:


Carbohydrates should provide 45 - 65% of total daily calories.
Fats should provide 25 - 35% of daily calories.
Protein should provide 12 - 20% of daily calories

, Basically, carbohydrates and protein each provide 4 calories per gram, while fat provides 9 calories in each gram.


For example, if you have eaten 100 grams of fat in a meal, then the number of calories consumed is 900 (9 multiplied by 100). If you have eaten 100 grams of protein, then you have consumed 400 calories (4 multiplied by 100). If you have eaten 200 grams of carbohydrates, then you have consumed 800 calories (4 multiplied by 200).
Once you know the number of calories from fat, carbohydrates and protein, add them up to get the total calories for that day. So 900 + 400 + 800 = 2100 calories. After this you can now determine the percentage of calories you have consumed.
To do this, divide the number of calories from each nutrient by the total number of calories for that day and multiply it by 100. So, for fat: (900/2100) x 100 = 42.8 percent. For protein: (400/2100) x 100 = 19 percent. For carbohydrates: (800/2100) x 100 = 38 percent.
Once you are aware of the general dietary guidelines for diabetic persons using this basic computation, you can easily tell if your diet falls in the normal range.

, In order to guide you, according to American Diabetes Association, there is about 15 grams of carbohydrate in:


200 ml of milk or orange juice
6 to 8 hard candies
¼ French fry
1 cup of soup
1 small piece of fruit (about 4 oz)
1 slice of bread
½ cup of oatmeal
1/3 cup of rice or pasta
4 to 6 crackers
½ hamburger bun
3 oz of baked potato
2 small cookies
2 inches (5.1 cm) of cake without frosting
6 chicken nuggets
½ cup of casserole

, For example, if your weight is 64 kilograms, the recommended protein intake is 51.2 grams (0.8 multiplied by 64).


Good-quality protein sources are defined as those that have PDCAAS (Protein Digestibility–Corrected Amino Acid Scoring Pattern) scores. This is essentially a grading scale for protein, with 1 being the highest score and 0 being the lowest. Here is a breakdown of the common proteins and their PDCAAS score:
1.00 for casein, soy products, egg white, whey
0.9 for beef and soybeans
0.7 for black beans, chickpeas, fruits, vegetables and legumes
0.5 for cereals and peanuts
0.4 for whole wheat.

, For diabetics, 1500 to 1800 total calories is the ideal daily intake. Fat provides 9 calories per gram.


To compute for the daily recommended intake in grams: if the diabetic patient has a diet of 1500 calories per day for example, then multiply 1500 by 0.25 and .35 to get a range of 375 to 525, then divide each by 9. So 375/9 = 41.6, and 525/9 = 58.3.
This gives you a range of 41.6 to 58.3 grams of fat per day. For diabetics, healthy fats such as Omega-3 fatty acids are recommended.

, This can lead to hypoglycemia or low blood sugar levels because the body uses up the stored blood glucose in the body when it cannot get energy from food.

, This will help your body to develop a routine in terms of its consumption of glucose from foods. This helps to prevent the occurrence of either high blood glucose or low blood glucose levels.

, Gout - a form of arthritis - is a condition caused by the buildup of excess uric acid. Uric acid is a chemical produced during purine metabolism in the body. Purines are nitrogen-containing compounds that are produced inside the body or can be found in certain foods and drinks.


Gout occurs when urate crystals accumulate in the joints, causing intense pain and inflammation. Urate crystals can form when a person has high levels of uric acid in the blood.
Gout causes sudden, extreme attacks of pain, redness and swelling. Gouty arthritis most often affects the big toe, but it also can occur in the ankles, feet, knees, wrists and hands.

, Diabetes is a disease that affects the body’s utilization of glucose – blood sugar that is the body’s source of energy. In order to use glucose, our body needs insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps transport blood sugar or glucose into the cells as a source of energy.


Without sufficient insulin, the blood sugar cannot be absorbed by the body's cells and remains in the bloodstream. In people with diabetes, there is the inability of the body to produce insulin or the insulin does not work like it should. Diabetes has two types:
Type 1 diabetes. The body’s immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, which is responsible for the production of insulin.
Type 2 diabetes. The pancreas can still produce insulin but the body does not respond well to it, so the insulin doesn't work.
In both types of diabetes, the glucose cannot normally enter the cells and remains in the bloodstream, resulting in high levels of blood sugar.

, Gout and type 2 diabetes often occur together, as both diseases have common risk factors. These include:


Non-modifiable Factors:


Age: As the body ages, its functions deteriorate. It may be unable to excrete uric acid any more which can lead to gout, or it may be unable to utilize insulin anymore, which can lead to diabetes.

Family history: Both gout and diabetes can be inherited. If one of your family members has gout or diabetes, then there is a chance that you may inherit the disease as well.

Gender:. Both gout and diabetes more often occur in men than women. This is because men have higher uric acid levels and are less sensitive to insulin.


Modifiable Factors:


Obesity: More adipose tissues from fats can produce and secrete more uric acid which can cause gout. Also, insulin does not easily bind to fats, which can increase a person’s risk of diabetes.

Diet and lifestyle: Excessive intake of alcohol can affect the body’s normal process of excreting uric acid, which can lead to gout. Also, alcohol can affect the body’s sensitivity to insulinwhich can lead to diabetes.



, They include:



Joint pain and inflammation: This is caused by elevated deposits of crystallized uric acid in the joints. This uric acid may irritate the joints and lead to inflammation. The pain in the joint can be described as sharp or excruciating.

Kidney problems: Increased uric acid can cause kidney stone formation, which leads to problems with urination. The kidney stones may block urine passage.

, Diabetes symptoms occur when the blood sugar is below the normal range (hypoglycemia) or above the normal range (hyperglycemia). The normal range of blood sugar level in the body is 70 to 110 mg/dl. Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include:



Blurred or impaired vision: Due to low levels of glucose (which provides energy for the body) certain parts of the body, such as the eyes, become weak due to insufficient energy.

Confusion which may lead to delirium: Due to insufficient glucose, the vital organs such as the brain are not working properly.

Extreme hunger leading to excessive eating: The body compensates for its lack of energy by releasing Ghrelin (hunger hormone) which gives the person the urge to eat.

Extreme thirst leading to excessive drinking: When the body loses fluids because of frequent urination in diabetes, the body secretes vasopressin (also known as anti-diuretic hormone) which activates the thirst mechanism and stimulates the kidneys to reabsorb water. The person responds by drinking a lot of water in order to replace lost fluids.

Rapid or fast heartbeat: Because the body has no source of energy such as glucose, the heart compensates by speeding up the pumping of blood to the body's vital organs.

Weakness or fatigue: Because the body does not have enough glucose, the sufferer may experience weakness and fatigue.

, When blood sugar levels go above the normal range, symptoms include:



Blurred or impaired vision: Abnormally high glucose levels in the blood can lead to swelling of the lens, which causes blurred vision.

Confusion which may lead to delirium: In hyperglycemia, although there may be a high level of blood glucose, it is not transported into the cells because of lack of insulin or insulin does not respond well to the body, so there is still no source of energy. The vital organs such as the brain don't work properly due to insufficient energy.

Extreme thirst leading to excessive drinking: When the body loses fluids because of frequent urination in diabetes, the body secretes vasopressin which functions to activate the thirst mechanism and stimulate the kidneys to reabsorb water. The person responds by drinking a lot of water in order to replace lost fluids.

Frequent urination: With hyperglycemia, not all of the blood sugar can be reabsorbed and some of the excess blood glucose is secreted in the urine where it draws more water. The kidneys attempt to decrease blood glucose levels by excreting the excess blood glucose through the urine.

Headaches: In an attempt to get rid of the excess sugar, the body increases urine output. This increase in urination leads to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance that results in headache.

Rapid or fast heartbeat: Because the body has no source of energy such as glucose, the heart compensates by speeding up the pumping of blood into the vital parts of the body.

Weakness or fatigue: Insufficient energy - due to the inability of glucose to be absorbed by the cells - leads to weakness and fatigue.

Decide on jalapeno peppers.,
Decide on olives.",How to Do the Olive and Jalapeno Diet," Some types of jalapenos are extremely hot, and some are on the milder side. Mild green jalapeno sauce (Tabasco is a good brand) can also help when you're out of peppers.


Pickled jalapenos stuffed with cheese. These are definitely the most mild jalapenos. Pickled jalapenos don't cut down on antioxidants or vitamins, so you don't have to worry about that. You can eat these whole, as a snack, or cut them up. They are best for eating whole, as the cheese can get messy when cut up.
Green jalapeno or chile peppers. These peppers are hot, but are milder in terms of hot peppers. Green jalapenos are generally not eaten whole, because of the seeds. You can cut them up and put them in salads, puree to make salsa, and use them for sauces and fillings. They have a lot of use in Mexican dishes.
Poblano chiles. These are a bit hotter than jalapeno peppers, but are still mild enough for the ones that don't have such hot teeth. They have thick walls, which make them great for stuffing. They can also be baked, peeled or dried. They are heart-shaped and very large. When dried, they're called mulato chiles.
Arbol chiles. These chiles are very hot, wear gloves when preparing. They are narrow and curved, they start out as green and mature to red. Arbol chiles are best used in small doses, and can be used in salsas, chili or sauces.
Habanero peppers. These peppers are very hot, and may burn your skin, eyes or nose if it comes in contact. They are best used in hot salsas.
Red Fresno chiles. Red Fresnos are very similar to jalapeno peppers, forgoing the meatiness and thick skin of jalapenos. They are popular for fresh uses, they don't dry well.
Serrano chiles. These chiles don't need to be steamed or peeled before use, making them very easy peppers to use. Since they are very meaty, they don't dry well. They are about six times hotter than the jalapeno.
Manzano peppers. These roundish little chiles have a very thick pod, making them hard to dry and black seeds. They are great for hot salsas, enchiladas, quesadillas and stuffing.;
, Olives are the staple of Mediterranean cuisine, and very versatile. They are not like jalapeno peppers in any way, shape or form. Some olives can be very salty, though, and some can be very mild. Picky eaters, keep this in mind. You can substitute capers, chopped sundried tomatoes or caper berries for olives. You cannot substitute olive oil for real olives, unless otherwise stated.


Manzilla, or mammoth, olives. Manzanilla olives are Spanish green olives, being the mildest of the bunch. You can eat them right out of the jar, use them in dishes, or pack them into platters. They are hollow, and can be filled with pimento, garlic, or nothing.
Kalamata olives. Kalamatas are black, Greek, brine-cured olives. These have pits in them, and are mildly salty.

Take a few hours of your free time to write up your meal plan. Include lean meat and protein in most or all of your meals.
Also make sure to include a variety of fruits, vegetables, dairy and 100% whole grains (if you're including these in your diet). Consuming a variety of foods from each food group is essential for a balanced diet.
Consider your lifestyle as well. If you're busy, on-the-go or have little time to cook, consider purchasing protein or meat that is pre-cooked or frozen for easier meals.

, In order to realize true weight loss benefits, stick to appropriate portion sizes-even with lean meat. Eating portions that are too large may results in excess calories and weight gain.


One serving of protein is 3 – 4-oz.This is similar in size to the palm of your hand, a deck of cards, or a check book.
Examples of appropriate protein servings include: 1 small chicken breast or 1/2 large breast, one or two eggs or 1/2 cup of beans."

Use the available online resources.",How to Easily Stick to and Enjoy a Diet Such As Nutrisystem," To help make a diet like NutriSystem more enjoyable (and help keep it enjoyable), be careful with how you go about eating the pre-made foods.


When you're selecting your diet plan, you'll be sent a whole entire month's worth of food items.
You will quickly learn that some items are quite tasty and enjoyable, while others aren't as delicious as you'd thought they'd be.
If you notice this, try to avoid finishing all your favorites up within the first few days. Otherwise, you'll have a bunch of food leftover that you don't enjoy.It's easier to stick to the diet knowing you have some exciting options everyday. So mix it up each day between some of your favorite pre-made items and some that are not as tasty.;
, Since you do need to supplement your meals with grocery store foods, make sure to pick items that you'll enjoy eating. This can help make sticking to the plan more enjoyable.


Some of the meals that are delivered may not be your favorite. If so, take the opportunity to use some of the grocery store foods to help add in a favorite food. This way, you'll still enjoy the meal overall.
If you're not enjoying any part of your meals, there is little chance that you'll stick to the diet long-term.
Also, purchase a variety of these foods each week. Try not to get stuck in a rut. This can get boring overtime and is another common reason people fall off the bandwagon.Look at the online resources for ideas on different foods to include with your pre-made items. For example, you could try: pair the spinach stuffed shells with a side salad, or pair the low calorie pancakes with a serving of fruit and a cup of coffee or add in your own afternoon snack of a greek yogurt with blueberries.

, Something that is common for dieters following these types of weight loss plans is getting a bit bored with the routine. After a while, just heating and serving the meals may not be as appetizing.It's normal to feel a little tired of the same routine and the same types of foods after a while.
If you know this ahead of time, you can prepare so you don't fall off the wagon due to boredom.
When you start to feel a little bored, consider changing your routine a little bit, while still staying within the guidelines.
You can try: going out to eat and ordering ""approved meals"" or making some of the recommended recipes online.

, Whether you're weaning yourself off the diet program or are taking a day off of the pre-made meals, using some of the online recipes may be a good option to keep things fresh.


One of the most common reasons people give up on a diet is that it gets a little old, boring and monotonous.
To prevent this from happening, mix up the available pre-made foods that you have at home with some the recipes that are provided online.This can help you keep things fresh and fun which can make it easier to stick to the diet plan long-term. For example, you can try: homemade turkey burgers, baked eggplant Parmesan, buffalo chicken wraps and even lightened up fettucini alfredo.

, It's fun and enjoyable to ditch the kitchen and frozen meals for a meal out. Luckily, diets like NutriSystem give you some great tips on how to do this while still sticking to your diet.


First, plan ahead. Look at restaurant menus online so you're aware of all the choices that are available to you. If there isn't a meal that will fit in your diet plan, find another restaurant.Stay away from liquid calories at restaurants. To avoid temptations, stick with water or unsweetened iced tea.
Stick to a smaller serving. Order an appetizer or split an entree with a friend or family member. This will help you stick to smaller servings and fewer calories.
Choose to eat out in moderation. Eating out, even when choosing healthier options, is still a little calorie heavy. Limit yourself to just one night out a week.

, When first planning to start a diet like NutriSystem, you'll need to go online and select what plan you want to follow. The most basic plan, and the least expensive, includes a pre-set month of delivered meals.


The basic plans generally send you a pre-selected menu of foods for an entire month. You do not get to choose what you are eating during this time period.
The basic plan is great for you if you're not a fan of having to choose so many meals in advance or are not very picky when it comes to foods or meals.
All of the plans limit the amount of work or prep you need to do with your meals. However, you need to choose the most appropriate plan for you or you're more likely to fall off the bandwagon.
Note that on the basic plan sample menus are provided so you know what you'll be getting.

, NutriSystem offers plans for women and men, based on their different calorie needs. There are also special plans for vegetarians and people with diabetes., There are a couple variations on the basic plan that give you more choice in your foods and meals. If you want to pick out exactly what you're going to eat during that month, these plans may be more appropriate for you:


The ""Core"" plan allows you to choose your own menu instead of the pre-selected kit.You can pick from these foods for your entire month's worth of meals.
The ""Uniquely Yours"" plan (which is the most expensive) gives you more menu options to choose from, including frozen meals.

, One thing you need to do prior to purchasing your foods or selecting your plan is make sure you have adequate storage space. You will be provided with a lot of food and need to make sure your kitchen and home can accommodate it.Many of the diets like NutriSystem send you about a month's worth of foods. That's about 28-30 days of breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks and some beverages.
If you're getting the ready-to-eat foods, these can be stored at room temperature as they are shelf stable. Make sure you have enough cabinet or pantry space for these meals.
If you're purchasing the plan with frozen meals, you'll need to have a ton of freezer space.
Some of the frozen meals that you will be eating within the next few days can be stored in the refrigerator so they are defrosted for you.

, Although you will be getting a lot of food in the mail, you still need to budget for additional grocery store expenses. These diets generally require you to supplement their meals with additional foods.NutriSystem suggests that you supplement each of your meals with foods from one of 4 groups: smart carbs (fruits and starchy vegetables), vegetables, extras (low-calorie condiments) and power fuels (protein).You will be adding at least one item to each meal that's delivered. For example, you might get chicken Parmesan and need to add in an additional serving of vegetables. Plan to have additions to each of the 4 meals.
Review the suggestions from the guide that's provided with your plan. Then write up a grocery list to match.
You'll need to see if these additional groceries, plus the cost of the diet foods will fit into your weekly or monthly food budget.

, With all diet programs, especially those that provide pre-made foods, you need to set your expectations appropriately. If you don't, you may be disappointed and find it difficult to stick to the plan.


One thing to note about these diet delivery services, is that the meals will most likely be much smaller than what you typically eat.In order to lose weight, your calories and therefore your portions will be smaller. Do not be surprised when you open your meals and see a small serving. And remember, you will be eating about 4-5 meals per day.
NutriSystem has been rated fairly highly when it comes to taste. However, the foods may not taste as good to you as your previous dietary choices.
This is especially true if you were eating a lot junk food, fast food or rich foods before. It may take some time to adjust your tastebuds to healthier foods and cooking methods.

, To help you make sure you're following the diet correctly and to make life a little easier, lay out your meal plan for the week. This will give you a blueprint of what you'll be eating at every meal and snack.


Many of the diets like NutriSystem, will help you by providing some sample meal plans. It may be a good idea to use one of these the first week or two to get you started.
Afterwards, try to make your own meal plan. Start by taking an inventory of all the meals that you have available.
Write down what pre-made food you will have for each meal: breakfast, lunch, dinner and planned snacks. Do these for an entire week.
Then, go back in and add in the supplementary foods from the grocery store. For example, you may pair a side salad with your dinners or add in a piece of fruit with your lunches.

, A very difficult area that many people struggle with while on diets like NutriSystem is the time when they want to stop the diet. It's important to be smart about this so you can easily transition into more regular eating.


There are a ton of resources that are provided just for this specific part of the diet.Look into the tips and suggestions provided by the diet itself to help you easily go through this stage.
Instead of just discontinuing the diet immediately, start by picking one meal a day to make completely by yourself without any of the pre-made items.
After a while of that, move on to replacing the other two meals with regular food overtime.
If you notice a stall in your weight loss or see a weight gain, revisit how you've been eating and see if there are adjustments you can make to get back down to your goal weight.

, To make following a diet like NutriSystem a little easier, take advantage of their available resources. There are tons of resources online or that you can purchase that can make following the program a little easier.One of the great resources that is offered is counseling. They can help coach you and motivate you, but also answer questions and help provide you with nutrition advice.
There are also blogs and community forums. This is a great place to get ideas on what foods are most liked, which foods are least liked and tips from actual dieters on how they got through more difficult stages.
Consider using the online tracking tools that are available as well. You can track your foods and exercise to see how well you're doing. The more often you track, the more likely you are to stick to the plan long-term.
Once you're ready to wean yourself off, take a look at their recipes online. This is a great place to find meals that will continue your weight loss without having to use the pre-made food items.

Purchase lean cuts of meat.,
Purchase organic meat.,
Incorporate one portion of meat into every meal.,
Cook meat without additional oils and sauces.,
Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables.,
Eat 100% whole grains.",How to Eat Meat and Lose Weight2," Lean proteins are foods that are relatively low in fat and calories per serving.When attempting to lose weight while focusing on meat-based foods, it's important to choose leaner meats over high fat meats the majority of the time. This can help keep your weight and cholesterol in check. Select non-fatty, lean meats such as:


Seafood. This is an excellent source of protein. Choose shellfish (like shrimp or crab) in addition to finfish (like flounder, tuna or mahimahi). In addition, some fish like salmon or mackerel, contain heart-healthy omega 3-fatty acids which have been shown to decrease the risk for heart disease.Poultry. Like turkey and chicken is also a great source of lean protein. Choose skinless, white meat options for the lowest fat content.
Pork. Most pork has very little fat or marbling throughout the meat.Cut away or remove any excess fat for the lowest fat option.
Red meat like beef or lamb. These proteins can also be considered a lean - especially if you're choosing lean cuts or 97/3 lean ground items. In addition, lean beef contains an abundance of zinc, iron and vitamin B12., Organic meat products, in general, are slightly more expensive than conventionally raised and processed meat products. However, organic meat is free of growth hormones, additives and preservatives.Look for the USDA seal of approval, which means that the animal was fed 100% organic food and was free-range.
Do note that organic meat has no nutritional difference when compared with conventional meat. However, free-range meat is typically higher in omega 3 and 6.

, Eating a serving of lean meat at every meal or snack will give you the foundation for a weight loss diet focused on meat.


To maintain a balanced and varied diet, eat a variety of proteins throughout the day. For example, you may have eggs for breakfast, a grilled chicken salad at lunch, beef jerky as a snack and grilled salmon and vegetables for dinner.
Other foods that are also high in protein (like dairy products, beans or tofu) can be included in some of your meals. Whether you choose to include them will be based on how you create and design your diet.

, Oil and sauces (like marinades or dressings) can contain a significant amount of added fat, sugar and calories. Limit the amount of oil and sauces you cook with to manage the overall calorie content of your meals.


For the lowest calorie method, lightly brush the meat with a small amount of olive oil prior to cooking it.
Or, try sautéing lean protein in a non-stick pan with the addition of some no-calorie cooking spray.
Fresh or dried herbs and citrus are healthful ways to add a lot of flavor to meat dishes without adding a lot of calories or sodium.
Avoid added excessive amounts of sauce to serve meat with. Even though you may love ketchup or barbecue sauce, both contain a lot of sugar which may counteract your weight loss goals. Instead look for alternatives that contain little to no sugar and calories. You can also try making these sauces from scratch to control the sugar and calories.

, Fruits and vegetables are essential to a healthy, nutritious and well-balanced diet. Even when choosing a meat-based weight loss diet, it's important to consume adequate amounts of fruits and vegetables each day. These foods are high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that are vital for your health.


1 cup of raw or 2 cups of leafy green vegetables are considered a serving.Aim to consume two to three servings daily.1 small whole fruit, 1 cup of sliced fruit and 1/2 cup of dried fruit counts as one serving. Aim to consume one to two servings of fruit daily., Many weight loss diets that focus on meat or are high protein are also low-carb diets. You may choose to limit how many carbohydrates you consume - especially from the grain group. However, if you choose to consume grains, choose 100% whole grains over processed grains.


Whole grains are minimally processed and contain all the parts of the grain: the bran, the germ and the endosperm. They are generally higher in fiber, vitamins and minerals compared to more refined grains.Whole grain foods include: 100% whole wheat bread or pasta, quinoa, brown rice, barley, or millet.

Weigh yourself weekly.,
Reevaluate monthly.,
Build a support group.",How to Eat Meat and Lose Weight3," Weighing yourself regularly when you're trying to lose weight will help you monitor and track your progress and let you know how effective or ineffective your diet program is. Regular weight check-ins will show you your progress over time and may help keep you motivated.


Weigh yourself about 1-2 times a week. Weighing yourself each day will not give you an accurate perspective of your progress. Daily fluctuations in weight (either a gain or loss) are normal and may be due to what you ate, drank or did at the gym the day before.For the most accurate method of weighing, take your weight on the same day of the week, at the same time with the same clothes (or no clothes).
Regular weigh-ins have also been shown to help prevent weight-gain., With any weight loss plan, it's important to check-in every month or two to see how effective your diet is. Review how much weight you've lost, how much more you'd like to lose and how your new diet is helping you reach your goals.


If your weight loss is steady or if you've reached your goal, the diet has most likely been successful. Keep on going!
If your weight loss has been slow or has stopped, take time to reevaluate the diet, how you've been eating and following the plan. It might make sense to keep a food journal for a few days to make sure you're truly sticking to the diet.
Also take into consideration how easy to follow your diet is and how it's making you feel. For example, if you're finding it overwhelming to have meat at each and every meal, you might want to make some changes to your plan to make it fit better with your lifestyle.

, Support groups can be a great tool for weight loss. Whether it's friends, family members or other dieters, a support group can encourage and motivate you throughout your progress.Ask friends or family members if they'd like to join you on your meat-based diet. It's can be more fun if you have a whole group of people with the same goal.
Get competitive with your support group. Set an end date for your weight loss competition and have an exciting prize for the winner.

Choose dark chocolate over milk chocolate.,
Trade in a full-sized chocolate bar for a snack-sized bite.,
Enjoy a low-calorie chocolate mousse or yogurt.",How to Enjoy Chocolate Without Ruining Your Diet1," Dark chocolate contains heart-healthy antioxidants, and it may help lower your blood pressure and cholesterol.Unlike milk chocolate, dark chocolate is lower in sugar and higher in fiber and iron.Opt for incorporating dark chocolate into your diet to reap these healthy benefits.


Look for dark chocolate that has around 70% cocoa or higher.
When buying dark chocolate, look at the label to make sure that added sugar is not the first ingredient.;
, Opting for a snack or bite-sized chocolate bar can help satisfy your cravings without derailing your diet.Smaller bars contain fewer calories and sugar than the larger chocolate bars. Next time a chocolate craving hits, enjoy one of these snack-sized treats instead.


Full-sized chocolate bars can contain 300 calories 40 grams of sugar, while smaller bars contain around 100 calories and fewer than 10 grams of sugar.To rein in your calorie intake, be sure to have only one of these bite-sized chocolate bars.

, To get your chocolate fix without indulging in the calories, grab a low-calorie chocolate yogurt or chocolate mousse.These treats come in a variety of styles and can be found in the dairy aisle at your grocery store.


Low calorie chocolate pudding, usually in the snack aisle, is also a good option.
A low-calorie chocolate Greek yogurt can provide a powerful chocolate flavor. Plus, it contains about 5 grams of protein to help fuel your body and boost your energy levels.Opt for a low-calorie chocolate mousse for a quick and easy dessert. These treats can be between 60 to 90 calories, so you can enjoy them without feeling guilty."

Go for pure spirits.,
Watch your mixers.,
Pick non-carbonated over carbonated beverages.,
Favor red wine over white wine or champagne.,
Avoid beer.,
Limit yourself to two drinks.,
Order fewer drinks at bars or restaurants.,
Alternate alcohol with water.,
Have a healthy meal or snack before you go out.,
Stay away from the bar food.,
If drinking at home, keep healthy snacks close at hand.,
Plan your late-night snack ahead of time.",How to Drink Alcohol on a Diet," Pure spirits (also known as liquors) typically have fewer calories and carbs than any other alcoholic drinks, as well as less sugar. If you have the palate for neat whiskey or a scotch and soda, make something like that your go-to drink.If you're on a low-carb diet, stick to whiskey, brandy or tequila – all of which have zero carbs.
Whiskey, vodka, and rum each have only 64 calories per shot, compared with more than a hundred calories per serving of beer.Spirits also have higher alcohol content per volume than beer or wine, which means that you'll drink far fewer calories.;
, If you don't care for the taste of straight liquor, it's okay to have a mixed drink while you're on a diet. However, you need to pay attention to the drink's recipe so you know what goes into it, and avoid sugary mixers.Serious cocktails such as Long Island Iced Teas not only have several shots of alcohol, but also pack a lot of sugar and calories. However, even a simple drink such as a rum and Coke can still derail your diet – not with the rum, but with the mixer.
Even a drink such as a gin and tonic, which isn't really a sweet-tasting drink at all, carries 16 grams of sugar. One or two of those could potentially bury your diet.
If you need to dilute the taste of the spirits with something, try cub soda, which has no sugar or calories.
When making mixed drinks at home, avoid bottled, pre-made mixers, which typically are high in calories and sugar (although there are some ""diet"" versions available).
The worst possible drinks – whether alone or mixed with something else – are cream-based liqueurs, such as Irish cream, along with other cream-based mixed drinks such as Amaretto Sours, or mudslides (which weigh in at 820 calories)., Apart from typically having more calories and sugar, the alcohol in bubbly drinks is absorbed faster than in drinks without carbonation.While faster absorption alone may not impact your diet directly, it can destroy your diet indirectly because the alcohol you drink will effect you more quickly. This means you could potentially feel a heavy buzz after one or two glasses of champagne, lowering your inhibitions and making you feel hungry – even if you just ate.
Carbonated drinks also can cause bloating and fluid retention, which can lead to dehydration.This is the reason you may have heard of the ""beer belly"" – drinking beer and other carbonated alcoholic beverages can result in greater fat deposits around your midsection.

, Generally speaking, the sweeter a wine is, the worse it will be for your diet. While red wine is relatively low in calories and sugar, white wine can include significant amounts of sugar and carbohydrates.Wine has antioxidants and other nutrients that actually can improve your health if drunk in moderation. After all, wine is made of fermented grapes, which in and of themselves can be a healthy diet snack.
Choose a dry wine for fewer carbs. You typically can have a glass or two of dry red wine on a regular basis on even the strictest low-carb diet., Generally speaking, beer is your worst enemy if you're on a diet. It's carbonated, high in carbohydrates, and high in calories. If you drink a wheat beer, you're essentially drinking fermented liquid bread.Many larger beer companies have introduced light and low-carb brews to their lineup, but you may not find these appealing – particularly if you love the taste of regular beer.
If you are going to have a beer, go for a darker beer, such as a stout, which has about 170 calories per pint. Lighter beers average around 195 calories per pint, but can have even more.The other advantage of darker beers is that they are heavier, and will make you feel more full. They also typically have a slightly higher alcohol content than lighter beers.

, Getting drunk can negatively affect more than just your diet. Especially if you're out on the town, set yourself a hard limit of one, maybe two drinks – depending on how long you're out.One drink a day is considered moderate drinking. If you only drink once or twice a drink, you probably can get away with having two drinks. But more than that, and you're at serious risk of blowing your diet.
Generally speaking, one drink per hour is a good pace. However, this doesn't mean if you're out with your friends for four hours owning bar trivia, that means you can have four drinks. Even if you haven't had a drink all week, having more than two drinks in a night can seriously damage your health and put all the benefits you're getting from your diet at risk.
Keep in mind that your diet is about your health, not your budget. Your limit doesn't mean ""only two drinks unless someone else is paying."" It means two drinks, period.

, When you're counting your drinks, keep in mind that the drinks you get from a bar or restaurant typically will be larger – sometimes significantly larger – than the drink you would make at home.Before you go out – or when making drinks at home – it's important to know what constitutes a ""drink."" You may have a 32-ounce stein, but filling it full of beer doesn't mean you've only had one beer.
A ""drink,"" for the purposes of measuring alcohol, is defined as one serving of alcohol. This translates to a 12-ounce bottle of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or a single shot of liquor. However, restaurants and bars may give you a pint of beer (that's 4 ounces over a single serving), or mixed drinks with multiple shots.
Keep serving sizes – not drink sizes – in mind when you're ordering at a bar or restaurant. For example, if you've limited yourself to two drinks, and you order a double, that's your limit. Two shots of liquor is equal to two servings of alcohol.

, With every alcoholic drink you consume, you should be drinking at least 12 ounces of water. If you're out at a bar or restaurant, order ice water along with your drink and take two sips of your water for every sip you have of your drink.You also should drink at least one big glass of water before you go out, or before you start drinking. Alcohol has a dehydrating effect, so you want to make sure you're well hydrated before you even start drinking, then maintain your hydration level by balancing your alcohol intake with water intake.
When you get back home, have another big glass of water or two before you go to bed.

, Munching on something with fiber, healthy fat, and protein will give you long-lasting energy that can counter alcohol's tendency to raise your blood sugar.If you don't have a full meal, you should at least have a snack, such as Greek yogurt with berries, a handful of almonds, or an apple.
Keep in mind that the alcohol in your drinks won't be absorbed as quickly if you drink on a full stomach. This can keep you from trashing your diet once a buzz kicks in.
If you're going out for dinner, pull up the restaurant's menu online before you go out so you have time to study it and make a healthy choice that won't blow your diet.

, Once you have a few drinks, greasy fries, nachos, or mozzarella sticks might start sounding like just the thing you need. However, if you abandon your diet to that extent after a few drinks, you'll end up regretting it.While greasy food can help settle the stomach a little if you've had one too many, you may pay for it in the morning – especially if you've maintained a healthy diet of whole foods for weeks or months. Your body isn't used to that kind of food, and may reject it.
The other side of that is your body will end up storing as fat anything it doesn't recognize as food. If you go for greasy fried food after a night drinking, chances are most of it will end up around your midsection.
Many bars also have plentiful snacks hanging around, such as peanuts or pretzels. Move them far enough away from you that they aren't within arm's length, or sit with your back to them.
If you're out with friends and someone orders appetizers for the table, keep them out of your line of sight so you won't be tempted to take some.

, When you're drinking, you tend to get hungry. Keeping healthy snacks out if you're drinking at home means you'll be more inclined to reach for those than to start hunting for junk.Almonds are a good go-to snack to have around, and you can just leave a bowl of them on the table.
Edamame also can make a good snack with various alcoholic drinks – especially Japanese sake.
If you tend to crave something salty when you drink, try organic tortilla chips with a simple avocado dip. You also can make a dip by mashing edamame.

, If you're going out with friends, get your food together before you leave so that when you come home you'll have a healthy, filling snack ready to go and won't raid your fridge.Before going to bed, choose a calming, high-fiber snack to get back some nutrients your body lost while you were out drinking. Hot cereal or oatmeal are good choices.
Since foods with plenty of fiber take longer to digest, you won't go to bed hungry, nor will you wake up famished in the morning.

Try buying fish in bulk by picking up canned wild Alaskan  salmon and other canned fish. You can stock up on canned fish so you can eat them as part of your paleo diet.
Eggs can be purchased in large quantities and are fairly inexpensive. They are often sold by the dozen and each egg has 6 grams of protein.
Be sure to store bulk food properly. Deep freeze the extra portions of large cuts of meat in a freezer and store extra bulk nuts in a secure place, like a refrigerator, to keep pests away.;
, A big part of eating paleo is eating fresh fruits and vegetables. Going to your local farmer’s market will ensure you have access to the best local produce and that you are not paying marked up prices in a grocery store. You may make it a regular habit to go to the farmer’s market once a week and stock up on fresh fruits and veggies.When you shop at the farmer’s market, make sure you walk around and look at the produce at different sellers closely. Compare prices for product and make sure you are getting the highest quality produce at a good price when you buy.

, A Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program gives you access to local, fresh produce from farmers in your area. It is also a good way to buy produce in bulk every week that is local and high quality. You can look at CSA programs in your area online or find one through your school, your work, or your community association. This way, you have access to fresh produce every week that is affordable and fits with your paleo diet.If you live in a shared household, you may try splitting a CSA order with others to cut down on the cost. Often, CSA programs offer a large amount of food to consumers, making them ideal for sharing with others.

, You can eat paleo on a tight budget by checking online and in the newspaper for coupons on paleo foods. Scan the coupons for discounts of fish, meat, eggs, and produce. You may also find discounts on certain bulk nuts. Clip the coupons and use them at checkout to save some money on your groceries each week.There are apps on your phone you can download that can tell you of coupons and discounts on certain food items. Using these apps, you can track these discounts and use them when it comes time to buy food for your paleo diet.

Eat a balanced diet.,
Burn extra calories to enjoy a chocolate treat.,
Allow yourself to have a cheat day.",How to Enjoy Chocolate Without Ruining Your Diet3," Leading a healthy lifestyle is all about balance and moderation. To enjoy chocolate without derailing your weight-loss goals, increase the amount of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your diet.If you focus on eating nutritious foods, counting calories won’t be necessary.Try to fill up half of your plate with vegetables and fruits. One quarter of your plate should be filled with lean proteins, like baked chicken or fish, and the remaining quarter can be reserved for whole grains like whole wheat pasta, quinoa, or brown rice.Cut back on your intake of processed foods, fried foods, saturated fats, and sugar as much as possible., Each week, aim to exercise for about 150 minutes, or for about 30 minutes for 5 days each week.On days when you plan to have a chocolate treat, increase activities like walking, swimming, or dancing to help burn extra calories. The more you burn, the more often you will be able to incorporate chocolate into your diet.


To burn an extra 100 calories, spend about 15 minutes mowing the lawn, 20 minutes working in your garden, or 30 minutes cleaning, mopping, and dusting.Small activities like these can also help you burn a few extra calories.

, A cheat day can help boost your overall commitment to your diet and can help you stay on track with your weight-loss goals.Perhaps you like to have a small bowl of chocolate ice cream after dinner on Sundays, or maybe you’ll allow yourself to have a packet of M&M’s on your family movie night. Give yourself a day to enjoy your favorite chocolate treat without the guilt!


If you are celebrating a birthday, plan to have your cheat day on the day of the party so you can enjoy a slice of chocolate cake.
Portion control is always important, even on a cheat day. Keep yourself on track by limiting the portions of your cheat foods within reason.

Load up on vegetables and fruits.,
Go for cheaper cuts of meat.,
Buy items that are about to expire.",How to Eat Paleo on a Budget2," If you are trying to be paleo on a budget, go for foods that are inexpensive and good for you. Vegetables and fruits are often cheaper than prepackaged foods and fit right into your paleo diet. Go for carrots, onions, celery, cabbage, and cheaper varieties of vegetables. Opt for cheaper fruits like apples and bananas.If you are still struggling to afford fresh fruits and vegetables, you can try buying frozen produce instead. Buying frozen fruit and veggies means you do not have to rush to use it all up or worry that you will waste money on food you won’t have time to eat. Pick up frozen fruit like berries and frozen vegetables like spinach, kale, and peas.

, You can save money on potentially expensive items like meat by buying cheaper cuts and organ meats. Liver, kidneys, heart, and brain are all cheap and full of nutrition. Talk to your local butcher about buying organ meats and then prepare them so they taste delicious.You can also go for cuts of meat that are not as tender but taste just as good once they have been cooked down. Cuts like the shoulder, the hocks, and the shanks are cheaper and taste great once they are slow cooked. You can also use the liquid from the slow cook as broth for soups, stews, and sauces.

, Don’t be scared off by expiration dates, especially if you plan to prepare and eat the food you buy right away. Many foods that are closer to their expiration date will be marked down. You may go for cuts of meat that are close to their “sell by” dates and buy them for dinner that night. Or you may pick up produce that is slightly bruised but still good and buy it for cheap.A big part of the paleo diet is not eating prepackaged foods, which means you may not need to worry too much about expiration dates unless you are eating items like meat or fish. If you notice cuts of meat or fish that are close to their sell by date and are on sale, do pick them up.

Cook more paleo meals at home.,
Make a paleo meal plan for the week.,
Allocate more of your budget to food.",How to Eat Paleo on a Budget3," A big way you can save money on your paleo diet is to avoid eating out and cook at home instead. Cooking at home means you know exactly what goes into your meals and you can be assured it is all paleo. You can also budget out your food more carefully when you cook at home and have leftovers to eat later in the week.One way you can motivate yourself to cook more paleo is to have others over who also eat paleo and cook together. Maybe you have a paleo dinner party once a week where you all get together and prepare paleo meals with a limited amount of ingredients or within a strict budget.

, Another way to ensure you stay on track in terms of budget is to create a paleo meal plan for each week. You may write down what paleo recipes you plan to have for the week and make a shopping list. You could then calculate how much money you are going to spend each week on food based on your meal plan and shopping list.As part of your meal plan, you may try switching up the dishes you make so you get some variety week to week. This will keep your paleo diet interesting and exciting for you palate and push you to make different dishes.

, Though you may already be on a strict budget overall, you may consider trying to allocate more of your monthly or weekly budget to food. Consider where in your budget you can cut costs or shift your costs so you have more money to spend on paleo food. Perhaps you skip your morning coffee at a cafe, eat out less, or spend less on items like clothing.Allocating even a small amount of money extra to your food budget can help make being paleo easier. You may think about the long term benefits of eating paleo and be willing to sacrifice a few things so you have more money to spend on your diet.

Be aware of how the oatmeal diet works.,
Talk to your doctor first.,
Understand the health benefits of oatmeal.,
Balance your oatmeal consumption with other healthy meals.,
Go shopping for supplies before you start the diet.,
Start with plain oatmeal in milk or with egg whites.,
Add fruit to the oatmeal in the morning and green vegetables at night.,
Return to your normal diet gradually.,
Have one serving of oatmeal a day once the diet is done.,
Exercise at least two to three times a week.,
Drink lots of water.,
Consider stopping the diet if you feel weak, have low energy, or other health issues.",How to Do the Oatmeal Diet," The oatmeal diet was originally developed by Dr. Carl von Noorden as a way to treat certain cases of diabetes. In von Noodren’s version of the diet, the patient consumes 250 grams of oatmeal, 250 – 300 grams of butter and 100 grams of a vegetable albumin, which is protein derived from plants, or six to eight egg whites. The patient cooks the oatmeal with water for two hours and then stirs in the butter and egg whites when the oatmeal is done. This diet is followed for one to two weeks and then the patient is allowed to return to their normal diet gradually.Remember that this diet was developed in 1903 — over a century ago. We know a lot more about nutrition and diabetes now, and following this diet could be very dangerous to your health and promote disordered eating.
The modern oatmeal diet consists of three phases, where you start with plain oatmeal in skim milk for one week. In the second phase, you can add fruit to the oatmeal in the morning and vegetables to the oatmeal in the afternoon. In the third and final phase, you can gradually return to your normal diet.Phase one of this diet is considered extreme and is not recommended.If you would like to use the oatmeal diet to lose weight, you should make sure you are having other healthy meals along with oatmeal and that you are maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This will ensure your body is reaping the benefits of oatmeal and will not put you at risk of other health issues while on the oatmeal diet.;
, While oatmeal is known as a healthy food option, it should be eaten in moderation, just like anything else. The oatmeal diet is an extremely restrictive, very low-calorie diet and doesn't provide all the nutrients you need from other foods. If you are interested in this diet, you must speak with your doctor or a registered dietitian first. This will ensure your body is reaping the benefits of oatmeal and will not put you at risk of other health issues while on the oatmeal diet.


Keep in mind a restrictive diet like the oatmeal diet is not sustainable for long-term weight loss. As soon as you return to eating the way you did before, you will gain the weight right back., The oatmeal diet is structured around the known health benefits of oatmeal, which include:Lower cholesterol levels
Reduced blood pressure levels
Boosting your immune system to fight off bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites
Helping your body to remove waste
A reduced risk of type 2 diabetes
An improved sensitivity to insulin
An increase in appetite-control hormones

, A diet consisting only of oatmeal (even with some added fruits and vegetables) is not considered a healthy, safe, or sustainable diet and you will need to eat other, healthy meals as well.


To ensure your body is getting enough nutrients, consider eating oatmeal with fruit in the morning and then have a healthy lunch that consists of a protein (animal-based, like chicken or fish, or plant based, like tofu), a grain (quinoa, brown rice), and leafy green vegetables. You could then finish your day with a dinner of oatmeal with vegetables.

, Before you embark on the oatmeal diet, you should make a shopping list of ingredients you will need to start your diet.Consider steel cut oats, rather than rolled or instant oats. Though they will take longer to cook than rolled or instant oats, steel cut oats have a creamy texture that will make your bowls of oatmeal taste delicious and filling.Instant oat packages often have added sugar, so avoid these if possible.
Choose skim milk over whole milk. Skim milk will provide creaminess for the oatmeal without adding too much fat. The milk will also help you maintain a healthy calcium level throughout the diet. You can also substitute the milk with egg whites and butter to vary the flavor, though the skim milk has more nutritional value.
Buy fruits and green vegetables to put into the oatmeal. These could be berries, such as strawberries, blueberries, or blackberries, and green vegetables like kale, broccoli, and spinach.

, For the first week of the diet, you should prepare basic oatmeal in skim milk or with egg whites and butter. The egg whites will ensure you get enough protein with your oatmeal.To prepare oatmeal in skim milk with steel cut oats, boil 1 cup skim milk and add ¼ cup oats. If you’re using rolled oats, boil 1 cup milk and add ½ cup oats. Let the oats cook for 20 – 30 minutes on simmer, stirring them occasionally. The longer the oats cook, the softer they will be.To prepare oatmeal with egg whites and butter, boil 1 cup water and add ¼ cup steel cut oats or ½ cup rolled oats. Let the oats cook for one hour and then add 250 grams of butter and 100 grams of egg whites (about ½ cup) once the oatmeal is done cooking. You can also add a dash of salt.

, After one week of oatmeal with milk or egg whites, you can add fruit and vegetables to your oatmeal.Add ¼ cup of berries like blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries to your oatmeal in the morning to break up the monotony of plain oatmeal and to give your body some much needed natural sugars and fiber.
You can then add ½ cup of steamed vegetables, like kale, spinach, or broccoli, to your oatmeal at night. This will provide nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, and give you some variety for your dinner meal.

, Once you feel the oatmeal diet has been beneficial, usually about two to three weeks from the start date, you can start to gradually return to your normal diet. Avoid diving right back into your normal diet, as this can lead to an increase in your blood sugar levels and can be harmful to your health, especially if you are diabetic.Cut out one oatmeal meal and replace it with one cup of broth, accompanied by steamed vegetables. The following day, replace one oatmeal meal with 1/2 cup of cooked chicken or beef and a small salad made of lettuce or spinach.
Continue to replace one oatmeal meal with a 1/2 cup of solid foods like chicken, beef, potatoes, and one slice of bread for one week.
After one week, you can reduce the oatmeal meal to once a day or once every other day.

, Though you may be tired of oatmeal by the time you finish the oatmeal diet, you should try to still incorporate oatmeal into your daily breakfast meal. Starting your day with oatmeal and fruit, sweetened with honey, can provide enough fiber to get you through the morning. Oatmeal will also prevent you from getting hungry until it’s time for lunch., To maintain a healthy lifestyle during the oatmeal diet, you should try to do at least 30 minutes of gentle exercise two to three times a week. This could be 30 minutes of walking or yoga.


Doing weekly exercise will ensure you will lose weight in a healthy and sustainable way while on the oatmeal diet.
Don't do anything too taxing or intense while on a very low-calorie diet.

, It is not recommended that you drink juice, soda, or alcohol during the oatmeal diet. Instead, you should focus on drinking at least one to two cups of water after you exercise and one to two cups of water during each meal and between each meal.Drinking water will help your body stay hydrated and ensure you are expelling any waste or toxins out of your body.

, If you feel weak or fatigued at any time during the oatmeal diet, you may not be getting enough nutrients and protein in your diet. You may decide to add more protein or a nutrient-rich meal to your diet or to add more vegetables or fruits to your oatmeal.


If you have any health issues and are concerned about your health while on the oatmeal diet, you should consider stopping the diet and check in with your doctor. Your doctor can then determine if it is medically safe for you to continue on the oatmeal diet.

Investigate the water diet.,
Set a realistic goal.,
Get a checkup.,
Drink half your body weight.,
Drink water often.,
Decide what kind of water.,
Get a water bottle.,
Add some light exercise.,
Set fitness goals.,
Get a wall calendar.,
Add a fitness app.,
Reduce caloric intake.",How to Do a Water Diet," There are many variations on this diet, ranging from all-out fasting to just making sure your daily water is cold. One version, for example, suggests that you consume roughly two glasses of water before each meal while following a low-calorie diet. Researchers found that people who did this lost about 5 pounds more than those who skipped the water.The water diet is best for a short amount of time. It is safest when combined with a normal diet, and can be dangerous when combined with fasting.
The water diet may not be safe for everyone. When doing a water fast, you risk symptoms of low blood sugar like dizziness and fatigue, not to mention constipation, dehydration, and an intolerance of cold temperatures.If you know you struggle with low blood sugar, the water diet may not be for you.
This diet tends to be a ""yo-yo"" diet, meaning that once you lose the weight, as soon as you go off of it, the weight comes back.;
, When setting out to lose weight, you need to know where you are and where you want to be. Take the time to make some measurements (such as weighing yourself) and check standards for your body's healthy weight (such as BMI), and then set your goals from here.


Weigh yourself. Once you see your current weight, you'll be able to set accurate weight loss goals.
Check your BMI (body mass index). BMI can tell you how healthy your weight to height ratio is. Someone who is 5’9” and weighs 150 pounds would do this math: x 703 = 24.96. This BMI of 24.96 is in a normal weight range. , You may check your BMI at home, but don’t start a new weight loss program without consulting your primary care physician. He or she will be able to more accurately evaluate your BMI and make fitness and diet recommendations.


Tell your doctor about your water diet plan so he can suggest safe dietary recommendations. Everyone has different physical requirements, and seeing a doctor will prevent you from unnecessarily harming yourself.

, The amount of water you consume overall each day is up to you, but experts recommend drinking half your body weight in ounces (that is, if you weigh 150 pounds, drink 75 ounces of water a day).If you forget to drink water before meals--an inevitable occurrence since you are trying something new--don't beat yourself up about it. Just try again at the next meal. You'll get the hang of it.

, Drink it both first thing when you wake up and 30 minutes before you eat a meal. The feeling of fullness you get when filling your stomach with water prevents you from overeating.


Drink after meals. Contrary to rumors that drinking while eating is bad for you, drinking after eating actually aids in digestion and prevents constipation.Drink after exercising. You need to replace fluids, even if you’re not noticeably thirsty. Athletes should drink about 1.5-2.5 cups of water beyond the recommended amount (half your body weight in ounces)., Tap water gets a bad rap for having chemicals in it, but the EPA directly supervises its production. Bottled water must follow a few regulations, but the EPA can’t guarantee its safety like it can with tap water.If your home has a filtration system in place, use it, but don’t stress about having access to filtered water.


Even though bottled water sales have surpassed those of coffee, milk, and juice, bottled water is terrible for the environment and some cities have started taxing it and removing it from their governments.Tap water is just as safe to drink, it's free, and does not harm the environment to consume.
Home water filtration systems can sift out some things in tap water, like chlorine, but none of them can remove all water contaminants. Plus you have to maintain these systems or they will grow contaminants, defeating the purpose., To keep water at your fingertips all day, invest in a good BPA-free water bottle, whether plastic, metal, or glass.


You don't have to purchase a water bottle, but you do need to keep up with how many ounces of water you're drinking each day. Perhaps designate a cup at work and one at home and use those instead of a water bottle.
When eating out, take advantage of the pre-meal drink order and ask for water. Make sure you sip your glass down two times before the meal is brought out.

, Your focus on the water diet is drinking water to lose weight, but exercise helps burn calories. If you already have a workout routine in place, don’t change it for the water diet. If you don’t, begin by walking several times a week before starting in on more strenuous exercise.


Only exercise if you are also eating. Exercising while doing a water fast will deplete your metabolism even more, making you vulnerable to the effects of low blood sugar, which can be dangerous.

, Goal setting keeps you motivated and helps you decide what things work and don’t work. For example, make a list of things you want to accomplish physically. If you want to lose 10 pounds in a month, write this down somewhere you can look at it everyday.


You have to estimate how much weight you will lose on the water diet in order to set a clear goal. For example, in the study we mentioned above, researchers found that subjects lost 15.5 pounds over the course of 12 weeks when drinking 2 glasses of water before each meal.

, Hang it where you’ll see it, like the kitchen. Mark beginning and end dates for your diet.


Even if you have your fitness goals mapped out elsewhere, like on a piece of paper or on your phone, having a wall calendar posted keeps your goals visible. This is key when you're standing in the kitchen and reaching for an unhealthy snack.

, You look at your smartphone everyday—why not turn it into a weight loss motivator? Apps like MyFitnessPal help track your water, food, and calories burned each day. Studies show that documenting food and exercise helps people lose more weight than people who don’t.Some people add the convenience of a fitness tracking bracelet so they don't have to think entering data into a phone (such as the FitBIt). These bracelets can track your movement and measure your sleeping habits, among other things.

, The goal of the water diet isn’t to count calories, but to put your body in weight loss mode, you do still need to consume fewer calories than you burn. The point is to require your body to pull energy from its fat stores.Record every bite you eat in a fitness app. It might surprise you how much you really eat in a day, and motivate you to eat less.
If you forget to record anything, just go back and make your best guess. Even estimated data is better than no data when you're trying to generate quantifiable results.
Keep in mind that the reason the water diet is labeled ""yo-yo"" is because when you drink water instead of eating, your body tends to take nutrients from your muscles rather than fat. This depletes your metabolism, requiring you to maintain an extremely low calorie diet that isn't sustainable in order to keep the weight off.

Increase your physical activity.",How to Lose 10 Kg Fast," If you want to lose weight, especially somewhat quickly, you'll need to cut out some calories from your diet. Cutting calories is one of the main methods for weight loss.


If you cut out about 500 calories daily, you'll lose about one to two pounds per week. With this weight loss rate, you could reach your goal in about two-and-a-half to three months.You could cut out more calories, but following a very low-calorie diet is not recommended. If you do not eat enough throughout the day, you're at risk of losing lean muscle mass and having nutrient deficiencies. In addition, your weight loss may eventually slow down and may not be sustainable long-term.Use an online food journal or smartphone app to help you count calories throughout the day and keep track of your intake.;
, Many studies show that if you want to see quicker weight loss results from a diet, that you should follow a low-carb diet.


Low-carb diets are eating plans that focus on minimizing your total carbohydrate intake throughout the day. These result in quicker weight loss and have been shown to help specifically lose more fat tissue.Carbohydrates are found in a large variety of foods including fruits, starchy vegetables, legumes, dairy products, and grains.
Since they are so widespread it's typically not recommended to follow a no or very low carb diet as you'll be missing out on a wide range of nutrients.
Instead of limiting each of those food groups, minimize the most carb-rich groups and those whose nutrients you can get from other foods. Limit: grains (like bread, rice, pasta, crackers or tortillas), high sugar fruits and starchy vegetables.If you do choose to have a serving of these carbohydrate-rich foods, stick to appropriate serving sizes: 1/2 cup or 1 oz of grains,1 cup of starchy vegetables,and a 1/2 cup of fruit., Both protein and produce (fruits and vegetables) are low in calories and high in many nutrients. Together, they make a great combination for weight loss.


Protein is essential for your diet and for weight loss. It helps your body function, maintain lean muscle mass and helps keep you feeling satisfied longer throughout the day.Include a 3 – 4-oz serving of protein at each meal and snack.Try items like eggs, poultry, lean beef, pork, seafood, tofu or low-fat dairy products.
Fruits and vegetables are high in fiber and other nutrients while being low in calories. In addition to protein, they can help bulk up your meals and help you feel satisfied with fewer calories.Include one to two servings of a low-sugar fruit (apples, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries or cranberries) or vegetable at each meal. Stick to 1/2 cup of fruit and 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of leafy greens.

, Having an occasional snack can be a part of a nutritious weight loss diet. However, too much snacking can lead to weight gain. Be careful of how much you snack as you try to lose weight.


If you want to lose weight quickly, try to limit snacking as much as you can. These extra calories can slow your weight loss.
If you do include a snack, keep the calories under 100 per snack.In addition, only snack if you're truly hungry and need a snack, or need an energy boost before or after an intense workout.
Examples of low calorie, nutritious snacks include a small piece of fruit, an individual low-fat greek yogurt, 1 oz of mixed nuts or a hard boiled egg.

, Water is a great drink to help you lose weight. Contrary to popular belief, retaining water and water bloat comes from not drinking enough water — not drinking too much. So load up on this calorie-free beverage to prevent additional water weight gain.


Aim for at least 8-13 glasses of water or other sugar-free beverages daily. You can also try flavored water and unsweetened decaf coffee or tea.If you're dehydrated, even slightly, you may feel hunger when in all reality you're only thirsty.To avoid this mistake, stick to the 8-13 glass rule.
In addition, drinking a big glass of water before a meal or when you're feeling a twinge of hunger can you help your stomach feel full and decrease your overall hunger feeling.
Limit or give up sugary beverages, alcohol or drinks with any calories. Liquid calories can easily sabotage your weight loss efforts.

, In addition to changing your diet, you'll need to add in cardiovascular exercise. The combination of diet and exercise can help you lose the most weight and lose it more quickly than diet or exercise alone.Aim to include at least 150 minutes of cardio activities each week. However, you can increase this amount to up to 300 minutes for additional health benefits.When choosing your exercises, aim to pick activities that are moderate-intensity for you. You'll need to be out of breath, sweating and have your heart rate raised.
You do not need to aim for a specific heart rate level necessarily. Aim for a 6-7 out of 10 on the perceived exertion scale (1 being completely sedentary and 10 being the highest intensity exercise you could handle).
Try exercises like jogging, using the rowing machine, doing aerobics classes or using the elliptical.

, One type of cardio exercise is called HIIT or high-intensity interval training. Adding this type of cardio to your exercise routine may help speed weight loss.HIIT exercises increase your heart rate significantly. Studies have shown that this type of exercise burns a significant amount of calories from fat and keeps your metabolism raised long after you've completed the workout.Make 1-2 of your cardio sessions a HIIT workout. The combination of HIIT and steady-state cardio (like jogging for 30 minutes) is great for weight loss.
An example of a HIIT routine would be: sprinting for 1 minute, followed by 2 minutes of a jog repeated 3-5 times or as many as you're able.

, Strength training is another type of exercise that may help with weight loss. However, this type of exercise helps maintain your weight loss long-term.


Strength or resistance training doesn't burn all that many calories by itself. However, it helps increase your lean muscle mass and your metabolism or your body's ability to burn calories.Include at least 1-2 days of strength training each week. Work each major muscle group and spend at least 20 minutes doing these activities.Exercises like weight lifting, isometric exercises, yoga and pilates all can help you build strength and increase lean muscle mass.

, In addition to participating in planned, structured exercise, try increasing how much you move throughout the day. This can also help your overall calorie burn throughout the day.You can burn a significant amount of calories through cardio exercises. Increasing your daily lifestyle activities can help increase the total amount of calories you burn each day.
Lifestyle activities are those things you do in a typical or average day.Anything from taking the stairs, doing household chores, walking to and from your car and standing can count as lifestyle activities.
These types of activities do not burn many calories alone. But if you increase them and are constantly moving or walking throughout the day, the total calories can add up.
Think about your typical day and see when and where you can add in more movement or more steps. Could you park farther away? Can you take extra flights of stairs? Can you take a walk break during your lunch hour?

, Anytime you are attempting to lose weight fast, especially a considerable amount, it is crucial to consult a doctor. It's always a smart idea to talk to your doctor prior to any new diet or exercise plan.


Talk to your doctor about how much weight you want to lose and what he or she thinks would be a healthy weight range.
Also get in touch with your doctor if you're having difficulty losing weight. They may run some general tests on you to rule out any health conditions that could be affecting weight loss.
Your doctor may also be able to refer you to a local registered dietitian or medically supervised dieting program.

, Food journals are a great tool for weight loss.Start keeping one when you start your diet to have a track record of what you've been eating.


Keep track of all your meals, snacks, drinks and any little nibbles you eat throughout the day. The more accurate you are with your journaling, the more useful your journal will be.
If you notice you're not losing weight anymore or have started to regain weight, come back to review your food journal. Look for extra snacking, larger portions or liquid calories. If you notice a trend, try to fix what's wrong to help restart weight loss.
Journaling continuously can also help keep you accountable. You may be less likely to snack or eat bigger portions if you know you have to account for it in your journal., You may have already implemented a new physical activity routine when you started losing weight. However, if you notice you're no longer losing weight or have regained some, increasing your activity might be helpful.


Although it's typically only recommended to do 150 minutes of aerobic activity most healthy adults can increase this amount to 300 minutes per week. With increased levels you can burn more calories and restart or continue weight loss.You may also consider changing the intensity of your exercise. If you're currently walking most days, do 1-2 days of a jog. Increased intensity also means you're burning more calories.

Studies suggest that trans fats may increase waist size 30 percent more than monounsaturated fats.






Some examples of monounsaturated fats include avocado, green tea, yogurt, blueberries, and bulgur. Chocolate milk is also a good source, especially when made with low-fat milk.






Eat more home-cooked meals. Fast food meals and processed foods contain many hidden trans fats.

, While many people may realize that they need to cut calories in what they eat, fewer realize just how many calories lie hidden in many drinks.


Avoid sugary fruit juices and sodas. Alcohol is also another major culprit.
These calories are all empty, so they do not provide your body with energy or any other nutrients it needs. Instead, these calories are eventually converted into fat.

, Fiber makes you feel full and slows digestion. As a result, food enters your bloodstream slower, making it easier to burn off.


Fiber derived from vegetables is especially helpful. Look for options like broccoli, avocado, cabbage, collard greens, peas, and Brussels sprouts.

,


White rice, white bread, pasta made with white flour, and potatoes all build on the fat. The sugar in these can raise your insulin levels, thereby increasing your appetite and prompting your body to store fat more readily.

, Protein increases the body's sensitivity to insulin, preventing your body from digesting food too quickly and causing less fat to get stored in your stomach or any other region.


Protein also stimulates metabolism.
Aim for healthy proteins, such as those found in lean meats, seafood, and fruits and vegetables.

, Sodium causes the body to retain water and gas, causing your abdomen to become bloated. In some individuals, the difference between a bloated belly and a non-bloated belly can actually be seen.

Make an appointment to see your primary care doctor. Talk to your physician about your desire to lose weight and get their opinion on how much weight you should lose.
Also talk to your doctor about the Dukan Diet. Ask if this type of eating pattern is appropriate for you.
It may also be wise to ask your doctor for any tips or advice on weight loss. This is especially important if you have any chronic diseases like high blood pressure or diabetes.
If you and your doctor decide that trying out a diet is appropriate for you, ask your doctor for a referral to a registered dietitian.;
, Whenever you're starting a new diet, it’s important to set goals for yourself. Goals can help give you a path to follow and can also be encouraging or motivating to you.In order for you to lose weight and be successful, your weight loss goals need to be realistic. If they're not, you could be setting yourself up for failure.
It's typically only recommended to lose about 1-2 pounds per week. Health professionals consider this to be safe and sustainable weight loss.If your goal is to lose 10 pounds, it’s not realistic to aim to lose this weight in 2 weeks. You'll need to lose it over 4-5 weeks instead.
You may also want to consider setting multiple goals. You can set one long-term goal and then smaller goals along the way. This can help keep you motivated and encouraged throughout your weight loss.

, To make sure you're following the Dukan Diet correctly, it'll be a good idea to prepare your home. Specifically get the kitchen ready - you'll need to stock up on allowed foods and consider getting rid of foods you shouldn't be having.


The Dukan Diet has a list of 100 ""approved foods"" that you can eat. The diet doesn't provide restrictions on the quantity of these foods. They include all protein sources (like eggs, lean beef, pork, seafood, soy and tofu products and low-fat dairy). In addition all non-starchy vegetables are allowed.Print out the list of these foods so you can use this to grocery shop. You can also use this list to make sure that you don't have foods that aren't allowed in your home.
Consider giving away prohibited foods to a food bank or friends or just tossing them if they've been opened already.
Then, take your approved foods list and hit the grocery store. Stock up on the items you enjoy and that are also allowed on the Dukan Diet.

, The Dukan Diet doesn't give too many rules or restrictions when it comes to preparing foods and meals. However, writing up a meal plan can help give you an idea of what you'll be eating over the course of a week.Take some time to come up with your meal plan. You'll need to have the approved foods list for this activity. Write out what you'll be eating for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks during one week of the Dukan Diet.
This blueprint of meals can help keep you on track, do meal prep in advance and reduce extra trips to the grocery store during the week.

, The official Dukan Diet websitedoes provide dieters with a lot of extra resources if needed. If you are unsure of how to follow the diet exactly, need extra ideas for meals or need some encouragement, consider getting these extra resources:


Weight loss coaching. The Dukan Diet offers coaching. This is a service you'd pay for but may help keep you motivated and on track while you're trying to lose weight.
Cookbooks. This diet also has several books that you may consider purchasing. They explain the diet in detail, give you information on nutrition and even provide recipes and meal ideas.
Blog and email service. The Dukan Diet website also offers dieters the option to sign up for weekly emails or tune into a daily blog. These blog posts may give a unique recipe, a cooking tip or provide extra motivation.

, With any diet, it’s important to follow approved recipes, foods and cooking techniques. When followed appropriately, you'll see the best weight loss.


The Dukan Diet is made up of 4 distinct phases (the Attack, Cruise, Consolidation and Stabilization phases). Each phase comes with different ""allowed foods"" and cooking techniques. Make sure you're familiar with what phase you're in so you're following the diet appropriately.
The Dukan Diet typically suggests low-fat cooking methods. Use little to no added fat when cooking.
Download different recipes or print out recipes that are appropriate for the Dukan Diet. Also make a list of recipes you currently make that would fit into the Dukan Diet plan.

, The Dukan Diet specifically lists 68 sources of lean protein that are considered ""allowed foods"". You can eat these protein sources in any phase of the diet. Make sure you only consume the following types of protein:


Seafood: arctic char, catfish, cod, flounder, grouper, haddock, halibut and smoked halibut, herring, mackerel, mahi mahi, monkfish, orange roughy, perch, red snapper, salmon or smoked salmon, sardines (fresh or canned in water), sea bass, shark, sole, surimi, swordfish, tilapia, trout, tuna (fresh or canned in water), clams crab, crawfish, crayfish, lobster, mussels, octopus, oysters, scallops, shrimp and squid.
Poultry: eggs, chicken, chicken liver, Cornish hen, fat-free turkey and chicken sausages, low fat deli slices of chicken or turkey, ostrich steak, quail, turkey and wild duck.
Red meats and pork: beef tenderloin, filet mignon, buffalo, extra-lean ham, extra-lean Kosher beef hot dogs, lean center-cut pork chops, lean slices of roast beef, pork tenderloin, pork loin roast, reduced-fat bacon (i.e. center cut belly bacon, which is leaner than regular bacon), steak (flank, sirloin, London broil), veal chops, veal scallopini and venison.
Vegetarian protein: seitan, soy foods and veggie burgers, tempeh and tofu.
Dairy products: fat-free cottage cheese, Fat-free cream cheese, Fat-free milk, Fat-free plain Greek style yogurt, fat-free ricotta and fat-free sour cream.

, In addition to 68 allowed protein foods, the Dukan diet also allows over 30 vegetables. These are only allowed on certain phases so make sure you pay attention to exactly when you add these foods.


Try any of the following allowed vegetables: artichoke, asparagus, bean sprouts, beet, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, eggplant, endive, fennel, green beans, kale, lettuce (arugula and radicchio), mushrooms, okra, onions (leeks and shallots), palm hearts, peppers, pumpkin, radishes, rhubarb, spaghetti squash, squash, spinach, tomatoes, turnips, watercress and zucchini.
You can start adding in some of these nutritious vegetables when you advance to the Cruise phase. However, you do not eat these everyday.

, The attack phase if the first phase of the Dukan Diet. The goal of the Attack phase is to trigger fast and encouraging weight loss. Depending on your weight, you may spend anywhere from just a few days to over a week on the Attack phase.The high protein and no carb nature of this phase will put you into ketosis. This is where your body is mainly burning fat for energy. No fruits, vegetables or grains are permitted during this phase.
You need to drink a minimum of 8 glasses of fluids daily to keep flushing the ketones out of your body. However, the Dukan Diet recommends even up to 13 glasses of fluids daily.
The Dukan Diet also recommends to start an exercise program when you start the Attack phase. Ideally, exercise in the morning to help burn more calories from fat.

, This is the second phase of the Dukan Diet. You'll start adding different foods back to your diet, however it still is skewed towards high levels of protein and very low levels of carbs.The goal of the Cruise phase is to continue to lose a steady amount of weight until you reach your goal weight.In addition, you're eating all 100 of the ""allowed foods"" at this time.
Although the Cruise phase does allow you indulge in more foods, you need to alternate your menus during the week. The Dukan Diet suggests alternating between days of all protein (like that of the Attack phase) and days where you include both protein and vegetables.
Make sure to exercise for at least 30 minutes daily. The Dukan Diet specifically recommends fast walking during this stage as your main form of exercise.

, The Consolidation phase is one of the longest phases of the Dukan Diet for some dieters. It's based on the total amount of weight you've lost during the diet. This is the phase where you're learning to maintain your weight while adding other foods back to your diet.


The Consolidation phase length will differ for everyone. You're supposed to stay on this phase for 5 days for every pound you lost. So if you lost 10 pounds, you'll stay in the Consolidation phase for 50 days total.The 68 protein foods and 32 vegetables that are allowed during the previous two phases are still the main components of your diet during this phase as well.
During the first half of the Consolidation phase you're allowed to have one serving of fruit daily, one ""cheat meal"" per week and 2 slices of whole grain bread per day.
The last half of the Consolidation you're allowed to have 2 servings of fruit per day, 2 ""cheat meals"" per week, 2 slices of whole grain bread per day and 2 servings of starchy vegetables per week.
In addition to adding some foods back to your diet, follow the Attack phase guidelines one day a week (Thursday is the day suggested). Only eat protein on this day.

, Although the Consolidation phase starts weight maintenance, it's the Stabilization phase that really focuses on weight maintenance long-term. You're allowed a significant amount more freedom in your food choices, but you need to follow a certain day to day menu.One of the “non-negotiable rules” of this phase is that you eat 3 tablespoons of oat bran everyday. You can add this to recipes, smoothies or sprinkled on other foods.
The Dukan Diet recommends continuing one day of the Attack phase (protein foods only) to help maintain your weight loss long-term.
As far as exercise, the Dukan Diet wants you to continue exercising and emphasizes the need to increase your lifestyle activity (like taking the stairs instead of the elevator).

, Regardless of what diet you follow long-term, one of the best ways to maintain your weight by weighing yourself regularly. This will help make sure you hold yourself accountable to your goal weight long-term.


Many studies show that people who have lost weight are able to keep it off longer and more easily when they're weighing themselves at least once a week.Make sure to weigh yourself weekly. However, weighing yourself daily won't necessarily give you an accurate information day-to-day. Natural fluctuations in weight occur daily so once or twice a week is appropriate.
Try to weigh yourself on the same day of the week, at the same time and with the same clothes (or no clothes). This will help give you a more accurate trend over time.
Give yourself a small weight range that's acceptable for you. If you go below or over that range, you'll need to address your diet and lifestyle to see where those weight changes are coming from.

, Another important aspect of weight maintenance outside of regular weigh-ins is a support group. Whether you attend a support group meeting or have friends or family that support you, this is a key aspect to being able to maintain your weight long-term.


Many studies have shown that those people who have a support group not only lose more weight, but are able to keep it off long-term.The Dukan Diet has several types of support systems. You can pay for weight loss and maintenance coaching, sign up for a blog or comment on support group forums.
If you're not able to use any of the Dukan support services, ask friends, family members or co-workers if they can be your support group. They may even want to try the Dukan Diet with you.

, A food journal isn't only for weight loss. In fact, it's also a great weight maintenance tool as well. Keep track of your meals and types of foods you're eating on a daily basis to help you maintain your weight loss long-term.A food journal doesn't have to be anything special. You can download a food journal app or your can keep a paper and pencil version.
When you're in the weight maintenance phase, you might not need to journal every single day. Aim to keep track of your foods at least 4-5 times a week.
When journaling, make sure you write down each breakfast, lunch and dinner meal you have. In addition write down any snacks and beverages you consume during the day.
In regards to the Dukan Diet, you may want to make notations on what days are all protein days or days when you're only going to consume lean protein and vegetables.
If you notice your weight increasing more than you'd want, come back to your food journal to check where the gain might have been coming from.

Forget spot reduction.,
Do more cardiovascular exercise.,
Strength train.,
Focus on your abs.While spot reduction does not work, performing exercises that work your abdominal muscles can build those muscles and tighten the area.,
Work-out your side muscles.",How to Get Rid of Your Muffin Top2," Most personal trainers no longer endorse spot training, as evidence suggests that it does not successfully eliminate fat in the targeted area.Some parts of your body lose fat faster than others. For many people, especially middle-aged women, the body retains a large portion of excess fat around the stomach area.
The fastest way to lose excess fat in your stomach is to perform exercises that cause you to lose excess fat overall.
Exercises focused on your abdomen do help you to tone that area, however. More muscle mass means a higher metabolism, which makes it easier to burn fat. Have a toned abdomen may also help to reduce the appearance of your muffin top.







, Cardio gets your heart pumping, forcing your body to work more and burn off more calories. The more calories your body burns, the more your muffin top should begin deflating.


High-energy dance classes, like zumba, work wonders. Swimming, hiking, kick-boxing, and cycling are also good examples of high-intensity cardio workouts.
Short, high-intensity exercises tend to work more effectively than drawn out, moderate-intensity exercises.
Take plenty of steps. You should take about 10,000 steps per day, and you can monitor these steps with a pedometer.







, Strength training builds muscle, and having more muscle makes it easier to burn excess fat quicker.


Strength train at least three times per week. Women who perform strength training for a solid 25 minutes two to three times per week usually gain about 2 lbs (900 g) of muscle and lose twice as much fat within the first two months.

,

These exercises alone will not get rid of muffin top, so they should only be done in conjunction with cardio exercises.
Crunches and sit-ups are the most common ab-focused exercises.







, You can help tone your waistline by working the muscles on either side of your abdomen.


Simple leg lifts are a good example of this sort of exercise. Lie on one side with both legs outstretched. Raise and lower the top leg, keeping it straight the entire time. Repeat the procedure with the opposite leg to work on both sides.

"

Pick your favorite type of cardio.,
Warm up.,
Perform 10 sprints with recovery periods.,
Go for 10 minutes at moderate intensity.,
Do 10 more sprints and recoveries.,
Cool down.",How to Get Rid of Your Muffin Top3," Running, biking, swimming, and jumping rope are all good choices for this exercise.


This routine does not spot-target your abdomen, but it does provide you with the cardio you need to melt excess fat. If you tend to gather excess fat around the middle, performing this as a part of your daily exercise regimen may help you lose more of that fat.

, Spend 10 minutes increasing your level of exercise from easy to moderate intensity.

At easy intensity, you should be able to hold a conversation with little to no problem. At moderate intensity, you should be able to hold a conversation but should only be able to speak in intervals of three or four words.
For instance, if you plan on running, work up from a walk to a jog.

, Each sprint should be 30 seconds long, and the sprints should be separated by 30-second intervals or light recovery exercise.

During your sprints, you should exercise at full intensity. Exert enough energy to become breathless.
Keep moving during your recovery periods. Walk or jog slightly.







, For 10 full minutes, perform your chosen exercise at moderate intensity without pausing to recover.

Again, during moderate intensity exercise, you should be able to speak but only in groupings of three to four words.

, Repeat your sprinting procedure, performing 10 additional 30-second sprints of intense exercise with 30-second intervals for rest in between.

Continue moving during your recovery periods by walking or lightly jogging.

, Finish up with 5 minutes of easy intensity exercise to wind your body down slowly.

Sit with your legs straight.,
Lift your legs off the ground.,
Criss-cross your feet.,
Perform 20 to 30 per set.",How to Get Rid of Your Muffin Top4," Your bottom should be flat on the floor or exercise mat, and your legs should be sticking straight out. Lean your upper body back slightly.


If you lack the strength to hold your upper body back, you can prop yourself up by leaning back on your elbows.
If you have a stronger core and do not need to lean on your elbows, cross your arms over your chest.
This exercise does target your abdomen and may help reduce muffin top by building abdominal muscles.

, Your legs should be lifted just high enough to engage your abdominal muscles without straining them.
Before lifting your legs, make sure that your chest and back are held tall. Tighten your core or abdominal muscles.

, Keep your toes pointed out and move your feet back and forth over one another.


Move your feet in quick, small, and precise gestures.
You may need to play around with the height of your feet in order to get the most benefit from the exercise. The closer your feet are to the ground, the more strenuous the movement will be. The higher up your feet are, the easier it will be. You need to choose a height that forces your abdominal muscles to work without causing pain.

, Each back-and-forth motion should be considered one repetition, and you should aim to do 20 or 30 repetitions per set.

Try to get three to five sets in during your exercise routine. Increase the amount or speed as you progress.

Increase gradually your net carb intake to no more than 25 grams per day.,
Find your Carbohydrate Level of Losing, or how many carbs you can eat and still lose weight.,
Move on to the next phase when you have fewer than 10 pounds to lose before reaching your target weight.

",How to Eat Fat and Lose Weight With Dr. Atkins' Diet2," Stick close to the induction phase diet but add in seeds, nuts, lower-carb fruits, dairy products and vegetable juice. You can also enjoy Atkins products and certain convenience foods in this stage.

, Once you find that you're losing a pound or less per week, you have hit your level.

"
Test your carb tolerance by adding 10 net grams of carbs each week.,
Add in higher-carb foods gradually.,
Continue this phase for several months to lose those last 10 pounds.,
Move on to the last phase of the Atkins program after you hit your target weight and have maintained it for 1 month.

",How to Eat Fat and Lose Weight With Dr. Atkins' Diet3," Once your weight loss plateaus or you experience carb cravings, you'll know you've reached your tolerance. Scale back those 10 grams.


Your Atkins Carbohydrate Equilibrium (ACE) is the number of carbs that you, as an individual, can consume. This number is important as you move on to the next phase.

, Find out what carbohydrates you can eat to maintain your weight and what carbs you need to stay away from. This is the time to try out more fruits and add in some healthy whole grains.

, This part of the process is slow, but following the procedure can help you to maintain your ideal weight.

Cut down hard on non-water drinks.,
Reduce the amount of white grains and dairy products in your diet.,
Eat fiber.,
Eat plenty of vegetables.,
Skip dessert.,
Slow down when you eat.,
Restrict calories.",How to Get Skinny in a Week1," One way to get rid of those pesky extra calories is to replace unhealthy drinks with water..


Sports drinks, sodas and alcoholic beverages don't satisfy hunger and just add empty calories.
Even diet drinks can have negative consequences on your weight. Research has shown that diet soda is linked to weight gain.
Drinking two 8 oz. glasses of water before each meal will help you to fill up your stomach so that you don't overeat.
Purchase a refillable water bottle and bring it with you wherever you go. That way, you can continue to hydrate yourself throughout the day without going for sugary drinks or sodas.;
, By eliminating foods that cause bloating, you will be able to look skinnier in no time.


Carbohydrates cause bloating, especially around your stomach where it will be most visible.
Simple carbohydrates are also easier to digest, so they leave you hungrier even though you've consumed plenty of calories.
Dairy can cause bloating if you have lactose intolerance or allergies.If this happens to you, switch to dairy substitutes. However, if you don't have this symptom, milk can be a healthy part of your diet.

, Having a lot of fiber in your diet helps you feel full sooner and for a longer period of time. It also moves fat through the digestive system so that less of it is absorbed into your body.


Swap out your morning bowl of cereal with oatmeal or some fat-free yogurt sprinkled with flaxseed instead.
Instead of pasta, add fiber rich foods like lentils, dry beans and vegetables to your diet.

, Complex carbohydrates in vegetables are digested more slowly than the carbohydrates in pizza and bread.


Vegetables also have a lot of water, so they help get rid of excess water weight.
Because vegetables are high in volume but low in calories, eating them will help you feel full faster while consuming less calories overall.

, Not only does dessert usually add extra calories when you are already satisfied and full, the high amounts of sugars and carbohydrates can also lead to bloating.


If you have a craving for something sweet, opt for fruit or a small square of dark chocolate instead. Dark chocolate is good for you!
Avoid places that can trigger your sugar cravings such as your favorite bakery, restaurant, the bakery section of the grocery store, or the candy section of the drugstore.

, When you lead a busy lifestyle, you often end up wolfing down food in your car, at your desk or while standing. This doesn't allow your body to let you know when it's fullWhen you eat slower, you give your brain the time to communicate with your stomach and tell you that it's time to stop eating.
When you feel satisfied with your meal, stop eating.

, In order to lose weight you need to remove calories from your diet responsibly.


A reasonable caloric goal for each day is about 1,200-1,500 in order to steadily lose weight.
Even though you're cutting calories, it is important to make sure that you are still getting the nutrients you need. Cut out foods that don't offer many nutrients (sugary drinks, desserts, and junk food) and make room for fresh vegetables, fruits, and lean meats.
If you cut your calorie intake too severely, your body will go into starvation mode and store more fat.

Opt for whole wheat pasta.,
Measure out portions carefully.,
Cook white pasta al dente.,
Try zucchini pasta.,
Bake spaghetti squash.",How to Eat Pasta Without Gaining Weight1," In general, whole wheat pasta is better for your health and weight. Whole wheat carbs are more filling and provide more vitamins and nutrients your body needs to thrive. To keep your weight in check, always go for whole wheat options.If you're not used to the taste of whole wheat pasta, try gradually transitioning into whole wheat choices. Try eating half whole wheat pasta and half white pasta until you're used to the taste of whole wheat.;
, Pasta is not necessarily bad for you. However, the reason it can be a culprit in weight gain is that the serving for pasta is only half a cup. Eating more than this can pack on the calories and pounds. Use measuring cups when preparing pasta to make sure you don't surpass the recommended serving size.If half a cup does not seem like enough food, you can add things like grilled vegetables and meats to give your dish more substance.

, If you really can't stand whole wheat pasta, it's okay to eat white pasta in small amounts. If you do so, cook your pasta al dente. This means cooking the noodles for a shorter period so they come out a little tougher. This means your body will work harder to process these foods, keeping your blood sugar levels in check. This can prevent you from feeling hungry later and resorting to snacking., You can buy zucchini pasta at the store or find your own recipe online. Zucchini pasta uses zucchini over flour noodles, adding extra nutrients. Swapping out regular pasta for zucchini pasta can create a healthier, lower calorie meal.

, Spaghetti squash is another great alternative. It has a similar consistency to pasta, but it is a healthy vegetable instead of a starch. Cut the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise, and remove the seeds. Bake in the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) for forty minutes or microwave it on high for twelve minutes. Scrape out the innards with a fork before eating."

Hydration is critical.",How to Drop at Least One Dress Size Before Your Wedding1," While the benefits are countless, this is one of the hardest things to implement into your daily routine. Water lowers body fat, flushes cellulite, improves digestion, gets rid of dark circles under the eyes, and makes you feel full. These are just a few of the benefits of drinking the required 2.5 liters/quarts of water per day. Break the amounts down into manageable amounts:


Keep a bottle of water beside your bed. Before you go to sleep drink 1/2 the bottle (Note: this will most likely increase the need to urinate during the night) and as soon as you wake up (before your feet touch the floor) drink the remaining 1/2 bottle.
Before each meal drink a half a bottle of water.

Do cardio exercises.,
Do interval training.,
Do push-ups and lunges.,
Take the stairs.",How to Get Skinny in a Week2," Doing a cardio exercise that gets your heart rate up is the best way to lose calories and shed the pounds. You will want to be consistent and work out every single day if you want to drop the weight in a week.


Choose a cardio exercise like running, swimming, biking or using the elliptical.
To keep yourself motivated, set an alarm for a time to go to the gym or start exercising. This will integrate the exercise into your schedule and remind you to go.
Ask a friend to work out with you. Going to the gym or jogging is easier when you have someone with you to hold you accountable. It also makes exercise more enjoyable.
In order to burn calories faster, you'll want to increase the intensity of your workout. If you're on an elliptical or treadmill, bring up the incline and level of your workout.
Cardio exercises are most effective when they are 40-60 minutes long. Set aside about an hour to work out each day.

, Interval training is the practice of alternating short bursts of intense activity with intervals of less intense activity as you're working out. Interval training helps you to burn more calories as you work out.


Integrate interval training into your existing workout. For example, if you like to jog lightly, insert short bursts of sprinting into your workout. If you use an elliptical, set it up so that every 5-10 minutes, the level of your workout goes up.
Interval training improves cardiovascular fitness and also increases the body's ability to burn fat.

, Doing a few sets of push-ups and lunges every other day will help tone your muscles and make you look skinnier at the end of the week.


If you are going to be wearing something that reveals your upper body (a bikini top or a strapless dress), do more push-ups. They will target your upper body and make your arms and shoulders look more toned.
If you are going to be wearing something that reveals your lower body (shorts or a skirt), doing lunges will firm up your butt, hips and thighs.

, Try to incorporate as much exercise as you can into your daily life so that you can continue burning calories and toning your muscles.


Take away the lazy shortcuts. For example, if you usually take the elevator, start taking the stairs. If you drive to the post office even though it's a block away, walk instead. If the lights are on in the kitchen, get up and turn them off instead of asking somebody else to do it.

Use oil-based sauces and herbs.,
Try plant sauces.,
Alter Alfredo sauce to make it lighter.,
Make healthy choices when eating out.",How to Eat Pasta Without Gaining Weight2," Pasta noodles are often flavored with rich, creamy sauces. Instead of reaching for Alfredo sauce, go for sauces made from oil and herbs. Drizzle some olive oil over your pasta and add sun dried tomatoes. Use a small amount of pesto for flavoring. Even just a few dashes of dried or fresh basil can bring out a great flavor without adding too many calories.Use only a small amount of any sauce you're using. Even healthy sauces, like pestos, can be high calorie due to the olive oil content.

, Plant-based sauces are generally healthier than rich, creamy sauces. Go for tomato-based sauces like marinara sauce. This will cut down on the fat and calorie content of your pasta.

, Many people love pasta with Alfredo sauce. However, Alfredo sauce is high in calories and fat. Thin down Alfredo sauce by using a recipe that calls for white wine instead of cream.You can also make a ""pink"" sauce by mixing one part tomato sauce to one part Alfredo sauce. This will give you a creamy consistency while cutting down on calories.

, Portions are generally bigger in restaurants and sauces and creams may be heavier. Opt for vegetable-based sauces, like tomato sauces, over things like Alfredo sauce and order smaller sizes. Even when you're ordering the smaller sizes, chances are the portions will be bigger than what you would eat at home. Make sure not to eat your entire serving at a restaurant. Take some home for later.You can share with a friend if it's hard to resist eating the full serving. You can also ask that the server bring half of the pasta already boxed up to take home.
Order a salad as an appetizer to cut down on how much pasta you eat at dinner. This will prevent you from eating the entire pasta dish. You can always take the leftovers home to reheat for another meal.

Mix pasta with veggies.,
Add protein to the meal.,
Serve pasta a side dish.,
Be conscientious of what you will consume later.",How to Eat Pasta Without Gaining Weight3," If you're craving your favorite pasta dish, but want to cut down on calories, do half noodles and half veggies. You can still use your favorite sauces and cheeses, but you will cut down on calories and boost nutrition with a serving of vegetables.You can use whatever veggies you want in your pasta. You can place them in raw or heat or steam them before adding them to the noodles.

, Mixing carbs and protein can help your body manage insulin levels, keeping you from feeling fatigued or hungry after a pasta dish. Instead of eating noodles and sauce on their own, add some protein. This will fill you up faster, reducing how much you eat overall, and keep you feeling more satisfied.You can add meats like grilled chicken to pasta dishes. You can also sprinkle cheese over noodles for a protein boost.
If you prefer your pasta plain, try eating pasta with a side of protein. Have some scrambled eggs with your pasta, for example.

, Many people enjoy a big plate of spaghetti for dinner. However, due to its high calorie content, pasta is better suited for a side dish. Instead of making pasta your main meal, have a small serving of pasta as a side to something healthy, like grilled meat and veggies., If you're eating pasta for lunch, skip out on drinks or a large dinner later. While you should never skip meals, it is best to cut back on carbs during the day. Eat things like fruits, vegetables, and proteins over carbohydrates if you'll be indulging later."

Eat 6 meals a day.,
Limit the size of your meal portions (meat, veggies, carbs) to no larger and no thicker than the palm of your hand.

,
Include a protein, a carbohydrate and a vegetable or fruit in each meal.,
Choose one day a week as your reward day and eat whatever you want and as much as you want.",How to Drop at Least One Dress Size Before Your Wedding3," Don’t panic, it’s easier than it sounds. Every 3-4 hours from the time you wake up, eat a little something. Your digestive system is far more efficient at handling a series of small meals than it is at tackling one large meal. For example, you could eat at 7am, 10 am, 1pm, 4pm, 7pm and 10 pm. Limit your mini meals to 250-300 calories per meal.

,, Here is a sample daily meal plan to get you started:

Meal one: Protein shake with 1% milk (whey protein drinks are also good)
Meal two: Half an apple and cottage cheese or yogurt
Meal three: Piece of chicken (no skin) and a small salad
Meal four: Cheese and the balance of the apple
Meal five: Piece of lean meat, rice or potatoes, vegetables
Meal six: Low fat chocolate pudding mixed with protein powder

, Whether you like pasta, cookies, ice cream, or chocolate. Don’t worry, you won’t gain fat if you do this because for the past six days your body has been used to eating ""clean"" food. On the seventh day your body thinks you are going to do the same and when you don't, it gets fooled and eliminates the effects of the ""junk"" food. In essence, you are tricking your body on your reward day but you must eat cleanly on the following day.

Celebrate!",How to Host a Weight Loss Contest," Anywhere between 6 and 8 weeks is the shortest duration you should attempt for a weight loss challenge. Shorter challenges will have the least drastic results in the end, but they can also be the most productive because there’s a slight sense of urgency throughout the competition.Between 8 and 10 weeks is the most commonly used time frame for a weight loss challenge. Give the challenge a catchy name that references the duration of the event, like the “10-Week Lifestyle Reboot” or something else similarly motivating.12 weeks should be the maximum duration for a weight loss challenge. After 12 weeks people may start to lose interest in the competition or drop out because it’s too strenuous.;
, The recommended and safest rate of weight loss is approximately 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) per week.On average, you need to burn 500 to 1,000 calories more than you consume each day, by way of diet and exercise, to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week. This is a realistic goal that everyone can shoot for.


As host of the competition, it will be your responsibility to convey to the participants that ultimately the contest is about health, not weight.
Caution your participants about using extreme measures and unhealthy methods to lose weight, and warn them about the dangers of losing too much weight too quickly. When you host the first meeting, provide literature about healthy weight loss strategies, along with quality information about diet and exercise for safe weight loss.
Emphasize that they should use diet and exercise to lose weight, not starve themselves. State clearly and kindly that you'll have to privately intervene if you notice anyone who starts shedding weight inexplicably fast or starts to look unhealthy during the contest and that it could result in their disqualification.

, Most challenges measure success by pounds lost, and this method will be easiest for you to measure. Providing the data in pounds lost will also more straightforward for the participants. Ultimately, the winner will be determined by calculating the highest percentage of weight loss over the time period of the challenge.


Record each participant’s weight every week, and on the final day of the competition you will get the average of those weekly weigh-ins and subtract that number from the participant’s start weight.
The objective is to reveal who showed the most improvement over the course of the contest, measured by percentage of weight loss.Sometimes weight loss challenges will measure success by body fat percentage instead of pounds lost. Both methods of measurement are effective, but it may be easier to measure body fat percentages accurately if you have a personal trainer or fitness expert involved in the competition.

, Working in teams can be a lot more fun (and effective) for everyone involved. If you decide to do teams, the process will be slightly different. Create small groups of 2 to 6 people, with one of them acting as team captain. Success will be measured by total percentage lost by the group rather than individually.


The weigh-ins will work the same as with individual play, except that the team captain will record everyone's weights and submit them each week.
The captain will also be responsible for making sure everyone in the group makes the weigh-ins and for team support in general.

, Make it something affordable, like $25 or $50 per person. The collected amount can fund the cash prize for the winner and also cover any expenses associated with the competition, such as T-shirts or planning a post-challenge party to celebrate everyone’s success.


If you decide to require an entry fee, task one person with being in charge of the funds throughout the challenge. Keep the money in a secure place, like in a lock box or safe, and make sure that all expenses are well-documented.
Skip the entree fee requirement if you think it will discourage others from participating in the challenge.
If you aren’t sure, send out an email to announce the competition. Get a feel for who is interested in competing and then poll those people about what amount would be fair and affordable to charge as an entry fee.

, Usually the reward is the cash prize generated from the collected entry fees (minus any expenses). You could also offer prizes like laptops, iPads, or gift certificates, if you have that capability.


If you are holding the challenge for colleagues at your place of employment, ask your employer to sponsor the event and provide prizes for the competition.
You’ll need to decide if the winner takes all, or if you plan to have first and second place winners in the competition. A winner-takes-all prize is certainly more of an incentive for the participants, but if you have several generous prizes planned, it would make sense to have first and second place winners.

, Supply someone in management with all of the challenge information and guidelines. Additionally, you should speak with someone in the Human Resources department about the contest. When announced, it should be stressed that participation is completely optional.


Enlist the HR department's help in announcing the contest, as well as monitoring employees for any unsafe or negative behavior. Consider having the HR department speak to everyone as a group about safety. Since crash diets can affect work performance, HR will need to help monitor the staff for any behavioral or performance changes.
If anyone on staff is uncomfortable with the contest because of past (or current) eating disorders, or for any other reason, let the group know when the contest is announced that the employee should speak to the HR department privately about it. If there are any major protests or problems reported, have HR help you shut down the competition.
Wait for the official go-ahead from management and Human Resources before announcing anything about the competition to your colleagues.
Since the challenge will encourage employees to be healthier, find out if your employer would be willing to help cover expenses and provide the cash prize.

, Whether you're setting up the competition for your friends, family, or colleagues, a successful challenge requires active and engaged participants. Establish who you want to recruit and announce the competition via email.


Create fliers, emails, a Facebook group and, if possible, provide a website where people can get more information and sign up to participate.

, Consider calling it a Wellness Competition rather than a Weight Loss Competition, to put the emphasis on health rather than weight loss. Promote the competition with vocabulary and imagery that is health-oriented and not completely weight-focused.

, Along with announcing the competition prizes, try upping the stakes. Have each participating person or team choose their favorite charity or community outreach program and offer to award a portion (or even all) of the prize money to the chosen beneficiary.


If you are organizing the challenge among coworkers, ask if your company will match the donation.

, Recruit local health and wellness professionals to provide informal seminars throughout the challenge on subjects related to fitness, well-being and weight loss.


Invite a local chef to demonstrate healthy cooking and provide recipes.
Visit personal trainers and gyms in your area to see if they would like to offer their services or become involved in the challenge in some way.

, Create well-defined policies for all components of the challenge and provide this information to the participants in document form. Additionally, post the contest rules on the challenge website and make them available through social media. Detail the prizes and any other important information that relates specifically to the contest.


Make sure to include all important dates, the rules for entry, and the procedure for how measurements will be taken.
Don’t forget to include any prohibited activities that could result in disqualification, such as taking weight loss supplements or engaging in unsafe weight-loss strategies.
If you are organizing the competition at work, ask management to sign off on the policies and procedures. Make sure that the Human Resources department reviews all of the information, and enlist their help for monitoring the staff for any red flags.

, Arrange a space for this purpose and have the entire process organized prior to announcing the contest. Taking measurements can be done as simply as using a bathroom scale to record the participants’ weight, or you could plan to have a personal trainer or health professional weigh-in participants and take body fat measurements.


The most accurate way to track weight loss is by setting a routine day and time (preferably in the morning before breakfast) each week to record the measurements.Network with local community experts, such as personal trainers and nutritionists, and offer them the opportunity to make new contacts or give talks in exchange for taking measurements.

, Set this date in stone and establish a deadline for entries, so that the challenge follows a strict and manageable timeline. Announce the meeting time and place for the initial weigh-in and answer any questions about the process.


Reassure the participants that all weight information will be kept confidential.

, Consulting a physician before embarking on a new health routine is a good habit for everyone to get into and setting that standard lends a professional quality to your challenge.


It also emphasizes that good health is more important than any weight that might be lost in a competition.
If you want total peace of mind about the health of your participants, you could even make this a requirement upon entry.

, Have the participants come in to be weighed and record everyone’s starting weight using whatever method you established at the introductory meeting. Use a systematized method, such as a spreadsheet, to record the name and starting weight of each participant.


Make sure that everyone knows the dates and times for the weekly weigh-ins for the remaining duration of the challenge.
If desired, you could photograph each participant at the initial weigh-in and plan to do the same at the final weigh-in. You could then provide your participants with a before and after snapshot to document their success.

, Each week, after everyone has weighed in, send out an encouraging email to all the participants. You can keep the participants updated on who’s in the lead throughout the competition, or simply offer motivation and encouraging words to keep everyone engaged in the challenge.


Additionally, try sending out group emails throughout the duration of the challenge that provide a steady stream of healthy weight-loss tips, recipes, resources and encouragement to your group.

, Create opportunities for the participants to get together periodically during the challenge. This gives everyone a chance to meet face-to-face to support one another and share their weight-loss experiences while also fostering a sense of community among the competitors.


You can also use these mini-events as opportunities to gauge and maintain everyone’s interest and enthusiasm in the challenge.
Mid-challenge events could be almost anything that you think would pique the interest of your participants. Offering a complimentary yoga class, hosting a fun run, and inviting everyone to a healthy pot-luck picnic at your local park are all great examples of motivational events.

, Encourage them to share their personal diet and exercise tips there, as well as their experiences and progress photos. Promote a sense of community rather than focusing solely on the competitive element of the challenge.


If possible, provide a way for the participants to receive feedback and support and frequently share resources like weight loss websites and health forums with the group.

, On the day the competition ends, have everyone come in for their final weigh-in. Hold the meeting first thing in the morning, prior to breakfast, since that’s the best time to gauge everyone’s most accurate weight.Meticulously record everyone’s final weight and plug the numbers into your spreadsheet.


Offer a simple, healthy assortment of breakfast foods for your participants to enjoy after their final weigh-in.
Let everyone know how and when you will be revealing the results of the challenge. You could host an announcement party at lunchtime that day or soon after, so that the participants don’t have to wait too long to hear the news.

, For each participant, calculate the average of their weekly weigh-ins. Subtract that number from each participant’s starting weight, and this will give you a very precise measure of how much progress each person made.

, Gather everyone together and reveal the winner. Provide each participant with individual progress reports that show the data you collected during the competition to highlight their individual successes.


Calculate the total overall weight lost by the group and announce that number, as well, congratulating the group on their collective success.
Thank everyone for their participation and encourage them to continue the healthy habits they’ve established during the challenge.
Send out a group email that details all of this information, so that anyone who couldn’t attend the announcement will know who won. You could send out the progress reports individually via email, as well.

, After the winner is announced, make sure everyone sticks around for a mini-celebration. Cater the event with healthy food options and provide weight-loss literature and resources that the participants can take away with them.


Keep the atmosphere positive and emphasize that everyone was successful, even if only one winner was chosen.

She can diagnose weight problems and help develop a plan for your child to safely lose weight.Your child's pediatrician will also evaluate your child and may order lab or other tests to determine if there is a medical cause for the weight gain or if there are any complications from it.


Make a list of your child’s eating habits, exercise or activity level, and let the doctor know about any medications, limitations, or conditions your child has.
Ask the doctor questions you have about childhood obesity, diet, or exercise.
Talk to the doctor about ways you can support your child’s weight loss. She may suggest meeting with a dietitian and children’s fitness professional to help you find the best and safest ways to support your child.;
, Even if your child doesn’t have special dietary needs, her diet probably needs some adjustment to lose weight and stay healthy. Talk with a registered dietitian about how to help your child lose weight while giving her all of the vitamins and nutrients necessary to maintain her health.Tell the dietitian about what your doctor suggested to help your child lose weight through diet.
Give her information about what your child eats and what types of food preferences your child has. The dietitian may be able to suggest healthy food options that taste good and help your child lose weight.
Ask any questions you have about what your child needs nutritionally as well as any suggestions the dietitian has for helping your child lose weight.
Ask your doctor or local health facility to suggest a registered dietitian., In addition to diet, exercise is often one of the key ways doctors suggest that children lose weight.Beyond active play time, you may want to meet with a certified fitness professional who works with children to either train your child or suggest an exercise program for her.


Look for a trainer who has a youth fitness certification. These types of trainers are better options for your child than those at gyms or fitness centers.Be aware that certified youth fitness professional can help your child exercise and lose weight even if she doesn’t get much activity.
Ask the trainer any questions you might have about how you can get involved in helping her suggestions or doing exercise together with your child.

, Most doctors’ weight loss suggestions are based on your child’s age. For example, the doctor will likely suggest that a child under the age of 12 lose about one pound per month, but a child over the age of 12 may safely lose up to two pounds per week.For a young child who is not severely overweight, the goal might be to stop the child from gaining more weight rather than to help the child lose weight.Figuring out how many calories your child needs to function and lose weight sensibly can help you plan her meals.Calculate the number of calories your child needs per day by consulting information on her age and nutritional needs.For example, an eight year old child needs about 1800 nutrient rich calories per day. For your child to lose weight, you’d need to reduce her food calories slightly and make sure she gets exercise every day of the week.Remember to not be too extreme in limiting calories. Not only can this be unhealthy for your child, but also undermine her self-esteem and progress.
The best thing to do is to meet with a dietitian to determine your child's daily calorie needs for weight loss

, Eating nutritious and regular meals as well as snacks can help your child lose weight. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends giving children nutritious food choices from the five food groups in appropriate portion sizes.Incorporate choices from the five food groups every day. The five food groups are: fruits, vegetables, grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy.Give your child three nutrient packed meals per day that include foods from the five groups. In addition, she should also have two healthy snacks such as low-fat string cheese or apple slices.Following this routine can keep her full and less likely to want junk food.
Use small amounts of sugar, salt, and fats to make your children enjoy their food more., Parents often overestimate how much food their child needs.Follow appropriate serving sizes for your child’s age.Learn suggested portion sizes for your child’s age.For example, a five year can have ¼ cup cooked vegetables and ½ cup salad as part of a meal.Serve smaller portions and limit second helpings to reduce the chance that your child will overeat., Limit the number of unhealthy food choices you have in your home or make available to your child. Foods like cake or cookies and drinks like soda are often loaded with fat and calories.Choose fruits and vegetables and other healthy options when food shopping.Keeping food choices healthy in your house can help your child avoid unhealthy foods.
Look for hidden sugar in your food choices. Read the packaging for terms like corn syrup, sucrose, dextrose, or maltose.Avoid banning sweets entirely to prevent cravings or overindulging.Consider introducing fruit-based snacks and desserts in place of baked goods., While you may be tempted to completely change your child’s diet to help her lose weight, make changes only gradually. Children have sensitive palates and can be resistant to change, so proceeding slowly can help her get used to a healthier diet.


Replace processed foods with healthier options. For example, substitute white rice with brown rice and add more vegetables that your child likes.

, There is evidence that having family meals together can help your child make more nutritious food choices. This can help her lose weight safely.Schedule dinner at the same time every night to help establish a routine.Allow your child to participate in cooking or setting the table. These activities can make mealtimes fun, help her learn about nutrition or food, and get her to make better food choices.Consider limiting how much you dine out, especially at fast-food chains, which can be a trap for unhealthy foods.Help your child make good choices if you go out. For example, your child might like chicken tenders with apple slices instead of fries.

, Exercise and activity can help your child shed excess weight. But beyond burning calories, it builds their bones and muscles, helps them sleep and stay alert during the day., The word “exercise” may scare your child—or you. Having unstructured activity to get your child moving can help her lose weight in the same way that an exercise program does.Be aware that a child needs at least an hour of moderate to vigorous activity a day.
Encourage free playing activities like hide-and-seek, jump rope, or jumping on a small trampoline.
Give your child the option of joining a sports team like your local swim or soccer team.
Try different activities until you find one your child likes. For example, if your child likes art, nature hiking or rock climbing might be a good choice for her.

, You can increase the amount of activity or exercise your child gets by limiting the time she is allowed to sit around the house. Set a specific time or schedule that your child can watch TV, play computer games, or talk on the phone.Remember that your child will need some rest time, especially if she is not feeling well. Allow her some time to “do nothing” to help her settle down and refresh.
Consider allowing your child to do computer games that get her moving.

, Incorporate your whole family into activity time. This can emphasize the importance of activity for the whole family and prevents your child from feeling singled out.Consider making activity a pre-dinner ritual. For example, you could play a game of family touch football and follow it up with a nutritious meal.
Make sure to praise your child for their activity and making healthy food choices.

, Children who need to lose weight may struggle with self-esteem issues and other medical conditions.While your child may occasionally lack motivating or balk at your suggestions or rules, giving your child support without being judgmental or critical can help institute and reinforce healthy habits and build her self-esteem.You can provide support by:


focusing on the health benefits of weight loss over appearance
being sensitive to your child’s feelings
talking to your child about her feelings or needs
praising your child’s efforts whenever you get a chance
focusing on or pointing out positive goals
having patience with her to help prevent eating disorders., It may be difficult for children to understand why they need to lose weight, which may cause them to push back on your suggestions or changes. Talking to them about possible consequences of being overweight, such as health problems or not fitting into clothing, can help them more tangibly focus on the goal of slimming.Use terms that kids can easily understand. For example, you could say, “it’s important to keep moving and watch what you eat. Those extra pounds can make your bones hurt or might make it more difficult to run fast when you’re playing soccer.”Let kids knows that excess weight can affect them now and in the future from everything such as health to their choices in clothing.
Let your child know that losing the weight might prevent any teasing, bullying, or rejection they’re experiencing.

, It may seem like a good idea to tell your child about “bad” foods when changing her eating habits. However, this can be counterproductive and cause her to rebel against you by sneaking the food or overeating it when she is outside of your home.Talk about “healthy choices” and “less healthy choices.” For example, you could say “an apple is a healthier choice than a cookie for your snack.”
Remember that it’s ok to allow your child an occasional treat or less healthy choice.

, A child may simply refuse to get moving and eat healthier choices. Give her different reasons to lose extra weight without promising sweets or food treats.Promise to do an activity with your child that she wanted to do if she makes healthy choices for a week.If she’s hungry enough, she’ll likely eat it.For example, she might want to go to a local water park. Take her as a reward for eating well and being active.
Buy her a small gift for meeting goals. For example, she might like a new dress or had her eye on some shoes. Surprise her with one of these for losing a pound in a month.
Try and avoid promising her sweets or treats as a reward. Save these for very special occasions.If she’s hungry enough, she’ll likely eat it., There is evidence that families with similar eating habits enjoy the same types of health. Consider your child’s palate when cooking, but don’t make her any separate meals to appease her.Realize that it is ok if your child skips a meal or if she refuses to eat. If she’s hungry enough, she’ll likely eat her meal.

Shed water weight.",How to Drop a Dress Size in a Week," A popular saying that has shown up in many news releases is “you can’t outrun a bad diet.” Scientists have discovered that what you eat has more of an effect on your weight and overall health than caloric restriction and exercise.A diet of lean proteins and vegetables is your best friend, particularly when you’re trying to jumpstart your weight loss.


Eat as many whole foods — for example, raw fruits and veggies, chicken, raw almonds, and rice — as possible.
When you do buy processed foods, look at the nutritional value to ensure that the products are low in sugar, saturated fat and salt, and high in fibre, protein, vitamins and minerals.;
, Consider following this sample diet and variations on it each day for a week. When preparing your meals do not use any sodium. In addition, be sure to drink only water and unsweetened, clear tea!


Breakfast — 1/2 pear, 1/2-cup wild blueberries, coconut milk, hemp heart and flax seed smoothie, plus one rye cracker with almond butter.
Lunch — carrot soup (no sodium) made with carrots, zucchini, fresh ginger, turmeric, onion powder, poultry seasoning, and pepper, plus a fresh greens salad with shredded carrots and beets, topped with pumpkin seeds and a garlic-extra-virgin-olive-oil dressing.
Dinner — kale and red onions fried in extra virgin olive oil, topped with a coconut-milk-tumeric-curry-powder sauce, plus a salad of shredded carrots and beets topped with sunflower seeds, plus one baked 4-oz. chicken breast.
Snack (if needed) — one apple, or 1/2 an apple plus 10 raw almonds, or one pear, or 1/2 a pear plus 10 raw almonds.

, Your body burns more calories digesting protein than when it digests fat and carbs. Try replacing carbs with lean proteins such as lean beef, turkey, fish, chicken (white meat), tofu, nuts, beans, eggs, and low-fat dairy., Contrary to popular belief, carbs are not evil, and can be part of a healthy diet; however, low-carb diets have been proven to help with weight loss, so if you’re trying to lose weight quickly, you’ll want to limit your carb intake.If you do choose to continue eating carbs, stick with whole, unprocessed sources of carbs such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and beans.These are a wonderful source of fibre, which is another great weight-loss tool.

, Depending on your age, you mustn’t consume more than 1,500 to (if you’re 51+) 2,300 mg of sodium per day. Too much sodium can cause high blood pressure (leading to heart disease and stroke).It can also cause you to retain water, and look physically larger than you are.

, Researchers have found that getting enough fibre is key to a healthy diet and can help in weight loss. Aim for at least 30 g of fibre each day., Spicy foods contain natural chemicals that can increase your metabolism. Add a tablespoon of chopped red or green chilli peppers to your meals, or even add some chilli flakes. Try adding some cayenne to a home-made soup., Studies have shown that drinking between 375 ml (for women) and 500 ml (for men) of water day before each meal can help you feel more full and result in eating less.If you don’t already drink enough water, you’ll find that it can really help you drop a few pounds quickly.


To figure out how much water you should drink each day, divide your body weight in half: that’s how many ounces you s should drink per day. Example: a 150-pound woman should drink 75 ounces per day of water.
Not drinking enough water can slow your metabolism. Drinking at least 8 glasses of water per day will help keep you burning calories — you’ll burn more than you would if you drank less than 8 glasses per day. Try drinking a glass of water with each snack.Be careful not to drink too much water though, as this can lead to serious health problems., Taken in moderation, these drinks can help boost your energy and your metabolism. You must drink them clear, though — no milk or sugar! And don’t go overboard, as too much caffeine can cause health problems. Aim for 2 to 4 cups of green or oolong tea per day, or 1 to 4 cups of coffee per day, depending on how much caffeine your coffee contains.


A cup of coffee can contain anywhere from 50 mg to 300 mg of caffeine. Limit yourself to 400 mg of caffeine at most per day, unless you’re an adolescent, in which case the maximum drops to 100 mg per day.Be careful that caffeine doesn’t interact with any medications you’re on. If you’re taking weight-loss pills that contain caffeine, you’ll need to be very careful not to exceed 400 mg per day.
Effects of too much caffeine include insomnia, nervousness, restlessness, irritability, stomach upset, fast heartbeat, muscle tremors., Your daily caloric needs depend on your age, gender, height, activity level, and current weight. To lose weight you need to burn more than you consume.


A woman aged 19-30 who is sedentary (with only minimal physical activity each day) should consume anywhere from 1,550 to 1,800 calories per day to maintain her weight, and should restrict herself to between 1,000 and 1,250 calories per day to lose weight.A man aged 19-30 who is sedentary should consume anywhere from 2,050 to 2,200 calories per day to maintain his weight, and should restrict himself to between 1,250 and 1,650 calories per day to lose weight., When you severely restrict calories, your body can begin to think that it’s starving, and it will then hold on to everything you eat — meaning you can actually gain weight. What you eat is really more important than how much you eat. Eating whole foods will help you feel more satisfied with less calories; in addition, pay attention to how you feel while you eat, and stop when you’re satisfied — not full. , Eating two to three large meals per day, with hours in between, will cause your metabolism to slow between meals. By eating a small meal or snack every 3 to 4 hours, you keep your metabolism more steady and will burn more calories over the course of the day., Aim to eat at least 2/3rds of your day’s calories before dinner.Try eating your lightest meal at dinner — for example, a soup and salad with no heavy meat proteins or grains. Eating lighter at night might even help you sleep better — another important aspect of losing weight (being well rested).

, There is little evidence to show that eating at night can actually cause weight gain, but what it can do is cause indigestion as you lie down so soon after eating, or insomnia if you eat something like chocolate, for example.


Science still shows that the calories in/calories out rule applies, and as long as your nighttime snack is part of your caloric intake planned for the day, you should be fine; the problems arise when you don’t snack healthfully before bed, and when it leads to problems sleeping., Often when we feel hungry, we’re actually thirsty. If you’re feeling hungry, try drinking a large glass of water to see if that satisfies you. If after 20 minutes you’re still not feeling satisfied, chances are, you’re hungry!

, It takes roughly 20 minutes for your brain to tell your stomach “I’m full.”If you speed through a large meal in 10 minutes, it’s likely you’ve eaten much more than you actually needed to in order to feel satisfied. Slow down and take time enjoy what you eat. You may find it helpful to set a timer for 20 to 30 minutes to ensure that you don’t eat too quickly.


Some people find it useful to give themselves 2 to 3 minutes between bites.

, Depending on your health and physical abilities, this could be anything from a walk to a run or swim, to going to the gym and lifting weights. The key for weight loss is to get your heart rate up to between 75% and 85% of your maximum heart rate., Increasing your muscle mass will boost your resting metabolism, meaning that you will burn more calories even when sedentary.Lift weights, do yoga, or take up pilates. Any type of strength training will build muscle and help you lose weight.Be sure to give yourself at least a day off between weight-training sessions so that your muscles have time to rest repair themselves.

, High-intensity exercise will keep you burning more calories, longer, than low to moderate intensity workouts. Aim for an intense aerobics class or bursts of jogging or running during your walks., Beyond exercising and building muscle, you can boost your weight loss by simply moving around more every day.


Walk around when you’re talking to a friend on the phone.
Lift weights while watching TV.
Go for a walk with a friend instead of sitting and having a drink.

, Body wraps can temporarily help you shed a pound or two of water weight, resulting in you looking slightly thinner for a short period of time. Note that the results are only temporary, though, and may only last a day or two.Body wraps are commonly offered at spas. Do an online search for reputable, well-reviewed spas near you to see what’s available.
Be sure to ask your spa about the ingredients in the body wrap before-hand. If you have any health conditions and/or are taking medications, consult with your doctor to ensure that none of the ingredients in the body wrap will cause problems for you.If you have sensitive skin, you’re better off using a clay wrap than a wrap with fragrant oils., Fasting involves abstaining from some or all kinds of food and drink; it can help you temporarily lose a few pounds, but generally the weight will come back on once you start eating again. Fasting for a few days won’t hurt most healthy people, as long as they stay hydrated. Fasting for longer periods of time, however, is dangerous.A water fast would be to only drink water for a set period of time — not eating or drinking anything else.
Another type of fast is to only consume liquids — generally fresh fruit and vegetable juices, and broths.
Yet another type of fast is to consume mostly liquids, with one light meal each day — usually comprising vegetables, whole grains, and maybe lean protein.Don’t fast if you have diabetes; it can lead to dangerous drops and rises in blood sugar. You should also not fast if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you suffer from any chronic health conditions. If you’re unsure about whether you can safely fast, ask your doctor., Shapewear is a word for undergarments made from rigid yet flexible fabrics that are specifically designed to smooth out our trouble zones — flattening the stomach and love handles, pulling in the thighs, and lifting the bum. You can purchase shapewear at most department stores, in the section where you would buy underwear.


Corsets can also pull you in at the stomach and waist and help you look much trimmer.
Note that shapewear and corsets — or any extra-tight-fitting clothing — can cause health issues if worn over a prolonged period of time. Health risks include meralgia paresthetica (painful burning and tingling in the thighs); digestion issues, including acid reflux; and an increased risk of blood clots in people who have circulation problems., Your body is capable of retaining up to 5 pounds of water each day.Lowering your sodium intake, increasing your fibre intake, exercising, having your body wrapped, and — perhaps counterintuitively — drinking more water, can all help with shedding water weight.


If you are a woman, you’ll likely retain more water when you're menstruating. If you know that you’ll be menstruating during a trip or special day where you want to look your thinnest, you might consider extending your birth control pill if you take the pill (this can postpone your period). If you’re not on the pill, battle water retention by consuming lots of fibre and water, and avoiding sodium.

Manage stress.",How to Burn 20 Pounds Fast," One of the primary keys to losing weight quickly is to control what you eat. Decreasing your intake either by controlling portion sizes or counting calories works well for quick weight loss.Portion control is sometimes the only thing you can control. If you're eating out or subjected to meals controlled by someone else, portions are the one thing you can control every time.
Estimate your calorie intake and usage. Pay attention to what you eat and drink throughout the day, and note amounts of each item as best you can. This can show you how much you currently eat and how many calories you can cut out of your diet safely.
To speed up the process, you can try cutting your calories to the lowest amount of calories that's considered safe for most people — 1200 calories daily.However, this amount may change based on your activity level, gender, and weight.
It's wise to discuss this amount with your doctor to make sure 1200 calories is safe and appropriate for you.
If you cut out about 500 calories daily that generally leads to about one to two pounds of weight loss per week.Consuming less than 1200 calories daily can put you at risk for nutrient deficiencies and may result in slower weight loss over time.;
, Having a set meal plan can help keep you on track. In addition, it can help keep you on track since you'll know exactly what all your meals and snacks are.Spend some time coming up with a meal plan for the week. Be sure to include all meals and snacks you plan on eating throughout the day.
You can use online calorie calculators to find out the typical number of calories for foods or meals that you want to include on your diet. Double checking this can help make sure you stay within your calorie limit.

, Studies have shown that low-carb diets result in quicker weight loss compared to low-fat diets or very low-calorie diets.Limit your carbohydrate intake to help reach your desired weight loss goal quickly.


Carbohydrates are found in a variety of foods including: grains, fruits, starchy vegetables, legumes and dairy products.
Low carb diets may have some initial side effects. They are not dangerous or unsafe, but may make you feel a little off. Typically, you may experience headaches, hunger, crankiness or fatigue.There are a variety of commercial low carb diet plans that are based on different levels of carbohydrates. Find a program that's most appropriate for you if you don't want to design one for yourself.

, When you're limiting carbohydrates in your meals and snacks, you'll need to focus on lean protein, vegetables and fruit. This diet pattern will help keep you satisfied and support quick weight loss.You'll also want to incorporate healthy fats into your diet.


Choose lean protein foods at each meal like: pork, eggs, poultry, seafood, lean beef, legumes, nuts and tofu.
Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables daily. Include one to two servings at each meal. Although fruits and some starchy vegetables do contain carbohydrates, they offer you a wide variety of essential nutrients like fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. These are appropriate to include even on a low-carb diet.
Healthy fats include avocado, nuts, seeds, olives, olive oil, and coconut oil.
Examples of meals include: cottage cheese and fruit; lettuce wraps with deli meat and cheese, plus a handful of raw vegetables; kale salad with grilled salmon; or grilled pork tenderloin and mixed vegetables.

, These types of foods are typically higher in calories and can slow or stop your weight loss. In addition, they are also typically lower in essential nutrients like vitamins or minerals.If you're interested in losing 20 pounds quickly, you'll need to cut out completely or severely limit extra snacks or treats.
Limit foods like: sweets or desserts, chips, crackers, sodas, sweetened coffee drinks or sweetened tea, and pretzels.
Also avoid alcoholic beverages. These do not provide any nutritional value and are only extra calories.
Even if you fit these types of foods into your calorie limit, you may be missing out on key nutrients from other, more healthy foods (like protein, fruits or vegetables). Saving up calories for sweet treats that are lacking in nutrition may slow weight loss.

, The best way to lose weight quickly is a calorie controlled diet and exercise. You will need to participate in a fairly intense exercise regimen to burn a significant amount of calories to help you lose 20 pounds quickly.


Vigorous exercise is any activity that significantly raises your heart rate and breathing pace. You shouldn't be able to say more than one or two words at a time without taking a breath.On the perceived exertion scale you should be around a seven or eight out of ten. Level one is sitting and ten is the most intense exercise you could perform.
Set aside about an hour every day. Plan to be active for an hour most days, even if some activities are less strenuous than others.
Moderate intensity activity will also burn calories and support weight loss. However, vigorous intensity activity burns more calories and may help you reach your weight loss goal quicker.Prior to starting any exercise routine, it's important to meet with your doctor to make sure exercise is safe and appropriate for you.

, You should aim for a minimum of 150 minutes of cardio weekly. However, it's recommended to get up to 300 minutes or five hours weekly for increased weight loss.Common cardiovascular exercises include running or jogging, swimming laps, dancing, cycling, and certain martial arts. These activities burn differing numbers of calories per hour, but all of them are effective.

, Strength training is a healthy and highly effective type of exercise for weight loss. It will help increase lean muscle mass, which over time, can increase your body's natural ability to burn calories.Weight training is invaluable for any weight loss program, because stronger muscles require more energy to operate, which means that they burn more calories.Include about two days of strength training for at least 20 minutes a session.Exercises include: weight lifting, weight lifting classes, body weight exercises and pilates.

, Taking a break from exercising is a crucial part of a workout schedule. Continually working out, especially at vigorous intensities, is a lot of work and stress on your joints, muscles and body.Rest days help your body recover and can help prevent injury.
Stick to rest days just as religiously as you stick to your workouts.
Rest days should still be active. That means staying off the couch and participating in light, low-impact, low-intensity activities. These can include: restorative yoga, light walking, or a leisurely bike ride.

, Tracking all your foods and meals will not only help you stay on track, but can be motivating to you as well.Seeing how well you've done and well you've stuck to your diet plan is exciting.


Many of us believe we are eating less than we really are. Food journaling is a fool-proof way to ensure that you are holding yourself accountable.
Grab a notebook or download a diary app to your smart phone. Jot down notes about your meals (including calorie intake), exercise, and other measures you're keeping track of.
You can also use your journal as a diary. Taking note of how your diet is making you feel, writing about difficult days, etc.

, Write down your goal and leave it somewhere you can easily check it again. Underneath your goal, keep a weekly log of how many pounds you've lost or how many inches you've lost.


When you feel like giving up, read over your goal and the progress you've already made. This may be the motivation you need to keep yourself going.
Keeping track of your weight can also provide you with some insight into how well your diet is working or if it's not working. You'll be able to discern when it's time to make a change., Post sticky notes or taped scraps of paper wherever you will see them often: the bathroom mirror, the refrigerator, even the steering wheel of your car. Write short motivational phrases and reminders on them. They'll give you a bit of a boost throughout the day.


Little positive sayings can help you remember your goal, keep you focused, and help you stay on track., This is especially useful in helping to maintain your exercise schedule.If you have an exercise partner, you have a reason beyond yourself to show up to every session on time.


He or she can give you a boost of enthusiasm when you're not feeling up to your workout.
Your partner can also lend a good ear when you're feeling down or unmotivated with your diet or progress.

, Stress can make it hard to stay on a diet or exercise plan. Managing stress can help you stay motivated and feel energized throughout your diet program.


Extra stress can slow weight loss and even promote weight gain.Getting it under control can help support quicker weight loss.
It's important to find activities to help calm and relax you. Try chatting with friends, going for a walk, listening to music or reading a good book."

While some of this weight is actual body mass, a lot of it is excess water. Once your body has rid itself of this excess water, it is normal for the rate of weight loss to slow down significantly.Track your progress and ask yourself: has my weight loss really stopped, or just slowed?
Experts agree that an ideal rate for safe, lasting weight loss is one to two pounds per week, so perhaps your plateau isn't a plateau after all!;
, Maybe you were very diligent about counting calories at the beginning, or maybe you were able to lose weight initially without monitoring your food intake that closely. In either case, you may be consuming more calories that you realize, and carefully tracking your intake using a food diary or one of the many free calorie counter websites and apps can help you identify exactly how much you are eating and when.Once you have a good handle on what you are consuming, you can start to look for problem areas and make adjustments
If you have been very active, it's also possible you haven't been eating enough calories. If you are working out, your body will require more food. If you restrict yourself thinking that you will lose weight faster, you will actually cause your body to hold on to the weight you currently hold.

, As your body gets smaller, it will burn fewer calories and you will need to eat less and less to maintain the calorie deficit that leads to weight loss. If you have not done so lately, enter your weight and activity level into a calorie counter to get an up-to-date number for the number of calories you need.Most experts recommend a calorie deficit of 500 calories a day to achieve gradual, lasting weight loss.If the calculator tells you that you require 2200 calories per day, you should try to consume around 1700 calories per day to lose a pound per week.

, Have you been exercising consistently? Do you do the same kind of workout every day? Are you doing any kind of resistance training? Lastly, are you relying on the calorie counter on the elliptical machine at the gym to tell you how many calories you actually burned? Think about ways you can change up or improve your exercise routine. Finally, know that the calorie counters on gym machines can be highly unreliable, so if you've been using them to budget your calories, you may have been led astray.Elliptical machines are the worst offenders for over-estimating caloric burn. Track the amount of time you work out and the intensity, and use an online exercise calculator to get a better idea of how many calories you actually burned.
Your body can get used to doing the same activities if you don't change up your workout routine from time to time. If you try something new, you may be engaging different muscles and burning calories in a new way that your body isn't used to, causing you to lose weight.

, The number on your scale may not be budging, but there may be other evidence that your body is still changing for the better. Do your clothes fit better? Are your arms bulking up? If you are putting on new muscle, your body will shrink even as the number on the scale stays the same. Better yet, that new muscle will burn more calories than fat, so your weight loss will probably pick up again soon.


Don't weigh yourself too often. Weight fluctuates due to a variety of factors and it can be misleading. Once a week is more than enough. Try to keep your weigh in around the same day and time each week.
Be patient and remember that not all plateaus are created equal. If you are making progress in other areas, you may just need to wait another week for the number on the scale to start falling again.

, If you've analyzed all the possibilities and tried everything, but still can't get your weight loss back on track, schedule an appointment with your doctor. She might have some additional ideas for you, and can also order blood work to check for a hormone imbalance. You may be suffering from an undiagnosed disorder such as thyroid disease, insulin resistance, or polycystic ovary disease that is preventing you from losing weight., When you do the same kind of exercise over and over, your body gets more efficient at that exercise and may start burning less calories to get it done. Mix things up and add some variety to your routine, and you are likely to see an improvement.Add some interval training to your normal walking or jogging program for a huge caloric boost.
Try a new kind of fitness class or activity.
There are hundreds of free fitness videos available on YouTube and other sites like Fitness Blender. You could try a new kind of workout every single day!
Meet with a personal trainer to get new ideas and create a routine that will optimize your weight loss.

, Adding muscle mass increases the number of calories you burn every day and makes weight loss easier. Add some strength or resistance training to your routine to get that scale moving again.Strength training doesn't require an expensive gym membership. You can get started with some inexpensive lightweight dumbbells and go from there.To avoid putting on a lot of muscle bulk, focus on lots of reps using smaller weights.
Women often worry about lifting weights and becoming too ""bulky,"" but unless they are actively trying to gain muscle, this won't happen. Women will gain muscle by lifting, but they won't bulk up because they have lower levels of testosterone.
There are also many great strength-building exercises you can do with no equipment whatsoever! These include pushups, squats, step-ups, and dozens more., It's easy to fall into the habit of eating the same food day after day, which can lead to boredom and overeating, and may train your body to become too efficient at digesting certain foods. Shaking up your diet might be just the thing to get past your weight-loss plateau.Try adding some new foods to your routine, especially fruits and vegetables.
Change your eating schedule around. Try making breakfast your largest meal of the day, or breaking up 3 large meals into 6 smaller ones.
Eating throughout the day keeps your metabolism going.
Switch out the plates: instead of dishing out your salad on a small plate, and your entrée on a large one, do the opposite!
Try eating something with casein protein before bed (like cottage cheese). It takes a long time for your body to digest this type of protein, causing your metabolism to work even while you sleep.

, Numerous studies have shown that a protein-rich diet can help dieters lose more weight by improving satiety (the feeling of fullness) throughout the day, and increasing muscle mass. Adjust your diet to include more protein, and try to space your protein intake out throughout the day.If you increase your protein intake, be sure to decrease your intake of carbohydrates and/or fats to make up for it. Weight loss still requires a calorie deficit, regardless of what kind of calories you are consuming.

, If you typically skip breakfast, or only eat a light meal in the morning, shifting more of your calories to the A.M. can help you lose more weight. A breakfast rich in protein has been shown to be especially beneficial for those wishing to lose weight.Start your day with some scrambled eggs, or a protein shake.
Try a protein-enriched cereal for an easy and convenient breakfast treat.
Never skip breakfast. The worst breakfast that you can have is no breakfast.

, Not getting enough sleep taxes your body, slows your metabolism, and makes you more likely to overeat during the day. If you wake up feeling tired and sluggish, try going to bed an hour earlier for a week. Not only are you likely to feel better in general, the number on that scale will likely start dropping again., Sometimes your body just needs a break, and many fitness experts recommend taking time off from a calorie-restricted diet as a way to get past a diet plateau. The goal is not to go bananas and eat everything in sight, but simply to return your caloric intake to the base level needed for maintenance, 1800 to 2400 calories per day for most people, for three days. When you resume your regular diet, you should see a noticeable improvement right away."

Ask yourself if you are willing to deal with ""carb flu.""",How to Decide Whether to Go Paleo1," While you can eat meat and healthy fats on paleo, many other foods are not allowed on the diet, such as legumes, whole grains, and dairy. These foods provide valuable nutrients, so it may not be wise to eliminate them.Dairy can help to maintain bone integrity. It may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and high blood pressure.


Eating no dairy also significantly lowers your source of calcium.
Many people find that having strict “cannot eat” lists can be too difficult to follow. Determine if you can sustain yourself on such a strict “allowed” and “not allowed” list.;
, You may need to think about whether or not paleo is a good choice for you due to your medical conditions. Many people who are lactose intolerant, have celiac disease, or have food allergies may benefit from a paleo diet.


If you don't have any food allergies or sensitivities, decide if any other medical condition, such as diabetes, may be improved by going paleo.
Make sure that you discuss a paleo diet with your doctor first.

, The paleo diet takes a lot of prep time and planning. Since you make most of your meals at home, you have to take the time to do meal prep on weekends or in the evenings. Then you have to cook the meals. While you can precook a lot of lunches, dinners, or breakfasts, it still takes time to cook these meals.Many recipe websites and cookbooks offer easy paleo recipes and quick tips to help you find the time to cook with the paleo lifestyle even if you are busy.

, If you are single and live alone, you only have yourself to think about. However, if you have a spouse, partner, or children, paleo may be a lot more difficult for you. Decide if switching to paleo will be a family-wide lifestyle change, or if you will be the only person doing it.If you have children, make sure to discuss the diet with your child’s pediatrician first. Calcium is important for your child’s developing body and it may be harder for your child to get this vital nutrient on a paleo diet.
If you want to do paleo but your family doesn’t, you should think about how you will prepare two different meals - one for you and one for your family. This also requires buying many different ingredients in the grocery store.
Many paleo recipe blogs, websites, and cookbooks have family-friendly and kid-friendly paleo recipes if you want your whole family to make the change.

, There will come a time when you will go out to eat. It may be vacation, with friends, or for a work function. Even though you may think a salad and a piece of grilled meat is the answer, these are not guaranteed to be paleo.For example, you have to consider what ingredients are in any dressings or sauces in a dish. You must also think about toppings, such as dried fruit or nuts. Does the dried fruit have added sugars? Do the nuts have processed toppings or salt? Is the meat grass-fed? What kind of oil is the food cooked in?
Some people use special occasions when they go out as “cheat days.” This may be a method you can use as long as you are not “cheating” often.
Many paleo blogs, websites, and books have suggestions on how to dine out while paleo, and what to do when you are on vacation or not in control of your food.

, For some people, the first few weeks to a month of paleo leaves you feeling bad, which is called ""carb flu"" or ketosis. This is considered a detox period, where your body gets all the unhealthy toxins from grains, legumes, and additives out of your body.Not everyone gets ""carb flu,"" but it can be a frustrating time when first starting paleo.


""Carb flu"" can include headaches, fatigue, mood swings, stomach upsets, flu-like symptoms, foggy brain, and dizziness.
Paleo supporters say ""carb flu"" will go away after three to four weeks, and afterwards you will feel great.

Try sautéing foods or stir-frying foods in a nonstick skillet to help cut down on the need for oils while cooking.


Sautéing and stir-frying are quick cooking methods. When used with a nonstick skillet, you need very minimal amounts of added fats to cook the foods thoroughly or prevent them from sticking.If you want foods to cook more quickly, you can add a little water or broth to help speed up the cooking process. Neither of these adds extra calories.
Some nonstick cooking sprays can damage the surface of some nonstick skillets. Instead of using these sprays, use olive oil or canola spray instead. This provides a very thin coating of fat that helps prevent sticking without adding a ton of calories.;
, If you're looking for a low-calorie cooking method that imparts great flavor to foods, consider baking or roasting. This high temperature method makes leaner foods or lower calorie foods taste great.Roasting and baking use the dry heat of the oven to cook foods thoroughly. Specifically, this high heat helps caramelize foods on the outside creating a golden brown crust.
This caramelization not only provides a crispy crust, it also helps bring out a lot of the natural sweet or nutty flavors of foods.
Roasting and baking need very little added fat to cook. You can use just a little drizzle of oil over a large tray of vegetables or protein and still have everything cook evenly and thoroughly.

, Another way to prepare vegetables without adding a lot of extra calories is by steaming them. Once steamed you can flavor and season as desired.


Steaming is naturally a no-calorie cooking method. This cooking method uses the steam that's made after boiling water. You're not adding fats or seasonings and you're not submerging the food in any type of liquid.Although steamed vegetables are great, you can also steam foods like fish, shellfish and other proteins.
After you've steamed your foods to the desired doneness you can then add a small drizzle of olive oil or lemon juice or toss with your favorite spice blend.

, Like roasting, grilling is another very flavorful cooking method that doesn't require a lot of added fat or calories. You can use both indoor and outdoor grills for this low-calorie cooking method.


When you grill foods, you expose them to the direct heat of the grill. This sears the outside of the food leaving a crispy, dark golden crust. These charred parts of grilled food are immensely flavorful.Grilling is a great low-calorie cooking method because it requires very little added fat. In addition, fat that has been added to foods (for example, from a marinade) or fat found in the food (as the fat in a steak) drips through the grill grates instead of coating the outside of the food.
Many types of foods do well on the grill. You can cook protein foods (like chicken, steak or seafood), vegetables and even fruit.

, A crockpot or slow cooker will make meat very tender. Again, you control the ingredients, so you can leave out any added fats and choose only lean proteins. Use a crockpot to make soups and stews with tons of vegetables that will fill you up and be packed with nutrients., Microwaving as a cooking method can occasionally get a bad rap; however, it's actually a really great quick cooking method that requires little to no added fat.If you think about it, microwaving is essential steaming foods. It heats and cooks foods by activating the water molecules present in the food itself.
One of the benefits of microwaving foods, especially vegetables, is that this cooking method helps vegetables to retain their color and many of their nutrients.
Depending on the type and power of your microwave, you can also cook protein foods like chicken or fish.

, When you're trying to follow lower calorie cooking ideas at home, you need to make sure the ingredients you're choosing to use are also lower in calories.


Protein foods are something that should be included in each meal. They're essential to your overall health and can help keep you satisfied longer.Some protein sources are higher in fat which makes them higher in calories. Items like fatty cuts of beef, poultry with the skin and full-fat dairy are higher than their leaner counterparts.
Instead choose lower calorie protein sources that are also lean like: poultry without skin, lean beef, pork, seafood, legumes and tofu.
To keep overall calories lower from even lean sources of protein, measure out appropriate portion sizes. Stick to 3 – 4 oz or 1/2 cup of protein per serving., A simple trick to keep meals at home lower in calorie is by making half of your plate vegetables and fruit. Include more of these foods in your meals when you're cooking from home.


Both fruits and vegetables are naturally low in calories. They're also high in a variety of nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals.
When you make half of your plate consist of vegetables and fruit you're automatically making half of your meal lower in calories.Although all fruits and vegetables are lower calorie, some are lower than others. For example, a starchy vegetable like corn is higher in calories than dark greens. Instead of starchy vegetables, focus on leafy vegetables, and non-starchy vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers, onions, and peppers.
Like lean protein, you need to measure portions to keep calories of these nutrient-dense foods low. Measure out 1/2 cup of fruit, 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of leafy greens., Dairy products fall under the protein category. However, this group contains a wide variety of foods that can potentially be higher in calories. Make sure to choose lower fat and lower calorie dairy products.


Dairy products include foods like milk, cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese, butter and sour cream. Many dairy products are high in fat which automatically makes them higher in calories as well.When you're eating or cooking with dairy products, try to stay away from the full-fat versions (like whole milk). Stick to fat-free (skim) or low-fat (1 or 2%) dairy products.
Also measure the appropriate portion sizes. For milk and yogurt your portion should be around 8 oz. For cheese measure out 1 – 2 oz per serving., Many people serve a grain as a side dish when they're cooking at home. Choose wisely when serving grains to keep your overall homemade meal healthy, and choose grains that are minimally processed. This retains the full nutrient value.


It's always ideal to choose 100% whole grains over refined grains. Whole grains are not as processed and are typically higher in fiber, protein and other nutrients.Note that regardless of whether you choose refined or whole grains, they are almost identical in their calorie content. 1 cup of brown rice and 1 cup of white rice are both about 200 calories.Since both refined and whole grains are similar in calories, you want to always measure your portion size of these foods. You should stick to 1/2 cup of cooked grains or 2 oz of grains., Whether you're using ketchup, salad dressing or mayonnaise, condiments can rack up calories pretty quickly. Be mindful of how much you use when you're cooking at home.condiments


Some condiments are overly high in calories. Try to limit or avoid using items like: full-fat mayonnaise, full-fat sour cream, full-fat dressings, honey mustard sauce or BBQ sauce.
Instead, try to stick to lower calorie condiments like: salsa, soy sauce, horseradish, low-sugar ketchup, and low-fat sour cream and salad dressings and mustard.
Sauces, marinades and dressings can also get quite high in calories. Always read the label and figure out what the serving size is and make sure you measure it out appropriately.
If you can choose reduced calorie versions of your favorite items. For example, use light ranch dressing instead of the full-fat or light sour cream instead of the full-fat. Or opt to make your own vinaigrette at home. Many store bought versions include more sugar which makes them higher in calories overall.

, One specific group of dressings, sauces and toppings that are commonly overly high in calories are creamy based items. Whether it's sour cream or Alfredo sauce, be mindful when cooking or using these at home.


Creamy sauces, dressings or toppings are typically very high in fat which also makes them high in calories. This is from being made with cream, butter or whole milk.When you're recreating these items for your home cooked meal, limit the portion size that you use and also choose lower calorie choices.
For example, instead of cream-based sauces or dips, make your own at home using fat-free cottage cheese, yogurt or fat-free ricotta cheese. You can make blue cheese dressing with greek yogurt or sub greek yogurt in the place of sour cream on tacos.

, One of the places where homemade cooking can get high in calories is when you're using fats (like oil), sauces or condiments. Always measure the portion sizes of these items to make sure homemade meals stay low-calorie.


Fats are the most calorie-dense food. Regardless of what type of fat you use, they all have a relatively the same amount of calories since they are pure fat. One tablespoon of olive oil has the same amount of calories as 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.
When cooking, consider using a spray version of olive oil or canola. They're all natural, flavorful and can provide a very thin coating of fat. It's significantly fewer calories than pouring oil into a pan or pot.
If you need to use more oil or butter always measure your portions. Fats typically should be kept to a one tablespoon serving or less.""Diet"" fats or oils are something that you should limit. Margarine and low-calorie butters are more processed. They contain fewer calories than their regular, unprocessed counterparts, but not by much. It's better to use a portion controlled serving of unprocessed oil or butter.

Ask yourself why you want to diet.,
Bulk up.,
Verify that you can diet safely.,
Analyze your current eating habits.,
Identify problem areas.",How to Diet1," Being clear about your reasons and your goals can help you choose an eating plan that makes sense and pays off for you in the way that you hope it will.


Manage diabetes. If you've been diagnosed with diabetes, changing your eating habits is a must. Reducing or eliminating sugar from your diet is key to living well with this disease.
Reduce your risk of heart disease. Eating foods that will bring down your cholesterol levels and help rid you of excess belly fat can decrease your risk for heart disease.
Drop that baby weight. Putting on extra pounds is part of any pregnancy, but at a certain point you may decide that baby fat looks best on your baby and be ready to get back to your pre-pregnancy weight.
Get ready for swim suit season. Lots of folks go into diet mode when the weather warms up and the prospect of putting on a swim suit is downright frightening. Sometimes just small changes in your diet can make the difference between being bikini-ready or swim-trunk-terrified.;
, You might be interested in adding muscle and putting on some extra weight in a way that's healthy. Protein is integral in developing muscle mass, so your diet should focus on maximizing the daily amount of recommended protein.

, Before you take on any new eating plan, it's best to consult with a physician to make sure a diet won't prove dangerous for you.


Let your physician know your plan for dieting. Anything under 1200 calories a day can be dangerous. Michelle May, a weight management doctor says, “Rapid weight loss by critical calorie restriction causes water, some fat, and muscle loss, which ultimately decreases metabolism so the body needs fewer calories to survive.” It also causes a shift toward a higher percentage of body fat, which increases the risk for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Some people use calories as a way to measure their target food consumption, others base their diet on grams (of protein, whole grains, etc.), while some create lists of foods to eat more of and foods to eat less of. Decide how you'll approach your diet.


Review your prescription medications with your doctor. It's important to be sure that your diet plans are in sync with any nutritional guidelines that may be associated with the prescriptions you take.

For example, if you take ACE inhibitors to lower your blood pressure you need to watch your intake of bananas, oranges and green leafy vegetables. If you've been prescribed tetracycline you may need to avoid dairy products during the period you take the drug. , Before you change what you're doing, you need to know what you do now. Keep track of what, when and where you eat for insight into your current eating habits.


Keep a food diary. Put a journal in the kitchen or next to your bed and write down what you eat (meals, snacks, those little ""tastes"" from you friend's plate--all of it), the time of day that you eat and where you eat (kitchen table, sofa, bed).
Track online. Several websites offer online tools that allow you to track your eating habits electronically. If it's as close as your smartphone, it should be easy for you to keep track.

, We all have different eating habits and ""triggers"" that can cause us to overeat. Being aware of yours is the first step in managing them as part of your new eating plan.


Stress. One of the biggest causes of overeating is stress. When we feel under-the-gun or anxious, we often turn to food for comfort. If this is a problem area for you, you may need to include stress management techniques or stock healthier food options to deal with this trigger.
Fatigue. When we're tired we're less likely to make good food choices. If you realize you often eat while tired, you'll need to think about how you can get more rest and make sure that you grocery shop when you're feeling your most rested and focused.
Loneliness or boredom. Friends all out of town? Can't find something to do? If you discover that you turn to food when you're on your own, you might want to think about supplementing your new diet with some new activities or hobbies that will get you out of the house, keep you engaged and stop you from overeating.
Excessive hunger. If you put off eating because of a busy schedule, you may discover that by the time you sit down to dinner you're ravenous and eat everything in sight. If this is a problem area for you, think of how you can schedule mini-meal breaks in your new eating plan.

Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Include fresh meat.,
Add in healthy fats.,
Avoid non-paleo foods.,
Figure out if you want to adjust your mindset.",How to Decide Whether to Go Paleo2," One key to the paleo diet is to eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Most paleo advocates recommend that you eat organic if possible. Paleo is built on eating what our ancestors did, so that means fresh foods and no processed foods.This means you shouldn’t eat canned vegetables or fruit if you can avoid it. Only buy frozen vegetables if they have no additives or are organic.

, Protein in the form of meat is another staple of the paleo diet. This means you can eat any type of meat you want - as long as it is organic, grass-fed, and hormone and antibiotic free. Eat beef, chicken, turkey, pork, fish, lamb, duck, shellfish, or any other meat you want.Eggs are also an important source of protein for paleo.
You can eat meat that isn’t organic or grass-fed, but always try to go as natural as possible to eliminate chemicals, pesticides, and other harmful additives.
Whenever you are buying certain products, like bacon or sandwich meat, make sure to buy nitrate-free.

, Another key to paleo is healthy fats. This includes avocado, nuts, bone broth, and healthy oils. Coconut oil is a common paleo staple, but you can also use olive oil or avocado oil. You can use grass-fed butter or clarified butter, along with beef tallow or lard if they come from healthy, grass-fed, hormone and antibiotic-free sources.Vegetable and Canola oil are not included in the Paleo diet. Make sure you are not buying peanuts; they are legumes, not nuts.

, Paleo comes with a list of foods you cannot eat. First, you should not eat anything that is prepackaged. This includes boxes, jars, and bags. On paleo, you also cannot eat grains, dairy, salt, sugar and artificial sweeteners, or legumes, like peanuts, beans, lentils, or soybeans.Stay away from hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oil. This includes margarine, soybean oil, corn oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, and sunflower oil.
You should do your shopping in the produce and meat sections. Some stores, like Whole Foods, do carry prepackaged paleo-friendly foods, like granola or energy bars.
Honey is okay in small doses on the paleo diet.

, Paleo is a lifestyle and a mindset. Some people use it as a weight loss tool, but just like with any “diet,” you must be careful of yo-yo dieting. If you want to do paleo, you should adjust your mindset and embrace the lifestyle. This means focusing on fueling your body with good ingredients.Many people just substitute unhealthy foods with paleo versions of the food. This isn’t true paleo. Each meal should be full of vegetables first, along with a protein.

Know the macros.,
Eat mostly vegetables.,
Consume fruit and starchy vegetables in moderation.,
Beware of falling into paleo bad eating traps.,
Join an online paleo community.",How to Decide Whether to Go Paleo3," Paleo is generally designed around the idea that you eat a diet high in fat, moderate in protein, and low or moderate in carbohydrates. If you are eating the correct foods, you don’t have to worry about counting calories or thinking about your portions.The paleo diet recommends getting your nutrients from 65% fat, 20% carbohydrates, and 15% protein. Most people who follow paleo use this as a guide, not a hard rule., Many people make the mistake of eating too much meat on the paleo diet. Too much protein without carbs can cause kidney damage and osteoporosis. Too much meat can also cause heart disease because of the saturated fat. To help avoid this, eat mostly vegetables in your diet.You want to fill your plate up with tons of veggies, then add a healthy fat and a protein. For example, your breakfast may be eggs, avocado, tomatoes, broccoli, and peppers. Your dinner may be a cauliflower fried rice made with coconut oil topped with sautéed shrimp.

, Fruit and starchy vegetables should be eaten in moderation because of the sugar and carbohydrate content. Eat mostly berries when you consume fruit, such as blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries. Limit starchy vegetables, especially if you are trying to lose weight.If you work out often or are an athlete, you may want to increase your starchy fruits and vegetables some. For example, many people who eat paleo will eat a sweet potato on days they have a heavy workout.

, Many people switch to paleo and instead of eating a lot of vegetables, healthy fats, and protein, they eat the wrong things. They eat too many paleo treats, which are paleo-friendly recipes for foods like cookies, brownies, cakes, and pancakes. These foods still have carbs and sugars, just made with paleo-friendly ingredients.People often eat more fruit than what is recommended on the paleo diet. Fruit is high in carbs and sugars, so it is important to limit how much fruit you eat. Dark chocolate is another paleo-friendly food that needs to be eaten in moderation.

, If you are unsure if you want to go paleo, try looking into an online community. Paleo is a community of people who support each other as they eat a specific way in a society that doesn’t encourage that kind of eating. Look on paleo forums, Facebook, or even go to a Meetup where you can read about other people’s paleo journey.Many people share recipes and tips about how to manage paleo with their busy lifestyles.
You can even use this opportunity to ask questions to those who do paleo.

Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Consume more lean protein.,
Look for whole grain foods.,
Include healthy fats.,
Eliminate trans fats.",How to Diet2," Fruits and vegetables make up a huge part of a healthy diet. They contain essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that keep your body functioning well and protect it against harmful free radicals. The food pyramid calls for 2 1/2 to 3 cups of vegetables and 1 1/2 to 2 cups of fruit per day for adults.Go red. Many red fruits and veggies are loaded with powerful, healthy antioxidants. Antioxidants soak up damaging free radicals and may help fight heart disease, reduce the risk for some cancers, stroke and macular degeneration. For example, tomatoes are a good source of potassium and vitamin C, which makes them good for your heart. They may protect against prostate and breast cancers. Red peppers have tons of vitamin A, which helps with skin, bones, and teeth, and almost as much vitamin C as an orange. Think green. Green vegetables contain calcium and iron not to mention soluble fiber, which helps stabilize blood sugar, lower LDL cholesterol (the bad kind) and keeps you feeling full longer so you're likely to eat less.

For example, kale is a wonder veggie with tons of benefits--it's high in fiber, iron, vitamins A, C and K and antioxidants, helps fight inflammation and lowers cholesterol. Broccoli is high in fiber, protein and vitamins A, C and K, improves eye and skin health and detoxes the body. , Your body needs protein to build muscle, provide immunity protection and keep your metabolism on track. To get the benefits with none of the detriments that can be associated with protein sources, choose foods that are high in protein and low in fat.


Be a fat detective. Pick skim milk rather than whole milk, lean ground beef or ground turkey rather than marbleized ground beef. Look for fat that's hidden--or not so hidden--in your protein choices.

Avoid full-fat dairy products, organ meats such as liver, fatty and marbled meats, spareribs, cold cuts, hot dogs and sausages, bacon, fried or breaded meats and egg yolks. Become a fan of fish. Certain types of fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can lower blood fats called triglycerides. You'll find the highest amounts of omega-3 fatty acids in cold-water fish, such as salmon, mackerel and herring. Be one with beans. And peas and lentils--legumes in general are good sources of protein and contain no cholesterol and less fat than meat. Try a soy or bean burger in place of a hamburger or toss some tofu into a veggie stir-fry or salad.

, Whole grains are the entire seed of a plant and contain three parts: the germ, the bran and the endosperm, so whole grain foods contain all three of these components. Unfortunately, when plants are refined the bran and the germ are removed and about 25% of a grain’s protein and at least 17 key nutrients are lost. To get all the benefits, look for foods that are labeled as whole grain. Reap the benefits. Studies have documented numerous benefits of a diet rich in whole grains. They include reduced risk of stroke, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory disease, colorectal cancer, gum disease and asthma, better weight maintenance, healthier carotid arteries and healthier blood pressure levels. Shoot for 48 g. of whole grains in your diet daily. Source your supermarket. About 15% to 20% of products on supermarket shelves are whole grains. Look for products labeled as ""whole grain"" or check to see if a product has the ""Whole Grain"" stamp from the Whole Grains Council.
Check multiple food items. It's not just grains, flours and breads that can be whole grain; pastas, cereals, cookies, tortilla chips, pancake mixes and other grain-based products can be labeled whole grain, so read the package carefully.

, Not all fats are bad for you; in fact, some should definitely be a part of your healthy eating plan. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs)are a healthy type of fat as are polyunsaturated fats and offer certain benefits such as a reduction in LDL cholesterol (the bad kind), an increase or maintenance of HDL cholesterol (the good kind), help stabilize insulin levels and control blood sugar.Foods high in MUFAs include avocados, canola oil, nuts (almonds, cashews, pecans and macadamias plus nut butters), olive oil, olives and peanut oil.

, Trans fats are oils infused with hydrogen, so you might see them listed as ""hydrogenated"" oil on package labels. They raise bad cholesterol and lower good cholesterol, cause weight gain, increase the risk for heart disease, cancer, stroke and infertility. Among the biggest sources for trans fat are commercially fried food and packaged foods, especially baked goods.
Beware of labels claiming no trans fats. The FDA allows food with up to a half-gram of trans fat per serving to be labeled ""trans fat free."" Eat enough of them and those half-grams add up. Trans fats are so bad for you, New York City has passed a law prohibiting the use of them in restaurants.

Skip the processed foods.,
Stay away from sugary drinks.,
Avoid specific ingredients as needed.",How to Diet3," Processed foods and fast foods are high in the kinds of things you're better off avoiding--sodium, saturated fat and sugar. It doesn't mean the occasional fast-food burger or frozen entrée will kill you, but these are the kinds of foods you want to limit.


The government's most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that no more than 10% of calories come from saturated fats. If you're on a 1500 calorie-a-day diet, that means you can have 15g of saturated fat a day--fast-food burgers can have anywhere from 12g to 16g.

, Sugary drinks, especially soft drinks, have been linked to weight gain and obesity. Calories consumed through a straw are still calories and contribute to packing on the pounds, so plan to cut down or reduce your consumption of these beverages on your diet.


The best thirst quencher is and always has been water. Plus drinking more water will make you feel more full and may reduce your intake at mealtime.

Make water more appealing to your taste buds by adding slices of citrus, cucumbers, mint or other herbs.


Juice sounds healthy, especially drinks made from 100% juice, but they're high in sugar. Drink them in moderation or add water to get some of the nutritional benefits with fewer calories.
In a study by Harvard University researchers, sugary drinks were linked to 180,000 deaths a year worldwide, 25,000 in the United States alone. Another 2013 study, this one by the scientists at Imperial College London, found that the risk of type 2 diabetes rose by as much as 22% for every 12 oz. serving of sugar-sweetened drinks consumed per day., You may have a condition that requires you to steer clear of certain ingredients, so read labels carefully and stock up on products that suit your specific dietary requirements.


Celiac disease. Celiac disease is a digestive disorder caused by intolerance to dietary gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Thanks to a growing awareness of the needs of those who are not able to tolerate gluten, a number of gluten-free products are now on the shelves of not only specialty food stores but also your local supermarket.
Hypertension. A dangerous condition and a precursor to heart disease and stroke, hypertension can be managed in part by a diet that's heavy on fruits, vegetables and lean protein. The DASH diet--which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension--has been shown to decrease blood pressure, is recommended by a number of health organizations including the National Institutes of Health and was ranked No. 1 best overall diet in the U.S. News and World Report's Best Diets 2012. Food allergies. If you suspect a food allergy, be sure to get tested by a physician. Eight foods account for 90% of all food allergies: peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat, soy, fish and shellfish. If you have any of these allergies, read food labels very carefully to avoid choosing items that may trigger an allergic reaction.

"
Ease into your diet.,
Treat yourself occasionally.,
Monitor your progress.,
Keep yourself accountable.,
Stay positive.",How to Diet4," While it may be tempting to drastically cut calories and impose unrealistic eating expectations to hasten weight loss, a slow and steady approach is more effective and easier to maintain.


Change just one meal a day. Rather than redoing your plate at every meal, try eating just one healthier or smaller meal a day. You won't feel deprived with this gradual change, which will give you time to adjust to your new way of eating.
Eliminate or replace one snack a day. If you always have a cookie at your 3 p.m. coffee break have a peach instead or simply skip the sweet treat altogether. Or trade your large mocha for a cup of green tea with a squeeze of lemon.

, Having a reward system in place can help keep your enthusiasm high while dieting and prevent you from going off track.


Schedule a ""cheat"" day. Allow yourself one day a week when you can forget your dietary restrictions and eat whatever you want. It'll give you something to look forward to and keep you from feeling deprived.
Be careful of labeling a food as ""forbidden."" Human nature makes us desire something we can't have even more. Avoid saying that you can ""never"" have a certain food on your diet plan. Allow for exceptions to reduce the allure of certain tasty treats.

, To track your success in taking off the pounds, set up a system that will let you see how you're doing.


That same food diary you started at the beginning of your plan to track your eating habits can be used to track what you're eating on your new plan. Compare your entries from week to week to see trends, triggers and successes.
Use an online program. Enter all the information about your new plan (starting weight, goal weight, daily menus) into an electronic program that will keep your progress at your fingertips. Many of these programs offer healthy recipes and community forums where you can connect with others who share your goals.
Conduct weekly weigh-ins. It's not just what your food diary says that matters, it's what the scale says as well. Set a certain time each week to weigh yourself and make note of the results.

, You shouldn't beat yourself up about the occasional slip-up on your diet, but don't let yourself off the hook entirely. You've set a goal and charted a course, now it's up to you to stay on track.


Tell someone (or everyone) that you're dieting. Making a public declaration can increase your chances of success by holding you accountable to others. It can also engender the support you need from family members and friends who can cheer you on to your goal.
Join a support group. This could be formal group such as Weight Watchers or simply a group you organize yourself. Post an ad on Craigslist looking for weight-loss partners or organize or join a Meetup group dedicated to healthier eating.

, Dieting can be difficult and change isn't necessarily easy but keeping a good attitude can help you get over the rough patches you may encounter on your road to better health and a better body.


Post inspirational sayings on your fridge. Having mood-boosting words-of-wisdom close at hand can help you handle a difficult diet day.
Do things that make you feel good. Get a pedicure, have your hair done, buy a new perfume. Little things that make you feel special and pampered can offset the feeling of deprivation that can sometimes creep in when you're dieting.

Understand the net carb concept.,
Learn the formula for calculating net carbs.,
Find the number of total carbohydrates on a nutrition label.,
Subtract the fiber.,
Deduct the sugar alcohols.,
Note the net carb count.,
Use a carbohydrate-counting guide if there is no label.,
Consider using a mobile app.,
Try a digital tracker on your computer.,
Write out your count by hand.,
Consume just 20g of net carbs during the induction phase.,
Increase your carb intake gradually.,
Add 10 grams of net carbs each week during phases three and four.",How to Count Carbs on the Atkins Diet," The Atkins diet focuses on cutting down on carbohydrates so you need to learn how you can monitor the amount of carbs you are consuming. To do this you need to understand what net carbs are. Net carbs simply represent the total carbohydrate content of food after you have deducted the fiber content and any sugar alcohols.You only need to count net carbs instead of total carbohydrates because these are what significantly impact your blood sugar level.
Foods which are low in net carbs don’t have a major impact on your blood sugar level, and as such are less likely to disrupt your weight loss.
Low net carb foods include fruits and vegetables which are rich in important nutrients like vitamins and minerals.;
, The formula for calculating net carbs is straightforward enough. You simply need to subtract the dietary fiber and the sugar alcohol content from the total carbohydrates. This will give a basic number which you can use to monitor your carb intake while on the Atkins Diet. The formula for calculating net carbs is:


Net Carbs = Total Carbs – Dietary Fiber – Sugar Alcohol.This is a simple formula but it’s fine for the purposes of the diet and won’t take you long to remember.

, The easiest way to calculate the net carbs with these formula is to look at the information on the nutrition label of the food. All food that comes in appropriate packaging will have one these labels which will give you the figures you need to determine the net carbs.Start by finding the number of total carbohydrates in a food on the food’s nutrition label.
Total carbohydrates are typically found in the top section of the label after the product’s sodium content.

, Now find the quantity of dietary fiber in the food. Dietary fiber is often located as a subheading beneath the total carbohydrate count. Subtract the amount of dietary fiber from the amount of total carbohydrates.

, Sugar alcohols are not easily absorbed by the body, so they do not count against your net carb total. If the food label contains a listing for sugar alcohol quantity, then you can subtract sugar alcohol content from your total carbohydrate count in addition to subtracting dietary fiber.


There is some debate about the impact of sugar alcohols on blood pressure so you should not assume that is fine to consume these in large amounts just because they don’t contribute to your net carbs.
Sugar alcohols contribute to calories and can have a laxative effect when consumed in large portions., Once you have subtracted the fiber and sugar alcohols from the total carbohydrates you will have calculated the net carb value. Make a note of the figure and don’t forget to adjust it according to how many grams of the food you are eating.


You may notice some foods now advertised with labels that claim to have low net carbs. There is no legal definition of net carbs so it’s a good idea to do your own calculation too., Calculating net carbs on foods that don’t come with handy nutritional information printed onto the packaging is a little trickier. You still need to use the same basic formula to determine the net carbs. (Net Carbs = Total Carbs – Dietary Fiber – Sugar Alcohol.) In order to do this, you first need to find out the total carbs, dietary fiber, and sugar alcohols content in the food. There are many guides for foods that provide all the useful information that is included on nutrition labels.


For example, a banana doesn't come with a food label, but you can find the net carb info listed on the Atkins website. A small banana has 20 net carbs.You will find that over time you will learn the net carbs of different foods so you don’t have to check them in the guide all the time.
The guides will also contain other useful nutritional information and help you learn to identify foods to avoid more generally.

, Once you have learned how to calculate your net carb intake you need to actually track how much you are consuming to make sure you stick to the Atkins plan. There are a number of different techniques and technologies that can help you to do this. One good option is to download a carb counting app onto your smartphone.It has the advantages of being portable and something you keep with you all day.
Depending on the app you can also track other nutritional information.
It will do some of the calculations for you and give you a clear and up-to-date count of your net carb consumption.

, Another digital option is to download a tracker onto your PC or laptop. Like the app this will do a lot of the calculating for you and is likely to contain a variety of other features to help you monitor what you eat more fully. Using one of these programs can often help you to gain a fuller picture of your diet.Unlike a smartphone app, it is not something you will carry around with you all day, so you won’t be able to keep it completely up-to-date during the day.

, A nice low tech version is simply to write down your net carb intake by hand as you go through the day. You could buy a special notebook and keep it with you. Jotting down your progress can be a good way to really take ownership of your diet plan and have a sense of achievement as you stick to it.


You won’t get as much analysis and extra information if you write it down yourself.
But it could be nice to look back through the notebook after you have completed the diet to remind yourself of your progress.

, In the Induction phase, you should consume no more than 20 net carbs per day. In subsequent phases, you can consume more as long as they don’t interfere with your weight loss. Start by consuming 12 to 15 grams of net carbs through eating foundation vegetables.Foundation vegetables include leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower and asparagus.
Eat high-fat, low-carb dairy products during Induction for your remaining carbs. Examples include hard cheeses, cream and sour cream.

, In phase two, OWL (Ongoing Weight Loss), you can add 5 grams of net carbs to your diet each week. As long as you continue to lose weight, you can continue gradually adding more carbohydrates to your diet. If weight loss stalls, you can cut back on your carbohydrates until you start to lose weight again. Start eating nuts and seeds again. Avoid chestnuts, which contain too many net carbs.


Add in some fruit the next week. You can eat berries, cherries and melon.
Vary your dairy. After you incorporate fruit, you can add in whole milk yoghurt and fresh cheeses, including ricotta and cottage cheese.
Add legumes next. These include chickpeas, lentils, peanuts and beans., These phases, known as Pre-Maintenance and Maintenance, are about finding the right balance to maintain your weight loss.You are working to find your Atkins Carbohydrate Equilibrium, or ACE. Your ACE is the number of net carbs you can consume each day without gaining weight.


Eat a greater variety of fruit. Enjoy apples, citrus fruits and other fruits that are lower in sugar but high in fiber.
Start eating high-carb vegetables again. You can add winter squash, peas and carrots back to your diet, but avoid regular potatoes.
Add whole grains after you add high-carb vegetables. Focus on whole grains and continue to avoid high-carb refined grains such as white bread and white rice."

Weigh yourself regularly.,
Weigh yourself at the same time every day.,
Buy a scale.,
Weigh yourself.",How to Create a Weight Loss Chart1," Studies have shown that weighing yourself on a daily basis can help you maintain your weight loss goals. It gives you a regular method for being accountable to yourself.Try to weigh yourself every day so you can get a sense of which forms of exercise and nutrition work best for you.Another option is to weight yourself once a week, which is still effective if you don't want to weigh yourself every day. Some studies have show that weighing yourself daily is not an effective motivator for weight loss.You might become frustrated if you do not see the results you wish to see at the rate you would prefer.If you have a history of eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia, do not weigh yourself daily as this can trigger a relapse of your disorder.;
, Most doctors recommend weighing yourself in the morning as your weight is more likely to fluctuate over the course of the day.Do it first thing, right after you use the bathroom.


Do not eat or drink anything before you weigh yourself. Even drinking a glass of water can have an effect on your weight.
Wear the same thing when you weigh yourself. It's best if you can weigh yourself while you are naked as heavy shoes, sweaters and other pieces of clothing can contribute to an inaccurate number on the scale., If you want to weigh yourself every day at home, you need to own a scale. The most common forms of scales are digital scales; these are scales that will produce a numeric value on a tiny screen once you step on them.There are also balance beam scales, but you will find that these are taller and bulkier in nature. They might not be the most convenient choice for the average-sized home bathroom.

, Step onto the scale. Stand tall with your feet placed parallel, under your hips. After a few seconds, the scale will read the number that represents your weight in pounds.Record your weight immediately after weighing yourself so you remember it accurately. You can plot it into your weight loss chart or simply write it down in a nearby journal or piece of paper."

Increase your lifestyle activity.",How to Achieve Your Summer Weight Loss Goals," Many people have summer weight loss goals. Consider whether you want that weight off before summer starts or you want to work on weight loss during the summer.


Many people want to lose weight before summer. You may want to be ready for your bathing suit the first day the pool opens or have an early beach vacation. You'll most likely want to have lost weight prior to this.
If that's the case, you'll want to start your weight loss program before the beginning of the season. Plan to start a diet or incorporate more exercise at least a month or two before summer begins.
If you want to take advantage of the summer season and try to lose weight, you can start anytime during the summer.;
, Summer is a great season to set and achieve weight loss goals. It's a three month season where you can take off a good amount of extra weight if you need to. Set realistic goals this summer to help make sure you can achieve them.


When losing weight, try to set realistic goals. These help set you up for success instead of failure.Keep in mind that to lose one pound of fat, you need to create a deficit of 3500 calories. This means that to lose a pound in one week, you would need to create a calorie deficit of 500 calories every single day. You can do this by reducing your calorie intake and burning more calories than normal through exercise. Over the course of 12 weeks, this would result in a 12 pound weight loss. If you wanted to lose two pounds per week, then you would need to create a deficit of 1,000 calories per day, every day with no cheat days.
Most health professionals suggest aiming for about one to two pounds per week. This is a safe and sustainable weight loss rate.Although summer is about three months long in total, it may not be long enough to lose a large amount of weight. For example, a target goal of 50 pounds, would be too high for the short summer season.

, There are many things about summer that can make weight loss a little easier or more motivating to achieve. However, it's also easy to get sidetracked with vacations, summer BBQs and parties.


Keeping yourself accountable anytime you're trying to lose weight is essential. If you don't track yourself and your progress, you're more likely to lose sight of your goal and get off track.To keep yourself accountable, try: weighing yourself one to two times a week, keeping a food journal, keeping a pair of skinny jeans or a bathing suit nearby to look at, building a support group or tracking your exercise with an app or a pedometer.
Summer lends itself to a variety of fun things that can lead you awry on your weight loss plan. Watch out for: summer BBQs, summer cocktails, summer treats like ice cream sandwiches and blueberry pie, larger portions and eating out on vacations or long days laying out at the pool.

, Regardless of what type of goal you want to achieve, setting rewards for yourself can help encourage and motivate you to meet your goals.The same goes for weight loss.


Make staying accountable more fun by setting up rewards for yourself as you meet small or large weight loss goals over the summer.
Whenever you're trying to set up rewards for yourself, consider avoiding food related rewards. A dinner out, a special dessert or an extra glass of wine can get you off track and set you back a few steps.
Try other rewards like: treating yourself to a day at the beach, getting your nails done, playing a round of golf, getting a massage, purchasing new clothes or taking an extra day off of work.

, Another key method to making sure you achieve your weight loss goals during the summer is by building a support group. Nothing keeps you more accountable than other people.


Support groups or a support person is essential for weight loss. These people or person should know your exact weight loss plan and goals. Ask friends, family members and co-workers if they'd be interested in being your support group.
Share with them what type of diet you're following, what physical activity you plan on doing and how much weight you're going to lose.
In addition, getting on the scale with a person or doing a diet or fitness plan with a support group has shown the best results in regards to weight loss., One method of your diet that you should focus on to achieve weight loss during the summer is the amount of protein you eat. Following a slightly higher protein diet can help you achieve quicker weight loss during this short season.Protein is an essential nutrient in your diet. It helps fuel you through the day and support your metabolism and lean muscle. In regards to weight loss, it helps keep you satiated and less hungry during the day, which is a great component for weight loss.
To make sure you're eating enough protein for your body, always include a minimum of one serving at every meal and snack.
Also, measure the appropriate portion size of protein. Each serving should be about 3-4 oz or about 1/2 cup.Choose leaner proteins as well. These are naturally lower in fat and calories. Items like poultry, eggs, lean beef, pork, low-fat dairy, legumes and tofu are great examples.

, One aspect about summer that lends itself well to a weight loss plan is all the in season fruits and vegetables. These low calorie foods should make up about 50% of your diet.Health professionals recommend that you make half of your plate or half of all your meals a fruit or a vegetable. This not only helps you achieve a well-balanced and nutritious diet, but also helps support weight loss.
Both fruits and vegetables are naturally very low in calories. When you make half of your meals a fruit or a vegetable, that means half of your meals are automatically lower in calories as well.
When the warm weather hits, a whole host of fruits and vegetables are available. Enjoy the bounty of this season and choose a wide variety of both of these nutritious food groups.
Measure out a 1/2 cup of cut fruit or one small piece, 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of leafy salad greens.

, Since summer is only for a short three month period, to achieve your weight loss goals, consider going on a lower carb diet. This has been shown to help people lose a little more weight quickly.Studies have shown that in comparison, a lower carb diet can help you lose more weight in a shorter period of time compared to other diets (like a low calorie or low fat diet). Since you're focusing on a three month time period, this might be beneficial for you.
Low carb diets are eating plans that limit or restrict how many carbohydrates you eat. They're found in foods like grains, fruits, starchy vegetables and legumes.
However, limiting your grain intake is a great modified low carb diet to follow. This allows you to still follow a balanced diet filled with other nutritious foods like fruits, vegetables and legumes.
Limit yourself to 1-2 servings of grains daily. Measure out 1 oz or about 1/2 cup of cooked grains per serving.Also, try to choose only 100% whole grain if you can. These foods are less processed and contain higher amounts of fiber, protein and other nutrients.Try foods like oats, quinoa, brown rice, millet, whole grain bread or whole wheat pasta.

, Although summer does have a lot of great foods that can help support weight loss, this season does come with its higher calorie treats. Beware to not over indulge this season or else you may not be able to meet your summer goals.


Foods or drinks that are high in fat, high in sugar (or both) are generally going to be higher in calories as well. If you eat these foods regularly or in larger quantities, it will make weight loss much more difficult.Common summertime foods that can cause a slip-up include: ice-cream sundaes or ice cream cones, fruit pies, cakes, snow cones, fruity cocktails, beer or wine, hot dogs, hamburgers and even boardwalk fries.
You don't have to completely avoid your favorite summer treats, but eat them in moderation. In addition, when you do have them, aim to have a smaller portion to keep the overall calories in check.

, Drinking an adequate amount of fluids is always essential to your health. However, during the hot or humid summer months, it's even more essential that you meet your daily minimum.


Water helps your body function normally. Without enough water, you can become dehydrated quite quickly. Mild dehydration may make you feel sleepy, cause headaches or even make you feel like you're hungry. This can make sticking to a weight loss regimen more difficult.Aim for at least 64 oz or about 8 glasses of clear, hydrating fluids every day. However, if you're active during the summer or spend more time outdoors, you'll need more water. Drink an extra 1.5 to 2.5 cups (400 to 600 milliliters) if you exercise for a short period, such as 30 minutes. However, if you exercise for a long period of time or if you are sweating a lot, then you will need to drink more.Stick to calorie-free, caffeine-free beverages. Try: water, sparkling water, flavored water and decaf iced coffee or tea. Alcoholic and caffeinated beverages can dehydrate you.

, Summer is a popular time for afternoon picnics, holiday barbecues and parties. However, many foods and drinks served at these gatherings can throw you off track with your weight loss.


Barbecues and picnics can be loaded with high fat and high calorie foods. Be wary of items like: hotdogs or brats, creamy salads (like potato or macaroni salad), sweet treats (like ice cream or blueberry pie), sweetened beverages and alcoholic drinks, chips and dip and high fat meats (like ribs or burgers).
If you do have some of these foods, keep your servings small. This will help limit your overall calorie intake.
Try to look for healthier alternatives like: a burger without the bun, salads made with an olive oil based dressing, fruit based desserts, raw vegetables and dip, and pre-portioned foods (like mini sliders).
An easy option to help you stay on track at these festive events, is by offering to bring a dish to the party or picnic. That way, you'll be able to control what goes into your dish and automatically have at least one option that fits into your healthy eating plan.

, To boost your summertime weight loss, consider adding in some physical activity to your routine. Cardio or aerobic exercise in particular can help support your weight loss goals.


Cardio exercises come with a variety of benefits-like improved mood and sleep habits. However, this type of exercise also helps rev up your metabolism in the short term and burn calories. Combined with a weight loss diet, this can help you achieve your summer goals.Aim to include about 150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours of cardiovascular exercise each week. You need to include activities that are moderate intensity and engage in them for at least 10 minutes at a time.Activities that can help you achieve your summer weight loss goals include: walking, jogging, dancing, swimming, surfing, skim boarding, playing sports, using the elliptical or kayaking.

, In addition to cardio exercises, it's also important to include strength training exercises too. These work in conjunction with cardio and can help you maintain your summer weight loss.


Unlike cardiovascular exercises, strength training exercises help increase your metabolism in the long-run by increasing your muscle mass overtime. In addition, these are the exercises that can help tone muscles which may make you feel more comfortable in a swimsuit or summer clothing.Health professionals recommend that you include at least one to two days of strength training every week. You should aim to work each major muscle group for at least 20 minutes in total.
Try lifting weights or taking a weight lifting class, doing yoga, pilates or body weight exercises.

, Summer is also a great season to focus on increasing your lifestyle or baseline activity levels. This can help you stay active and help your body burn calories continuously throughout the day.


Lifestyle activities are movements and activities that you do as part of your normal day. Whether it's gardening, mowing the lawn or taking the stairs, these all count as lifestyle activities.
Studies have shown that activities like these are equally as beneficial for your body, weight and health as more structured aerobic activities (like going for a 20 minute jog).Summer is a great time to try to add more movement or more steps to your day. The weather is nice, allowing you to be active both in and outdoors.
Think of ways you can increase your lifestyle activity. Try gardening, mowing your lawn, swimming laps or doing pool walking instead of just laying out, trying a new beach sport like skim boarding or boogie boarding, walk around amusement parks or playing a sport outside on the weekends.

Stop once you reach your goal.,
Ease out of your diet.",How to Diet5," Some diets are meant to be life-long and others are simply short-term to achieve a weight loss goal. Many diets are fine temporarily but may not be healthy over the long run.


Be careful of ""yo-yo"" dieting. ""Yo-yo"" dieting, also known as weight cycling, is the phenomenon by which you lose weight on a diet, regain it after the diet ends and embark on a new diet. Repeated ""yo-yo"" dieting can increase the risk for mental distress, life dissatisfaction and binge eating; over time it can damage the cells that line the blood vessels increasing your risk for heart disease. , Ending a diet can be a relief, but if you simply return to your old ways of eating, you can easily gain back the weight you worked so hard to lose. Instead, think about putting a maintenance plan in place to keep you at your new weight.


If you've been on a liquid diet or one that seriously restricted caloric intake, you must be careful and add foods back slowly so as not to shock your system. Incorporate homemade soups, fruits and vegetables over a period of a few days before settling into a healthy eating routine.

Watch your daily calorie consumption.,
Eat regularly.,
Include your fruits and veggies.,
Stick to lean proteins when you can.,
Pick whole grains over refined grains.,
Change up fall recipes by lowering calories.",How to Avoid Autumn Weight Gain1," It is easy for little bites and snacks to add up to lots of extra calories in a day. Therefore, keeping track of how many calories you eat in a day is essential for avoiding weight gain. Start tracking everything you eat and drink throughout the day.

You can write down what you eat in a journal and look up the calories or use a smartphone app to track your calories.
Pay attention to small bites and snacks that you have throughout the day. For example, if you go to a party, make sure that you write down the bite-sized sausages, cookies, and beverages you consumed.;
, When you're busy in the fall, it can be easy to skip a meal. The problem is, you end up at a party or gathering, and then you eat more than you should. Try to keep your blood sugar steady by eating at least three meals a day or five to six smaller meals, if you prefer.If you plan on indulging later in the day, try eating smaller, healthier meals, such as a lean protein with a veggie. You could try hummus with celery sticks.

, You've heard it before, and you'll hear it again: you need to make fruits and vegetables an integral part of your diet. You should be eating at least seven servings of fruits and vegetables every day. When you fill up on these options, you're less likely to overindulge in higher-calorie foods.During the fall, you have plenty of options for fresh fruits and veggies, including pumpkins, pomegranates, and apples. You'll also find winter greens and root vegetables, such as Brussels sprouts, kale, turnips, and cabbage., When you're not at a party, try to make your protein choices lean ones. Think skinless chicken breast, skinless turkey breast, fish, beans, and legumes, for starters. Tofu is also a great lean protein choice. By making lean choices when you can, you're saving some room for less healthy choices later., Whole grains keep you fuller for longer, plus they generally provide more fiber and nutrients than refined grains. Think whole-wheat pasta instead of regular pasta or whole-wheat bread instead of white bread. Other healthy whole grains include quinoa, bulgar wheat, oatmeal, and lentils.

For instance, with your Thanksgiving sides, you could sub whole wheat bread for white bread in your dressing, as well as picking whole wheat rolls over white rolls.
Instead of a pasta salad, try a whole grain salad made with quinoa or bulgar wheat, vegetables, and a light dressing.
While not a whole grain, you can sub cauliflower for half the potatoes in your mashed potatoes without a big difference in taste or texture. Try including the skin of the potato, which adds more fiber, too.

, Many fall recipes are holiday favorites, which are high in calories. However, don't despair. You can lighten them up switching out lower-fat items for higher ones and by reducing the sugar in them. For instance, if a recipe calls for full-fat sour cream, try using nonfat Greek yogurt.

Understand what happens when you eat carbohydrates.,
Understand the role of insulin.,
Limit the amount of carbohydrates that you eat.",How to Compare Nutrisystem With Atkins2," When you eat a carbohydrate and the bloodstream transports the molecules to your cells, 1 of 3 things may happen:


Carbs may be burned immediately for energy.
Carbs may be stored for the short-term as a compound called glycogen.
Carbs may be stored for the long-term as fat.

, Insulin controls the release of stored fat from fat cells. High levels of insulin from high carbohydrate meals mean that your body burns carbohydrates instead of burning stored fat.

, By lowering the amount of carbs that you consume, you turn on your body’s fat-burning engines. As a result, you will lose weight.

Compare each diet’s philosophy about carbohydrates.,
Decide which foods you would rather eat.,
Decide how much you want to cook.",How to Compare Nutrisystem With Atkins3," NutriSystem does not limit the amount of carbs that you can eat. You are simply expected to eat mostly low-GI carbs. Atkins, on the other hand, restricts the quantity of carbs that you can consume.

, Both diets will require you to change your eating habits for life, but Atkins will require you to more strictly restrict your carb intake.

, NutriSystem provides you with prepared meals, while Atkins will require you to plan your own menus and cook your own meals.

Fill up on healthy foods first.,
Savor what you love.,
Skip the sugary drinks and alcohol.,
Stay away from high-calorie foods.,
Stick to a single serving a day.,
Laugh it up.",How to Avoid Autumn Weight Gain2," When you go to a party, try sticking to the fruits and vegetables for the bulk of your food. Of course, you want to try some of the other foods, but try to limit your intake to just a few bites of the higher-calorie foods.If you're not sure if the party will have healthy snacks, try eating something healthy before you go or even bringing something healthy with you. For instance, you could volunteer to bring a vegetable tray, so you know you'll have something healthy around., When you do pick out higher-calorie foods at parties, take the time to really enjoy it. If you plow through it without really tasting it, you'll just end up going back for more. You might as well take the time to really enjoy the calories you're taking in.For instance, if you want a bite of Halloween candy, don't just gobble down three or four pieces. Take small bites, and let each one melt in your mouth. Pick and choose. For example, you could have a small Kit Kat one day and a piece of hard candy the next day.

, Parties are notorious for having free-flowing high-calorie beverages, from punch to alcohol. If you indulge, try to keep it to just a little bit, as you can add on calories quickly. Plus, drinking alcohol in particular can make you hungrier and dissolve your resolve, reducing your self-control, affecting your judgement, and increasing your caloric intake., That is, physically try to keep yourself out of areas where they are kept. For instance, if you know there are pumpkin muffins in the break room at work, try to keep yourself out of there. At home, keep as many high-calorie foods out of your house as possible. When you do bring them home, put them somewhere that's not easy to reach, such as in a high cabinet.If you have extra candy leftover after Halloween, consider giving it to a family you know or donating it to an organization that will take candy, such as organizations that send candy to troops.

, During the fall, you're bound to run into candy and sweets all over the place, given the holidays. You don't have to completely skip all the fun. Rather, just consume in moderation by only having one small piece a day., That is, instead of congregating around the food table, try to move to where other people are at a party. Put the emphasis on talking to people and catching up, rather than on eating and enjoying the food."
"
Try a stationary bike or treadmill.,
Have a dance party while you clean.,
Take a walk to enjoy the leaves.,
Find an indoor gym or pool.,
Incorporate more movement into your day.",How to Avoid Autumn Weight Gain3," If the cooler weather is keeping you indoors, try setting up a treadmill or stationary bike someplace you enjoy the view. You can have it looking out a window, for instance, or lined up with the television so you can keep yourself entertained while you work out., Cleaning is fairly effective exercise, particularly during cooler weather. You can up how many calories you burn by blasting your favorite tunes while you clean. Start dancing, making cleaning more fun while increasing your movement., If you enjoy the cooler weather, autumn is a great time to be outside. Take a walk through a local park or even just your neighborhood to catch glimpses of the changing leaves.Another great exercise option is to rake the leaves in your yard. You'll burn plenty of calories while making your yard prettier.

, If you have trouble motivating yourself to get outside when it's colder, try joining an indoor gym or pool. That way, you'll have a nice, warm place to work out, and you'll be able to motivate yourself more.

, Getting more exercise doesn't mean you have to make a special trip somewhere to do it. You can simply make it a part of your day. For instance, take the stairs instead of the elevator or park farther out at the store. You can also take a swing around the office every time you go to the bathroom.

Make sure you are sleeping well.,
Try a relaxation technique.,
Be willing to say ""no."",
Cope with sadness.",How to Avoid Autumn Weight Gain4," Fall brings with it a busy schedule, with the start of school and multiple holidays. You may find that you are skipping out on some of your sleep to try to keep up. However, not getting enough sleep will only make you crankier and more stressed, plus it can make it harder to avoid weight gain.Make sure you're getting the recommended 7 to 8 hours of sleep a night.
If you have trouble going to bed on time, try setting a bedtime alarm an hour before you need to be in bed. Turn off all electronics at that time to help ready your brain for sleep.

, When you feel yourself getting stressed, try to employ a relaxation technique to calm yourself down. For instance, you could try a visualization technique, meditation, or a deep breathing technique.For a visualization technique, take a moment to close your eyes. Think about one of your favorite places. It can be a place you went on vacation or your childhood home, for example. Imagine yourself there. Don't just use visual cues. Employ all your senses. Think about how it feels, the sun or wind on your skin. What do you smell in the air? What do you hear? Spend a few minutes visualizing to help yourself relax.

, During the fall, your schedule can become packed. It can be hard to say no when someone just wants you to come over for a little fun. However, you still need room to breathe, so make some time for yourself. You don't have to give a reason why you're saying no. You can simply say, ""Sorry, I can't attend."", Sometimes, the holidays are not always a happy time, for a variety of reasons. Maybe you've lost a loved one recently, or maybe you just don't like the stress that comes with this time of year. The important thing is to focus on the good parts of the holidays, by making time to be with the people you love.Realize that some of your traditions will change over time, and that's okay. It's important to adapt as your friends and family change.
Make time for community. Go be with your friends, or go to community events at churches or community centers. If you're feeling sad, invite your family over for a impromptu meal. The holiday season should be a time to spend with those you love, and reaching out will make you feel better.
Take time to remember. If you're feeling sad about the loss of a loved one, it's good to take the time to actually feel that sadness and remember the person who's gone. Try bringing it up when your family or friends get together, as they'll likely want to spend some time remembering, too, even if it is bittersweet.

Ask for a test to measure your levels of vitamin B-12.,
Have your cholesterol levels checked.,
Get your Body Mass Index (BMI) measured.",How to Buy Supplements for a Raw Food Diet1," Individuals who do not eat animal products often have low levels of iron.


A quick blood test can give immediate feedback on your iron levels. Only take iron pills under the supervision of a physician.;

If a health professional suspects a deficiency, supplements are available in shots and pill forms.

, A study with individuals on a long-term raw food diet were often found to have low levels of the positive form of cholesterol (HDL).


If your HDL levels are dangerously low, your doctor may recommend higher levels of animal protein in your diet.

, Many people find it easy to maintain a healthy body weight while on the raw food diet, but some individuals drop to a BMI that is too low for good health.


If your BMI is dangerously low, your physician may recommend that you follow a diet higher in fat and protein, or potentially take a break from the raw food diet altogether.

The cheaper option overall, which actually gives you more benefits, is the All Access Premium Membership. The other option is the As You Go 30 Day Membership.The All Access Premium Membership requires that you pay a fee up front to join. In 2016, the fee is $50, and then you pay $19 a month. It gives you a $50 coupon for food, as well as access to eTools, unlimited one-on-one consultation, support materials, and personalized menus.With the As You Go plan, you pay $39 a month, but you don't need to pay an upfront fee. You get most of the same things you do with the other plan, but you only get one consultation a week.
With either plan, you are able to buy food from the website.;
, Most major cities in the United States have at least one local center for Jenny Craig. Jenny Craig prefers you sign up in person, so you'll visit the center closest to you to sign up for the program you want.If you need help, you can always call (866) 706-4042 to talk to someone.
When meeting with a consultant, you'll talk about your weight loss goals and how the program works. Support is very important for long-term weight loss, and your counselor can offer this support.

, If you don't have a center nearby, you can call for Jenny Craig Anywhere. This program provides consultation over the phone instead of in person. The number to call is call (800) 597-5366, option 2., Generally, you must order two weeks of meals at a time. The first time you order, the foods are chosen for you. After the first time, you can change your food up.However, if you're not quite ready to commit to two weeks, they do have a three-day sample you can try, which comes with nine meals (three each of breakfast, lunch, and dinner), three snacks, and three salad dressings. As of 2016, this sample is $40., On Jenny Craig, you can stick to preplanned meals, meaning the company will just send you meals based on plans they've decided. Some customers find this easiest because they don't have to make decisions. However, if you prefer to have more can control, you can also customize your plan., Jenny Craig allows you to decide what meals you'll eat each week. You can customize your meal plan by discussing it with your consultant in person or over the phone or by going online.You will need to supplement your meals with fresh fruits, vegetables, and dairy. Jenny Craig foods are meant to be consumed with these ""Fresh and Free"" additions.
Fresh and Free additions are added for nutritional value and variety, and include foods like salad greens, non-starchy vegetables, and a Jenny Craig soup you can make, which is full of vegetables.
The meals are all priced differently, so if you're on a budget, you can buy meals that are priced less.

, To order food online, you'll need to register your account information. You'll also need to set up a username and password so you can access your account again next time. Beyond that, ordering food works much like any online buying system. You add items to your account based on how many meals you have left in your plan, and then pay for them., Once you decide on your meals, they will be shipped to your center or to you. If you have them shipped to you, you may pay extra for shipping. The meals mostly come frozen, with the exception of some of the bars and breakfast items., Another option is to use recipes provided by Jenny Craig.

Choose low-carb protein options.,
Use unsweetened or low-sugar (less than 3 grams) dairy products.,
Pick out low-sugar fruits.,
Incorporate non-starchy vegetables.,
Limit higher carb foods.",How to Choose Low Carb Breakfast Options1," Protein is an essential nutrient in your diet. It's especially important to include protein at breakfast since protein will provide your body with the energy it needs to get your day started.


Protein-rich foods are naturally carbohydrate-free. You don't have to worry about counting carbs when you're eating some of these foods.Here are some examples of protein foods you can include at breakfast: sausage, bacon, ham, lox, smoked fish, eggs, nuts or tofu.
Measure out your portion of protein at your breakfast meal. Eating one to two servings is appropriate. Go for 3 – 4 oz or 1/2 cup of protein per serving.;
, Dairy products, like cheese or milk, do contain a lot of protein, but they also contain carbohydrates. Some dairy products also contain added sugars. It's important to make smart choices from this food group — make sure you carefully read the nutrition label to find out if there is added sugar and how many carbs are contained in a single serving.


Although you may associate items like yogurt or cheese as being high in protein (which they are), these foods also contain a naturally occurring sugar known as lactose.This sugar varies in different dairy products, but gives them a higher carbohydrate content compared to protein foods like fish, chicken or eggs.
The lowest carbohydrate dairy products include: low-fat or fat-free milk, plain greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or cheese.
Of course, always measure your portion sizes of whatever dairy product you choose to eat. Go for 1 oz of cheese or 1 cup of milk, yogurt or cottage cheese., The fruit group is well known as a carbohydrate-containing group; however, it's not wise to completely avoid this nutrient-rich food group.If you want to include an occasional serving of fruit for a low-carb breakfast option, go with low-sugar fruits. These fruits are naturally lower in fructose (the natural sugar in fruit) which lowers their overall carbohydrate intake.
The best fruits to choose for a low-carb breakfast include: cranberries, blackberries, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and apples.Always measure your portions of fruit to help control the total carbohydrate count for your breakfast meal. Only eat 1 small piece or about 1/2 cup of fruit chopped.
Items like dried fruit or canned fruit in syrup are much higher in sugar and also carbohydrates. Try to avoid these if you want to stick to a low-carb breakfast meal.

, A more uncommon breakfast food group is non-starchy vegetables; however, these nutrient-rich veggies are a great low-carb addition to your morning meal.


Similar to protein foods, non-starchy vegetables are naturally very low in carbohydrates, and most of these carbs are fiber, so if you stick to less than 1 cup of cooked or 2 cups of raw at a time, then you don't have to count them toward your daily total intake.Non-starchy vegetables are lower in carbohydrates and are appropriate to eat in large quantities. Items like corn, potatoes, lentils, beans or yams do contain a high amount of starch and are much higher in carbohydrates.
Examples of non-starchy vegetables you can include at breakfast are: spinach, kale, onions, mushrooms, peppers, olives, tomatoes, asparagus or zucchini.
Getting in a serving of non-starchy vegetables at breakfast is a great idea since you need about three servings total daily. Measure out 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of leafy greens per serving., To make sure that your breakfast meal stays on the low-carb side, you should avoid or at least limit the most common carbohydrate-rich foods.


One very common food group that pops up at breakfast is the grain food group. Whether it's a piece of toast, an English muffin, a bagel, a tortilla or oatmeal, these foods are much higher in carbs compared to others.In addition, starchy vegetables like potatoes or yams are another component of breakfast meals. Again, these are much higher in carbohydrates.
Try to avoid dairy products that are higher in carbohydrates like flavored yogurts, yogurt drinks or regular yogurt. These have more added sugar or naturally occurring sugar which increases their carbohydrate content.
These foods aren't necessarily unhealthy, but they do contain a higher amount of carbohydrates and should be limited if your goal is to have a low-carb breakfast.

Buy Vitamin B-12 pills.,
Consider a general multivitamin.,
Ask about a prescription niacin supplement.,
Use an iron supplement.,
Avoid the need for supplements through a varied diet.",How to Buy Supplements for a Raw Food Diet2," Vitamin B-12 is essential for the health of your central nervous system and red blood cell health. Individuals deficient in B-12 may suffer from anemia, depression, dementia, or a serious problem with the nervous system.


Vitamin B-12 is found naturally in meat and dairy products. If you include milk, cheese, eggs, and occasional sources of animal meat proteins in your diet, you will be significantly less likely to become deficient in vitamin B-12 or to need a supplement.

, Because raw food diets can be low in other essential nutrients, such as calcium and vitamin D, taking a multi-vitamin formulated for your sex and age may be an easy way to ensure that you are not missing certain nutrients primarily found in animal products.

, Over-the-counter niacin supplements can help raise levels of healthy cholesterol in the blood, but prescription supplements have fewer side effects and better contributions on HDL levels than store-bought supplements.


If you prefer to raise your HDL levels through food products, consider eating more healthy fats. Nuts and plant-based oils, such as olive or flaxseed oils, can also help raise HDL levels without supplements.

, Iron pills should only be used until healthy blood levels of iron are achieved. Afterward, it is preferable to consume sufficient iron through leafy green vegetables.

, Eat a variety of colors and types of foods every day.


Consider adding cooked foods or certain animal products to your diet a few times each week to prevent deficiencies in B-12 and HDL cholesterol. A varied diet and the inclusion of some cooked and animal-based foods make a raw food diet more sustainable over the long term.

Research national production standards.,
Examine the amount of the supplement in each pill.",How to Buy Supplements for a Raw Food Diet3," If the brand you are considering purchasing promotes the use of safety standards on its labels and discusses its practices in depth on its website, it is likely you have found a dependable brand.

, Large doses of particular nutrients should only be taken on a regular basis under guidance of a physician.


If you are beginning to supplement your raw food diet with vitamins or minerals, opt for low-dose pills.

,


If you are a member who pays weekly as you attend meetings, and are not enrolled in any online services, all you have to do is let your leader know you are discontinuing your program and stop attending meetings.

Prepare quick and on the go breakfast meals.",How to Choose Low Carb Breakfast Options2," A tasty Mediterranean spin on breakfast is a Greek-inspired omelet. Full of vegetables and protein, this is a great low-carb meal to start your day off.Heat a small sauté pan over medium high heat. Add in 1 teaspoon of olive oil to coat the pan.
While the pan heats, scramble two eggs in a small bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.
Pour the eggs into the sauté pan. Swirl the eggs in the pan gently so the entire bottom of the pan is coated in egg. Allow the eggs to cook slightly before adding in the toppings.
Sprinkle on 2 tablespoons of feta cheese, 1 teaspoon of chopped fresh oregano, 2 tablespoons of diced tomatoes and four to five sliced black olives to one side of the omelet.

Enjoy!, If your traditional scrambled eggs are getting a little boring in the morning, try making your own mini frittatas. They're a great make ahead meal for busy mornings.Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees F (or 175 degrees C). Spray a regular sized muffin tin with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.
In a large bowl, beat together the following frittata ingredients: six jumbo eggs, 1/4 teaspoon of both salt and pepper, 1 cup shredded cheese (use your favorite), 1 cup shredded zucchini and 1/2 cup of diced onion.
Carefully pour the frittata mixture into the muffin tins. They should fill the muffin tins evenly. Bake your mini frittatas for about 20 minutes or until they are cooked through.
Remove from muffin tins and allow to fully cool on a rack. Enjoy warm.

, Another non-traditional way to enjoy eggs in the morning is baking them along with avocados. This breakfast is high in protein and high in healthy fats.Start this recipe by preheating your oven to 425 degrees F (or 220 degrees C).
Slice two avocados in half and carefully remove the pit. Lightly salt and pepper the sides of each avocado half. Place each avocado half in a small ramekin or bowl to help keep them stable while they bake.
Carefully crack one egg into each avocado half. Place the small bowls on a sheet tray or baking sheet and place in the oven. Cook for about 15 minutes or until the egg is cooked through.
Allow baked avocado eggs to cool for about five minutes. Then serve warm.

, If you're short on time, consider making meals ahead of time or making a low-carb breakfast you can eat on the go. Ideas to try include:


A pre-made protein shake or protein bar.
Two hard boiled eggs and a cheese stick.
An individual plain Greek yogurt with nuts.
An individual cup of cottage cheese with nuts and low sugar fruit.

Talk to your doctor.,
Count your daily carbohydrate intake.,
Choose a variety of foods from low-carb food groups.,
Incorporate nutritious sources of carbohydrates.,
Consider following low-carb diet plans.,
Follow a low-carb diet when you go out to eat.",How to Choose Low Carb Breakfast Options3," Whenever you're starting a new diet, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor first. This is especially important if you're following a diet that's limiting an important macronutrient like carbohydrates.


Although a low-carb diet is most likely safe for most people, there are some health conditions that this may not be safe for. Ask your doctor if they think a low-carb diet is appropriate for your current health conditions.
If weight loss is your goal, talk to your doctor about other ways to lose weight. They may have some additional resources or advice for you.

, If you want to really be specific with your low-carb diet, keep a count of your total carbohydrate intake each day. This is great if you're aiming to keep your total carbs under a specific amount.Consider downloading a food journaling app that keeps track of your nutrient intake each day.
You will be able to see how many carbohydrates you're eating as you continuously track more and more foods throughout the day.
For example, if you notice your carbohydrate intake getting close to your limit by lunch, you'll know that dinner has to be exceptionally low-carbohydrate.

, In general, a low-carbohydrate diet isn't necessarily considered balanced. You will be limiting your intake of a variety of food groups (like grains, starchy vegetables, fruit and some dairy products). To help compensate for this to some degree, make sure you choose a variety of low-carb foods daily.


Even though you're limiting your overall food choices, make sure to choose a variety of other foods. The more foods you include in your diet, the bigger the variety of nutrients you'll be getting.
For example, don't only have steamed broccoli or cauliflower for side dishes. Try dark greens, eggplant, asparagus, peppers, artichokes, brussels sprouts or zucchini. Each one of these veggies offers you a different set of nutrients.

, Following a low-carb diet doesn't mean that you can't have any carbs. Some carbohydrates are essential to the normal functioning of your body, so make sure you choose nutritious sources of these foods when you do eat them.


Many low-carb dieters avoid grains since they have some of the highest carb counts; however, 100% whole grains are a great choice if you do decide to have a grain-based food.
Whole grains are less processed and contain higher amounts of fiber and protein compared to more refined grains (like white rice or white bread).Always measure your portion sizes of these higher carb foods. For grains, measure out 1 oz or 1/2 cup per serving., If you want to have a more structured diet to follow, consider following a plan like Atkins or South beach. These diets can help you lose weight and give you more ideas for low-carb meals.


Look online for low-carb diet plans. Atkins and South Beach are very common and have a variety of resources you can use to help you follow a reduced carb diet.Many of these diet plans also have books with meal plans, recipes and grocery lists to help you build low-carb meals.

, In addition to eating low-carb breakfasts, you'll also want to choose low-carb meals when you go out to eat. This will help you stay consistent with your diet.


When you're out, review the entire menu before making any decisions on your meal. This will help you figure out exactly what's offered and what options you have.
Look over the menu to see if they have a ""healthy,"" ""reduced calorie"" or ""low-carb"" section. Many restaurants help consumers by highlighting these types of meals.
If you can't find specific ""low-carb meals,"" just order a meal that contains a source of protein (like chicken, fish, pork or beef) and a vegetable.
You can order a side dish of vegetables or ask to skip a starchy or high-carb item (like fries or potatoes) for a side of vegetables.

Eat plant-based proteins.,
Decrease the amount of carbohydrates you eat in a gradual manner.,
Limit the amount of sugary foods that you eat.,
Consume dairy products.",How to Be Atkins Diet and Gout Friendly1," The Atkins diet focuses heavily on consuming proteins. Unfortunately, many meat-based proteins can exacerbate gout, so striking a healthy balance between both diets will help to live the lifestyle you have chosen. In order to do this, stick to proteins that are plant-based. These foods will give you the protein that the Atkins diet demands, while limiting your consumption of uric acid to cater to your gout because plant-based proteins have low levels of purines. These proteins include:


Legumes like soybeans, lentils and garbanzo beans.
Nuts and seeds like cashews, sesame seeds, and walnuts.
Grains like quinoa and oatmeal.
Vegetables like broccoli and spinach.;
, While the Atkins diet says to limit your carbohydrate intake, having gout means that you should be eating complex carbohydrates. However, in this case you can try to stick to the Atkins diet. However, you should not cut all your carbs out immediately. Instead, reduce the amount of carbs you eat very slowly.Rather than going from eating one cup of rice to no rice at all, cut back your carbs by eating half a cup of rice, rather than a full cup. Slowly reducing your carbs will allow your kidneys to adjust to the changes you are making to your diet while still being able to excrete purines.
Slowly decreasing the amount of carbs you eat may also help you to decrease your weight. This will be discussed further in the next section of this article.

, Both having gout and the Atkins diet require that you limit the number of sugary treats and sodas that you consume. The Atkins diet says to do this because those foods get stored in your body as fat, causing you to can weight. Having gout requires you to cut back on these foods because many of them contain uric acid.These foods include:


Candies and sweets.
Sodas, juices from concentrate, and other soft drinks.
Instead, drink natural fruit juices that do not have additives because they stimulate the production of less uric acid.

, Dairy products are thought to decrease the amount of uric acid contained in your blood, which is good for living a gout-friendly lifestyle. At the same time, most dairy products contain protein, which works in favor of the Atkins diet.Drink one to two glasses of milk regularly.
You can also eat foods like yogurt and cheese.

Include whole grains.",How to Become a Pescetarian," Typically, pescetarians follow a plant-based diet and do not consume red meat, poultry, pork or lamb. The majority of their protein is coming from plant-based sources like beans, nuts or lentils in addition to fish and shellfish. All other food groups — like whole grains, fruits and vegetables — are consumed on a regular basis.


A healthy diet goes beyond limiting animal products. In addition, you want to focus on well-balanced meals, healthy cooking techniques, limiting processed foods and refined sugar and drinking adequate amounts of water each day.
Pescetarian diets are also beneficial to your health. They may help you manage or lower your cholesterol levels, and reduce your risk for cardiovascular disease.;
, Depending on how restrictive you want your diet to be, you may chose to include or not include foods like eggs and dairy products; however, if you're transitioning from a typical, average diet, it may be easier to include dairy foods and eggs to help give you some variety.


Incorporate a variety of proteins into your pescetarian diet outside of seafood. If you're consuming eggs and dairy products, they're an excellent source of protein. In fact, the egg has the highest biological value of all proteins. The biological value provides a measurement of how efficient the body utilizes protein consumed in the diet.In addition, don't forget about beans, lentils, nuts and whole grains!
Ensure that your meals feature fruits, vegetables, whole grains and dairy (if you're including this) each day. This means you have a well-balanced diet.

, Take a trip to your local or online book store and think about buying a few quality printed resources. Cookbooks and magazines that feature pescetarian recipes will help motivate and excite you as your transition to this new eating pattern.


Cookbooks have a wide arrangement of recipes and are a great resource to browse through. Plus, they generally have great photographs which can help motivate you to continue with your new eating pattern.
Go beyond printed resources and find bloggers that post regularly about pescetarian recipes. They might also have good tips on adopting this new eating pattern.

, Finding friends, co-workers or others who also follow a pescetarian diet can be helpful. They'll be a great support to you as you make your new diet transition.


You can try joining online communities or forums where you can post questions, link up with other pescetarians and get helpful information from others already following this diet pattern.
Take a cooking class. Many restaurants, cooking stores and private companies offer cooking classes. Try signing up with a friend or family member for a class that focuses on seafood preparation.

, Transitioning to a new diet may affect more than just you. If you're living at home with your family, your dietary changes may influence what is purchased and prepared at home. Speak to your family members about what you'll be changing in your diet and what foods you will and will not be eating. Make sure they fully understand what a pescetarian diet is.


If some family members want to continue eating meat or animal products, that's OK. Discuss with them how you can accommodate both eating styles in your household. A quick family meeting will help.
Ask your family members if they'd be interesting in following a pescetarian diet along with you. They might be interested in following a pescetarian diet a few days a week or a few specific meals during the week. Finding a common ground may help cut down on extra food prep for a variety of different eating patterns.

, Switching to any new diet or eating pattern will most likely require that you prep your kitchen and re-stock your pantry and refrigerator with new or different types of foods. Purchase a variety of seafood each week.


Keep frozen seafood, canned tuna or salmon or frozen salmon or tuna burgers on hand as well. They have a longer shelf life and can be used in a pinch or when fresh seafood isn't available.
You might also want to consider purchasing special kitchen tools or equipment. For example, a fish filleting knife, fish spatula or boning tweezers; however, these aren't necessary for general seafood preparation.
Purchase spices or seasonings that complement seafood well. For example, Old Bay is a mixed seasoning blend designed for fish and shellfish. It's a quick all-in-one spice that will boost up the flavor of your dishes.
In addition, stock up on fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains so you have all the food groups to make well-balanced meals.

, If you're busy or on the go, prepping weekly meal plans can help you easily implement a pescetarian diet. Take an hour or two each week and write out each of your meals. Then, write up a grocery list of all the items you need to purchase that week. It'll help keep you on track and minimize the time you spending shopping and looking for items in the store.


Find meals that can be prepared in advanced. If your weeknights are busy, doing some meal prep on the weekends or during your free time can make weeknight dinners a breeze. Prepare lunches or parts of your dinners ahead to cut down on cooking time.
Creating meal plans in advance can also help cut down on costs. You'll buy the items that you need and skip purchasing things you think you need but already have at home.
Breakfast ideas can include: whole wheat English muffin with an egg and cheese; an individual low-fat Greek yogurt with fruit; or high-fiber, high-protein cereal with almond milk.
Lunch ideas can include: grilled salmon over a spinach salad; two grilled shrimp and vegetable soft tacos; or lentil and vegetable salad with a vinaigrette dressing.
Dinner ideas can include: grilled mahimahi with brown rice and steamed mixed vegetables; portobello mushroom burgers with baked sweet potato fries; or salmon burgers and a small green salad.

, Seafood can be intimidating to prepare. Many people have never tried or only prepared one or two types of fish. Review a variety of recipes and keep trying new things. The longer you stick with the plan, the more comfortable you'll become preparing a wide variety of fish and shellfish.


Try to incorporate some cold-water fish like salmon, tuna or mackerel. These fish are known as ""fatty fish"" and generally contain higher amounts of heart-healthy omega-3 fats. Try to consume these anywhere from two to three times per week.
If preparing a seafood-based meal each night is overwhelming, try focusing on one new recipe or one new type of seafood per week. This will help expose you to a variety of cooking techniques, but will be less stressful.
Start with a simple meal or recipe. Or incorporate recipes you already make that feature seafood more often into your weekly meals.

, Fish and seafood are the defining trademarks of a pescetarian diet; however, don't forget about plant-based sources of protein too. Items like beans, lentils, nuts and whole grains are healthy, lean sources of protein.


Meat replacements, tofu, tempeh, seitan and veggie burgers are other great sources of protein that will fit into a pescetarian diet.
Keep a stock of canned beans, nuts and whole grains for quick and easy meals.
Plant-based proteins can also be the main source of protein in your meals. It's not necessary to make seafood the main source of protein in each meal. Quinoa, for example, is a great source of protein as it contains all nine essential amino acids.

, It's important to find a trustworthy market with knowledgeable staff. The fishmonger is person at the store or market who orders, handles and manages all the seafood and the department. They will be able to provide accurate information on the quality of the seafood, whether it was fresh or frozen, whether it was farmed or wild and how sustainable the fish is.


Try to avoid road-side stands that sell seafood. You won't be able to tell where or when the seafood was harvested or know the reliability of the individual selling it to you.
Also invest some time reading and researching websites like Seafood Health Facts or Fish Watch. They are reliable, trustworthy sources of information. They review the safety, sustainability and health of seafood.

, Many people think that fresh foods are always better; however, many times frozen foods — especially seafood — are sometimes more fresh. When fish and shellfish are harvested, they are immediately cleaned and frozen on the boat — at the peak of freshness. Many times, seafood that's labeled as fresh was harvested several days prior, however it should have never been previously frozen.


Ensure you thaw frozen fish properly. Take frozen items and place them in a sealed container in the bottom of the refrigerator and allow them to defrost overnight.
Purchase frozen fish that's packaging is intact and completely frozen solid.
At well-stocked grocery stores and markets, there are a large variety of frozen fish and shellfish available. You're options are far from limited if you choose frozen items.

, Once you have chosen the store or market where you're going to purchase your seafood, evaluate the quality and freshness of the options available. Look at the display or counter. All seafood should be kept at 32 °F (0 °C) and be on ice.When you're purchasing whole fish like a trout or mackerel, pay attention to the eyes. They should be bright and clear. As fish ages, the eyes will get cloudy and sunk in — this will indicate fish that is not fresh.
Fish fillets should have firm, elastic flesh. They should also have a clear, shiny appearance to them. Fillets that are prepackaged should contain some liquid, however it should be at a minimum.
Shellfish like mussels, oysters or clams can be sold live, cooked or freshly shucked. If you're purchasing live shellfish, look for unbroken shells that close tightly if squeezed. If the shells do not close, they are most likely dead and not fresh.
Scallops are also considered shellfish, but are generally sold freshly shucked. They should be firm with a creamy white color and a slightly sweet smell. Scallops that smell sour indicate they are most likely spoiled.
Do not hesitate to ask to look at your fish selections up close. You'll get a better idea of what it smells like, how it's flesh looks and it's overall appearance.

, Try to choose fish and shellfish that are ethically farmed or raised. You can always ask your fishmonger for more information on the items they have for sale. In addition, check out the EDF Seafood Selector Guide for more information.


Sustainable seafood includes fisheries that handle plentiful species in addition to species that are lower on the food chain (they can reproduce quicker and maintain an adequate population).They also have to maintain a variety of very high standards and fishing practices.
Choosing fish and shellfish that are sustainable helps ensure some more rare species are not overfished. When certain species are overfished, it increases their chances to reach critically low levels which can affect the environment, food chain and the longevity of the species.
Sustainable species include fish such as: Alaskan Cod, farmed Artic Char, Atlantic Pollock, Catfish, Dover Sole, U.S. MahiMahi, Alaskan and Canadian Halibut and farmed Rainbow Trout .

, Many plant-based diets like the pescetarian diet do include eggs and dairy products while others do not. These foods, especially when ethically raised, are a great and healthy addition to your diet. Both are wonderful sources of protein in addition to having a variety of important nutrients.


You can also trying using dairy alternatives like soy or almond milk, soy based yogurt or vegan cheeses. This will allow you more flexibility with your food choices and recipes.
If you choose to omit eggs and dairy be mindful to replace the nutrients prevalent in those foods. For example, dairy foods are high in calcium. Try getting your daily calcium from foods like dark greens, almonds or fortified orange juice.

, Although a pescetarian diet does have a focus on fish and shellfish, you cannot forget about the main components of this type of diet — fruits and vegetables. Produce is truly the crux of all healthy diets. These plants are high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. They're incredibly important to your diet and health.


Make 50% of most of your meals a fruit or vegetable. These low-calorie, nutrition powerhouses will fill you up, keep you satisfied and add an array of nutrients to your diet.
When you're including fruits and vegetables into your diet, try to eat fruits and vegetables that are different in color each day. You'll get a variety of different nutrients with each colored fruit or vegetable.

, Many people forget that whole grains are not only a great source of fiber, but also contain protein.


Pair whole grains with legumes like lentils and beans for the perfect protein combo. Pairing these two types of foods together makes them a complete protein. This means, this combination has all of the necessary amino acids for your body.
Aim to make most of your grain choices whole grain if possible. Try whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, 100% whole wheat pasta, farro or oats.

Take advantage of “superfoods.” The Atkins diet has superfoods that serve as the cornerstones of healthy eating on the plan.",How to Avoid the Pit Falls of the Atkins Diet," Many people have a tendency to overlook the importance of vegetables when they significantly restrict carbs and increase protein. Also, some people don’t want to “spend” their daily carbs on vegetables, which do contain carbohydrates, however negligible. You run the risk of nutrient deficiencies if you do not ensure that you’re getting enough vitamins and minerals.Your goal is approximately two cups of steamed veggies and six cups of leafy greens per day.;
, A pitfall of any diet is not drinking enough water. You need at least 64 ounces per day, although the bigger you are, the more water you need. Your urine should be clear or very pale yellow and you shouldn’t feel thirsty. Drinking water increases your metabolism and helps you burn fat.The Atkins diet is a diuretic, and you’ll need to compensate for lost water.You need to increase your water consumption even more if you go into a state of ketosis, as water will dilute the ketone buildup in your system.
Ketosis can occur on a low-carbohydrate diet, where body fat is used for fuel instead of glucose from carbohydrates.

, It’s much easier to maintain a diet when eating at home. Going out to eat puts you at risk of not finding something within Atkins guidelines, either forcing you to eat nothing and be hungry, or forcing you to go off your plan “just this once.” Instead of falling into that trap, do your research. Look up menus online, call around, and see which establishments offer Atkins-friendly foods., The Atkins diet calls for you to record your daily net carbs, which is the number you get after subtracting grams of fiber from your total carbs. Carbohydrates are found in breads, cereals, rice, pastas, beans, fruits and vegetables. There are no carbohydrates in meat or in fat. You count carbs because that is what impacts blood sugar. Fiber is a carb, but it has no impact on blood sugar, so make sure you subtract it from the total carb count of the food.


Sugar substitutes, for example, automatically count as one gram of net carbs.
Read the labels on your foods. A low-carb, soft tortilla has 11 grams total carbohydrate and 6 grams of fiber. 11 - 6 = 5 grams net carbs.

, The natural fluctuations in your daily weight can be discouraging and frustrating if you’re focusing solely on the number on the scale. Rather than weigh yourself every day, weigh yourself weekly. Take your measurements weekly as well, because you may see measurement changes one week even if you don’t see the scale budge much.


Exercising will build muscle, which weighs more than fat, and that might prevent the scale from moving some weeks. This is why you should also take body measurements.

, If you are used to consuming carbohydrates, immediate carbohydrate restriction may produce some immediate side effects. Keep an eye out for these symptoms and contact your doctor if they persist or get worse.Dizziness
Constipation
Fatigue
Headache
Weakness

, Be sure to avoid possible nutritional deficiencies that may result from such a restrictive diet. To make up for deficiencies, you can take supplements.Pay particular attention to:


Thiamin
Potassium
Folate
Vitamins C, D, and E
Magnesium
Iron
Calcium
Sodium

, The Atkins Diet calls for high intakes of protein, and many dieters opt for proteins that are also high in saturated fats. This high level of saturated fat intake increases your risk for heart disease, especially in women.Diets high in processed meats and red meats also increase your risk for type II diabetes, increase your cholesterol, and increase your risk of certain cancers, coronary heart disease, and chronic obstructive lung disease., Research shows that most people who go on a low-carbohydrate diet will ultimately end up gaining more weight than they lost. This may be due to the high protein component of the diet. Additionally, some studies indicate a correlation between low-carbohydrate diets and increased risk of heart disease., Consuming minimal carbohydrates can put you in a state of ketosis, which is the process of your body burning stored fat in the body rather than sugar while building ketones in your body.Immediate side effects of ketosis are nausea, physical and mental fatigue, headache, mental fatigue, and bad breath (smells like alcohol or like nail polish remover). The long-term effects are unknown.

, Originally the Atkins diet advised that exercise wasn’t necessary; however, they have since revised that guideline and encourage regular exercise as a healthy component of the plan. Consider aerobic exercise combined with weight training, as approved by your physician.Aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week (or 30 minutes five days a week) as well as 20 minutes of strength training two to three times a week.

, The Atkins diet has four phases: the Induction phase (1), the Balancing phase (2), the Fine-tuning phase (3), and the Maintenance (4) phase. Some people associate the Atkins Diet with Phase 1 only, the phase in which you restrict your carbs to under 20 grams daily. You cannot reasonably maintain the unrealistic diet of Phase 1 indefinitely, and you should move on to the next phases as the program suggests., There are some low-carbohydrate diets that suggest you can eat whatever sources of protein you want in unlimited quantities, including processed meats, smoked meats, fatty meats, red meats, and salty meats. These can lead to a variety of health problems and should be eaten sparingly. Instead, opt for lean meats, such as fish, chicken, and turkey.Don’t forget non-meat sources of protein, such as nuts and seeds and full-fat dairy products., People tend to overestimate portion sizes, sabotaging any weight-loss efforts. Previously the Atkins diet did not include portion sizes; however, they have since revised their protocols to help people see the results that they want. To successfully navigate this diet, pay attention to your portion sizes and account for everything that goes in your mouth., Atkins recommends wholesome, healthy foods, such as vegetables, avocados, fatty fish, and eggs. These foods deliver lots of nutrients, healthy fats, and fill you up without significant carbohydrates."

Watch canned fruit.,
Use caution when consuming sugar alcohols.,

Limit honey and maple syrup.",How to Balance Sugar on the Atkins Diet1," Words like dextrose, fructose, high fructose corn syrup and “natural flavors” often indicate added sugar. Always check for hidden sugars in prepared sauces and salad dressings.;
, Read the nutrition information label to find out how many carbohydrates are in the product.

, Eat fruit that is canned in water, not syrup.

, If a product contains more than 5 grams of sugar alcohols, then the sugar alcohol may affect your blood sugar levels. Every gram of sugar exceeding 5 grams should count as 1/2 carbohydrate.

, While food labels often show the number of grams of sugar in a product, you should be most concerned with the net carb count. Other carbs besides sugars have an equally significant effect on blood sugar.

, Even though these sweeteners are natural, they still contain sugars that will affect your blood glucose.

Let yourself daydream and have fun with your visualizations. Let anything be possible. These happy thoughts can be inspiring and motivating to you.;
, If you've never made an inspiration or visualization board before, you might want to get some ideas of what to do before making one for yourself.


Go online and search for ""vision boards"" or ""inspiration boards."" Many blogs, websites and pictures will come up that you can use to get an idea of how to design your own board.
Inspiration boards are becoming more popular lately. Ask friends, family members or coworkers if they've made one before. They may share theirs with you or be able to give you some ideas.
You can also talk to the staff at craft stores or scrap book stores for ideas on supplies you'll need and items you can put on your board.

, Before starting your inspiration board, stock up on some craft supplies. This will help make sure that you can put your board together exactly as you want.Head to a craft store or find an online site that sells craft supplies. They might even have ideas or products (like cork board or a dry erase board) that are designed for inspiration boards.
Purchase items like: glue, construction paper, scissors, tape, thumb tacks, stickers, or colored pens and pencils.

, Decide what sort of board you want. Each type of board will give you different options.


Choose between cardboard, hardboard, pin board, or even a dry erase board. If you want to make a board that you can change or update think about choosing a dry erase board or pin board.
Also choose an appropriate size. Think about where you'll be hanging your board and purchase a board that will fit.

, When choosing images, think of the things that will inspire you most.You may choose to put up pictures of inspiring people, clothing, or motivational phrases.
You can even post pictures of what you want to do or feel like when you've reached your goal weight.
By all means use pictures of bodies that you aspire to look like but be realistic. Photos of celebrities or models may present an unrealistic ideal that can't be obtained. Choose role models who have a healthy weight and look healthy.
Choose images that inspire you now and that you connect with. Remember that whenever you're feeling down, you want to be able to look at these pictures and remember what you're aiming for rather than feeling like you can't match up, ever.

, Pin up photos of healthier substitutes alongside your favorite foods.


For example, list hamburgers from a fast food outlet in one column and in the other column, list a homemade burger using healthier and lower calorie products.
It's even better if you can use images and not just words (perhaps take photos of the old food and the new food). In times of temptation, look at this list for inspiring healthier alternatives.

, Weight loss is about both food and exercise. If you want to be inspired with exercising routines, add some shortcut reminders that will help you remember your exercise routine.


This could be a series of sports images, a set of URLs for online exercise tutorials or comic-strip like exercise images for an exercise you want to do every single day (such as push ups).
You can also post up pictures of activities you want to do when you're fit - like crossing the finish line of a race.
In addition, put up pictures of fun workout clothes, shoes or put the lyrics up of inspiring workout songs.

, On your inspiration board add a table or chart to record your progress to encourage you to keep going.Another idea is to add a barometer that goes up as your weight comes down. Use any idea that is easy to add and update.
Track progress of your weight, improved eating habits or improved fitness levels.
You can also use a cut out of yourself moving along a timeline towards your goal.

, Over time you may want to make some changes to your inspiration board.


This will be especially true if you've met your goals, made progress or have changed your goals.
Change out pictures or motivational sayings as you've progressed closer toward your goal or have met your goal. You might want to change this to reflect maintenance if you need to.

, If you've made a fairly interactive inspiration board, be sure to follow up with the tasks you've set, or make use of its information to keep you going.


Add and remove things from the board as needed; you can paste new things over the top of old if needed. Be flexible, as your weight loss is a journey of a changing you.
Place the inspiration board somewhere prominent. Choose a spot where you will see the board daily and be inspired by its content.

, Whenever you're attempting to lose weight, it's a good idea to chat with your doctor first. They'll be able to tell whether weight loss is safe and appropriate for you.

Drinks lots of fluids.,
Reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, or cut it out of your life entirely.",How to Be Atkins Diet and Gout Friendly2," While the Atkins diet promotes weight loss, it is important to lose that weight gradually in order to keep your gout in check. When you lose weight at a rapid pace, your uric acid levels can increase, causing your gout to flare up. To lose weight gradually, create a regular exercise routine and eat healthy.To read more about create a health exercise routine, click here.


, As mentioned previously, it is important to lose weight slowly in order to keep your gout from being exacerbated. To do this, set a long term weight loss goal for yourself. Try to lose about one to two pounds each week, rather than starving yourself to drop a bunch of weight at once (which is very unhealthy).


To help you stay on track, record your weight loss goals and advances in a journal. You can also use an app on your phone to help you keep track of what you eat each day, and help you to visualize your goal.

, When trying to be both Atkins and gout friendly, it is important to drink plenty of water. Staying hydrated will help you to dilute the uric acid in your blood so that it can be eliminated more easily through your urine.


While everyone needs to drink a different amount of water, in general, an average adult woman should try to drink 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water each day, while an average adult man should try to drink 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water each day., To live both an Atkins and gout friendly lifestyle, you should try to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, or stop drinking it at all. Alcohol can increase the level of toxic substances in your body, which can slow down the secretion of uric acid.


Limit yourself to one or two drinks when you are not experiencing an attack of gout, and cut it out entirely when you are experiencing a gout attack.

One pound is 3,500 calories. You have seven days to lose ten of those.
3,500 x 10 = 35,000 calories to be lost.
35,000 / 7 = 5,000 lost per day.

Note that it is likely physically impossible for you to cut out 5,000 calories per day. That is over 2 times what the average male is recommended to eat in a day. Even a morbidly obese person may not be able to lose that.
Luckily, it's not just diet that controls calories: exercise does as well. In this rapid and intense diet, both are needed. However, this ability will be compromised if you are severely cutting food intake.;
, Being obligated to face what you're eating is going to keep you conscious of what you decide to put into your body. Keep a journal and write down every single thing you eat and drink for this week.


Make yourself accountable. Show your journal at the end of every day to a friend, family member, or trainer. Knowing you have to face another person's judgment might give you the extrinsic motivation you couldn't give yourself. If they're willing, have them keep a daily log of their diet with you.
You don't have to just log your food! Log your exercise, too! That way you'll see your combined efforts and be totally wowed.

, Sometimes its hard to be so strict on ourselves when we're going through something alone. After all, does the world end if you eat that candy bar? No. Grab a friend and let them help you on your quest.


Make every social activity active. Get your family and friends cooking instead of going out. When your community is supporting you and not showering you in temptations, success will come a lot easier.

Keep a food journal for a week.,
Reduce your caloric intake by 500 calories daily.,
Follow appropriate portion sizes.,
Choose lower calorie foods.,
Limit liquid calories.,
Cut out excess snacking.",How to Lose Hip Fat1," Continue eating in a normal manner. You can use this journal as a baseline for changing your diet.


A food journal can let you see into your diet and give you clues about things you can change to help result in weight loss.
Take note of portion sizes, snacking, liquid calories or higher fat foods you typically eat. Star these items or make a list to help you get started with your diet plan.
Continue to keep your food journal when you're trying to lose weight. Studies show that those who stick to their food journals are more successful with weight loss long-term.;
, By reducing the amount you are eating, you can signal to your body to start using its stored fat for energy (including the fat stored in your hips).


In order to lose weight and reduce excess body fat in your entire body and in your hips, you'll need to cut calories. Reduced caloric intake overtime will result in weight loss.
Cutting about 500 calories daily generally results in about a one to two pound weight loss each week.Health professionals considered this safe and healthy weight loss.
Use your food journal to help you see what types of foods you can cut to result in a 500 calorie deficit.

, Following appropriate portion sizes in each of your meals will help you manage your calories and lose weight.To help you measure portion sizes appropriately, consider buying a food scale or measuring cups.
It's ideal to measure each meal and snack to make sure you're staying on track. Eyeballing portions can lead to over estimating portion sizes and underestimating your total caloric intake.
Measure foods to the following sizes: 3 to 4 oz (80 to 120 grams) of protein foods (or about the size of a deck of cards), 1 oz of grains or about 1/2 cup (125 ml), one cup (250 ml) vegetables or two cups (500 ml) of leafy greens and 1/2 cup (125 ml) of chopped fruit or one small piece.Include 1 serving of protein and 2 servings of a fruit or vegetable at each meal.It's recommended to consume about two to three servings of grains throughout the day.

, Another item to focus on to help you lose weight in addition to watching calories and portion sizes is choosing lower calorie foods.


Foods that are portion controlled and lower in calorie are the best choice when it comes to weight loss.Choose low-calorie and lean protein foods like: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy products, pork, seafood, legumes and tofu.
Choose 100% whole grains without seasonings or sauces. Whole grains are more nutritious as they have higher amounts of fiber and other nutrients. Purchase grains that do not contain a seasoning packet or a sauce to minimize calories.
Most fruits and vegetables are naturally low in calories. Be careful if you're purchasing canned or frozen items. Make sure they do not contain added seasonings, sauces or added sugars.

, Many times liquid calories are responsible for a large part of the excess calories in your diet. In addition, cutting these out completely can really help you lose weight.Liquid calories are found in a variety of beverages. Limiting or completely avoiding these types of drinks is the best idea to help support your weight loss.
Limit drinks like: regular soda, full fat milk, juices and juice cocktails, alcohol, sweet tea, sweetened coffee drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks and hot chocolate.
Although some drinks contain no calories, they should be limited due to the high amounts of artificial sweeteners and other additives. Limit things like: diet sodas, diet energy drinks and diet sports drinks.
Fill up on clear, hydrating fluids like: water, flavored water, unsweetened decaf coffee and decaf unsweetened tea. Aim for a minimum of eight 8 ounce glasses daily, but you may even need up to 13 glasses daily., Another dangerous area for weight loss is snacking. Too many snacks or grazing constantly throughout the day can sabotage your weight loss.


Health professionals typically recommend that you limit the amount of calories you eat from snacks throughout the day. If your end goal is weight loss, keep snacks to about 150 calories per snack.Depending on your lifestyle and activity level, you typically will only need one to two snacks maximum daily.Eat snacks that combine a low-fat source of protein with a natural high fiber source, such as a fruit or vegetable. Some good snacks to eat include 1 oz of mixed nuts (30 grams) with a medium sized apple, one individual low-fat greek yogurt with 1/2 cup (125 ml) of grapes, 1/2 cup (125 ml) of cottage cheese with one cup (250 ml) of cherry tomatoes, or 3 oz (80 grams) of turkey jerky with one cup (250 ml) of carrot sticks.

Ask your doctor about being referred to a registered dietitian. She may have a colleague she works with on a regular basis.
A registered dietitian is a nutrition expert that can help you design your weight loss plan, assist with meal planning, or suggest certain foods for weight loss.
Visit the EatRight website and click on the orange ""Find an Expert"" button on the top right to search for a dietitian in your area.;
, Losing five pounds in five weeks can be fairly simple — especially when you count calories. To lose about one pound a week, aim to cut out 500 calories daily from your diet. This generally results in about a one pound weight loss per week.


Do not cut out too many calories or eat fewer than 1200 calories daily. This may result in nutrient deficiencies as it can be difficult to consume enough vital nutrients on very low calorie diets., A food journal is a great weight loss tool. You can use it to see what changes you can make in your diet and also to help keep you on track throughout your diet.


Purchase a journal or download a journaling app on your smart phone. Track as many days as you can — both weekday and weekend days. Many people eat differently on the weekends, so including both weekend and weekdays is important.When you're first starting your journal, take note of how many calories you're eating daily. Many of the food journal apps do this for you automatically. This can give you a idea of a calorie goal to follow for your weight loss plan.

, Meal plans are another great tool for weight loss. Planning out your meals and snacks in advance can help you stay on track and stick to your plan.


Consult a dietitian in regards to a meal plan to ensure that it is accurate and appropriate for your health history.
Take a day each week to write out your meal plan. Include all meals and snacks that you'll need for the week.
Your meal plan can also help you create a grocery list each week so you only buy the items you need.

, Protein is an essential nutrient, especially in terms of weight loss. Eating lean protein at each meal has been shown to aid in weight loss and can help you lose more weight in the long-term.Eat an appropriate portion size of protein at each meal. Aim to include about 3-4 oz of lean protein at each meal.This is approximately about the size of a deck of cards or a checkbook.
Include a variety of lean protein at each meal and throughout the day. Lean protein options include: poultry, eggs, lean red meat, pork, seafood, and low-fat dairy.
Vegetarian protein sources are also considered lean. These include: beans, lentils, nuts, tofu, and tempeh.

, Fruits and vegetables should make up a fairly large portion of your diet. These foods are low calorie and full of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.


For a well-balanced diet, try to include a fruit or vegetable at each meal and snack.
One serving of vegetables is about 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy green vegetables.One serving of fruit is 1 small whole fruit, 1 cup of sliced fruit, or 1/2 cup dried fruit., Whole grain foods provide your diet with an essential source of fiber and some vitamin and minerals. They are minimally processed and contain the bran, germ and endosperm of the grain.1 serving of whole grains is 1 oz or 1/2 cup of grains like rice or pasta.Using a food scale is another accurate way of measuring pasta or other grains.
Examples of whole grain foods include: quinoa, brown rice, 100% whole wheat bread, millet, barely, oats, or 100% whole wheat pasta.

, An occasional snack can help make weight loss easier. This is especially true if a snack will help prevent you from overeating at a meal.Take caution when deciding to snack. A snack can be a great tool to get you through an extended period of time between meals (more than four or five hours) or as pre/post workout fuel. Keep snacks to about 100-200 calories. Also, try to include lean protein, fruits or vegetables, or whole grains. The combination of protein and fiber may help keep you satisfied longer. Healthy snacks can include: low-fat cheese and an apple, low-calorie protein bar, or a greek yogurt and fruit.

, Aim to get an adequate amount of fluids daily. It's generally recommended to consume around eight glasses or 64 oz daily. Although the amount is different for everyone, adequate hydration can also aid in weight loss.Keep a water bottle close by and monitor how much you're drinking each day.
Also, drinking right before a meal can calm your hunger and decrease your overall intake at your meal.

, When you're trying to lose weight, it's important to moderate how much you indulge in your favorite foods. Many indulgent foods or comfort foods are higher in calories and fat and can slow down or prevent weight loss.


Save indulgent foods like sweets or higher fat foods for a special occasion. Or, try consuming them in moderation — like once or twice a month.
If you're planning on indulging, consume a small portion to keep the calories in control.

, Drinking alcohol on a regular basis can prevent or slow down your weight loss. Alcohol can be very high in calories and sugar (especially in mixed drinks). Limit or avoid alcohol.


Women should limit alcohol to a maximum of 1 glass daily and men should limit alcohol to a maximum of 2 glasses daily.Like indulgent treats, if you enjoy drinking alcohol, try to consume it in moderation. For example, a glass of wine once or twice a week.

, Although exercise doesn't cause weight loss by itself, including regular physical activity will help support your weight loss efforts. Aim to be active for at least 150 minutes each week.Aerobic activities can include exercises like: dance classes, hiking, jogging, or biking.
Be wary of the calorie estimates on cardio machines. The numbers listed aren't necessarily accurate for your height, weight, or gender., Resistance training is a great compliment to cardiovascular activity and your weight loss. As you build more muscle mass, you will increase your metabolism and burn more calories overall.It's recommended to include two days of strength training each week.Strength training includes activities like: weight lifting, Pilates, or isometric exercises like push-ups or crunches.

, Scheduling a session or two with a personal trainer might be a good idea. This is especially true if you're unfamiliar with some exercises or want to find an exercise routine that will support your new weight loss plan.


A personal trainer can assist you in creating an exercise plan that is progressive, periodized, and appropriate for your abilities/goals.
Many gyms offer a free or discounted personal training session when you join or as part of your membership.
A personal training session might be costly, but you may only need one or two sessions to learn a routine or learn how to use the machines.

, It will be important to weigh yourself at least one to two times per week. This is especially true since you want to lose five pounds in five weeks; since it's a shorter dieting period, you'll want to make sure that your diet plan is working well.


Don't weigh yourself each day. You might notice a slight gain or loss that's just reflective of something you ate or physical activity you did the day before. These fluctuations might not accurately reflect your overall progress. Purchase a home scale so you have the right tools at home to keep yourself on track.
For the most accurate weights, weigh yourself at the same time of day, on the same day of the week, and in the same clothing.
Regular weigh-ins have also been shown to help prevent weight-gain., In order to meet your goal of losing five pounds in five weeks, it'll be important to check in and evaluate your diet along the way. Since the timeline is so short, if you notice your diet is not causing adequate weight loss, you'll want to make adjustments as soon as possible.


If you're not losing weight, check in with your food journal and calorie count. Are you slipping up? Snacking more often or eating larger portions? Make the necessary changes or cut out a few more calories to induce weight loss.

, Ideally, after you've lost your desired amount of weight, you should keep it off. Stick to your diet plan long-term to maintain your weight loss.


Maintain the lifestyle changes you've made: monitoring calories, portions sizes, and eating a balanced diet daily.
Also monitor how often you indulge in treats or alcohol. Although the occasional treat is OK, keep them to a minimum long-term to help maintain your weight.

Cut out processed goods.,
Eat 5 times a day.,
Learn about portion control.,
Drink at least 64 ounces of water a day.",How to Lose 10 Pounds in 1 Week without Any Pills2," Having a low-energy-dense diet is the simplest way to lower your intake of calories and still maintain feelings of fullness and keep the hunger pangs at bay.This is code for dishing up the veggies, opting out on the french fries, and still feeling full.


Energy density is the amount of calories (or energy) in a certain weight of food. If a food has a lower energy density, it provides fewer calories per gram. That means if you stock up on these foods you can eat till the cows come home and not see the result on your waistline. After all, 400 calories of fried chicken is a lot less food than 400 calories of salad.Basically, foods like fruits and vegetables fill us up more quickly without the calories. Protein and carbs have 4 calories per gram; fat has 9. Fiber has between 1.5 and 2.5 and, of course, water has 0.
To maintain a low-energy-dense diet, load up on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean dairy and meats (foods that have high water and fiber content), and avoid processed goods.

The easiest way to avoid processed goods is to skip the fast food and restaurants. If you make it, you know exactly what's going into your body.



, In addition to three small meals, keep on snacking (healthily). Your meals should be smaller, but you'll feel more full.


There's a science behind it, too. When we eat, our thermic effect of food (or TEF) raises. A high TEF raises our metabolism, reduces feelings of hunger, and ultimately leads to weight loss.Because you're eating more often, your meals need to be smaller portion sizes. You're not eating more; you're just spreading it out through the day.
Your snacks should be healthy and a healthy portion size. Munch on fruits, nuts, or low-fat yogurt. If rationing and time are issues, pre-measure your snacks and put them in resealable baggies. You won't overeat and you can grab one on your way to work.

, By portion control standards, an adult should eat 3 oz. (90g) of protein, 1/2 cup (87.5g) of starch and 1 cup (175g) of vegetables per meal. Eating any more than what your body needs will only increase your weight; however, understand also that eating less than what your body needs will lead to weight gain (or a stagnated weight) as well.


You must eat in order to avoid your body shutting down and retaining weight. Use visual cues if portion-sizing is Greek to you. 1 bell pepper is a serving of vegetables--about the size of a baseball. An apple is 1 serving, that's a tennis ball. A serving of pasta is the size of a hockey puck. A serving of cheese is the equivalent of four playing dice. And chicken? Think of a deck of cards.

, Add a glass before bed and one when you wake up, and drink a glass (or two) before each meal. Cleaning the body of daily toxins is one of the best ways of losing weight. What's more, the added liquid gives you the sensation of feeling full even before you start eating.


Carry a bottle of water with you daily and make a habit of drinking from it often. The more you drink, the more you will want and the better you will feel. A hydrated body has more energy.
The Institute of Medicine advises that men and women try to consume about 3.7 and 2.7 liters of water a day, respectively, including water found in food and other beverages.

Vamp up the cardio.,
Start strength training.,
Add yoga.,
Stay moving.",How to Lose 10 Pounds in 1 Week without Any Pills3," Exercise must be a regular activity in your day even after the week is up if you want to continue to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Exercise also builds your energy and increases your metabolism, and both help make your weight loss endeavor more successful. Because exercise methods for losing weight are subjective and dependent upon your health, meet with your doctor to discuss the best exercise routine for your personal needs.


Cardio burns more fat than strength training, but both are needed for maximal weight loss. If running isn't your thing, choose an easier-on-the-knees activity like swimming or the elliptical machine.

Look into High Intensity Interval Training, or HIIT. The National Institute of Health says HIIT ""involves repeatedly exercising at a high intensity for 30 seconds to several minutes, separated by 1-5 minutes of recovery (either no or low intensity exercise)."" They also say that ""...such benefits, especially weight loss, are amplified with HIIT.""So, next time you get on that machine, rotate going all out with relaxing and you're done in 15 minutes.


Plenty of activities count as a cardio workout that you may not even realize. Here are the calories burned in 30 minutes of each activity:

Aerobic dance - 342
Boxing - 330
Jumping rope - 286
Tennis - 232
Basketball - 282
Swimming (freestyle) - 248



, Those who do cardio and strength will burn the most fat and build muscle. If you're new to weights, use a buddy or consult a trainer at your gym.


No time for the gym, huh? No problem! Invest in hand weights or dumbbells for your home. You can get a workout in wherever, however, and without the monthly fee.

, Let's face it: 10 pounds in one week is a steep goal. You need to burn as many calories as possible. So why not do some Yoga while Homeland is playing in the background?


Yoga burns 3-6 calories a minute. After an hour in front of the TV, you've knocked off 180-360 calories.

Yoga is not the most intense workout, no. However, it has shown to lead to mindful eating (which other workouts do not correlate with) which, in turn, leads to greater weight loss.



, So, you've been to the gym 5 times already this week and you're yoga-ed out. What else can you do?


Bike to work. Take the stairs and skip the elevator. Take whatever little opportunities you can to burn those calories and get active.
Do those household chores you've been putting off. You'd be surprised how washing the car, tending the garden, and rearranging the furniture can make you break an unintentional sweat.

Do the research on fad diets.,
Visit the sauna.,
Consider body wraps.",How to Lose 10 Pounds in 1 Week without Any Pills4," They're called fads for a reason, but if you're looking for an...interesting...challenge, pick the one that appeals most to you:


Juicing. This diet takes your food and puts it in liquid form. 24/7, it's juice. You can buy juices just for this purpose at the store in a wide variety, but juicing your own fruits and veggies is much cheaper.
The Master Cleanse Diet. You only drink an elixir of 2 tablespoons (30 g) fresh-squeezed lemon juice, 2 tablespoons grade-B organic maple syrup, 1/10 (.5 g) teaspoon cayenne pepper, and 10 ounces filtered water. That's it.
The Sleeping Beauty Diet. Well, on the upside, you don't have to ingest a tapeworm, but all you can do for days on end is sleep.
The Maple Syrup Diet. Similar to the Master Cleanse, this is a concoction of maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and water. Again, this is all you're allowed.

Fad diets are not healthy. There are no two ways around it. Most people crash after a few days and gain back any weight (and then some) that they may have lost. If you want to lose weight permanently, fad diets are not the way to do it. All in all, they are injurious to your health.



, A trip to the steam room will quickly shed that water weight off of you. You won't lose fat, but you may lose inches.


It's important to stay hydrated and not visit the sauna too often. A 15-20 minute visit once a day is plenty. When you get out, drink a glass of water.
Saunas are not safe for children. It's best to leave them at home (supervised, of course).

, Most spas nowadays offer a plethora of wraps that claim to tone your skin and add to weight loss. Take a gander at what your local spa has to offer and give it a try.


The more common types are mineral, detox, slimming, and cellulite. Each one uses slightly different herbal remedies; pick the one that seems most catered to your needs.

The treatment is relaxing and skin-soothing more than anything. No research has shown that wraps actually pull out or eliminate toxins from your body.

Do high-intensity cardiovascular exercise four to five days per week.,
Exercise for at least 30 minutes, five days per week.,

Do lunges.,
Do hip raises.,
Add in the bridge exercise.,
Include plies.",How to Lose Hip Fat2," High intensity exercises or HIIT is an exercise that combined both moderate and high intensity cardio activities that can torch calories and help burn body fat.


Fitness professionals have been prompting HIIT workouts to help those who want to get rid of excess body fat. Although it does not specifically target your hips, it can help reduce your overall body fat.
HIIT workouts are typically shorter in length and combine short bouts of both very high intensity activities and more moderate intensity activities. They are great in combination with other cardio and strength training.

, You cannot reduce hip fat without reducing overall body fat. You also cannot spot correct using only toning exercises or strength training. Including regular cardio is an important component to help you meet your end goal.


Health professionals recommend doing 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercises each week.This can include walking/jogging, cycling, swimming or dancing.
If you want to experience a quicker reduction in your hips, aim to workout for one hour five to six days per week or up to 300 minutes weekly.Include cardio exercises that are known to slim and tone your thighs. Activities like running/jogging, using the stair master or cycling are great to help burn calories and tone your legs.

, This popular exercise works your hips, butt, thighs and stomach. Developing muscles in those areas, combined with overall fat loss, can help with toning (showing lean muscle definition).


Start with your feet hip width apart. Place your hands in prayer position in the middle of your chest.
While putting your weight into your heels sit down like you are trying to sit in a chair. Push your buttocks out behind you and go down as far as you can or until your thighs are almost parallel to the floor.
Pause when your thighs are parallel to the ground. Slowly rise back up to your starting position. Repeat 10 to 20 times or as necessary.

, In this exercise, you will step forward with one foot and allow your knees to bend. This is a great exercise to help develop muscles around your hips and entire thigh.Start standing with feet shoulder width apart and put your hands on your hips.
Step forward a few feet (0.5 m) with one foot. Keep your toes point forward. Drop your back knee and bend your front knee at the same time in a slow and controlled movement.

Count calories.,

Eat a balanced diet.,
Snack healthy.,
Choose healthier cooking techniques.,
Drink adequate amounts of fluids.,
Ditch alcohol and sugary beverages.",How to Lose Weight Without Exercising1," Weight loss programs usually require you to modify your total calorie intake. Counting calories and being aware of how much you eat can help you lose weight. In general, you'll want to cut out about 500–750 calories daily to lose about one to two pounds weekly.Figure out how many calories you can cut from your daily diet by first calculating the number of calories you should take in each day. Do this by searching online for a calorie calculator, then inputting your weight, height, age and activity level in order to calculate your recommended caloric intake. Each person is different, so it's best to get your own, personalized number.
Do not consume less than 1200 calories daily. A diet that's too low in calories puts you at risk for nutrient deficiencies as you cannot eat enough food to meet your daily requirements for most vitamins, minerals, and protein.""Your weight is a balancing act, and calories are part of that equation. Fad diets may promise you that counting carbs or eating a mountain of grapefruit will make the pounds drop off. But when it comes to weight loss, it's calories that count. Weight loss comes down to burning more calories than you take in. You can do that by reducing extra calories from food and beverages, and increasing calories burned through physical activity."";
, If you are not exercising to burn calories, you must trim them from your diet in order to lose weight. Writing out a meal plan can help you plot out all your meals and snacks and make sure they fit into your pre-determined calorie range.


Spend some time writing out all your meals, snacks, and beverages for a few days or a week.
Allot a certain caloric amount for each meal. For example: 300-calorie breakfast, two 500-calorie bigger meals, and one to two 100-calorie snacks. This may help you choose what foods to eat for meals and snacks throughout the day.
Include foods from all five food groups most days. Review your meal plan to make sure you're getting adequate amounts of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and dairy.
Having all your meals and snacks planned in advance may keep you from making poor nutrition choices when you're in a rush.
Keeps snacks conveniently located and ready in the fridge, car, backpack or purse.

, A diet that is calorie controlled and includes all five food groups is a good foundation for healthy weight loss.You should include all of the following most days:


Fruits and veggies. These foods are dense, filling, low-calorie and low-fat. Not only are fruits and veggies great for your waistline they have copious amounts of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants that you need for long-term health.Aim to make 1/2 of your meals fruits and/or vegetables.
Lean protein. Foods like poultry, eggs, pork, beef, legumes, dairy products, and tofu are great sources of lean protein. Protein will help keep you satisfied longer and may curb hunger cravings.Aim to include 3-4 oz of protein at each meal — this is about the size of a deck of cards.
100% whole grains. Foods that are whole grains are high in fiber and some vitamins and minerals.Quinoa, oats, brown rice, millet, and 100% whole wheat pasta and bread are examples of whole grains to include in your diet. Limit your grains to about 1/2 cup or 1 oz per meal.

, Including one to two low-calorie snacks is appropriate when you're trying to lose weight. Many times, a snack will help support your weight loss.Snacking may be appropriate when there is more than five or six hours between your meals. Sometimes, going for long periods of time without eating may make it harder for you to stick to your planned meal or portion sizes as you may be overly hungry.Most snacks included in a weight loss plan should be calorie controlled. Aim to keep snacks between 100-200 calories.Healthy snacks include: 1/4 cup of nuts, one individual greek yogurt, a hard boiled egg or celery and peanut butter.

, Don't sabotage the best of intentions with poor preparation methods. Cooking methods that use a lot of oil, butter, or other high-fat sauces or seasonings may cause your weight loss to plateau or slow.Try cooking methods that use little to no added fat. Try: steaming, grilling, braising, roasting and poaching/boiling.
Switch to extra virgin olive oil or canola oil. When substituted for saturated fats (like butter), these healthy monounsaturated fats can help to improve blood cholesterol levels, thereby reducing risk for heart disease and obesity.Avoid cooking techniques like: deep fat frying or pan frying. Also avoid cooking methods that use a lot of butter, oil, or margarine.

, Staying well-hydrated is also essential to weight loss. Many times, thirst can feel similar to hunger and trigger you to eat. Drinking enough fluids can help prevent this mistake and promote weight loss.Aim for about 64 oz or about eight glasses of clear, sugar-free liquids each day. This is a general recommendation, but is a good place to start.Fluids that will count toward your daily goal include: water, sugar-free flavored waters, plain tea, and coffee without cream or sugar.

, Both alcoholic beverages and sugary beverages contain excess calories that may work against your weight loss plan. It's ideal to completely pass these up as long as you desire continued weight loss.Sugary beverages to avoid include: regular soda, sweetened tea, sweetened coffee drinks, sports drinks and juices.
At the maximum, women should consume one glass or less of alcohol daily and men should consume two or less daily. Again, if continued weight loss is desired, alcohol should be avoided."

This is where your body uses ketones for energy instead of it's usual glucose (a carbohydrate). Headaches are one of the most common side effects of the Atkins diet.An easy and all natural way to help fight headaches is to sip on a caffeinated beverage. Studies have shown that caffeine is a promising headache reliever.Many times, headaches are from enlarged blood vessels in the brain pushing on your skull. Caffeine serves as a vasoconstrictor and makes those enlarged blood vessels become smaller and more narrow and thus relieving your pain.Caffeine works quickly and you may notice some relief within 30 minutes. In addition, the effects may last up to three to five hours.Both tea and coffee are sources of caffeine with coffee being higher in caffeine. Most 8 oz cups of coffee have around 80 – 200 mg of caffeine.Try drinking one to two cups for headache relief.
Although you can find caffeine in drinks like sodas, sports drinks, and energy drinks, these are generally not on the approved beverage list for the Atkin's diet.;
, In addition to headache, ketosis and low-carb diets may also make you feel a little nauseous or change your bowel habits up.Try taking some OTC medications to help relieve any of these side effects.


If drinking a hot cup of joe doesn't help with your headaches, try taking an OTC headache medications. These are generally safe for most healthy people and will provide you with some relief. In addition, look for a headache medication that contains caffeine as this helps the medication work more quickly and effectively.If you experience any constipation or diarrhea you may want to consider taking some OTC medications for these side effects as well. Take a gentle laxative or stool softener at the first sign of constipation.If you let constipation go for too long, it can get worse and require more aggressive treatment like an enema.Nausea is another side effect that can make the first few days or weeks of the Atkins's diet difficult. Drink fluids often to help prevent nausea. Try hot ginger tea, club soda or ginger ale but avoid dairy products as these can make nausea worse.You can also take an OTC anti-nausea medication for additional help.

, Another temporary side effect of the Atkin's first diet phase is bad breath.Again, this is typically due to ketosis, but can be remedied very easily.


Brushing your teeth on a regular basis is always a good way to prevent bad breath. Consider purchasing a small travel-size toothbrush and toothpaste to keep with you in your purse, car or office. Brush more often and make sure to brush the back of your tongue thoroughly.There are some mouthwashes that are also formulated with antibacterials to help get rid of bad breath as well.In addition to a more rigorous dental hygiene program, consider sucking on sugar-free mints or chewing sugar-free gum. Make sure to check the sugar and carb content to ensure they'll fit into your diet.

, Being a little tired, fatigued or having some mental fogginess on the first few days or week of the Atkin's diet is common as well.Limit your physical activity until these side effects have passed.


Due to the fact that Atkins is a diet that is restrictive, especially on carbs, it is essential that you do not overdo it physically.
It's typically recommended to do about 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical cardio plus one to two days of strength training each week.This might be too much right at the beginning of your diet. Instead of doing moderate-intensity cardio, try doing the same amount of low intensity cardio. Activities like walking or a leisurely bike ride might be more easy (and fun) to do while you're doing a very strict diet.
Exercise may also help you keep a positive mindset on this difficult part of the diet.

, It's not surprising to feel a little tired or even a little moody the first few days of the Atkin's diet. Get enough sleep to help blunt these effects.


You typically need about seven to nine hours of sleep each night. If you don't currently get this amount, you might really notice that fatigue or mental fogginess common to low-carb diets.Try going to bed earlier each day your on the first phase of the Atkin's diet. Stay in bed later if you can as well.

, With any diet it is helpful to have a support group to encourage and motivate you to stay on track.


Many studies have shown that regardless of the diet type, dieters that had friends or family members supporting them did much better with their diet and lost more weight compared to those without a support group.Tell friends or family members about the Atkin's diet and your goal to lose weight. Ask if they would support you and even ask if they'd be interested in joining you.
In addition, the Atkin's diet has many options of support on it's own website. Check it out for more support resources.

, With any diet there will be challenges. Having a support group can provide you with the motivation and encouragement to stick to your new diet plan.


Ask friends, family members or coworkers to be your support group. Tell them about your new diet and long-term weight goals. They may even want to join you.
A support group can also help you with the mental difficulties of following a diet. It can be challenging day after day to stick to a more strict plan like the Atkin's diet.
Studies show that those people who have a support group can follow a diet longer, stick to the plan and lose more weight than those who do not., Journaling about your new diet and long-term goals can be a great coping mechanism for the difficulties that sometimes come along with following a diet. Sometimes the act alone of journal ling is enough to keep you sane and accountable to yourself.


Use a pen and notebook, journaling app or online site to start your journal. You don't have to journal everyday, but it might help you get all you thoughts out on paper.
You can also use your journal to keep track of your weight progress or food journal throughout your Atkin's diet.

, Whenever you're starting a new diet, it's important to have a full understanding of exactly what you're allowed to have and what you're not. This will make your transition to the diet much easier.


The Atkins diet is a very specific type of low-carb diet. It's divided into four phases with a specific list of approved foods and serving sizes in each phase.
In phase one, you're allowed to have: full-fat cheese, fats and oils, fish and seafood, poultry, eggs, meat, herbs and non-starchy and green vegetables (known as foundation vegetables).
Stock up on these foods in your home so that you have all the approved foods at your fingertips to prepare meals and snacks.

, Eating every few hours is a good way to prevent hunger, but is also a recommendation made specifically by the first phase of the Atkins diet.This diet recommends eating three meals daily plus two snacks or going for five to six small meals a day. Do not go more than three hours without eating.
Waiting a long time in-between meals or skipping snacks can make you more hungry and more likely to eat an unapproved food since you're so starving.Pack meals and snacks in advance to keep with you at all times. This can help prevent a situation where it's time to eat, you're hungry but have nothing that fits into the phase one approved foods list.

, During each phase of the Atkins diet you'll notice they provide you with a very specific amount of carbohydrates to eat each day. It's important to follow this guideline strictly.


The first phase of the diet limits you to a total of 20 g of carbs daily. It recommends not going above the 20 g of carbs daily, but also ensuring you eat at least 18 g of carbs daily.Eating less than 18 g of carbs daily doesn't increase or speed up your weight loss and also most likely means you're not eating enough of your foundation vegetables.Spread your 20 g of carbs throughout the day. This can help keep you feeling a little more even keel throughout the day. If you spend all 20 g of carbs at breakfast, you may notice more of those low-carb diet side effects in the afternoon.

, The Atkin's diet along with most other diets recommend consuming adequate amounts of fluid each day.Water is essential for your general health even when you're on a diet. In addition, drinking adequate fluids as mentioned before can help combat nausea and constipation associated with a very low-carb diet.
The Atkins diet recommends drinking eight 8-oz glasses of fluid each day. However, more general recommendations suggest drinking up to 13 glasses of water daily. This will depend on your age, gender and activity level.You shouldn't feel thirsty throughout the day and your urine should be very pale yellow by the end of the day if you're adequately hydrated.

, The Atkins diet suggest staying in phase one for at least two weeks or until you're about 10 – 15 pounds from your goal weight.If you have a more significant amount of weight to lose, you might consider taking some dietary supplements.


The first phase of the Atkins diet is very limited and cuts out several food groups (like fruits, starchy vegetables and grains). If you plan on staying on this phase for an extended period of time, it might be a good idea to take some dietary supplements to help prevent any nutrient deficiencies.A great ""backup"" vitamin is a general multivitamin. Take one a day to help cover a variety of your nutrients each day.
You may also want to consider taking 500 – 1000 mg of calcium daily since many dairy foods are restricted.

Try to keep temptation away.,
Remind yourself of the consequences of giving in to temptation.,
Keep a journal of the foods that you eat.,
Try eating some raw food snacks instead of the unhealthy foods you're craving.",How to Stay on a Raw Food Diet1," When you go to the grocery store to purchase your fresh fruits and vegetables, don’t go near the foods that you're tempted by. If you find that you're constantly craving chocolates, stay away from that aisle altogether. You're less likely to give in to those temptations if they're not right in front of you.


If you can, try to avoid listening to commercials and other advertisements for unhealthy foods until you become accustomed to your new lifestyle. In particular, visual cues can be the hardest to resist, so be careful with TV and online ads.





;
, If you give in to temptation, it will have potentially negative effects on your body and undo the gains managed thus far. A raw food diet is especially good for your body and even though you may enjoy the taste of cooked or processed foods, indulging in them will not be worth the bloating, gas and other likely unpleasant results. Not only will your health pay the price, but you're likely to have emotional consequences as well when you are faced with the realization that you've not exercised your willpower.

, If you do slip up and eat something that doesn't classify as raw food, write down how bad it made you feel after you ate it. Include both physical symptoms and emotional effects. Go back and review the journal the next time you feel the urge to cheat. This can be a great help in staying on track by reminding you of unpleasant side effects of slipping back.

, A little fruit is a great substitute for a sweet craving. When you're feeling tempted by a sugary, processed sweet treat, fill the craving with a handful of berries, which are some of the healthiest fruit sources available. Nuts can also be a great substitute if you're craving something fatty (but avoid peanuts as you might not be able to stop eating them), while tomatoes are known to help curb a salt craving that might otherwise lead to eating processed foods.

Focus on lean protein.,
Make fruits and vegetables a priority in meals.,
Reduce the amount of grains you eat.,
Make water your number one drink of choice.,
Eat fermented foods.,
Avoid added sugars and artificial sweeteners.",How to Reduce Your Overall Body Fat1," Low-calorie diets will help you lose weight and reduce body fat.Monitor how many calories you eat daily and reduce this number by around 500 calories each day. This will yield a 1 – 2 pound weight loss per week.Count how many calories you're currently consuming. You can use a food journal, app or online calculator to help you do this accurately. Cut out about 500 calories from this number. Your end result should be what you aim for daily for slow and safe body fat loss.
Do not try to follow a very low calorie diet or consume less than 1,200 calories daily. When you're calories are too low, you may stop losing weight or lose lean muscle mass, not body fat.You may want to check with your physician or dietitian about the amount of calories you should be consuming in order to reduce body fat.;
, Protein is essential for your body's metabolism. Focusing on lean protein at all meals and snacks can help support weight loss and body fat reduction.Lean protein should be included at all meals. This will help ensure you meet your daily recommended amount. Women should aim for 46 g daily and men should aim for 56 g.Lean protein sources include: poultry, lean beef, pork, legumes, tofu, low-fat dairy and seafood.
Limit or avoid sources of protein that contain higher amounts of saturated fat. Some studies have shown that a diet rich in saturated fats may increase body fat — especially in your abdomen.Limit foods like: full-fat dairy, fatty cuts of meat, and butter.

, In addition to lean protein, make a large part of your meals and snacks vegetables. You will also want to eat plenty of fruit. These foods are very nutritious and contain a lot of healthy nutrients your body needs.


It's generally recommended to consume about five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Aim for one to two servings of fruit and the rest should be vegetables.Also, when you're choosing foods from these groups, try to choose items that are brightly colored or darkly colored. These foods are typically more nutrient-dense meaning they contain higher amounts of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.For example, choose kale over iceberg lettuce.
Try using vegetables creatively. Try them raw with a dip or in a salad, sauté them on the stove, cook them in a soup, roast them in the oven, grill them outside, or hide them in a smoothie or in spaghetti sauce and serve over spaghetti squash.

, One of the best ways to reduce your body fat is to reduce the amount of grains you eat each day.These carbohydrate-rich foods can slow the reduction of body fat.


Foods that are high in carbohydrates include: bread, rice, pastries, sweets, pasta, crackers, chips, English muffins, and bagels. These highly processed grains contain little nutrition and can quickly raise blood sugar which often results in fat storage. There are other foods that contain carbohydrates like fruits and legumes; however, these foods also contain a high amount of other essential nutrients and shouldn't necessarily be limited.

, On a normal day, most people should drink about eight 8-oz glasses of water. Choose no-calorie, decaf beverages for the most hydrating fluids.Avoid sweetened, calorie filled beverages like sodas, juice or energy drinks as they will add calories to your diet and may increase body fat.
This is a general recommendation. The amounts of fluids needed will differ for everyone depending on their size and amount of perspiration. For example, those participating in aerobic exercise will need to drink more to help them re-hydrate. Let thirst be your first guide.

, Fermented foods, such as organic kefir, organic yogurt, and sauerkraut contain live cultures of good bacteria. Having large amounts of good bacteria in our intestines can help maintain a healthy weight.You can also take probiotics, which may even help manage stress., They can increase cravings and lead to overeating. There are over 60 names for added sugars, so it can sometimes be a challenge to identify them in an ingredient list. Some examples of added sugars are:Agave nectar
Barley malt
Cane juice
Corn syrup
Dextrose
Evaporated cane juice
High-fructose corn syrup
Malton 
Maple syrup
Molasses
Honey
Sucrose
Rice syrup

Get support from friends and family.,

Be gentle on yourself.",How to Be Zen About Not Losing Weight," As with any goal, make sure you set a reasonable standards. You can’t expect to lose 30 pounds in a week and then become frustrated when you only lose five.

Tap into an online BMI (body mass index) calculator (or use an app with your electronic device) to determine if you are within a normal weight range. Depending on how many pounds (or kilograms) you're over your range, calculate how many pounds it would take to get into the normal range first. If you want to go further into the normal range, make that a secondary goal.



 


Know what is a reasonable amount of weight to lose within a given week. The general rule of thumb is that you can lose around one to two pounds (o.5 to 1 kilo) per week in a healthy manner, depending on how much weight you have to lose.The two pound goal is ideal for those who are looking to shed 10 to 15 pounds. People who are considered to be morbidly obese may actually lose more than two pounds during the week.






Create a chart of how much weight you should be losing each week and compare it to how much you’ve averaged. You may be right on target, but getting frustrated because you want the weight to come off faster. A chart can make it clearer in a visual way that you're making progress.





;
, If you aren’t losing enough weight in a healthy amount of time, recall what could have derailed your diet. Typical weight loss obstacles include holiday periods, having company visit, allowing snacks to slip back in here and there during stressful periods such as meeting deadlines, not exercising regularly and keeping snack foods in the house within easy reach. Additionally, if you’ve been drinking more alcohol you could be packing on the pounds due to the additional carbs and calories. Some other issues include:

Stress: Whether you’ve experienced stress at work or home, stress eating could be preventing you from losing weight. Identify the stress source and deal with it direct rather than hiding away with food.






Boredom: Often people munch when bored without realizing that they're consuming a bevy of calories even though they aren’t hungry. Don't keep snacks within easy reach and don't eat mindlessly; drink water if you need something to put in your mouth or have a line of carrot sticks ready to demolish.






Traveling: If you're having a margarita (or three) by the pool every day on vacation, you could be consuming more calories than you think. Those frothy drinks and high calorie meals on vacation will definitely sidetrack your diet. Moreover, eating while sitting in a vehicle can be a real trap, as you lose track of time and the amount of food going in.






Temptation: In some cases you’ve thrown out all the junk food only to find that your husband or wife got a coupon for buy one get one free of your favorite ice cream and they've loaded up on it. Now it’s in the house calling your name, too hard to resist. In this case, have a chat to the other person about at least hiding it away from you, or not even bringing it into the house anymore.







, Let yourself come to terms with the fact that perhaps your diet isn’t going according to plan and that changes may be needed to recreate that ""oomph"" you started with. Find peace with where you are and understand that you have the power to make changes.

Plan rather than panic. It's too easy to give up if you give in to panic and tell yourself it's a doomed cause. Instead, get back to the drawing board and write out a new plan of where you want to head next with your dieting. Include doodles, fun quotes, inspiring sayings and lots of colors to keep it light, fun and very zen. You're forgiving yourself and restarting your motivation at the same time, after all.






Re-evaluate your diet. If you’ve tried a formal diet plan and don’t like it, you can make a change. Go online and explore the endless number of diets or weight management programs to see which one appeals to you most; just be sure to choose it from trusted sites though, to avoid fad diets. If you're unsure, take the diet to your doctor for his or her analysis.







, Even if you’ve lost some weight during your initial effort, consider this a fresh start from this point. Weigh yourself to gauge where you're starting and calculate a reasonable goal.

Set small goals. Instead of saying that you want to lose 20 pounds total, set smaller, attainable goals such as losing five pounds in two and a half weeks.






Track your success. Create a chart either on your computer or online to track your success. Seeing your weight loss on paper may motivate and keep you calm when you can track the process.







, Practice meditation or focus strategies to avoid getting overly upset if the scale doesn’t reflect the amount of work put into dieting. Sometimes dieters will plateau, which can cause anxiety but by understanding that plateaus are normal and that a little patience goes a long way, you can move beyond this seeming impasse. Instead of losing faith, refer to your chart and weight loss plan to restore the peace and calm and to reassure yourself that all good things take time and mature at their own pace.

Try meditation or focus strategies to help you relax or go for a jog to get the endorphins (happy hormones) flowing. By staying relaxed and ""in the zone"", you're less likely to be focused on the weight loss itself as an issue and more likely to be focused on your life as a whole and continuously reshaping where you want to head and the kind of person you want to be as a whole. A zen approach to weight loss helps you to better understand that weight loss isn't just about calories and the waistline but also encompasses your emotions, your sense of purpose in life, your lifetime goals, your general fitness and your overall sense of fulfillment about what you're doing with your time. All of this is a complete package and trying to make weight loss seem like an isolated activity can contain the seeds of its failure but when seen as a whole, your motivation and application can be more aligned and will be more likely to be successful.







, If you've been trying to do this alone, realize that social support is a must and that you deserve the love and care others you care about can give you. Enlist the support and help from those who are closest to you and whom you know you can trust to be supportive. An encouraging word or hug from a friend when you are feeling upset about your diet can be just the thing you need to make you feel zen and return focus to your goal.

, The word exercise can conjure up thoughts of pain and dread for some, especially when coupled with weight loss. A zen approach is to be gradual about exercise. Start easy with the exercise you like to do, like short walks or a quick swim. And gradually build this up to longer walks, longer swims and perhaps a bike ride. And as you're exercising, allow yourself to enjoy it, including stopping when needed. Each time you do the exercise, push yourself just a little further until eventually, you feel the innate pull to do more because you're enjoying it so much. It will happen provided you persevere and trust that taking it gradually will succeed. Once you're into this zen approach to exercise, you'll be able to pursue regular exercise for a lifetime rather than treating it as a one-off.

, If you have a tendency to be hard on yourself, to berate yourself as a loser or to be a perfectionist, losing weight can be extra hard on you when you reach plateaus or stuff up. Instead of resorting to being self-negative, task yourself with being gentle to person number one (yourself). Every time the ugly thoughts about failing and never being able to lose weight creep in, remind yourself that you will lose weight because you deserve to, that you are a worthy person who matters and that you are special. Kindness to yourself is absolutely vital and is as zen as you can be.

Laugh a lot. Watch funny shows, read amusing things and generally look for the lighter side of life. Being happy and content matter a great deal when it comes to motivating yourself and staying attuned to your greater goals in life.






Don't take it too seriously. Some attention and focus on the weight loss as a goal is good but overdoing the focus is unhealthy. Keep it all in perspective and realize that this is part of your life's journey and not the only thing that you should identify with.

Involve a medical professional.",How to Make Low Carb Dieting Simple and Easy," Start with the basics. When present in the body, carbohydrates, converted into simple sugars (known as glucose in your bloodstream), are your main fuel source. Low-carb dieting is based on the premise that, without sufficient carbs available as fuel, your body will burn its fat stores to keep you moving.There’s no official definition for a low-carb diet, but the range limit is usually somewhere between 50-100g of carbs per day. This range will vary with each person's body weight. Anything below 50g per day would typically cause the individual to go into ketosis. In comparison, typical American dietary guidelines recommend between 225-325 grams of carbs (900-1300 calories) daily.Medical opinions vary on the efficacy of low-carb diets as well. They do seem to offer weight-loss benefits, at least in the short term, and may have benefits for diabetics by decreasing blood glucose levels.Long-term health impacts are less clear. Consult your physician before beginning a low-carb diet.;
, Once on a low-carb diet, you'll likely be able to spot carb-heavy foods with ease before too long. It may be helpful, however, to keep a guide handy, at least early on, that identifies carb amounts in various foods.


Such a guide can be especially useful when eating out.
See, for example, this exhaustive chart for carb counts on a wide range of foods. As a point of comparison, each of the following has approximately 15 grams of carbs:
1 slice bread; ½ bagel
1 banana, orange, or apple; ¾ c. blueberries; 1 ¼ c. strawberries
½ c. apple or orange juice
1 c. milk (skim, full fat, or in between)
½ c. cooked beans, lentils, corn, or peas
1 small baked potato
½ packet of instant oatmeal
15 chips or pretzels; 1 cookie; ½ donut
⅓ c. mac & cheese; ½ breaded chicken sandwich
½ c. ice cream
1 ½ c. cooked or 3 c. raw of most non-starchy vegetables
meats, fish, eggs, and many flavorings, dressings, and toppings have fewer than 5 carbs per serving

, Different low-carb diet plans will tell you different things about what you should and should not eat.


Some plans tell you to eat high-fat proteins (like meats and dairy) and skip almost all grains (especially containing gluten), while others emphasize low-fat proteins and a more moderate amount of whole grains.Vegetables are a staple of low-carb dieting. All vegetables contain carbohydrates but some contain even more. The ones to focus on consuming are 'non-starchy' vegetables. In addition, some low-carb dieters do not count green non-starchy vegetables into their overall carbohydrate count. This is due to the high fiber count in these vegetables and many believe that this fiber content 'counteracts' any carbohydrates within these vegetables.
To make your low-carb diet simple, make your criteria simple: more protein and vegetables, less refined starches and sugars, and much less processed food.
One simple suggestion would be do eat lots of lean proteins and vegetables, prepared simply; add in supplementary helpings of whole grains, legumes, lowfat dairy, and fruits, and skip processed foods., If guidebooks or diet plans will help your stick to your low-carb diet, then it may be a worthwhile expenditure for you. However, you can begin and sustain a low-carb diet without buying any of those things. Just repeat to yourself, “more protein, more vegetables, less starches and sugars.”


Don’t bother with prepackaged low-carb foods if possible. Eating fresh, minimally-processed foods is always preferable.

, This might be your first worry when you think about giving up bread, pasta, potatoes, and other foods you think of as filling (and tasty). Your body can and will adjust and can be just as easily satisfied by a low-carb diet.


For a low-carb diet, you don’t eat less, just differently. Stick to eating 3-4 meals per day with small, healthy snacks as needed.You also experience less hunger due to your blood sugar being better regulated. With less carbohydrates, fewer blood sugar spikes (and falls) occur. This keeps you from getting too hungry or experiencing cravings.

, You may not believe it at first, but water can be filling and can help make your low-carb transition easier.


You want to drink at least 8 (8 oz) glasses of water per day, but even more will help.Carry a water bottle with you all day. Take regular drinks, before you’re thirsty. When you feel a craving coming on (especially for a cookie, donut, etc.), drink water first and see if that calms it.
Slice fresh lemons and add them to your water pitcher if you need some flavor.

, If you live in a household of carb-eaters, you won’t be able to pitch the potatoes and bread, but you can make sure you are well-stocked with staples of low-carb cooking.


A sampling from one lengthy list of low-carb pantry staples includes:
canned tuna / salmon / sardines
canned vegetables / fruit (in light syrup)
chicken / beef stock
canned tomatoes / tomato paste
low-sugar peanut butter
jarred roasted peppers
olives, pickles, and capers
whole grain pasta, rice, and flour
oatmeal and high-fiber, no-sugar cereal
sugar substitute
olive oil
As you develop your personalized low-carb menu, stock your pantry to suit.

, If a good old-fashioned bacon and eggs breakfast sounds good to you (minus any toast, home fries, or pancakes), you’re in luck.


A poached or fried egg, with bacon or sausage on the side if desired, can become your standard daily breakfast.
For more variety, make omelets with a variety of vegetables (spinach, bell peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, zucchini, etc.), meats, and a little cheese.You can even try your hand at low-carb blueberry or zucchini muffins.Drink water, plus some coffee or tea (minus sugar, plus sugar substitute if necessary) if you need a caffeine boost.

, Take the good stuff sandwiched inside a sandwich, skip the bread, and you’re on your way to a low-carb lunch.


Roll some deli meat up in a lettuce leaf. Add mustard, a bit of cheese, a pickle spear, or other flavor additions. Pair with fresh veggies -- carrots, celery, pepper slices, etc.
Mix up some chicken or shrimp salad and skip putting it in bread. Just use your fork and add some veggies on the side.Low-carb pizza could be dinner one night and lunch the next day.Drink -- you guessed it -- water. Will an occasional iced tea or diet soda ruin your diet? No. But get used to making water your standard mealtime (and other times) beverage.

, Steak, meatballs, pork chops, grilled chicken or fish (no frying, no breading) -- these will likely become dinnertime staples. Roasted or grilled vegetables and a side salad can become a standard accompaniment.Rely on spices and other seasonings -- capers or olives, for instance -- to change the flavor profile of your meals.
A roasted pork tenderloin,perhaps with roasted asparagus and a salad, will make even a family of carb-lovers happy at dinnertime.
Let’s all say it together -- Drink water!

, Starving yourself between meals will only make it easier for you to “cheat” on high-carb guilty pleasures, so prepare yourself by pre-packaging your own low-carb snacks to see you through the end of the workday (or any other time you need it).


Something as simple as a handful of almonds or blueberries (both of which are generally seen as all right in moderation in low-carb diets) can provide a quick boost.
Standard options include cut veggies with low-carb dressing; mozzarella cheese strings; or unsweetened yogurt, to name a few. Fruit intake will need to be a bit more limited, but having an apple, orange, raisins or grapes, dried apricots, or an unsweetened applesauce / peach / mixed fruit cup is far better than a bag of chips or a snack cake.Have we mentioned drinking water?

, There is some debate whether it is the ""low-carb"" or ""diet"" portion that deserves more credit, but evidence exists that people on low-carb diets may prevent or improve health problems like metabolic syndrome, diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease.Low-carb diets do seem to have an advantage in comparison to moderate-carb diets in regards to reducing HDL (""bad"") cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

, Our body needs carbohydrates to produce the energy it needs to operate. Properly-followed low-carb diets should not cause major medical issues, but severely restricting carbohydrate intake does carry risks.If you go to the extreme and consume less than 50 grams of carbs a day, you risk developing ketosis. This occurs when ketones build up in your body as a result of excessive break-down of stored fat for energy, and can cause nausea, fatigue, headaches, and bad breath.
During the first week or two of a low-carb diet, you may experience symptoms akin to ketosis -- nausea, headache, bad breath, etc. -- as your body adjusts to the significant reduction in carbs. This should pass, however, and you should move on to feeling perhaps better than ever.
Some medical professionals believe low-carb diets may increase long-term risks of cardiovascular disease and cancers because of the significant amounts of animal fats and proteins consumed, but the long-term risks of low-carb dieting, like the rewards, are more speculative than definitive.

, Especially if you are on a low-carb diet for an extended period of time, there is a risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies that can cause a host of problems including bone loss, gastrointestinal disorders, and increased risk for various chronic conditionsFruits may be full of sugars, but they are also full of vitamins and minerals. Don't completely exclude them from your low-carb diet. Make them a supporting player, not the star of the show that is your daily menu.
You may want to consider taking a multivitamin, or other supplements, but it is best to discuss this with a medical professional first.

, Talk to your doctor or other healthcare professional about your desire to begin a low-carb diet. Discuss your medical history and relative risks and benefits of the diet for you.


If you have a heart condition, reduced kidney function, or diabetes, among other conditions, it is especially important that you talk to your physician. You may well still be advised to begin the low-carb diet and it may benefit you greatly, but your doctor may also have specific advice and guidelines for you."

Weigh yourself once or twice a week.,
Find a support group.,
Reward yourself.",How to Lose Weight Without Exercising2," Monitoring your progress is important when you're losing weight. Stepping on the scale regularly can help you see how effective your diet program is going and whether or not you need to make any changes.


Remember, safe weight loss is about one to two pounds per week. Be patient with your progress. You're more likely to sustain slow and steady weight loss in the long-term.For the most accurate trend, it's best to weigh yourself at the same time of day, the same day of the week and in the same clothes (or choose to go without clothes).
If your weight loss has plateaued or you've begun to gain weight, recheck your meal plans and food journals and see if you can cut out any more excess calories to help induce weight loss.

, Having friends, family members or co-workers supporting you through your weight loss plan may help you continue to lose weight and maintain it long-term.Build a support group to help you stay on track.


See if others you know also want to lose weight. Many times people find it easier to tackle weight loss together as a group.
You can also try finding online support groups or support groups that meet in person on a weekly or monthly basis.
Get support by working with a registered dietitian; she can customize your meal plan and provide on-going support.

, Having a motivating and enticing reward at the end of your weight loss goals can help push you through to the end. Set up something exciting for yourself as you meet your goals. Ideas to try include:


Buying yourself new shoes or clothes.
Treating yourself to a round of golf or other favorite sport.
Getting a massage or other spa treatment.
Avoid food-related rewards, as these can trigger old habits that might not be conducive to weight loss.

"
"
Start a food journal.,
Get adequate rest.,
Increase your baseline physical activity.",How to Lose Weight Without Exercising3," Journaling your meals, snacks and drinks can help motivate you to stay on track. Also, people who journal typically lose more weight and keep it off longer compared to those who do not track their food.


You can either purchase a journal or download a food journal app. Try to track as many days as you can. Again, you're more likely to stay on track and stick with your meal plan the more often you record your foods.
Keep track of your food journal. This may be a good resource to evaluate how well your diet is going and how effective it is for weight loss.

, Sleeping seven to nine hours each night is recommended for general health and wellness.However, adequate sleep is also important for weight loss. Studies show that people who sleep less than six or seven hours nightly or have poor sleep weigh more than those who get adequate rest.Go to bed earlier. If you have to get up early, try to get in bed earlier to help increase your total sleep time.
To make sure you have a sound and undisturbed sleep, remove all electronics — like your phone or computer — from your bedroom.
Practice good sleep hygiene to ensure you get the most out of your sleep.

, Baseline activity is activity that you already do everyday — walking up stairs, walking to and from the car, and doing daily chores.This type of activity does not burn a lot of calories, but can help support your weight loss.


Although it's very possible to lose weight without going to the gym or working out regularly, there are definitely benefits of being moderately active. Even by simply increasing baseline activity, you may notice more weight loss, improved mood, or increased energy.Try to increase your baseline activity each day. Try: parking father away, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, standing during commercial breaks, or delivering messages to co-workers in person instead of email.
Encourage social gatherings that are a bit more active. Frisbee golf, swimming, or a simple picnic in the park with friends are activities that will get you moving (and get you fresh air). If weather is an issue, do something indoors like dancing.

"
"
Refrain from overeating.,
Become friends with other people who are on the raw food diet.,
Get into a good exercise routine.",How to Stay on a Raw Food Diet2," It's important to eat at the same time every day and develop a consistent eating schedule. This establishes an internal clock for your hunger triggers and it will greatly reduce the odds of having extreme cravings because you will be consistently keeping your body satisfied and full.


When you're eating, try to avoid any types of distractions. This will help you to consume your food at a good pace. If you're distracted, you will tend to eat faster and may not even realize that you're doing so. When this happens, you likely won't know when you're full and will continue to eat beyond what is necessary. If you eat without distraction, it can help you to become full with raw foods and stay full longer. This makes you less likely to reach for non-raw foods in addition to the raw foods you consumed.







, You can meet people in your area who are also doing the diet by joining a local support group. If there are no support groups in your area created for people who are doing the raw food diet, consider starting one up! Just having a few people to lean on during your adjustment period can make a tremendous difference in your ability to stay on track. People who share the same goal as you will help you keep to your diet and will also offer an excellent example showing you the benefits of what you're doing.

, Everyone knows that exercise is a great way to stay healthy, but it also has other benefits. Exercising keeps positive energy around you and will also help to curb your cravings for bad food. Any type of exercise that involves meditation is beneficial and will help you stay on track because the spiritual factor of the exercise will help you stay focused on your goals.

"
"
Give yourself praise for what you're doing.,
Refrain from being too hard on yourself.",How to Stay on a Raw Food Diet3," Buy yourself something small whenever you have stayed on track for a certain amount of time. Even if it is just a certain type of exotic fruit or a natural snack that you wouldn't normally buy, doing so can be a great way to reward yourself for sticking to your goals. And non-food rewards such as visiting a meditation center, going to see an indie movie or an item of hemp clothing are other great ways to reward yourself.

, Don’t beat yourself up if you fall off track. If you slip and eat something that you shouldn’t have eaten, try not to give yourself a hard time about it. Focus on the long term goal and acknowledge how far you have come in your efforts. Accept that you're only human and mistakes and slip-ups are going to happen occasionally. Cravings can be very difficult to deal with, especially at the beginning stages of your new diet. This is one of the reasons why a support group can be of great help. Make sure to learn from your mistakes and move on. Dwelling on your weakness will not help and will only build a negative attitude towards what you are trying to accomplish.

Increase your aerobic activity level.,
Add in high-intensity interval exercises.,
Include regular resistance training.,
Increase your lifestyle activity.",How to Reduce Your Overall Body Fat2," Put together an aerobic exercise routine that will work in conjunction with your diet to cut body fat. Together, aerobic exercise and diet have been shown to be one of the best combinations to reduce body fat.


In general, it's recommended to include at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week — that's just 20 minutes every day.To speed the reduction of body fat, it's suggested to work out for longer — up to 60 minutes daily.Include a wide variety of aerobic exercises like: walking/jogging, running, biking, dancing, swimming, martial arts or boxing and using the elliptical. Choose activities you enjoy, as this will make you more likely to stick with it.
If you're just starting out with exercise, start by building upon your current activity regimen.
Whether you opt for low impact exercises such as swimming or walking, or a more intense routine like kickboxing or weight training, aim to work out for at least 30 minutes.

, Some studies have shown that more vigorous intensity exercises that are done in intervals decrease body fat more efficiently than moderate-intensity exercise.Interval training combines both very high- and moderate-intensity exercise. These workouts are usually done for shorter periods of time. An example of interval training is: 1 minute of sprinting followed by 3 minutes of jogging. This cycle would be repeated several times, for about 20 minutes total (not including your warm up and cool down).
Interval training is great for body fat reduction as it has been shown to burn more calories from fat and keeps your metabolism elevated up to 24 hours after you've completed the workout., Strength training does not burn high levels of fat when you're performing the exercises; however, over time, strength training can help you build lean muscle mass which can help you increase your metabolism and your body's ability to burn calories.It's recommended to include strength training two to three days a week for at least 30 minutes.It's important to work all large muscle groups throughout the week.
Always include at least two days of rest and recovery between strength training routines. Your body and muscles need time for adequate recovery, otherwise performance may suffer over time., In addition to cardio and strength training, you can increase your daily lifestyle activity. Studies have shown that, in general, people who are more active tend to be healthier.Think about how much you move or how many steps you take in a day. How can you increase that?
A few ways to increase movement in your day include: do leg lifts while you sit at your desk or stand or do knee raises during commercial breaks.
Add more steps to your day by: taking a walk break during lunch, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, park farther away from your destination, and walk to places that are close to you (like the grocery store or pharmacy).

"
"
Manage stress levels.,
Go to bed earlier.,
Ensure that you are eating healthy portions.,
Eat mindfully.",How to Reduce Your Overall Body Fat3," Studies have shown that long-term, low-grade, chronic stress increases cortisol levels in the body. When this occurs, not only can it be difficult to lose weight, you may even gain more body fat.Exercising regularly can help manage stress levels. If you're feeling overwhelmed or overly stressed, take a 10 minute walk to help yourself calm down and unwind. Try yoga, which can be meditative.
Engage in other activities that will also help you relax. You can listen to music, read a good book or magazine, journaling, get together with friends, or watch a movie. Try meditation, deep breathing, positive visualization, and progressive muscle relaxation.
If you're having trouble managing stress levels, consider talking to a therapist or behavior specialist. These health professionals will be able to coach and guide you to better stress management.
Avoid relying on tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, or other drugs.

, Many people do not get adequate rest each night. Sleep is important for a variety of bodily functions including weight management. Go bed to earlier to get more sleep to help reduce your body fat levels.It's recommended to get between seven and nine hours of sleep each night. You may need to go to bed earlier and wake up a little later (if possible) to help you increase the amount you sleep each night.
Adequate rest also helps improve athletic performance in addition to helping you manage your hunger signals throughout the day.

, Portion control is necessary if you want to reduce body fat. Portion controlling will help you reduce your overall calorie intake and body fat.


In general, average healthy adults adults should consume no more than 3 – 4 oz of protein, 1/2 cup of grains, 1/2 cup of fruit and 1 cup of vegetables per serving.Use measuring cups or a food scale to help keep you on track with your portions.
You can also use smaller plates, bowls and cups to physically limit how much food you can serve yourself at one sitting.
Consuming more than the recommended portions of foods may increase your risk for gaining weight and increasing total body fat.

, Turn off your TV, put away your phone or book, and pay attention when you are eating. Eat slowly, chew well, and savor your food. Eating while distracted or when you are feeling emotional can cause you to overeat.Try to be present when you eat your food, noticing the tastes, smells, and textures."
"
Start a journal or log.,
Get on the scale weekly.,
Take your measurements.,
Get a body fat percentage test.",How to Reduce Your Overall Body Fat4," Whenever you're trying to lose weight or reduce your body fat, it's a good idea to start a journal. You can include a variety of information, but this log will help you see and measure your success.


Start a journal prior to making any changes. You might make notes about what you plan to change, your timeline and any other ideas or thoughts you have.
Think about keeping track of your foods and beverages. Logging what you eat has been shown to help people stay on track. It will also allow you to see any slip ups or help you determine if what you're eating is affecting your success.Also keep track of any measurements you take like your weight.

, When you're trying to lose weight and reduce your overall body fat, it's important to monitor your progress. One way to check in is by weighing yourself weekly.


Studies have shown that weekly weigh-ins help people stay on track and on target. You're more likely to be successful long-term if you continue to self monitor and check-in with your weight.Ideally, weigh yourself about one to two times a week. It might be harder to see accurate progress if you're weighing yourself daily due to normal fluctuations in body weight.
For the most accurate measure of your progress, weigh yourself on the same day of the week, at the same time and in the same clothes. First thing in the morning, before eating or drinking, before dressing, but after using the restroom is best.

, As you continue to lose weight and reduce your overall body fat, you'll notice that it's not only the scale that's changing. If you're losing body fat, you should also notice the size and shape of your body also changes.


Prior to starting your diet and exercise program, take a variety of measurements. These will help you see where you're losing the most fat.
Typical places to measure and track are: waist, hips, bust, thighs and upper arms. Keep these measurements in a journal. Every month, re-measure yourself to help you track your progress.
If your weight is staying the same, but your measurements are smaller and you have been working out, you are likely gaining muscle and losing fat, which is a healthy improvement.

, If you're able, get your body fat percentage tested and evaluated. This is the percentage of your body that is made up from fat. As you continue to diet and exercise, this percentage should decrease over time.Many gyms offer body fat percentage as a free service to their members. Ask a staff member or trainer at your local gym for more information.
You may also ask your doctor or physician if they have the equipment in office to evaluate your body fat percentage.
There are devices you can purchase for home use, but these typically take a lot of experience and practice using. Your margin of error will most likely be much larger compared to a health or fitness professional doing the tests for you.

Become informed about the raw food diet.,
Read books on raw food diets.,
Find community.,
Try it.,
Acquire the appropriate kitchen equipment.,
Consider the source of your food.,
Know which foods form part of a raw food diet.",How to Go on a Raw Food Diet1," Understanding the purpose and philosophy behind the raw food diet is an essential part of becoming an advocate for and ensuring that you are enjoying it, as well as benefiting from it. There are some well-known advocates of the raw food diet you can begin by reading about, and there are numerous websites available to read.


Search online for relevant websites. Useful search terms include: ""living foods"", raw food diet, natural raw foods, raw, sprouting, dehydrator, juicing, blender, vita-mix, healing, enzymes, organic or raw food recipe, etc.;
, Either borrow or purchase quality raw food diet books to learn as much as you can. Many raw food recipe books will also include historical backgrounds, nutritional analysis, and philosophical underpinnings along with the recipes. Good books to begin with include:


Dr. Ruthann Russo's The Raw Food Lifestyle, which includes a practical diet plan and tips on how to make the switch to raw living.Dr. T. Colin Campbell's The China Study includes alternative sources of protein., Join a local potluck or start one of your own. It's wonderful to share food with others. Online forums provide a great resource to meet fellow raw foodists, exchange recipes and have questions answered. And there are a number of raw foodists using Twitter and Facebook to exchange messages, meeting events, and ideas that can spark your own knowledge and expand your group of raw food friends.


Look for raw food festivals, get-togethers, cafes, and un-cooking classes.

, If you're concerned that you don't necessarily agree with the rationale for eating raw food all the time, the best advice is to give it a good shot.You'll only know if eating raw food works for you if you try it and see how it makes you feel. Some suggestions for transitioning to a whole or partial raw food diet include:Don't agonize over the decision. Pondering the worth of raw foods from an intellectual point of view can be something you allow to bubble away at the back of your mind rather than serving as a hurdle to stop you from beginning at all. Moreover, what matters is how you feel on such a diet; you can gradually come to terms with the nutritional science as you proceed (subject to the warnings outlined below).
Be flexible. It might be that you prefer to eat a partially raw diet for a length of time before advancing to a completely raw diet. In some cases, you may never fully transition to a wholly raw food diet but might mix it with 60 percent raw food and 40 percent vegan cooked food, for example.The need for freshness, unprocessed foods, and organic sources remains pertinent however you choose to mix it.
Trust your taste buds. If your head is bothering you with the whys and wherefores, trust your taste buds first. They'll reassure you that raw foods are delicious.
Appreciate the ease of preparation. Many raw foods are easy to prepare provided you select the right recipes. Indeed, sometimes there is no need to bother with recipes at all, but just prepare the foods simply and enjoy them in their raw state as salads or in their own right as a snack.
Find recipes that don't ask for exotic ingredients that are hard to find. You'll give up easily if you feel that you have to trek across town or order online just to get hold of strange ingredients. An occasional use of these might be called for, but keep most of your daily eating requirements to the ingredients that you can easily source locally.

, Quality kitchen equipment makes following a raw food diet much easier and less time-consuming. Look for items that are simple, affordable, easy to clean, and will do the range of things needed. When preparing raw food, typical preparation techniques include cutting into chunks, chopping coarsely or finely, dicing, mincing, slivering, julienne, shredding, grating, tearing, and chiffonade. As a raw foodist, you'll benefit from using these helpful ""must-haves"":



Sharp knives are essential, along with good cutting boards (either the more easily sanitized plastic boards, well maintained wooden boards, or - preferably - sustainably-farmed bamboo boards).
A food processor can be very useful. A food processor is excellent for chopping and mixing various foods.
A dehydrator removes moisture from food and thus preserves it for longer term storage.
A blender. Ani Phyo also recommends a Vita-Mix.Juicers are an excellent and easy way to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into a diet. Use sparingly with fruit, as it is better to eat fruit than to drink it.
Experiment with a solar oven.A solar oven uses minimal heat to preserve more nutrients. It can be used with a variety of dishes to make satisfying and delicious patties, hot and cold soup, dips, crackers, etc.

, When switching to a raw food diet, the source of your food is important. Organic food is unburdened by the chemicals used for conventional crops. Even though the scientific arguments continue to rage over the benefits of organic versus conventionally grown from a nutrient perspective, it's hard to argue with the fact that placing undue chemical burdens onto the environment is harming our environment, given that foods grown with excessive chemical loads are depleting soils, fouling up rivers and seas, and have questionable residues from pesticides on many of our foods. Ways to help yourself include:


Grow your own food. Experiment with sprouting seeds and herbs. A sunny window sill can be a good source of fresh food all year round.
Make your own compost. Your food will contain more nutrients. Try a compost bin or a worm composter.
Buy the most important organic produce when possible. If price is a factor for you, at least purchase the organic foods most recommended for eating organic as the basis of a healthy diet. Some crops are more heavily sprayed and intensively raised than others — this is where doing your own research comes in handy. Learn about the ""Dirty Dozen,"" i.e. the foods that carry the highest load of pesticides and should be organic whenever possible, at this website., There is a wide range of food available to the raw foodist, contrary to scoffing by those who dismiss the diet. What you will be losing is processed food but that's a bonus, not a problem! At least 75 percent of food consumed should not be heated over 118ºF or 48ºC. What you can eat are unprocessed, preferably organic, whole foods such as:


Fresh fruits and vegetables – make sure it's the freshest and organic where possible. Always have a good variety of greens, root vegetables, and fresh herbs in your fridge.
Nuts and seeds – always have two jar-sprouted items in your fridge at any one time and always have sunflower sprouts available. Keep a jar of almonds soaking in the fridge for ready use (change the water every day, for up to 5 days).Seed and nut butters are also important in a raw food diet.

Beans, grains, and legumes. Make sure you are choosing sprouted beans and legumes — they are tough to digest otherwise.
Dried fruit such as dates, raisins, cranberries, goji berries, pineapple, coconut, apricot, mangoes, apples, etc., make a great selection. Dates make excellent sweeteners for raw food desserts.
Fresh and dried herbs and spices – these add the flavoring variety to your food.
Salts – these can bring mineral nutrients to your diet if you use sea salt, miso or nama shoyu, Bragg Liquid Aminos, or Himalayan salt.
Oils – be sure to source your oil from a reputable place, and choose virgin cold-pressed olive oil, refrigerated flax oil, and refrigerated hemp oil.
Vinegar – apple cider vinegar is considered to be the best because it is high in malic acid, aiding the digestion of proteins.Seaweed – this brings a wide range of minerals into your diet and lignans (anti-cancer properties). Look for hijiki, dulse flakes, nori sheets, and wakame.
Young coconut milk.
Cocoa and carob – choose both from quality sources, organic, and store in airtight containers for freshness.
Raw food pate – this is a great standby to always have on hand for immediate eating.

Sauerkraut – make your own from cabbage or other vegetables for a long-term, fridge item that is healthy and spices up many raw food meals.For raw omnivores and carnivores, eggs, fish (sushi, sashimi), meat, milk and dairy products (non-pasteurized/non-homogenized) may also be included."

Focus on whole grains.,
Choose a high-fiber breakfast cereal.,
Add flaxseed to cereals and shakes.,
Have a bowl of oatmeal.,
Make breakfast burritos in advance.",How to Get More Fiber at Breakfast1," Whole grains provide greater fiber than refined carbohydrates such as white bread, and also are generally more healthy for you. Whole wheat, bran, barley, oats, and buckwheat have some of the highest fiber content.Simply switching your morning toast or bagel from white bread to a rich whole grain variety will enable you to get more fiber at breakfast.;
, If you normally start your day with a bowl of dry cereal, switching to a high-fiber brand is a good way to get more fiber at breakfast. There are many cereal brands, such as All-Bran and Fiber-One, that focus primarily on being a healthy source of fiber.If you normally eat Corn Flakes, for example, you can switch to Bran Flakes and add 6 grams of fiber to your breakfast.
Aim for a cereal with high bran content, or stick with your favorite cereal and simply mix in a few tablespoons of unprocessed wheat bran with it each morning.

, 1 ounce of flaxseed has 8 f of fiber. You can grind flaxseed in a coffee grinder or food processor so that the small seeds become like dust. Then you can sprinkle them on your favorite cereal or mix them into yogurt or smoothies to get more fiber at breakfast., Particularly when the weather outside turns cold, a bowl of oatmeal can be a warm and satisfying way to start your day, and also provides as many as 8 to 10 grams of fiber per serving.If you don't care for the taste of oatmeal, sweeten it with maple syrup or honey.
Add berries and nuts, or other sliced fruit, to further increase the amount of fiber you're getting at breakfast.

, Breakfast burritos made with a whole-grain or high-fiber tortilla wrap can provide between 10 and 15 grams of fiber per serving, depending on the fillings you use.You can make a breakfast burrito from scratch in a few minutes, but if your mornings are particularly busy you can also make a batch in advance and freeze them.
Include salsa and leafy greens to up the fiber content. You also might include avocado, which is particularly high in fiber.

Look for the positives.,
Appreciate your body.",How to Get Rid of Inner Thigh Fat," In order to lose weight, you should get most of your calories from low-calorie and nutrient-dense food sources.Make sure to include foods such as high-quality proteins (including lean meats and nuts), fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates (including whole wheat breads, legumes, and brown rice).Avoid heavily processed foods whenever possible. These include some foods that are frozen (including frozen pizza) and pre-made meals (including microwavable meals).These foods have been processed to compensate for the nutrition lost during the process it took to preserve the food.Choose fresh foods as often as possible.;
, Eating multiple (four to five) small meals throughout the day instead of three large meals can help keep your metabolism elevated and suppress your appetite so that you don’t overeat.If you decide to eat more frequently throughout the day, make sure that you keep your portion sizes small. You don’t want to end up eating large meals more frequently and taking in more calories!

, Saturated fats are less beneficial to your body than unsaturated fats and are usually found in animal sources, like dairy and meat, as well as hydrogenated oils. Many of our favorite desserts are filled with saturated fats, so make sure you limit your intake of sweets.


Palm and coconut oils contain the highest amount of saturated fat, but butter and rendered animal fats like lard and shortening contain a considerable amount of saturated fat as well. Fish oil, for all its healthy omega-3 fatty acids, also contains a high percentage of saturated fat, so it is important to read the nutrition labels on the foods you purchase and limit your portion sizes when eating foods that are high in saturated fats.It is important to note that you should limit, not exclude, saturated fats from your diet. The occasional saturated fat is fine, especially if it offers other health benefits, such as fish or nuts.

,


Replace beef and pork with chicken and turkey. Fish is also lower in fat than most red meat and has additional health benefits. When possible, you should opt for fresh fish over sardines, tuna, or other fish packed in oil.
Legumes like lentils, chickpeas, and pinto beans also pack a considerably high amount of low-fat protein. These foods will help you to feel full and will provide you with the necessary nutrition so that you aren’t deprived of essential nutrients as you eat a low fat diet in order to lose weight.

, Calcium helps regulate the way that fat cells store and break down fat, while low-fat dairy (such as milk and yogurt) can help promote weight loss.Particularly for women, who are especially prone to osteoporosis, it is crucial to include a sufficient amount of low-fat dairy in your diet.


Choose low-fat dairy instead of whole or no-fat dairy. Think two-percent or one-percent milk instead of whole milk or fat-free milk. Low-fat dairy options are often better that non-fat dairy, which are usually packed full of sugars.
Include more milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese in your diet. These dairy sources are lower in fat than most hard cheeses, creams, and butters.
Anyone over the age of nine years should consume approximately 3 cups of dairy per day.Children aged two to three years should consume approximately 2 cups of dairy each day, while children ages four to eight years old should consume about 2.5 cups of dairy each day., Alcohol is a source of empty calories that you will want to cut out of your diet as much as possible in order to lose weight. Your body reduces its fat-burning by nearly 75% after just one and a half drinks in order to rid itself of the by-products of alcohol (acetaldehyde and acetate).Thus, the fat and carbs that you eat have a greater chance of being stored as fat.


Even moderate consumption of alcohol can increase the amount of calories you consume, can decrease your motivation for exercising, and can negatively impact your sleep.If you do choose to drink, drink in moderation. This means one or fewer drinks daily for women and two or fewer drinks daily for men. (One drink is equivalent to 12-oz of beer, 5-oz of wine, or 1.5-oz of liquor).

, While there is some room for forgiveness in your diet, there are certain foods and drinks that are more likely to throw your diet off altogether. These should be avoided as much as possible. Take foods with empty calories and no nutritional benefit out of your diet. Drinks like soda and foods like frozen French fries and sweet breakfast cereals should be avoided., To lose this fat, you will need to reduce your overall body fat. It is essential to be realistic in what you can expect from your weight loss.

, Cardiovascular exercise is a great way to burn fat. In order to lose overall body fat (and thereby also lose fat in your inner thigh region), you should increase the amount of time that you do cardiovascular exercising or increase the days that you do cardiovascular exercise.Cardio workouts are particularly well-suited to assist with the appearance of your thighs because most cardio exercises work the lower body, which can tone and shape your thighs as you lose weight.For popular cardio exercises to try, look to elliptical training, running, stair climbing, jumping rope, and brisk walking.Exercise at least a half hour a day 5 days a week in order to increase your fat burning.Always consult with your physician before beginning a workout routine to make sure that you are healthy enough for moderate to intense exercise.

, Interval training involves alternating intense bursts of vigorous activities with periods of lighter activity.For example, you can alternate between walking and jogging (five minutes each, repeated for a total of 30 – 60 minutes), or you can alternate between jogging and running. Doing interval workouts will burn more calories, and thereby will burn more fat.


Aim for 30 minutes or more of interval training four to five times each week.,


To do a wall squat, place your back against a flat wall and bend your knees to a 45-degree angle. Hold this position for 30 seconds, then stand up and rest. Do four sets of 10 reps.

, This exercise is a bit of cardio coupled with toning. The combination of strengthening and cardio will help you burn major calories while targeting your inner thigh muscles.


Stand with your feet wide and your knees and toes pointed outward. In this position, your hand should be reaching down to the floor (picture a sitting frog!). Squat down as low as you can, but keep your chest up and make sure your knees are aligned over your toes.
Jump up in the air and rotate your body a quarter turn while bringing your feet together. While you jump, swing your arms over your head to help propel your body.
Land in a squat (the squat should be as deep as possible). And jump up again until you complete a full rotation (four jumps will constitute a full rotation).
Repeat as many times as possible for 1 minute. Then, repeat while rotating in the opposite direction.

,


Sit on a sturdy chair (one that does not have wheels), and rest your feet flat on the floor with your knees bent at a right (90-degree) angle. Place the pillow between your knees and thighs.
Exhale as you squeeze the pillow between your thighs. You should imagine it as if you are attempting to squeeze the stuffing out of the pillow. Hold this squeeze for 1 minute, and breathe normally while doing this.

, This exercise targets your adductors, the muscle group that runs along the inside of your legs. Doing this move will help increase muscle tone and will assist in burning off the layer of fat on your inner thighs when combined with regular cardio exercise.


Lie down flat on your side. Your legs should be straight out with one foot stacked on top of the other. You can bend your bottom arm and place in under your head for support, while you rest your other arm at your side, letting your hand fall on your upper hip. Your hips and shoulders should be perpendicular to the floor and your head should be aligned straight with your spine.
Support your spine by tensing your abdominal muscles and bring your lower leg forward. It should lie in front of your upper leg. At this point, both legs should still be straight, but the foot of the upper leg should be brought down to the floor so that both feet are resting on the floor.
Raise your lower leg off the floor. Breathe out and gently lift your lower leg so that it rises above the foot of the upper leg. Raise your legs until your hips begin to tilt or until you feel tension in your lower back or oblique muscles.
Inhale and return your leg to the floor in a controlled manner.
Gradually roll over so that you are resting on your other side. Repeat the exercise, stretching your other leg, to finish one set. Repeat this lift 10 times; do this for three sets on each side, alternating sides.

, Realize that you are probably your own worst critic, and you notice your inner thigh fat more than anyone else does. Ask yourself: do my thighs need as much work as I think they do, or am I seeing more inner thigh fat than really exists? Evaluate if you are being overly critical of your body.


You may want to ask a trusted family member or close friend for an honest evaluation of your inner thigh fat. This person can help you identify if this is an area that may need some slimming and toning, or if you are being overly critical of your own body.
For a true medical evaluation of the state of your body, visit your doctor. They can provide accurate information about areas in which you collect fat and can help you calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) and understand exactly what it means.

, While your thighs may have more fat than you would like, there are other parts of your body that should be a source of pride. Do not spend all your time focusing on your “problem areas.” Instead, make sure you spend some time recognizing the features of your body that make you feel beautiful and accentuate these areas when possible.


Name three parts of your body that are attractive and make you feel good. You might have strong arms, a flat belly, straight teeth, or bright green eyes. Whatever part of your body you like the most, make sure you highlight this feature.

, Your body is an amazing machine that carries you through your daily life. It may help you to pay greater attention to what your body can do on a daily basis. Remember that your body is an instrument, not just an ornament.Appreciate that your strong thighs allow you to lift up your child or grandchild, walk up a flight of stairs, and play hopscotch in your driveway.

Make sure to avoid foods that will upset your stomach or dehydrate you.",How to Follow the BRAT Diet," They are easy to digest and high in potassium, which is depleted by vomiting and diarrhea. They are also rich in amylase-resistant starch, which has been shown to end diarrhea more quickly.Some find ripe bananas to be easier on the stomach than the under-ripe bananas. Find what works for you.;
, Rice helps to improve the rate of rehydration and decrease the length of illness.You can prepare rice in several ways:


Use a rice cooker.
Bring 1 cup of rice and 1.5 cups of water to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to a simmer. Wait until all the water is absorbed, approximately 20 minutes.Cook rice in boiling water until soft enough to eat, then strain.

, Apples are a low fiber food that helps to make your stool firmer.Raw fruits are difficult to digest, so applesauce is preferred to a whole apple or slices.To make your own applesauce:Place 6 peeled, cored, and quartered apples in a large pot along with 1 cup of water and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of lemon juice.
Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
Use a potato masher if necessary to break up any chunks.
Stir in 1 teaspoon of sugar. You can also add ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon, though this may upset your stomach.
If purchasing apple sauce, make sure to buy unsweetened or 'no sugar added' applesauce varieties.

, Toast is another easily digested, low fiber food that will help to firm up your stool.For added nutrition, you should feel free to spread jam on your toast if you can stomach it. You will probably want to avoid butter and peanut butter, as they are high in fat, which is hard on your stomach.While whole grain toast is typically healthier than white toast, that is not as important here. The high fiber content in whole grain products can lead to gastric upset.

, Don’t eat solid foods if actively vomiting. Instead, stick to liquids high in electrolytes, like pedialyte.When vomiting has ended, you can introduce broth, watered down fruit juice, non-caffeinated sodas, or tea with honey. Take small sips, and drink most of your liquids between meals.Some find that chewing on ice chips helps with dehydration when nauseated.

, Be careful adding sauce to pasta unless you are sure you can stomach it. Be sure to remove the skins from the potatoes., Plain chicken, trimmed of fat is easy on the stomach and a good source of protein, which is important to aid in recovery.Plain eggs or egg whites are also very gentle on the stomach and an excellent source of protein.

, The probiotics (good bacteria) in yoghurt have been shown to reduce the length and intensity of diarrhea.The most helpful strains of bacteria include Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacteria bifidum.You can also get probiotics in pill or powdered form. The pills and powders usually contain a wide range of helpful strains of bacteria.

, Research shows that ingredients in cocoa target and disable the protein that causes the intestine to secrete water. A little chocolate can therefore help solidify your stool.If making cocoa, add very little milk, as it is hard on upset stomachs.

, A tablespoon of carob powder mixed with applesauce can help soothe your stomach.9-30 grams of psyllium seed taken daily will thicken your stool, lessening the intensity of diarrhea., While it is important to get back to a normal diet as quickly as possible, you should start with the simpler foods listed here and add others slowly. Be careful to avoid:


Fatty and greasy foods, especially fried food.Dairy products other than yoghurt.Raw or dried fruits and vegetables, and full-strength fruit juice.Caffeine and alcohol; they are diuretics (things that dehydrate you).Desserts and candy; sugary foods are hard to digest.Salty foods; too much salt and not enough water will worsen dehydration.

Take your time.,
Cook for yourself.,
Buy fresh foods.,
Skip prepacked cured meats or ones with added salt.,
Avoid brined foods.,
Skip the salad dressings and condiments.,
Make trades.,
Switch spices and other flavors for salt.,
Try marinating meat and vegetables.,
Remove salt shakers from the table.,
Keep high-sodium foods out of the house.",How to Follow a Low Sodium Diet1," You may be tempted to ditch all the high-sodium foods at once, but it will take a little while for your taste buds to adjust. Make your changes gradually.For instance, you can try making a recipe you like, but add half the salt than you normally do.If you try to go cold-turkey, you may be tempted to go off the low-sodium diet all together.;
, Fast food meals are usually high in sodium, as are quick meals at home, such as dry pasta mixes. Fast food restaurants are not the only culprits. Most high-end restaurants utilize a lot of salt to enhance flavor in their food. It is almost always thrown into every component of the dish; even sweet items! Make meals from scratch, and you'll be in control of how much sodium goes into the meal., Instead of boxed meals, buy uncooked meats (fresh or frozen) and fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits. Canned vegetables often contain added salt, unless you specifically buy ones without.However, canned fruits are fine, as they usually don't have added salt., That is, skip lunch meats, sausages, pepperoni, and beef jerky, as they all have extra salt.If you love sandwiches, try roasting a chicken or beef roast for the week, then carving off pieces to use in sandwiches., Foods like olives and pickles are preserved in a brine, which is a mixture of salt and water. If you're on a low-sodium diet, you should avoid these foods., Most prepackaged salad dressings and condiments contain high amounts of salt, so unless they are specified ""low-sodium,"" you should avoid them.Some condiments do offer low-sodium alternatives, so be sure to check around on the condiment aisle.
Consider making your own salad dressing to avoid sodium in pre-packaged varieties. A simple blend of oil and acid (ex: lemon juice) can make a tasty dressing. Salt is truly not needed.
Try making a simple vinaigrette at home. Mix together a splash of olive oil with a splash of balsamic vinegar. You can keep it that simple, or you can add in a few herbs, such as an Italian seasoning mix. For a fruity flavor, add in a spoonful of your favorite jam or preserves and mix well.

, For instance, try pork loin instead of ham. Pork loin is not cured like ham, yet it can be very flavorful with the right spices, such as sage or rosemary.Try interesting alternatives. For instance, instead of breadcrumbs, try topping dishes with ground broccoli. Instead of frying eggs in bread and salted butter, try using unsalted butter and rings of onion or bell pepper., Try out new (no-salt) seasoning mixes, such as a curry mix or a steak rub. Add a dash of balsamic vinegar for flavor instead of salt. Skip the salt at the dinner table, and instead, use pepper. You can add flavor to dishes in a variety of ways without adding extra salt., Use flavors such as lemon, garlic, and onion, along with a little olive oil, to marinate your meat and vegetables before cooking. Marinating them first will create more flavor, keeping you from missing the salt., If you can't grab the salt, you won't add more salt to your food at the table. Sometimes adding salt can be a mindless action, so just removing it from the table will make it easier for you to remember., Once you've learned what is high in sodium and what is not, stop stocking the high-sodium foods. That way, you won't be tempted to eat them. One surprising food that is high in sodium is cottage cheese. If you must keep high-sodium foods stocked for another family member, try keeping them in a separate cupboard or on a separate shelf."

Remain willing to adapt.",How to Follow the Paleo Diet," Supporters of the paleo diet believe that by recreating the way humans ate during the Stone Age, they can recreate a healthy lifestyle. Following the paleo diet can help you lose weight, control blood pressure, and manage your appetite.If you have different dietary or health concerns, the paleo diet may not be for you.


A change in lifestyle, even something as simple as your diet, can mean a major shift in your personal life. Knowing what you want to accomplish can help keep you motivated and on track.;
, The paleo diet involves eating more fresh meats and vegetables, so you'll need somewhere suitable to store them. Make sure you have ample freezer space for meat, and a refrigerator to keep vegetables cool.


Cooking paleo meals does not require specialized equipment, so you should not need to purchase additional pots, pans, or appliances beyond what you already own.
Equip yourself with a comprehensive cooking or recipe book specifically for the paleo diet.

, These can be red meat, pork, poultry, venison, eggs, or any other kind of meat. Meat for a paleo diet should be grass-fed, not corn-fed. This distinction is more important than the particular type of meat you choose. It better re-creates the conditions cavemen would have found their food, and avoids the sugars found in modern animal feed.


Fish and other seafood are also good meats to include. These contain healthy Omega 3 oils. Fish for the paleo diet should be wild, and not farm-raised.For each meal, a serving size of protein should be 4 – 8 ounces, or approximately one to two palm-sized pieces. You can eat a little more or a little less depending on factors such as your own weight or hunger level, but each meal should stay in that range., Vegetables provide most of the fiber and carbohydrates that you will get on the paleo diet. Fruits will provide the natural sugars your body needs. These should be fresh, not dried, fruits. Most fruits that fit with the ethos of the paleo diet (that is, eaten by cavemen) contain much less sugar than most fruits available today.If you are diabetic, or have other restrictions on sugar intake, it may be better to avoid sweeter fruits including grapes, bananas, mangos, sweet cherries, apples, pineapples, pears and kiwi fruit, especially early in the diet.
Your daily intake of fruits and vegetables should be at least nine servings (about 4 1/2 cups).You can spread these over your daily meals to best suit your appetite and menu.

, Remember that peanuts are not nuts (they are legumes), so instead focus on actual nuts like almonds, cashews, pine nuts, pecans, and walnuts. Unsalted pumpkin or sunflower seeds are also good. These make good snacks, but make sure you avoid salted and processed nuts. It is better to avoid snacking altogether, but nuts are the best choice.You can also use almond flour or coconut flours for many recipes.

, These should be natural, such as olive, walnut, flaxseed, macadamia, avocado, and coconut oils, all of which are sources of good fat. They are great for marinating meat, or providing a base for frying meats and vegetables.Each meal should include approximately one to two thumb-sized servings of fat, and oils are a good source of that., Dairy products are a gray area for paleo practitioners. Most paleo diets restrict dairy completely, as the introduction of regular dairy came much later in human history, and consuming dairy involves a large dose of carbohydrates in the form of lactose. In addition, modern dairy products come from cows fed with corn and other hormones, and are heavily pasteurized to remove fat. If you want to consume more of a ""primal"" diet, include dairy products such as full fat dairy like yogurt and butter from grass-fed cows., The paleo diet does not require you to eat meals on a set schedule. Instead, you eat when you are hungry. You certainly can eat three regular meals a day. If you are not hungry, though, you do not need to eat simply because it is time for a meal.Some paleo followers like to fast for extended periods between meals to better simulate the irregular eating schedule Stone Age humans would have followed. This is certainly not a necessary part of the diet, and being paleo does not have to mean fasting. The most important thing is eating the proper foods., When you first start out, it's likely you'll still be able to use some of your cookbooks for basics such as salads and roasting. However, you'll be confronted fairly quickly by all the elements you can't use, such as salt and processed items. Expand your repertoire of caveman recipes and explore the many possibilities by building on the basics.


Go through your existing cookbooks and adapt the recipes. You might like to compile a single book in a folder or in digital form to make it easier to refer to daily.
Search online for caveman food websites and blogs. There are also books available for purchase about the caveman diet – take a visit to your local bookstore. Popular websites include: Nom Nom Paleo, PaleoOMG, and RobbWolf.com.

, Cutting out grains and processed foods can be very difficult in the modern world, especially at first. Eating a slice of bread will not ruin your diet, and doesn't make you a failure. That being said, if you are not seeing results, you may want to reevaluate your diet and see if you are cheating a bit too much.


Some paleo dieters set aside a day during the week to eat whatever they want. This can help create better discipline throughout the rest of the week.If you're going to add a cheat food as a treat, use something filling and nutritious, such as a teaspoon of peanut butter on a banana, rather than grabbing a handful of cookies.

, Water is really the only approved paleo drink, and it can be especially helpful to keep your body functioning, especially given you will likely consuming additional protein. If water isn't enough, you can include an occasional cup of herbal tea or freshly squeezed fruit juice. Avoid sodas and processed fruit juices., While the modern paleo diet can supply most of the necessary nutrients, there are some potential weaknesses. If you are not getting all of these proper nutrients, consider additional supplements.Vitamin D. Unless your diet is rich in wild fish, and you get plenty of sunlight, you may need a Vitamin D supplement.
Omega-3 Fish Oil. In general, you will want to maintain balance between Omega-3 and Omega-6 oils. Unless you are fully paleo, 1 to 2 grams of high quality fish oil daily, containing Omega-3 oil, is a good supplement.
Probiotics. Western or vegetarian diets can sometimes damage the necessary bacteria in your stomach. When starting the diet, you may need to supplement what you eat with strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.

, At its core, the paleo diet is about changing your lifestyle, not just your meals. Even something as simple as walking as much as possible can be helpful to losing weight and getting the most out of your diet. Paleo exercise involves natural movements (preferably without too much gym equipment) and occasional strength training.Avoid extensive cardio workouts. These put extra pressure on your body, and require more carbohydrates.

Crossfit is a common exercise program for paleo dieters, and can be helpful for people looking for a more intense workout. Crossfit gyms are also a good place to meet other paleo dieters.

, Under most circumstances, the paleo diet presents very few health risks and is generally safe for most people to follow. It relies heavily on good sources of nutrients, including lean meats, vegetables, fruits, and nuts.The absence of whole grains, legumes, and dairy products will deprive you of some nutrients found in traditionally balanced diets, however, so a paleo diet may not be best for you if you have special requirements for fiber, calcium, or other vitamins and minerals.
Additionally, a paleo diet will be unsafe to follow if you have a vegetarian or vegan diet since soy and legumes--important sources of vegetarian protein--are not allowed.
If you have any previously known medical conditions, you should consult your doctor before attempting a paleo diet or any other major dietary change. In particular, those with heart, kidney, liver, or pancreatic disease may risk worsening their conditions by following a paleo diet., Even though a paleo diet will generally be safe for most people who do not have previously known medical concerns, it's always advisable to consult with a doctor or nutritionist before making a major change to your diet like this.Your doctor can work with you to determine if a paleo diet is right for your medical needs. Additionally, your doctor or nutritionist can help track the progress you make while following a paleo diet.

, Several clinical trials lasting 12 weeks or less suggest that following a paleo diet may make it easier to lose weight and maintain a healthy weight. Additionally, these studies also suggest better short-term glucose tolerance and blood pressure control.Note that longer clinical trials are still needed to assess the long-term risks and benefits.
There are some concerns that following a paleo diet long-term may result in higher levels of LDL cholesterol. The lack of calcium may also increase your osteoporosis risk, and the reduction of carbohydrates may result in ketosis.Additionally, following a restrictive diet like the paleo diet can be difficult to do for prolonged periods of time.

, While a paleo diet can be beneficial, it can also be more expensive since it largely promotes organic, grass-fed meats and other less accessible foods. If you plan on following a paleo diet, do so when your finances are balanced and budgeted for the extra expense., The scientific community still questions many of the underlying beliefs forming the basis of the paleo diet. While many of the foods restricted in this diet have been tied to health problems, many researchers still argue that the paleo diet could oversimplify dietary needs.Try the paleo diet for several months and evaluate your health both during and after. If the diet improves your health and your doctor concludes that it's safe for you to continue, it might be worth continuing. On the other hand, if you experience health concerns while following a paleo diet, be prepared to adapt or abandon it altogether for something more suited to your own needs.

Pay attention to your body.",How to Go on a Raw Food Diet2," Raw foods are more susceptible to spoilage and will not keep anywhere near as long as processed foods. Be prepared to consume raw foods quickly and to replenish them regularly.


Use up fresh food within the times recommended for consuming them. Their quality deteriorates after this time.
Harvest homegrown produce as you need it; that way you benefit from its growing, ""live"" goodness right up to the last possible moment.
Freeze such items as shelled nuts, seeds, dried fruits, carob, coconut, grains, etc., for optimal retention of their health benefits., Introduce raw foods slowly into your current diet.


Eat a variety of foods. Make a list of produce, herbs, nuts and seeds from A to Z that you would like to include in your raw food diet. Keep it seasonal but be sure to include as much variety as possible.
Begin with fresh fruit for breakfast. Or try a fresh fruit smoothie every breakfast, minus dairy.
Transition fresh, raw plant food into your remaining meals on a weekly basis. For lunch and dinner, have a large salad with the other items you're used to having. Include nuts, seeds, sprouted seeds, and sprouted beans.
Use raw food plant-based pates, non-dairy seasonings, fresh herbs, etc., to season raw food meals. Hummus can add zap to many meals. Added flavoring is very important for food not broken down by cooking, and helps to transform a ""salad"" into a ""meal"".
Use different food preparation techniques to add variety, such as sprouting seeds, grains, and beans, juicing fruit and vegetables, soaking nuts and dried fruit and blending.
Learn to make raw food desserts. You don't need to abandon your sweet tooth; many raw food desserts are possible beyond simple chopped up fruit.

, Not everyone appreciates the intensity of the work seemingly required for this diet if you follow the fussier food preparation examples.It is advisable to leave the trickier, fancier raw food diet suggestions for special occasions if you find they consume too much of your time in preparation. A raw food diet should not add to your anxiety levels, nor turn you into a crazed martyr to a cause that's rapidly depleting your patience.


Initially, expect some of the learning to be time-consuming as you switch preparation methods; after all, you are unlearning ""cooking"" and that can take some doing until it becomes second nature. After a time, it should become a lot faster, especially as you learn to prepare suitable items in batches.
You can always just add in some raw food to your diet rather devoting your entire dietary habits to it. Some people do a raw food diet on certain days of the week, or only do raw food at home and eat what they want when they go out. Find out what works for you, your body, your health, and your lifestyle!

, You may find that you need to supplement your diet to make sure that your nutritional needs are met. Try Vitamin B12 to prevent anemia. You may also need to include an iron and calcium supplement.Getting enough protein can be difficult on a raw foods diet.You may want to experiment with adding things like sushi or raw-milk cheese.

, Optimal health is about being healthy in a well-rounded way. What goes into your body is important but so is getting adequate exercise, relaxing properly to reduce stress, and thinking positively to ensure that you aren't bombarding your body with negative thoughts, emotions, and resentments.

, Many people will feel ill soon after abruptly starting a new diet. Although this is often referred to as a ""detoxification reaction"", it's actually your digestive system adjusting to your diet, and it happens with any diet.Increased fiber can cause temporary diarrhea or constipation. The change in diet can cause frequent flatulence, a notorious side-effect of those new to raw food diets.Some experts recommend easing into a new diet by slowly phasing in new foods and phasing out old ones, to allow your system time to adjust. However, if feelings of illness continue, this diet may not be for you and your body's individual needs.

If you want to get more fiber at breakfast, consider looking towards the Mediterranean and adding figs to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal.For example, just a couple of figs sliced on your oatmeal can provide you up to 15 grams of fiber per serving, as well as giving you an antioxidant, calcium, and potassium boost.

, Particularly if you pre-slice your fruit, a parfait can be made in just a few minutes so it won't interrupt your busy schedule but will still fill you up and give you an extra boost of fiber.Use berries or slices of unpeeled apple or pear. Bananas also are high in fiber.
To increase the fiber boost further, mix in ground flaxseed or chia seeds.

, Avocado is a high-fiber fruit, and avocado toast is a simple recipe that has found its way to the brunch menu of many trendy restaurants. To make your own at home, spread avocado on whole-grain toast.You can experiment with spices or add roasted chickpeas or lentils on top for even more fiber.

, Berries are high in fiber, particularly because you usually eat them whole with the peel intact. Just a handful of berries with your normal breakfast can drastically increase the fiber you have at breakfast.Fresh blueberries and strawberries also work well on top of your cereal or oatmeal, or mixed into yogurt.
You also might blend berries into a morning smoothie.

, If you regularly have potatoes, such as hash browns, with your breakfast, you can get more fiber if you don't peel your potatoes before you slice and dice them. Just make sure you wash them carefully.Like fruits, the peel of a potato contains more fiber than the potato itself.

, The juice of a fruit doesn't have the fiber that the whole fruit does. You'll get more fiber at breakfast if you eat the whole fruit, including the peel if it is edible, such as on an apple or a pear.Fruit peels contain the bulk of the fiber in most fruits. You can add unpeeled slices of apple or pear to your breakfast cereal, oatmeal, or yogurt for a fiber boost.

Make a sweet potato hash.,
Eat legumes.,
Look for low-carb bread.,
Include plenty of fruits and vegetables.",How to Get More Fiber at Breakfast3," Just because your diet doesn't allow potatoes doesn't mean you have to give up hash browns. Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of fiber and can be sliced or diced into a hash with eggs and ham or sausage.If you're vegan, add leafy greens, legumes, and tofu to your hash for even more fiber.

, If you're on a grain-free or gluten-free diet, legumes are an excellent way to get more fiber at breakfast. American diets in particular often overlook beans at breakfast, but in other cultures beans are a breakfast staple.For example, you might mix beans, along with tomatoes, onions, and peppers, into an omelette.
You also might try beans or lentils on toast. Sprinkle with garlic and drizzle with olive oil.

, If you are on a low-carb diet, such as the Atkins diet, you probably don't eat very many grains. However, there are plenty of companies that make special low-carb bread that you can still use for your morning toast and get plenty of fiber.Oats are naturally low-carb, so you might want to look for an oat bread, or a multi-grain bread that includes oats.

, Particularly if you're on a grain-free Paleo diet, getting enough fiber may at first seem difficult. However, there are plenty of fruits and vegetables that can easily provide the fiber you need for a healthy, balanced diet.Getting fiber from fruits and vegetables also is essential if you are on a gluten-free diet, since many grains are going to be off limits for you.

Look for the label ""low sodium."",
Check the label yourself.,
Pay attention to serving size.,
Check the menu.,
Keep a list of high-sodium and low-sodium foods.,
Think about hidden salt.",How to Follow a Low Sodium Diet2," This label means the food has 140 milligrams of sodium or less per serving.You can also look for ""sodium-free"" (less than 5 milligrams per serving) and ""very low sodium"" (less than 35 milligrams per serving). You can also look for ""unsalted."", Even if it's not labelled ""low sodium,"" you may need to pick the best option out of several brands. Look for one that has only about 5 percent of your daily value of sodium per serving.Remember that 'low sodium' may still be more than your particular daily allotment allows for. Keep in mind that these are based on very general guidelines and yours may be more specific.

, If a can of soup labelled ""low sodium"" has two servings in it, then you're really getting double the amount of sodium on the label if you eat both servings at once.

, Many restaurants offer menus with nutritional values these days. Sometimes, you may need to find the menu online before going to the restaurant, or you may need to ask your server for a menu nutritional facts. Alternatively, ask your server for low-sodium options, or ask if certain items can be served with less salt.Remember, you can even use this trick at fast food places. Many fast food places will make french fries without salt if you ask for them.

, Stick the list to your refrigerator so you'll see it often. That way, you always know what's best to eat when you go in search of a snack.The high-sodium list could include items such as pickles, olives, cured meats, tomato juice, dressings, chips, pretzels, soups, bouillon, and condiments. The low-sodium list could include foods such as fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, fresh or frozen meat, beans, yogurt, and cereal., Even small amounts of salt can add up, and you may not think about salt in foods such as milk and bread, both of which can have 130 milligrams or more of salt per serving. Though that falls under ""low sodium,"" you may miscalculate your daily intake if you don't pay attention to all the foods you're eating.Remember that even sweet items may have salt added. Salt enhances sweetness, therefore it is added to many desserts and other sweet items.

Understand why sodium is important.,
Know what happens to sodium.,
Understand what happens when you have extra sodium in your body.,
Know which diseases make it difficult to balance sodium in your body.",How to Follow a Low Sodium Diet3," You need a certain amount of sodium in your diet. Sodium plays an important role in helping you body run. It helps your muscles work, and it assists in sending nerve impulses throughout your body. It also helps keep your body's fluids in correct proportions., Sodium is processed through your kidneys. That is, your kidneys are responsible for making sure you have the right amount of sodium running through your blood. If they sense you are running low, they will store some up to help keep your body running properly. If you're getting too much, usually your kidneys will flush out the extra in your urine. Sometimes, however, your kidneys can't get rid of enough sodium.You also lose sodium in sweat., Doctors do not agree exactly how it works, but too much sodium in your body can increase your blood pressure. Most think that it increases the volume of the blood in your body, which in turn signals the body to up your blood pressure., Congestive heart failure and kidney diseases, for instance, can make it harder for your body to balance the sodium. Therefore, your doctor might put you on a low-sodium diet if you have one of these diseases."

Informing yourself about eating habits can help you more effectively change your bad eating habits.Read about nutrition and eating habits either in magazines or online. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and United States Department of Agriculture provide extensive information on health, nutrition and effecting change in your eating habits.;
, You can’t change bad habits without identifying your current eating patterns. Keeping a detailed food diary can help you figure out your bad and good habits and put you on the path to making changes.Write down everything you eat for two weeks to a month to help give you an overview and make it easier to identify bad habits and patterns.
Include snacks or foods you eat without normally realizing it or in passing.
Note the source of your food. For example, write if you are eating canned fruit versus fresh fruit.
Consider writing down how you feel before and after meals, which may help you identify bad habits and triggers for them.
Make sure to also note good habits in your food diary. For example, ""I eat breakfast every morning, even when I'm busy,"" or ""No matter what, I always have a side salad with dinner.""

, After a few weeks, you should be able to identify specific habits and patterns of eating. Knowing your bad habits can help you formulate a plan to begin making changes.Some bad habits you might want to note are:


Eating meals too quickly
Eating everything on your plate
Taking multiple helpings of meals
Eating or snacking when you’re not hungry
Eating while standing up, which can make you eat mindlessly or too quickly
Always having appetizers and/or desserts
Skipping meals, especially breakfast, In addition to bad eating habits, you should notice some good habits as well. It's important to know those good habits because they help you see where you're being successful so that you can support and expand those habits. Some examples of good eating habits include the following:

Eating healthy choices such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins
Having a healthy breakfast every day
Limiting high calorie snacks
Keeping sugary snacks to a minimum

, When you’ve figured out what your bad habits are, start making a plan to gradually replace them and continue your healthy habits. Include things in your plan like replacing bad foods for healthy alternatives, exercise, and rest.Make sure your plan is gradual so that it is easier to replace bad habits and reinforce good ones.For example, don’t get rid of all snacks in favor of eating nothing. Limit yourself to a couple of healthy snacks a day. Good snacking options include air-popped popcorn, fruit, and string cheese.Incorporate your good eating habits into your plan.
Create your plan around three healthy and nutritious meals and two wholesome snacks a day.Aim to have meals that include foods that meet nutritional needs.For example, eat lean protein, vitamins, and fiber with foods such as lean meats or nuts. Eat fruits and vegetables instead of things like burgers and fries.Be aware of situations that encourage bad habits like mindless snacking and write into your plan how you can avoid them. For example, keep apples or sliced carrots at your desk.Build in one “cheat day” or “cheat meal.” Allowing yourself a little conscious cheating may help you avoid bad habits on other days., If you are unsure of what your bad habits are or have difficulty figuring out good ones, talk to your doctor or a dietitian about your plan to change your diet. They may be able to identify other problem areas and suggest tricks to change and make alternatives to your diet.


Find a registered dietitian through the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics online search tool.Tell your doctor or dietitian about your plans and ask any questions that you may have.
Consider seeing a mental health professional to help you understand your daily habits and to assist you in making behavioral changes.

, Many people have triggers or cues for bad eating habits, such as sitting in front of the TV or getting a bread basket at a restaurant. Avoiding these “cues” or triggers can help you gradually forget and replace your bad habits.Figure out ways to avoid cues and triggers. For example, drive home a different route to avoid stopping for coffee or fast food.Find an alternative if you can’t avoid triggers. For example, keep healthy snacks in your car or chew gum when you drive past fast food restaurants., Your food diary will help you be more aware of your bad eating habits so that you can replace them with healthier options. Part of your plan for change will include replacing these habits with the new strategies you've incorporated into your plan.Come up with sensible alternatives to bad habits. For example, if you feel the need to clean your plate, take smaller amounts of food so that you can finish without feeling guilty or overstuffed.Try eating structured meals at a table, which can keep you from mindlessly eating bad foods.
Eat only when you’re hungry.
If you've started seeing a dietitian or mental health professional, include their recommendations in your plan.

, You’re probably excited to get rid of your bad habits and improve your health, but it’s important to make gradual changes This will help you incorporate many different good habits and stick to them for life. Pushing yourself to change too quickly could result in you getting overwhelmed and giving up. Changing any habit takes time.Try to include at least one healthy habit with each meal. For example, if you typically watch TV while eating, eat at the table instead. If you skip breakfast, try having having a piece of fruit with peanut butter.
Follow the same principle when replacing unhealthy foods with healthier choices. Consider having steamed broccoli with garlic salt instead of broccoli covered in cheese sauce.
Remember that small changes make a big difference over time.

, Planning your meals in advance can minimize the risk of returning to bad habits. Planning also reinforces your good eating habits. It may also ensure that you’re getting enough nutrients.Try and prepare as many of your own meals as possible to avoid cues and triggers.
Plan a healthy breakfast to start your day with healthy habits. Pack a lunch or scope out the menu at restaurants so that you don’t feel tempted to have something that isn't on your plan., Nobody is perfect and sometimes you’ll have a day where you go back to a bad habit. Give yourself a break and let yourself occasionally indulge in a bad habit.


There is some evidence that giving yourself a chance to cheat occasionally can help you stay with healthy habits.Focus on the positive, like that you ate healthy most of the day or haven’t reverted to unhealthy habits in a while., Learn about the basics of good eating and nutrition. This may make it easier to gradually switch out your bad habits and food choices for good ones.


Choose foods from the five food groups at each meal and make sure to vary choices from meal to meal so that you get plenty of nutrients. The five food groups are: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy.Eat 1-1.5 cups of fruit daily. Fruits like raspberries, blueberries, or cherries are good choices.Eat 2.5-3 cups of vegetables daily. Broccoli, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes are good choices.Eat 5-8 ounces of grains daily. Half of this amount should be whole grains from foods like brown rice, quinoa, or whole wheat bread.Eat 5-6.5 ounces of protein daily. Lean meats like pork or chicken, cooked beans, eggs, or nuts are good choices.Get 2-3 cups of dairy daily.Cheese, yogurt, and milk are good choices., Remove any foods from your pantry that influence bad eating habits. This can reinforce the gradual changes you are making.


Remove foods that are cues or triggers for you, such as chips, candy, or processed meals.
Donate unused food to a local food bank.

, Buy a selection of healthy choices to restock your pantry. Having mostly or only healthy options can reinforce good habits and help you avoid cues and triggers.


Avoid going overboard with buying food, which can cause some people to revert to overeating. This might require that you shop more often, but may also keep you on track with healthy habits.
Get options like whole wheat pasta, oatmeal, or brown rice so that you can avoid bad eating habits when you’re in a pinch.
Keep herbs and spices to jazz up meals and give flavor to foods you normally find to be bland.

, Eating out can cue bad habits for many people. Learning to make conscious choices can help you enjoy restaurants and visiting with friends or family without going back to bad habits.


Keep your cues and triggers in mind. For example, if fried appetizers are your downfall, simply skip that part of the menu.
Stay away from buffets, which may encourage you to revert to many different bad eating habits like overeating and making unhealthy choices.

Keep a food diary.,
Learn the difference between salt and sodium.,
Include table salt that you add to foods.,
Look for an online calculator.,
Plan your meals in advance.,
Inspect nutrition labels closely.,
Measure proper portions.,
Total sodium for ingredients.,
Use your sodium numbers to calculate your salt intake.,
Eat more whole foods.,
Focus on bread, soups, and sandwiches.,
Cook your own meals.,
Increase your intake of potassium.",How to Calculate Your Salt Intake," Make a record of everything you eat each day for at least a week. This will give you enough data that you can accurately estimate the amount of salt you're consuming on a regular basis.Include the brand names of packaged food products you consume, as well as the type of food.
Be honest with amounts you consume. It can help to weigh your food before you eat it, to make sure you're estimating the amount correctly. You also can measure the volume of bowls you commonly use, or use a measuring cup to get a better idea of the amount of food you're eating.
Make sure you include snacks. Keeping a food diary, even on its own, can be a good way to cut back on mindless eating. For example, you'll probably find you're less likely to keep munching on chips or cookies while watching television if you know you have to write it down in your food diary.;
, While the words ""salt"" and ""sodium"" are often used interchangeably, they actually refer to two different substances. Salt itself is a chemical compound, of which sodium is only one part.You'll typically see ""sodium"" on nutritional labels, but you may see ""salt"" in the list of ingredients.
You can use your sodium intake estimates to determine your salt intake. Generally, you'll take the amount of sodium and multiply it by 2.5 to find your salt intake.Keep in mind that if you've estimated your sodium intake, the number you get for salt also will be an estimate.

, Salt already included in processed foods and restaurant meals typically accounts for the vast majority of the salt you consume each day. However, that doesn't mean the salt you sprinkle on your food can add a lot of sodium to your daily intake.The dash of salt you add to foods can be difficult to measure. You may want to consider tapping the same amount of salt you typically would add to a meal into a small measuring spoon so you can get a better idea.
Think about the types of foods on which you typically sprinkle salt, and how many of these foods you eat in a typical day. You can use your food diary to help you with this. If you sprinkle salt on a dish, note that in your food diary so you remember to add that in later.

, There are a number of calculators online that you can use to help estimate your salt intake. Look for a calculator that is operated by a healthcare provider or government agency, as these typically will be more reliable.While there are general guidelines, the recommended amount of sodium you should consume will vary based on your age and gender. Online sodium calculators should take this into consideration. Some also may ask your height and weight to provide you with a more reliable estimate of the amount of sodium you're consuming.
If you've kept a food diary, it will be an asset when providing information for an online calculator. You may want to read over the questions asked on the calculator first so you can go through your food diary and categorize the food you eat and more easily answer the questions.
When you complete the calculator, it typically will give you an estimate of the amount of sodium you consume each day, as well as how this relates to the recommended level of sodium you should consume. Keep in mind that this is only an estimate, but it can help you adjust your diet.

, If you carefully plan what you're going to eat each day for a week, you can shop only for the ingredients in those meals. The planning makes it easier to track your sodium intake, because you won't have unknown items that you have to calculate after the fact.You may have already started a food diary so you could estimate your salt intake. Continuing to use your food diary can make it easier to plan your meals and stick to that plan.
It's a good idea to go through your fridge and pantry and get rid of snacks and high-sodium foods, so they won't tempt you. This is particularly important if you're trying to cut back on sodium in your diet.

, On packaged and processed foods, you'll find a nutrition label that indicates the sodium content of an individual serving of that food product. Choose foods that are low in sodium or have no salt added.Keep in mind that different brands of the same food product may have different amounts of sodium. Generally, you want to choose the brand that has the lowest sodium.
Frozen vegetables have lower sodium than canned vegetables, and many frozen vegetables may have no sodium at all.
Watch out for sodium particularly in foods that you normally wouldn't consider salty, such as bread, rolls, and cookies. Salt often is used as a preservative, and is used in baked goods as well.
Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, mandate color-coded labels to help you choose low-sodium foods. If you live in such a country, look for labels with a color that corresponds with the lowest levels of sodium., Nutrition labels provide sodium content for packaged food products based on individual serving sizes. To adequately and correctly track your salt intake, you must ensure you're eating no more than a single portion.The amount of food that is considered an individual serving will be listed on the nutrition label. Use a measuring cup, measuring spoon, or a food scale to determine how much food equals a serving. You can also estimate the portion sizes of certain foods.
The sodium content listed on the box is the content for a single serving. If you eat more than one serving, you need to multiply that amount by the number of servings you've consumed.
For example, if the bowl of cereal you normally eat for breakfast actually equates to two individual servings, you would need to multiply the sodium amount on the cereal box's nutritional label by two.

, Sodium can sneak into meals you make at home, even if you don't add salt specifically. Make sure you've determined the sodium content for all the various ingredients in a recipe so you can account for it properly.If you've purchased whole foods that didn't come in a package with a nutritional label, you may have to do additional research online to determine the sodium content of that food.
When you total the sodium for ingredients in an entire recipe, don't forget to divide by the number of servings. For example, if you made a casserole and ate a fourth of it, you would take the total amount of sodium included in the casserole's ingredients and divide by four to find your personal sodium intake.
Don't forget to include any table salt, garlic salt, onion salt, or any other seasonings you use in the recipe that contain sodium, or that you sprinkle on the food before you eat it.

, While you may be able to track the exact amount of sodium you consume, you'll have to go one step further if you also want to find out exactly how much salt you're consuming.Generally, you probably want to track your sodium intake for at least a week. Get your sodium total, then divide by seven to get your average daily sodium intake. This will be a more accurate number than if you simply track your sodium intake for one day.
Once you have your daily sodium intake number, multiply that number by 2.5. The result is your salt intake.

, You can better control your salt intake by purchasing whole foods at the grocery store, rather than eating packaged or processed food products, or frequently eating out at restaurants.With packaged and processed foods, you can't do anything about the sodium the company adds to the food product. However, if you make the same thing yourself using whole foods, you have the opportunity to reduce or even eliminate salt.
Another benefit of whole foods is that they tend to be cheaper than packaged and processed foods, so ultimately you may see a decrease in your grocery bill.
When you make your grocery trip, shop the perimeter of the store first. This is typically where the produce, meats, and dairy are located. When you shop the aisles, start with the outer aisles and work your way in.

, Commercial breads, canned soups, and cold cuts are some places where sodium will sneak into your diet, even if the foods you're eating don't taste particularly salty.You may have difficulty if you try to eliminate or significantly reduce the amount of salt in your diet all at once. Your taste buds have become accustomed to it, and you may initially find foods bland or even distasteful. It takes time for your taste buds to adjust to less salt.
Canned soups and sandwiches are some of the most common foods that sneak in significant amounts of sodium into your diet. A single bowl of soup or a sandwich made with cold cuts may contain as much sodium as you're supposed to consume in an entire day.
If you regularly eat canned soups, look for those that have no salt added, or that indicate they are low-sodium on the front of the label. Typically the low-sodium banner will be green. In most grocery stores, the low-sodium versions of popular soups can be found alongside that brand's other soups, for roughly the same price.
You also can easily find soup recipes online or in a cookbook that are made using whole food ingredients. Make your soup in large batches and freeze the excess so you can enjoy it for a longer period of time.
Rather than buying packaged cold cuts, get meats that haven't been processed and slice your own, or get fresh-sliced meat from the deli for your sandwiches. It typically will be a little more expensive, and won't keep as long, but it will have significantly less sodium.

, Most people rely on packaged food products because they're more convenient when you have heavy demands on your daily schedule from work or school. You can ease this issue by planning and preparing your meals in advance.Cooking in advance not only will help you track and control your salt intake, it also helps with portion control.
Pick three or four recipes you like and purchase the ingredients. Then spend an afternoon making those dishes. You can freeze individual portions to eat throughout the week. Remember to invest in some freezer-friendly containers that hold individual portions.

, Potassium helps to counter the effects of sodium, so increasing your potassium intake can decrease the negative effects of salt in your diet. The two minerals work together to support cellular function and help keep your body hydrated.Try to include a potassium-rich food with every meal, and you'll be well on your way to reaching the recommended daily intake. You also may want to take a potassium supplement.
Avocados have the most potassium of any food, with a whopping 1068 milligrams per whole avocado. That represents approximately 30 percent of the total recommended potassium intake for an adult.
Vegetables that are high in potassium include spinach, sweet potatoes, acorn squash, and mushrooms.
Bananas and apricots also contain significant amounts of potassium. Just one large banana provides as much as 12 percent of your recommended daily intake of potassium.
You also can find potassium in coconut water, and in kefir or yogurt.

Look for dextrose and maltodextrin at brewing or winemaking supply stores.,
Ask your local pharmacy if they stock dextrose and maltodextrin.,
Purchase dextrose and maltodextrin online.",How to Buy Dextrose and Maltodextrin," Stores that specialize in health food and exercise-centric products often carry these ingredients. Dextrose is favored as a post-exercise protein shake additive, because it can be used to easily manipulate insulin levels in the blood. Maltodextrin is favored for the opposite effect - it is very high on the glycemic index, and is metabolized very slowly.;
, Many grocery stores will carry these products as well. Look for them either in the baking aisle near the other sugars, or in the vitamins and supplements section. They can often be found near the protein powders and shakes.

, Specialty stores stocking beer brewing or wine making supplies nearly always stock these 2 compounds. If you do not see them on the shelves, ask an employee, as they may be kept in bulk containers in a back room.

, Another option for finding these 2 products is through a pharmacy. You will have better luck searching at large chains rather than smaller, locally owned pharmacies. Ask an employee to help you, as they may keep these products behind the counter.

, The guaranteed way to find these 2 products in the quantities you want is by shopping online. Health food stores, winemaking supply stores, and many general retailers will stock these products. Online shopping is ideal if you need very large quantities of dextrose or maltodextrin, or if you live in a remote area and do not have access to the more specialized options presented above.

Cheat by making smart choices.,
Cheat with your favorite foods––just practice portion control.,
Hide alcoholic drinks with seltzer or another low calorie beverage.,
Go out to dinner.,
Avoid talking about your diet.,
Just don't eat the fattening stuff.,
Consider one square of dark chocolate a night as a reward for sticking to your diet all day.",How to Cheat on Your Diet," If smart snacking isn’t part of your diet protocol, consider adding it as your daily “cheat.” The right snacks may actually help to boost your metabolism, while at the same time reduce your desire to overindulge. In fact, if you're on a diet that restricts food or calories, you may not getting enough nutrition to sustain an active metabolism––which may bring weight loss to a grinding halt. Instead of not eating, consider eating six small meals or snacks throughout the day to avoid spikes in blood sugar levels. Examples of smart “cheat” snacks include:


Instead of going for the full-bodied, extra buttered popcorn, consider adding a little butter spray (such as non-stick butter spray) and light salt to hot air popped corn.
Suck on hard candy during the day. No one will know what you are eating, plus the candy will satisfy your sweet tooth cravings.
In the mood for chocolate? Try a version of weight control or sugar free hot chocolate. Many brands contain 25 calories but deliver the same rich, chocolate flavor that may help curb your cravings.;
, You don’t have to limit your cheat meals to raw carrots and sugar-free hot chocolate. You can have your pizza and eat it too. Avoid packing on the pounds by eating a smaller portion of your favorite foods including ice cream, pizza and pasta. The Mayo Clinic asserts that you can eat anything you want and still lose weight, as long as you stay within the parameters of eating less. In fact, some overweight people eat what is considered to be a healthy diet, but simply eat far too much food. The American Cancer Society gives examples of what is considered to be a normal portion amount:


1 oz. (28g) meat should be the same size of a matchbox
3 oz. (85g) meat is equal to a size of a deck of cards or bar of soap (the recommended portion for a meal)
8 oz. (226g) meat should resemble the size of a thin paperback book
1 medium potato is about the size of a computer mouse.

, Going out and want to have a drink? Instead of going with a full-bodied drink, add a low- or no-calorie mixer. One of the lowest calorie alcoholic beverages is vodka. For a vodka and Diet Coke, you're imbibing only 56 calories per drink versus 116 calories in a 175 ml glass of dry white wine. If you don’t like Diet Coke and prefer something clear and sparkly, skip having a vodka tonic and request vodka and club soda instead. Tonic water has almost the same number of calories as a regular soda, whereas club soda has none. You can also mix drinks with Crystal Light or use another calorie-free drink mix for lower calorie cocktails.


Drink eight ounces (236ml) of water between drinks to stay hydrated and reduce the number of calories you're drinking.
Add sparkling water or club soda to white wine to reduce calories.
Don't overdo cheats on alcohol in your diet. Alcohol is not the dieter's friend as it is so easy to take in lots of calories without realizing it.

, While eating out on a daily basis can stall weight loss and even encourage weight gain, eating out every once in a while can help you stay on track for success. Why? If you’ve been eating the same number of calories for several weeks, bump up that number by 200 to 500 calories one night to rev your metabolism. How does this work? Eating different amounts and types of calories from time to time is called caloric cycling. The metabolism reacts when it's fed a higher number of calories and has to work harder to gobble them up. Many body builders and fitness experts practice ""caloric cycling"" to build muscle but also to boost metabolism. However, when dining out, don’t go crazy to boost the number of calories; in fact, many dishes that appear harmless may be packed with more calories than you require:


Select an appetizer as your entrée. Go for something that has green, leafy vegetables and is light on sauces––salad for an entrée is perfect. Request the dressing on the side and avoid anything that is fried.
Eat only half of the food on your plate. Practice portion control and take the rest “to go.” Toss the food in the trash when you get home. Or, if you feel safe, give it to a homeless person on the way home.
If you opt to have a drink, skip dessert. If you choose dessert, pursue fruity, light items rather than going for the chocolate mousse bomb.

, One of the things that can make you feel bad when indulging a little now and then on a diet are the recriminating looks and scolding comments of others who know you're on a diet and who feel free to make their own judgments about your intake. The less you talk about being on a diet and the more you simply assert that your eating choices are the way you prefer to eat, the less people will be quick to jump up and point out your detours. Unless your friends and/or family members know every intimate detail of your diet they won’t be any wiser if you add cheat foods. This means that you can cheat out in the open without being badgered.

, You could eat sugar free cookies etc. They taste delicious.

, It has about 70 calories and it's melt in your mouth, oh so rich and decadent taste will send the pleasure centers in your brain into Nirvana. Individually packed ones from Ghirardelli come in several flavors.

Know that too much variety, especially when reintroducing solids, can cause digestive problems.,
Beware of foods with a lot of oil during the first week of breaking the fast.",How to Break a Fast," You want to make sure you know what the time frame is for breaking of the fast. Most often, the length of the fast will determine the length of the time spent breaking the fast. Don't skip the initial breaking of the fast unless you want to feel sick and completely undo all your hard work.


For longer fasts (more than 7 days) you will want to set aside four days for the breaking of your fast. The first couple days will be limited to the very basics before you start to add more things.
Set aside one to three days for breaking the fast if you're doing a shorter fast (about a week). The first day will be the day for just fruit juice and maybe some broth. Depending on how you feel, you can move through the steps quickly over the next 2 days.
For a one-day fast, step aside one to two days to recover from it. Your system won't be as stressed, but that doesn't mean you can just jump in and start eating junk.;
, One way to make it easier to keep on schedule and not start eating things you shouldn't is to make a specific meal plan for the length of time you need to introduce food back into your system. An example of a meal plan (for breaking a four-day fast) might be:


Day One: Two 8-ounce cups of fruit/veggie (carrot, some greens, banana, apple) juice that is diluted 50/50 with water 4 hours apart.
Day Two: More diluted veggie/fruit juice, with bone broth and 1/2 cup of fruit (pears, and watermelon) every 2 hours).
Day Three: A cup of yogurt and fruit juice for breakfast, a snack of 1/2 cup of watermelon and veggie juice, a lunch of vegetable soup and fruit juice, a snack of 1/2 cup of apple, dinner greens with yogurt as dressing and fruit juice.
Day Four: A soft-boiled egg for breakfast with fruit juice, yogurt and berries as a snack, some cooked beans and veggies for lunch, an apple and some nuts as a snack, a hardy veggie soup for dinner with fruit juice.

, For the initial break, especially if you've been fasting for awhile, you'll need to start with re-hydrating your body. To this end, the first day, or two, you'll need to only drink diluted fruit/veggie juice.


To break the fast, drink one 8-ounce cup of diluted fruit or veggie juice. Avoid the kind that has extra sugars and additives. After all, you just got that stuff out of your system.
In 4 hours, drink another 8-ounce cup of diluted fruit or veggie juice.

, Depending on how your body feels, in another 4 hours, you can start adding some vegetable or bone broth to your regimen.


Try this recipe for chicken stock or beef broth if you're adventurous and can help yourself from nibbling on meat while you're making it.
You give your body adequate time in between foods because you don't want to overload your system. It will have difficulty processing and digesting new food, even broths, if you put a bunch of food in it right away.

, If you fasted for a couple weeks or longer, it's probably a good bet to continue a steady diet of fruit/veggie juice and stocks or both. Otherwise, it's time to move onto whole fruit. That's because a lot of fruits have a high water content and are easily digested, while also being high in nutrients and energy. Your system needs food that is easily assimilated and gets your digestive system going without making it have to work too hard.


You will want to start introducing small quantities of fruit around the end of the first day and second day.
Some of the best fruits to eat are: melons (especially watermelon), grapes, apples and pears. These are easy on the system.

, The fibrous fruits are harder for your body to digest and the highly acidic fruits may cause discomfort.

, You really want to be eating yogurt during the breaking of the fast. Yogurt will help repopulate your digestive tract with good bacteria and enzymes that the fast has stripped from it. These probiotics will, in turn, make it easier for you to digest food.


Introduce this one on the second day, or whenever you introduce the fruit. You want those enzymes in your digestive system as soon as possible, without overloading the system.
Make sure that you are using unsweetened yogurt, because sugar (processed sugar, not the kind that's in fruit) will make you feel worse.

, Your body is going to tell you if you're moving too quickly. Some things are normal, like feeling incredibly hungry or lightheaded because you haven't eaten in a while. There are other things that mean you're breaking your fast incorrectly.If you get constipated, your stomach is cramping, or feel like you're going to throw up (or actually throw up) you should go back to drinking the diluted fruit juice and broth.
You should pass at least one bowel movement after the first couple glasses of juice. If not, you might need to move on to fruit.
You also want to pay attention to the food you're re-introducing into your diet, because you might discover some food allergies. Pay attention to how the food makes you feel: nauseated, drowsy, makes your mouth or tongue itch, makes you congested.

, Start off with leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach. Eat these vegetables raw, and include the yogurt as dressing. Continue to eat fruit and drink juices as your body regulates its digestive system.


After eating lettuce and spinach, move on to other vegetables. Eat them raw and cooked. You could even make vegetable soup (but don't eat the store bought soups, because they have a lot of added sugars and salts and things your body won't thank you for).
Sprouts are also a highly effective vegetable, because they contain lots of minerals and antioxidants that your body needs and easily digests.

, You'll need to cook these well and eat them in addition to your veggies and your fruits. Your appetite will get stronger as you continue to re-introduce different foods into your diet.Try nuts and eggs once you've gotten more accustomed to eating (Day Four for the longer fast, Day Two for the one-day fast, and Day Three for the medium fasts). The easiest way to eat eggs is to soft-boil them or scramble them. Hard-boiled eggs are more difficult for your body to digest.

, If it's processing the veggies and fruits without problems (like cramping, nausea, etc.), then you can start eating the more difficult-to-digest foods. But if it's been a struggle up until now, stick with the foods that have caused you the least trouble so far. Trust the foods that have a good track record with your body.

, You want to start off eating every two hours or so, in the beginning (after you've completed the 4 hour apart diluted juices). You'll be progressing towards larger meals, as your body adjusts to more food.


In the end, the optimum daily eating schedule is 3 meals and 2 snacks. Once you've gotten to this point, your body should be back to normal and hopefully feeling better after the cleanse.

, Chewing your food breaks it up so that it is more easily digested by your system. So eat slowly and allow your body to prepare itself for digestion. Aim to chew each bite of food at least 20 times before moving on to the next bite., On the first day, you stuck to watermelon juice and on the second day, you introduced grapes and pears. Then, immediately after eating only small portions of the grapes and pear, you get diarrhea and the solids pass right through you. Is something wrong?


Fasters experience this quite frequently after they introduce solids back into their body. During the fast, your digestive system has been resting and inactive. The enzymes in your gut aren't used to working. Suddenly, they get whole food and have to ramp up from 0 to 60 in a short amount of time. No wonder they crash and burn.
The solution to this problem is to stay the course. Most likely, the problem is not with the food itself but with the simple fact that you're asking your body to do something it isn't completely ready for. Stick predominantly with fruit and vegetable juices, along with broths and stocks, and occasionally give your body some easy solids. Your body should adjust within a day or two.

, If, on the other side of the spectrum, you're unable to have a bowel movement after beginning to reintroduce solids into your diet, don't panic. You're not a fringe case, and you're not doing anything wrong. Here's what you do:


Mix together 1 teaspoon of Metamucil (or other fiber supplement) and 1 teaspoon of aloe juice in 8 ounces of water and drink before meals. The fiber supplement and aloe vera are both gentle laxatives which should help you evacuate.
Stay away from foods or drinks that cause constipation or make it even worse. Nuts, kale, and coffee, while raw and otherwise good for you, will make your constipation even worse. Stick with easy-to-digest fruits like prunes and vegetables like yams and squash.

, The name of the game for breaking a fast is simplicity. Find a juice drink that works and stick with it for a day. The next day, find a simple fruit that works and only eat it for a day. Too many fasters assume that their digestion is hardier than it actually is and punish it by giving it what they think it wants — variety — when it really wants simplicity. Keep things simple and your body will reward you.

, Even foods with beneficial oils, such as avocado and nuts, may cause digestive problems for stomachs that have recently been weaned off solids. Stick to fruits and vegetables without a lot of oils in the early going; gently see how your responds to high-oil foods such as avocado when you are ready to reintroduce them.

Understand the serotonin/food myths.,
Shun the simple carbs and embrace the complex carbs.,
Avoid caffeinated foods, especially energy drinks.,
Eat healthy fats, such as omega-3 fatty acids.,
Eat dark chocolate.",How to Boost Serotonin1," Unfortunately, there are a lot of myths surrounding food and increased levels of serotonin. These myths include:



Foods rich in tryptophan automatically boost serotonin. This is false. Most foods that contain tryptophan, an amino acid, compete with other amino acids to be absorbed by the body's transport system.Eating a lot of turkey, which is rich in tryptophan, will not automatically give you more serotonin.

Eating a lot of banana will automatically boost serotonin. Bananas do contain serotonin. That serotonin, however, is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier and be absorbed by humans.;
, Complex carbohydrates are absorbed by the body differently than simple carbohydrates. Simple carbs raise your blood levels quickly, causing a spike in insulin, which drops after a while.Complex carbs are absorbed more slowly by the body and therefore avoid the massive peaks and troughs brought upon by simple carbs.



Complex carbsinclude:

Legumes like peas and lentils
Whole grain breads
Whole grain pastas
Brown rice
Starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes and parsnips



Simple carbs include:

Yogurt
Fruit juice
""Normal"" pasta
Cakes, candies, and other refined sugar products
White bread and white rice, while not technically simple carbs, are absorbed by your body in a similar way.



, Caffeine suppresses serotonin, which could also help explain why it's a hunger suppressant as well.Energy drinks contain large amounts of sugar, which the body processes quickly, but which produce an energy-zapping low after the insulin has finished surging. If you have to drink caffeinated products, wait until after you've eaten, doctors recommend.

, Omega-3 fatty acids are hypothesized to affect the functionality of serotonin in the brain. People with low serotonin levels commonly have low DHA levels, which is an essential building block in the brain, and which needs to be replenished with foods such as fish oils, which are high in omega-3 fatty acids.Look for omega-3 fats in:


Fish, such as salmon, and fish oils
Nuts, seeds and seed oils, such as flax seed oil

, Eating dark chocolate improves serotonin levels partly because of resveratrol.Resveratrol boosts both endorphins and serotonin levels. Remember to reach for dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate, as milk chocolate contains far less cocoa (the stuff that produces serotonin) than dark chocolate."

Get lots of calcium.,
Eat plenty of protein.,
Get enough Vitamin D. Recent studies have shown that Vitamin D, like protein, helps the body absorb calcium.,
Get more Vitamin K. Though experts are not yet clear on exactly how Vitamin K contributes to bone health, several studies have shown that it aids in calcium absorption.,
Eat more potassium.,
Get up!,
Do weight-bearing exercises.,
Make time for resistance training.,
Quit smoking.,
Cut down on caffeine.,
Go easy on the alcohol.",How to Build and Preserve Bone Mass," Calcium is stored in the bones and teeth, and it makes them hard and sturdy. The average adult needs 1,000 mg of calcium every day. Adolescent girls and premenopausal women need about 200 mg more.There are lots of ways to incorporate calcium into your diet. Your options includedairy (such as milk, yogurt, and cheese)
juices fortified with calcium
boxed cereals fortified with calcium
oatmeal
beans
legumes
salmon
dark leafy greens (such as broccoli, spinach, collards, or bok choy)
almonds;
, Though older studies suggested that protein was actually detrimental to bone mass, newer research shows that, eaten in moderation, it aids with the absorption of calcium. Men should get about 56 grams of protein per day, women should get 46, and pregnant women should get 70. Eat plenty of lean protein, including:


fish
beans
cheese
eggs
nuts
chicken
oats
Greek yogurt
milk
broccoli
quinoa
brussels sprouts

, You should get about 600 IU (but no more than 4,000 IU) of Vitamin D every day. Talk to your doctor about taking a Vitamin D supplement if you are concerned that you aren’t getting enough from sources such as these: eggs (with yolks)
fatty fish (such as salmon, mackerel, or tuna)
shrimp
cod liver oil
beef liver
dairy products fortified with Vitamin D
cereals fortified with Vitamin D
juice fortified with Vitamin D
the sun (about 10-15 minutes three times per week will do) , Women should get 90 micrograms of Vitamin K, and men should get 120. Get Vitamin K in foods such as leafy greens
onions
asparagus

, Potassium may help neutralize acids that take calcium out of your body, so it’s important to get this nutrient alongside calcium, proteins, and vitamins. Adults should get, in general, 4.7 grams of potassium daily. Foods high in potassium include sweet potatoes
white potatoes with the skins on
bananas
yogurt
dairy products
meat
nuts

, Leading a sedentary lifestyle contributes immensely to bone loss. Particularly if your job requires you to sit for long periods of time, be sure to take frequent breaks to stand, stretch, or take a quick walk.

, Along with eating a diet rich in calcium and other nutrients, this is the key to building and improving bone mass. Exercise to keep those bones strong! The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends about 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise every day. Some effective weight bearing exercises include


walking
dancing
jogging
jumping rope
skiing
climbing stairs

, In addition to getting plenty of weight bearing exercise, it’s also a good idea to improve your strength by lifting weights or using elastic bands. This will not only improve bone mass, but also aid in strength and balance, which can help prevent falls (and broken bones) as you get older. Alongside lifting weights, yoga, tai chi, and pilates are good ways to incorporate resistance training into your routine. Be careful though! Some positions are not recommended for people who already have osteoporosis. Try to do resistance training 2-3 days per week. Work each major muscle group if you can (legs, hips, back, abs, chest, shoulders, and arms), but if you aren’t up for that, rotate and work on a different set of muscles each day. , Smoking leads to bone loss. Adults who smoke are more likely to fracture bones, and the risk increases the more you smoke. Studies indicate that even secondhand smoke can effect bone mass., Too much caffeine can make it hard for your body to absorb calcium.Especially if you don’t get enough calcium in your diet, stick to 2 or fewer cups of coffee or soft drinks per day., Drinking excessively can cause bone loss, so stick to moderate consumption. One drink per day for women and two for men is okay, and some studies have even shown that alcohol in moderation can help bone health in the long term. "

Focus on quality.,
Avoid eating fast food.,
Avoid eating fat-free, no-fat or nonfat foods.,
Avoid eating trans fats and high fructose corn syrup.,
Enjoy fats.",How to Do the Martini Diet1," The first rule of the Martini Diet is to “eat only the very best.” Eating only the best means sticking to whole foods and avoiding harmful processed foods. While this will remove a lot of packaged and pre-made food from your diet, it will introduce you to a wide range of unprocessed foods for further exploration, including fruits, nuts, seeds, vegetables and quality meats.;
, On the Martini Diet, you'll need to adhere to the Slow Food philosophy. In a nutshell, this means that food should only be prepared from the highest-quality ingredients and those ingredients should be fresh, and they should be from local sources. Cooking should be a source of pleasure and dining taken slowly, amid conversation, sharing with loved ones and friends, and eating mindfully.

, According to the Martini Diet, fat-free foods are not foods; they are a process. And the evidence of their utility is weak at best anyway––they simply encourage you to eat bland food that has little place in the nutrient stakes.

, Trans fats are found in shelf-stable items such as margarine, baked goods and fried foods like freezer chips, while high fructose corn syrup is found in many sodas, candies, cookies and cereals.

, Monounsaturated fats like those found in avocados and omega-3 fatty acids such as those found in fish are best, but even the fats found in cream and butter are good for satiety.

If you’re curious, the 4 states that currently do not have any licensure requirements are Arizona, Colorado, Michigan and New Jersey.;
, The accreditation required for a degree in the nutritional science field varies from state to state. Currently, 46 states require an accredited 2 or 4 year degree in nutritional science (either online or campus-based.) Getting your bachelor’s in nutrition, institution management, biology, chemistry, and physiology is your best bet.


You’ll also benefit from business, mathematics, psychology, sociology, and economics courses. Odds are, if your program is a good one, it will touch on all these bases. And if your state is one that requires a license with experience, it’s best to pick a program that has a built in internship.

, An advanced degree isn’t strictly necessary, but a solid understanding of biology, chemistry and health will be a great asset. In addition, the more education you have, the more job opportunities you’ll have. If you’d like to continue learning, it's a good idea!


If you do complete an advanced degree, you are that much closer to getting certified through the CBNS (Certification Board for Nutrition Specialists). If you take and pass the exam, you will become a Certified Nutrition Specialist. However, this article will outline becoming a Certified Clinical Nutritionist -- a process that doesn’t need an advanced degree.

, Before you go any further, you need to have the right coursework under your belt. The CNBC (Clinical Nutrition Certification Board) requires three hours in each of the following: anatomy and physiology, chemistry, microbiology, human biology and biochemistry. Hopefully your undergrad covered that!


You can also choose 5 of 8 electives; they are: Introduction to Nutrition, Nutrition and Disease, Nutrition Assessment, Nutrition Counseling Strategies, Nutrition II, Nutrition and Supplementation, Herbology and Nutrition and Aging.

, In order to get on your merry certified way, you'll need to submit your credential review application and college transcripts to the CNCB. Then you should obtain credential approval from the board and begin your PGSCN course, eventually taking the CCN exam., It's four courses long (14 hours each) and done online -- the only downside is that each course is $1,125. You have 90 days to complete the 4 sessions and they can be done in any order.


If you do not have a sufficient amount of applicable coursework to your name, you can still get a Certificate of Completion by taking the 56-hour PGSCN. This, though similarly named, holds less weight than getting certified and does not qualify you to take the CCN -- you need the coursework to do that.

, Now that you've taken all the courses, the PGSCN, and submitted all your paperwork, you're good to apply to sit for the CNN. It's taken at a testing facility and is 3 hours long.


The CCN is $450 currently, but the study guide is available online for free! Quite clearly, these are tests you don't want to have to take twice.
You're done -- once you've passed the CCN exam, you're good to go!

, The procedure for obtaining a license is similar in most states; you gather the documentation you need, get them notarized and submit the application and fee. Find the licensure requirements for your state by visiting the website of the Commission on Dieticians and Nutritionists.


If you are ever thinking about moving (or practicing with a long commute), consider getting licensed in another state as well. Unfortunately, just because you're licensed in one does not mean you're licensed in another.

, As stated before, nutritionists have a plethora of options when it comes to places of employment. You can work in many settings, including hospitals, cafeterias, nursing homes, government agencies and schools. Some are even self-employed!Nutritionists aren't just advice givers. Though plenty work with patients much like doctors do, they're also government employees and researchers, too. However, the more ""scientific"" your position, the more education you'll need.

, As a nutritionist, you could concentrate on any number of topics. Geriatric care, raising children, care of those with diabetes or other illnesses, etc. However, it's also determined by your environment -- maybe you don't want to work one-on-one at all? Generally speaking, your duties could include some of the following:


Working with patients, looking at a their blood chemistry, neurochemistry and other indicators to assess how they are metabolizing food. You will also identify imbalances caused by poor or inadequate nutrition that contribute to disease.
Some nutritionists work for government regulatory agencies, ensuring that the manufacturer’s nutritional claims about the amount of calories, sodium and vitamins in processed foods correct.
Research! The realm of research when it comes to food and nutrition is still growing and will continue to do so. Working at an educational institution will put you on this path, improving how the world views food.

, Most nutritionists have to participate in several hundred hours of supervised training. Some degree programs include this hands-on training, but you may have to complete this portion after you graduate in the form of an internship in a medical setting.


After this experience and if you've completed the CCN, you may qualify as an RD -- a registered dietician. The qualifications are parallel to those states that require licensure., Nutritionists have to listen to patients to understand their concerns and their goals. Your medical expertise aside, you will also function as a cheerleader and empathetic listener. Some of your patients may struggle with the program you have outlined; you should be prepared to help them overcome any hurdles they encounter. They're depending on you for their health, after all.


Part of a nutritionist’s job is to assess a patient’s energy level through personal interviews and tests, and give the patient nutritional advice. As such, you will be spending a lot of face-to-face time with your patients. An in-depth assessment using a holistic approach will mean you’ll have to know more about your patient than his or her eating habits; you’ll need to learn about your patient’s lifestyle and goals, their personal problems and fears, their childhood eating habits, and their cultural and taste preferences.

, You will have to keep up with the latest developments in nutrition research and be able to interpret scientific studies. Not everyone has the background you do, so you'll need to translate the statistical data into practical applications for your patients.


There are new research studies every week about the effects, good and bad, of various foods. These studies are often contradictory. As a trained nutritionist, you will be expected to interpret conflicting health research studies to develop a healthy, sound plan of action for your patients.

, As a nutritionist, you will have many patients, each with different backgrounds and needs. You will need to keep your files organized and easily accessible. And you'll need to remember their names, their families, and their personalities!


Even though this job is very science-oriented, it's very people oriented, too. In order to keep your clients on, they'll need to feel as if they are your only client. If you can't remember them from Joe, you're outta luck (and money!).
If you are self-employed, this goes double. You'll be handling your own taxes, licenses, and be working as a ""company."" When April 15th rolls around, you'll be glad you're as organized as you are.

, You will often have to explain complicated topics in a way that your patients will understand. Simply telling patients that certain foods are good for them is not enough; you should be able to explain the technical aspects of your prescribed nutritional programs.


Think of yourself as the bridge between science and your patients -- you need to be able to people-speak and science-speak! After all, the Internet can tell them what to eat and not eat, what to do and what to avoid -- it's you who has to put the personal, doable twist on what can be a very daunting subject.

Exercise regularly.,
Get enough light.,
Invest in massage.,
Understand that stress may interfere with serotonin.,
Relive happy memories.",How to Boost Serotonin2," Exercise is a great way to boost your serotonin levels.The results are clear: exercise causes an increase in tryptophan, which is a precursor to serotonin. The tryptophan persists well after exercising is finished, suggesting that mood elevation may be present for hours after the exercising has finished.


Work out in at intensity levels with which you are familiar. Consistent serotonin release is linked with exercise that people feel comfortable with, not exercise that pushes people off the edge, an English study has found.If you can't find the time to exercise regularly, try walking or 30 minutes to an hour per day. At the very least, this moderate exercise will help burn calories and boost tryptophan levels, causing an increase in serotonin.

, Light probably helps serotonin synthesis. Research has found a positive correlation between serotonin synthesis and total hours of sunlight during the day.In postmortems of humans, serotonin levels are higher during the summer months than the winter months.Getting a better mood could be as easy as opening the curtains in your otherwise dark room.


Get natural light during the day, not artificial light during the night. Natural, daytime sunlight is better at giving you serotonin than artificial LED, fluorescent, or UV light.Getting artificial light, especially at night, has the added disadvantage of blocking melatonin production, which helps your body get a good night's sleep.

, Several studies show that massage therapy helps cut down the stress hormone cortisol while boosting serotonin levels and increasing dopamine.This double-pronged benefit makes massage particularly valuable.

, Prolonged periods of stress can deplete serotonin levels.Serious and systematic stress can have an impact on the body's ability to produce and synthesize serotonin. This means that you should stay away from stressful situations as much as possible, and find healthy ways to deal with stress once it comes your way.


If confronted with lifestyle stress, try practicing:

Yoga
Meditation
Deep breathing exercises
Self-expression (art)



, Though it may sound corny, reliving happy times may be enough to give your brain a serotonin boost.This may directly increase serotonin levels and keep you from fixating on less happy times, if you are prone to depression. The inability to think of happier times is called ""state dependent recall."" If you can't think of happier times, try talking to friends or family and looking at old journals or pictures.

Minimize your overall intake.,
Eat a 3-ounce (85g) portion of every type of food.,
Eat one-third of what you are served at a restaurant.,
Follow listed portion suggestions when eating desserts.",How to Do the Martini Diet2," The second rule of the Martini Diet is to “eat somewhat less of the very best.” The Martini Diet does not provide exact guidance on how much to eat, but it does offer some suggestions for visualizing portion size.

, To go back to the martini glass comparison, 3 ounces is about the size of a martini glass. As the diet’s creator, Jennifer Saunder, says, your food should come a respectable distance from the top of the glass, like gin, rather than being mounded over the top., Because restaurant portions are often huge in North America, cutting your consumption when eating out will trim a significant number of calories from your diet.


Better yet, share the uneaten food with your love, a friend or a child. There is something fun about doing this and you don't need to feel guilty for leaving uneaten food. Or, ask for smaller portions, such as choosing the appetizer size instead of main course size.

, For instance, eat only 1/2 cup of ice cream instead of eating a large bowl full of it. Or, simply go without dessert more often than not. You will get used to it because dessert is more of a habit than a necessity.

"
"
Make mealtimes your main––and only––eating times.,
Sit down to a proper breakfast, lunch and dinner.,
Avoid portable foods and drinks.,
Eat at the table or in a cafe.",How to Do the Martini Diet3," Rule Number 3 of the Martini Diet is to “eat the very best only at mealtimes.” This means that you'll need to avoid snacking between meals as a way of conserving calories. At first this may seem like a challenge but seriously think about the times you snack––many of those times are likely to be driven by boredom, stress or pressure, or just because the item happens to be in your view. Retraining yourself to eat only at mealtimes is a great way to rein in the calorie intake.

, Only eat at those times. It's also a good idea to turn this into a meal with others, so that you have time to exchange talk and enjoy their company.

, For instance, do not carry bottles of soda or cups of coffee with you as you do errands. However, you can carry a water bottle with you––water helps to reduce food cravings and helps you to feel full.

, Avoid eating in your car or while you're on the go. Any place that isn't made specifically for eating should be out of bounds––and sorry, that includes the couch! Making this a firm rule will help to prevent the ingestion of extra food that you're not often conscious of nibbling on.

"
"
Always carry breath strips.,
Whiten your teeth.,
Set a beautiful table.",How to Do the Martini Diet4," Strong, mint-flavored breath strips should be popped into your mouth as soon as you feel a strong craving. Nothing tastes good right after eating a mint strip, which should be enough to kill the craving.

, Wearing white strips during the times of day when you are most susceptible to cravings will make it physically impossible for you to eat.

, Don’t hesitate to use your best plates and a vase full of flowers, even for a leisurely lunch. Setting a beautiful table helps to stave off feelings of deprivation.

Keep your exercise regime pleasant and desirable.,
Take horseback riding lessons.,
Try ballroom dancing.,
Learn ballet.,
Take ice skating lessons.,
Try fencing.,
Engage in a vigorous walk.,
Go swimming.,
Enjoy exercise daily.",How to Do the Martini Diet5," Exercise on the Martini Diet is meant to be elegant. If you're uncomfortable at the gym, consider other forms of exercise––not every person is a good fit for gym workouts. The most indulgent forms of exercise either make you feel good while doing them, or come with an incredible wardrobe that inspires you to get out there and participate.

, Posting while riding a horse is like doing an endless series of ballet plies, and currying and combing your horse afterward will give you a nice upper body workout.

, Dancing may burn as many as 396 calories per hour. It's also likely that you'll meet great people.

, If you’re intimidated by wearing a tutu and tights in public, then try one of the New York City Ballet’s workout DVDs at home. However, there are good adult ballet classes with people of all sizes and shapes, so don't feel shy.

, Start with one session per week to build strength and leg muscle. During warmer months, skate indoors, and during the colder months skate outdoors.

, Fencing will help you to engage in a workout that is surprisingly aerobic while venting your bottled-up anger at the same time. It's also very graceful even as you attack your opponent.

, Walking is easy to do on the spur of the moment and requires no lessons or special equipment. It's elegant, you can wear whatever is comfortable and pleasant, and you might even get to know your surrounds better.

, Swimming allows you to experience solitude in the middle of a hectic schedule while still getting a fantastic workout.

, Exercise should be as much a part of daily life as eating.

Cut any animal foods out of your diet.",How to Be Healthy Without Dieting," Studies on people have shown that beans and other legumes can prevent heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, so eat legumes such as:


Black beans
Lentils-- red and yellow
Chickpeas
Mung beans;
, Complex carbohydrates found in whole grains, starchy vegetables and legumes are the best sources of complex carbohydrates. Top healthy choices include:


Steel-cut oats
Wheat-- whole or cracked
Bulgar
Barley
Quinoa
Rice-- brown and wild
Popcorn
Squash and pumpkin
Sweet potatoes
Potato wedges-- grilled or baked
Soybeans
Split peas
Beans-- white, kidney and chili

, Yes, fats. The healthy fats are typically found in plants and are classified chemically as monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats. Bad fats are made by chemical reactions that create products with long shelf lives. The food industry benefits when their products last a long time. The problem is that if bacteria, oxygen and micro-organisms can't break the so-called foods down, our enzymes cannot either. These fats become a poison to our bodies, work our bodies excessively and clog up our internal systems. These fats, which have no analogs in nature, are classified as saturated or trans-fats.


Good fats are found in:






Avocados
Nuts-- almonds, macadamia nuts, hazelnuts, pecans, cashews
Natural monounsaturated oils-- olive, canola, sunflower, peanut, sesame
Natural polyunsaturated oils-- soybean, corn, safflower
Olives
Almond butter
Seeds-- sunflower, sesame, pumpkin, flax
Fatty fish-- wild salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, trout, sardines
Soy milk
Tofu



The sources of bad fats are:






Tropical plants and oils
Synthetic saturated or trans-fats
Fats found in animals


Limit intake of fats from the bad sources.

,

Milk, often thought to be a good source of calcium, is actually a very bad source of calcium. The ""hype"" that milk is good for you is a product of lobbying by the dairy producers. The reality is that people who drink milk often don't get enough calcium. So, as it turns out, it is good to stay away from dairy.






Protein is necessary for proper metabolism and optimal health. The thing is, protein is good for you, if you don't consume to much of it. Also, people often eat lots of animal protein, which is the worst source of protein. Protein from beans and nuts are a much, much better. The verdict is still out on how much protein is enough, so, for now, just eat some beans four or more times a week, and include nuts as well.







, You know this already. It's not so bad, though, once you've learned how to eat them. And you don't have to be a gourmet chef to prepare them, either. Search online for quick and easy ways to prepare vegetables.

, If you love your desserts, you're not alone. But, your body cannot handle sugary cakes, pies and cookies every day, so opt for the healthy fruit alternative when it is available and in season.


Fruit is important because it is packed with vitamins and minerals. Again, search online to find quick and easy ideas for turning fresh fruit into a favorite dessert!

, If you're working a lot, you probably don't have time for exercise. If you're constantly on your feet at work, your muscles might not need much additional exercise. But, for a healthy heart, make time for a walk in the morning before you go to work or in the evening after dinner. If you get breaks in your work schedule use that time to benefit your body.

, Or do them all. The more, the better-- up to a point. Make sure not to overdo and to rest your muscles one or two days each week. For serious targeted exercise, rotate the muscle groups so that each has a chance to recover.

, Most people have a problem with acne. To prevent an acne flare up or improve an acne problem, wash your face regularly.

Consider the feedback you gathered, and incorporate it.,
Vectorize the design.,
Tell the company to trademark its logo.,
Keep listening.",How to Design a Company Logo," To get recognition? Memorability? Trust? Admiration?;
, You need to understand the company’s brand to create a logo that will represent it. What emotions do you wish the customers to feel? What impression do you want them to have? What is the company story? You need to understand why the company does what it does and why people should care., Do the company has previous logos? If yes, looking at its current and former logos will tell you about its design style., Do the company have a color universe? If so, the choices have probably been made for a reason and you should reflect them in your logo. Still, colors have a meaning in your customer’s mind and if you realize that another color can be added or that the company made a mistake, changing them is an option you can consider., Sometimes a company won’t be able to afford colors for printing costs. Yet, a company’s logo is probably the first thing its customer will see so you don’t want it to look cheap., Jot down the company values, its slogan, what it makes you think about… Words can lead to logical ideas.

, One way to figure out the company's brand identity is to create a mood-board. For instance, a startup can be represented by a rocket or a unicorn, HR by people or a magnifying glass…, Decide what you want the company to tell the customers. Decide what you want people to think when they see the logo., It will tell you what the design trends in the field are, and you can find inspiration from it. Don’t forget that your goal is to make the company stand out from the competition.

Get inspiration from logos and designs but don’t copy them. The human mind is powerful beyond measure. Use your own creativity.

,, Our subconscious minds respond in different ways to different shapes. Straight lines, curves and jagged edges all imply different meanings.

Circles, ovals and ellipses convey a positive emotional message. Using a circle in a logo can suggest community, friendship, love, relationships and unity. Rings have an implication of marriage and partnership, suggesting stability and endurance. Curves of any sort tend to be viewed as feminine in nature.
Squares and triangles: straight edged logo shapes such as squares and triangles suggest stability in more practical terms and can also be used to imply balance,. Straight lines and precise logo shapes also impart strength, professionalism and efficiency. It has also been suggested that triangles have a good association with power, science, religion and law. These tend to be viewed as masculine attributes, so it’s no coincidence that triangles feature more prominently in the logos of companies whose products have a masculine bias.
Vertical lines and horizontal lines: our subconscious minds associate vertical lines with masculinity, strength and aggression, while horizontal lines suggest community, tranquility and calm. The implications of shapes also extend to the typeface chosen, jagged, angular typefaces may appear as aggressive or dynamic, on the other hand, soft and rounded letters give youthful appeal.

, Just like shapes or fonts, different colors can reinforce your logo's message. Each color has its own set of associated moods. 84.7% of consumers cite colors as their main reason for buying a particular product and 80% think colors increase brand recognition.Simplify your colors. Some mediums only allow for two colors, and so should you in most cases. You should also check how your logo look in black and white. Some of the color associations are:

Red: energy, love, exciting, action, bold, passionate.
Blue: secure, calm, honest, strong, caring, trustworthy.
Yellow: logical, playful, optimistic, forward thinking, confident.
Orange: happy, sociable, friendly, affordable.
Purple: imaginative, creative, nostalgic.
Green: growth, organic, natural, caring, fresh, earth.
Multi-color: multi-channel, positive, playful, bold, boundless.
Black: sophistication, luxury, seductive, formal, authority.

, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop are most commonly used, but you can also use Inkscape for free., You want the company to stand out from its competition. Be imaginative.

Be creative. Logos can communicate something else than what a company does. Nike’s logo is not a shoe, but it represents the will of the company to get things done.
Keep it simple. A logo needs to be easy for the company’s customers to understand and pleasant for the eye.

, Your need to let your mind think and most often your first logo won’t be your favorite. Most companies will probably ask you for at least 3 different versions anyway, so that they can choose what they like most.

, Inspire people. Be attractive and meaningful. Create an aura around the company’s name.

Think about people’s emotional response. What do you want the company’s customers to feel when they see its logo?

, You put trust in them. Use it. Yet, don’t rely only on them., Try to find potential customers and show them your designs. Ask them questions about the key words you came up with from your brainstorm.

, Be cautious with details. You want everything to be perfect., You can use Illustrator to do it. Otherwise, try an online image vectorizer.


Make sure that the design is scalable. Try it in different image size. Some details might be lost in small sizes.

, They have to make sure no one will use their logo. It represents the company and its values, and the way to protect it is to apply for a governmental trademark. It can cost over 250 euros (over $300)., If the company gets back to you with suggestions from its customers and ask you for a new contract. If you accept the deal, press the customers for details."

This is particularly true if you have a health condition, such as diabetes.


If weight loss is your goal, ask for a referral to see a registered dietitian who can help you design meal plans that will help you lose weight while still getting all the nutrients you need to stay healthy.
Speak with your doctor about your current weight, cholesterol levels or blood pressure and if they are at a healthy level. They may recommend certain changes based on your current health.
As you continue to improve your health, maintain or lose weight and make other changes to your lifestyle, keep in touch with your doctor so he or she will know if there is any changes to your health.;
, Getting skinny might not coincide with your goal to be healthy. Not all people who are ""skinny"" are considered healthy. Instead of aiming for skinny, aim for a healthy, appropriate weight.Being underweight may put you at increased risk for infection, disease, osteoporosis and other medical conditions.To find a healthy weight for you, you can use an online calculator that will give you a weight based on your age, gender, height, and activity level. Try the one here: http://www.dietitian.com/calcbody.php#.WEXONaIrJE5

You can also use your BMI or your body mass index to find out whether or not you're at a healthy weight. If your BMI is between 18.5 – 24.9 you're considered at a healthy weight. if your BMI is under 18.5, you should see a physician and/or dietitian. That puts you in an underweight category and gradual weight gain may be important.Try the calculator here: http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html

Use one or more of these tools to decide if you're currently at a healthy weight or need to lose weight. Use this information when forming more specific goals.
If you're currently at a healthy weight consider using cardio and strength training to help trim and tone your body.

, Getting healthy and aiming for a healthy weight is a broad goal and one that will most likely take a variety of changes on your part. Be more specific with smaller goals. Writing out several smaller and more specific goals can give you a more realistic set of goals and a more detailed idea of what you need to do to meet those goals.Try separating out your goal into categories first. For example, you might make a few goals in the following areas: diet, exercise and general lifestyle.
Examples of more realistic and detailed goals would be: ""Lose 5 pounds in two months;"" ""Exercise three to four times a week for 30 minutes;"" or ""Decrease my alcohol consumption to one to two drinks weekly from my current level of five drinks weekly.""

, A plan will help you chart your journey to meet your goals. Whether or not you use a meal plan or exercise plan, these can serve as guides on your way to be healthier.


A meal plan is a great place to start. This will help you reach goals that are related to your diet and weight. Write out a week's worth of breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack and beverages. This will give you a guide for grocery shopping and take the guess work out of healthy eating throughout the week.An exercise plan may allow you to schedule in exercise throughout the week. It can help you visually see when, where and what type of exercise you'll be doing each day.
Keep your plans on hand. You may want to change or adjust them as you get closer to your goals or your goals change over time.

, After detailing your goals, you may want to come up with a calorie limit for yourself each day. This can either help you lose weight or maintain your current healthy weight.Every person needs a different amount of calories each day to keep their body working and functioning at an optimal level. Changing the amount of calories you eat each day can help you reach a variety of different weight goals.
If you've decided you need or want to lose a little weight, aim to cut out about 500 calories daily. This generally results in about a 1 pound weight loss each week (or slightly more if you incorporate exercise).This is a slow, steady and safe rate of weight loss that will coincide with your goal to be healthy.
If you'd like to maintain your weight, you can find an online calculator (such as this one http://www.dietitian.com/calcbody.php#.WEXRhKIrJE5) that uses your age, gender and weight to determine a estimated amount of calories that will support weight maintenance.
You may want to consider using a food journal or journal app to help you count and track your daily caloric intake. This will allow you to see if your current calorie intake is needs to be adjusted to help you meet your goal (either weight loss or weight maintenance).

, It's important to eat regular, consistent meals throughout the day. Skipping meals or going too long between meals is not considered healthy and can lead to unwanted fluctuations in your weight.There are a variety of eating patterns that you can adopt and fit into your current lifestyle. At a minimum, it's generally recommended to eat at least three meals daily; however, you may find it easier or more desirable to eat four to six smaller meals throughout the day.
Start your day off on a good note by eating breakfast. Studies have shown that those who eat breakfast typically maintain a healthier weight. It kickstarts your metabolism and gives you the energy to focus throughout the day.
In addition to scheduling in regular meals, you may also want to schedule in the occasional snack. Snacks will help you transition from one meal to the next when there is longer than four to six hours between those meals., A balanced diet will help support a healthy weight and healthy body. In addition, this type of eating pattern will provide you with all the essential nutrients it needs to function well each day.A balanced diet means you're eating foods from each food group: protein, dairy, fruits, vegetables and grains. Each food group offers your body a wide range of nutrients.
In addition, make sure you eat a large variety within each food group. Choose a variety of protein sources and different colors of fruits and vegetables.Avoiding entire food groups or large quantities of foods can lead to nutrient deficiencies.Unless you have a food allergy or other medical restriction, do not make any foods completely off limits.

, These foods should make up a rather large part of your diet. Both of these food groups provide some of the most nutritious and nutrient-dense foods you can eat.


Fruits and vegetables are widely know as ""healthy food."" This is because they are fairly low in calories and high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.They provide your body with a large quantity of the required essential nutrients.
Most nutrition professionals recommended eating five to nine servings daily or making half of all your meals and snacks a fruit or a vegetable.Although fruits and vegetables are healthy, still stick to appropriate serving sizes. Eat 1/2 cup chopped or one small piece of fruit or 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of leafy greens or salad., Another way to add more nutrition and health benefits to your diet is by choosing 100% whole grains over refined grains.


100% whole grains are minimally processed and include all three parts of the grain: germ, endosperm and bran. Together, these parts of the grain offer you more fiber, protein and B vitamins.There are a variety of whole grains to try including: quinoa, millet, brown rice, 100% whole grain bread and pasta or oats.
Refined grains are those that are highly processed, are lower in fiber and other essential nutrients. Examples include: white rice, white bread or pearled barley.
Again, follow appropriate serving sizes for grains which are about 1 oz or 1/2 cup cooked., Protein is an essential nutrient to a nutritious diet. Protein provides the building blocks for your body to do a variety of essential functions each day.


Protein is important for: provide structure and support for cells, bind and carry molecules throughout the body, and provide the building blocks for bones, muscles, hair and organs.Choose lean protein sources when possible. They are lower in fat and calories and can help support a nutritious diet and healthy weight.Also choose appropriate portion sizes which are 3 – 4 oz or about 1/2 cup.Choose lean sources like: poultry, eggs, lean beef, pork, legumes, tofu and seafood.

, Although a high fat diet isn't considered healthy, some dietary fat is essential for a well-balanced and nutritious diet.Choose to include heart-healthy fats to include in your diet.

Dietary fat plays a variety of roles in your body including: aiding in vitamin and mineral absorption, provide energy to your body, helps provide insulation and supports healthy skin and hair.It's important to choose sources of dietary fats that will support your health and not adversely affect it. Choose omega-3 fats or monounsaturated fats instead of trans-fats and saturated fats.Sources of healthy fats include: nuts or nut butters, olive oil and olives, avocado, salmon, tuna, mackerel, chia seeds and flax seeds. Include one to two servings of these each day.Trans-fats have been shown to adversely affect your health by decreasing your HDL (good cholesterol) and increasing your LDL. They're typically found in processed foods like candies or pastries., Beverages that are high in calories and sugar can lead to weight gain which can have a negative effect on your health.Limit these types of beverages and stick to hydrating fluids instead.

Aim for at least eight glasses of hydrating fluids each day. You may need up to 13 glasses of water daily depending on your age, gender and activity level.Stick to clear, hydrating fluids like: water, flavored water, unsweetened and decaf coffee and tea. These are the best for maintaining your hydration status.
Drink milk and 100% fruit juice in moderation. Although both contain some worthwhile nutrition, they still count towards ""liquid calories."" If you're watching your total caloric intake, do not forget to track any liquid beverages you consume.

, Boxed or processed foods are generally considered not very nutritious.Limiting these foods can help you improve or maintain your health in addition to supporting a healthy weight.


There is a large variety of processed foods that include both nutritious items and unhealthy choices. Processed foods even include those that have gone through very minor changes to be ready for consumption.Although bagged pre-washed spinach is considered ""processed,"" it's still a very nutritious food to eat on a regular basis; however, a frozen TV dinner is much more processed and also unhealthier from all the added sodium and preservatives.
Minimized the highly processed foods that have added sugars or fat, or are high in fat and calories. Limit items like frozen TV dinners, sweets and pastries, crackers, chips, pretzels, processed meals and canned meals.
If you currently rely heavily on highly processed foods, begin swapping these with more whole, unprocessed foods. Consider cooking more at home and making some foods from scratch instead of buying them pre-made.

, Cardiovascular or aerobic exercise is an essential component to a healthy lifestyle. Include at least two to three hours weekly to help you maintain good health. There are a large variety of health benefits associated with regular aerobic exercise including: improved sleep and mood, decreased risk of obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure, and increases your chances of living longer.Go for moderate-intensity activities like: fasting walking/jogging, swimming, using the elliptical, doing an aerobics class or dancing.
A gradual increase gets the best results, since it gives your body the time to adapt and make progress. It also may help you prevent injury or overuse pains.Also, you tend to burn more calories if you exercise in the morning.Make sure to keep yourself hydrated while exercising by drinking plenty of water.

, Cardio offers your body a variety of health benefits; however, when combined with regular and consistent strength training, you'll see even more health benefits.


Strength training is great to help improve bone density, decrease your risk for osteoporosis, increase or maintain lean muscle mass and increase your metabolism.Most fitness professionals will suggest adding at least one to two days of strength training each week for the most benefit.A variety of activities can count as strength training. Try lifting weights or using weight machines, doing isometric exercises (like push-ups or crunches), or doing classes like yoga or pilates.

, There have been a variety of studies that show those who move more throughout the day or have a high level of lifestyle activity may see similar benefits to those who only do planned or structured physical activity (like going for a 30 minute jog).Lifestyle activities are those that you do on a regular basis or as part of your lifestyle. For example, walking up the stairs to your apartment, doing the laundry or raking the leaves all count as lifestyle activity
These types of activities do not necessarily burn a lot of calories or provide the immediate health benefits of structured activity; however, as they accumulate throughout the day, they do make a difference for your health.

Walking around the house, to work, college or school, or to get to other places, such as a friend's house. Do more household chores like gardening, mowing the lawn or raking leaves. Take the stairs more often.

, Outside of diet and activity, there are a few other things that will support your goal of being healthier and maintaining an appropriate weight. Getting adequate sleep each night is a very important part of your goal.


Those who don't sleep enough or do not sleep well are at increased risk for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. In addition when you don't sleep well it's difficult to focus and concentrate during the day and have increased sensations of hunger and craving for higher carb foods.Health professionals recommend getting in about seven to nine hours of sleep each night.If you're having difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, talk to your doctor immediately. It's not safe to go too long without sufficient or restorative sleep.

, Like sleep, stress also plays an important role in your health. When stress is not managed or not managed well, you may experience negative health effects.


One common effect of stress is weight gain. Your body secretes more cortisol (a stress hormone) which makes you hungrier and makes it more difficult to lose weight.In addition to weight, excess stress can cause: headache, chest pain, fatigue/exhaustion, upset stomach, difficulty sleeping, and mood swings.Manage stress by participating in activities that relax you. Try: talking to a friend or family member, listen to music, meditate, read a good book or magazine or take a short walk.
If you're having difficulty managing stress on your own, consider seeking professional help. Many mental health professionals and coaches can give you the guidance and tools you need to manage the stress in your life more appropriately.

, Both smoking and excessive alcohol consumption have been shown to have a large quantity of serious side effects on your health. Both should be eliminated if you want to be healthier and maintain a healthy weight.


Smoking or use of any tobacco products has been associated with a variety of negative side effects including: lung disease and cancer, heart disease, stroke, cancer of many other organ systems, decreased immune function, decreased fertility, increased risk mouth and gum diseases and increased risk for rheumatoid arthritis.You can try quitting cold turkey, but you may have more luck if you use cessation aids such as
Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with: high blood pressure, stroke, a variety of liver diseases, pancreatitis, weakened immune system and cancer.One serving is 5 oz wine, 12 oz beer, 1.5 oz liquor.
Limit alcohol to one serving or less daily for women and two servings or less daily for men."

Follow up.,
Fail Quickly.",How to Build a Successful and Profitable Writing Business," Take some time with creating your vision - after all, you're going to spend more time working than you do with anything and usually - anyone - else. So think about what you want - from your work - and in your life. Do you love to travel? Then think about incorporating some form of travel writing into your business vision - so you can get paid to do something you want to do - and take your trips off your income tax as well! Love eating out? Watching the latest films? Going to the theater? Visiting art galleries, museums or special places of interest? Then add that to your services or repertoire.;
, To be successful in any business, you have to know your strengths and your weaknesses. Make sure that you play to your strengths and find someone else to fill in where you're weak. (For example, it's difficult for many writers to proof their own work. If you're a poor speller, or English isn't your primary language find someone who's good at it and let them review your work before sending it out.)

, There's been so much talk online - especially in the Internet Marketing field - about ""niches"" and finding a good niche, and choosing the right niche - that several articles about this subject alone could be written. But in this case, what you need to think about is this: your experience, (which could include life, business, hobbies, volunteer work, interests and passions). When you're deciding what kind of writing business you want to build, make sure that it's something that you can see yourself doing for the next several years. Remember too, specialists make more money than generalists - and it's easier to be a big fish in a little pond, than a little fish who gets lost - or eaten by a bigger fish - in a big ocean.

, Another part of doing your research means looking closely at your competitors. You want to know who they are, what they offer, how they offer it...and perhaps most importantly of all - what they're NOT offering. One of the fastest ways to become successful - especially in a competitive marketplace, is to specialize by serving a specific part of your chosen niche and providing services that your competitors are not. (Or bundling your services in a unique way that provides your ideal customers with something they can only get from you.)

, If there was nothing stopping you from getting to work with anyone you wanted, who would it be? Do you like the idea of having the government - and the long-term contracts, stability and high pay that goes along with that? Or do you enjoy the variety, excitement and constant change that comes from working with people in the arts and entertainment industry? Or maybe you have a way of taking highly technical and/or complicated information and making it simple and easy to understand? The point is, whoever you want to work with, you need to know - and be able to articulate - who they are, what they want, and why they should choose to buy from you rather than anyone else. You'll also need to know where to find them and what to say to them so they want to work with you, too.

, This might sound a little strange - after all, you're a writer. You offer writing services. But if you think that's ALL you offer, you're wrong. Your complete offer should also give your prospective client the information they need to know about: how you work, your working schedule, your guarantee, your policies, your communication guidelines, and - last but not least, your fees.

, You can do this quarterly, semi-annually or yearly, but make sure you schedule time to do it on schedule. When you're just starting out, you might want to strategize quarterly - because the way you market when you're just starting out is going to change as you begin building your business and gaining regular customers will change.

,, This is probably one of the biggest mistakes most writers make - they don't follow up with prospective clients. This is one of the easiest - and least often used strategies for building your writing business. Take the time to follow up with prospective clients, current clients and past clients.

, If there's something you don't know how to do - find someone you trust and ask for help. If there's a skill you need to learn, then cowboy up and just do it! (For example, don't let something that can be learned - like html for example -stand in your way of building a successful writing business.)

Know what you're asking for.,
Know how many illustrations do you want?

,
Be prepared for providing needed info.

,
For each illustration please provide the following list of the elements to be included in the composition?,
Decide if the art will the art be in color or black and white?

,
Do you want one or more prints or a digital image or both?

,
If you are ordering prints how many and what size?

,
For what purpose will the art be used?

,
Know ahead of time, what is the eye, hair and skin color of the subjects?

,
Will you be providing reference material or do you expect the artist to procure it.,
Will there be any text on the page?,
Do you need the artist to design a logo and if so what are your ideas for it?,
Do you want a logo you already have placed on the art?,
You can ask the illustrator to show you samples of art they have which conveys the type and quality of the illustrations they create, however, do not expect them to have the exact thing you have in mind.,
Ask the artist if you will be supplied with a sketch before they go to the final finish.",How to Find an Illustrator," Once your quest for the right illustrator has ended the next step is knowing how to instruct the artist to draw what you have in mind. The best way to be satisfied with the art you order is to be extremely clear in your instructions. The artist will appreciate a concise, to the point order. Below is a list of questions designed to help organize your requests.;
,,, For example: A drawing of a collie dog, walking down a lane, in profile, past a line of trees with a clear, blue, cloudless sky in background. The dog should be wearing a collar and have a pleasant expression.

,,,,,, Some artists will charge for finding reference material as it can be very time consuming. You might consider finding the reference to save fees.

, Do you want the artist to provide the text or leave room for your printer to place the text on the finished art. If you want the artist to do it what font should be used. If you are having your printing company place the text they can superimpose it on the digital art.

, What is the message you want to convey?

, Can you supply a digital image of the logo.

, For instance if you want a picture of a bride on a skateboard and they have drawn skateboards and brides separately you can be confident they draw them together. If the artist can draw an airplane but has not drawn a skateboard be confident they can draw the skateboard.

, Do not expect the artist to redraw the picture if you change your mind for the original layout without incurring more fees.

Be persistent.",How to Become a TV Reporter or News Anchor," Your voice is key in this field. You should concentrate on projection, enunciation, and inflection. All of these things will help you deliver your “script” in a compelling nature. Be authoritative in your speech. This will give you credibility with your audience. Read newspapers and magazines aloud. Listen to the best journalists in the field when they speak and try to emulate them.You'll have to speak loudly and slowly enough for people to understand you, but quickly enough to cover everything you have to say in a given amount of time.;
, This doesn't mean that you have to look like a movie star or a Victoria's Secret model. You don't even have to be classically handsome or beautiful. You do, however, have to look appealing on camera, and have that special quality that makes people want to watch you doing whatever you do. This is a mixture of charisma, confidence, and that special something that will make people respond to you even if you're covering a story about a local bake sale.


Unfortunately, it can go the other way -- you may be incredibly attractive but may come off as lackluster on camera. Don't think that your looks are a golden ticket to the profession.

, If you want to succeed in the world of TV reporting or news anchoring, then you have to be able to talk to anyone about almost anything. If you're reporting, you may have to talk to people live, on site, and on camera, even if they aren't comfortable, and your job will be to make them comfortable. If you're an anchor, then you'll have to introduce people to your audience and talk to them in the studio, and use the same skills to make them open up and feel at ease.You may not realize that many reporters and news anchors have to write and investigate their own stories, but this may actually be a large component of your job. If this is the case, then you'll need to be able to talk to a variety of people who can give you access to the information you want.

, Tough one, eh? If you want to be an honest TV reporter or news anchor, then you'll have to learn to put your prejudices aside. Even if you lean a certain way politically or feel biased against certain professions, people, or regions, you'll have to do your reporting as objectively as possible. You won't be able to let the people you interview see through to your personal beliefs, or you won't be giving people the honest, unbiased news that they really want.


If you're prejudiced against certain people, they will be much less likely to open up to you.

, Though being an articulate speaker is crucial, being a strong writer isn't far behind. Even if you're just reading what you have to say and improvising as you go along, or if you have to write your own stories, writing skills will get you far in the field. Writing skills will also help you communicate with others if you have to develop your own stories, and your writing should make you sound as professional as possible., If you're the kind of person who needs a nap after working for two hours, then the life of a TV reporter or news anchor is not for you. You may have to work 12 hour shifts, get up at 2 a.m., or spend hours just standing in the same spot during unusually cold or hot conditions waiting for a story to break. And you have to have the ability to work a 10 hour shift, only to be told that a major story just broke and to work 5 more hours until you take care of business.


You will have to be flexible. This is not a job for people who want to work 9-5 and then go home and kick their feet up. Think you can do it?

, Most TV stations require that you have a college degree, preferably in broadcast journalism. Getting a degree in English or Communications is also a big help. Some schools that have top broadcast journalism programs are Brigham Young University, University Missouri Columbia, Northwestern University, Syracuse University and Arizona State University.


Taking a wide variety of liberal arts courses, such as political science or art history, will help you get more experience with a variety of subjects and will make you a more well-rounded reporter or anchor.

, When you're in college, you'll have to do more than just get your bachelor's degree if you want to take your career to the next level. Join your school newspaper and get some practice writing stories, investigating leads, and understanding the hard work needed to provide your audience with a good story. If you have a local college TV station, try to involved there, eventually ending up as an anchor or reporter if you can.


If your college does not have a local TV station, go for the local radio station. This will still give you some experience with interviewing others and speaking in an articulate manner.

, You can do this over the summer, between undergraduate semesters, or even after you graduate from college. Getting an internship at a local paper can help you make connections and have a better understanding of the way a news station runs. You may not end up doing much more than answering phones and getting coffee, but if you want to get ahead, you'll have to do it -- with enthusiasm.Getting this experience will help improve your resume greatly. This is the kind of thing that will back up an impressive resume reel.

, Though a master's degree in journalism isn't required for you to become a TV reporter or a news anchor, it can help you get a leg up in the profession. Most journalism master's programs, such as the one at Columbia University, are only one or two years long. You may have to pay out of pocket for this degree if you can't get funding or a scholarship, so choose wisely. A journalism degree can help you not only get an appreciation for the field of reporting, but it can also help you get a leg up in the application process.Additionally, going to journalism school can help you make valuable connections that may lead to jobs in the future.

, You of course learn some of this in school. Writing for TV is very different from writing a term paper. You need to learn how to write to the images your audience will see on TV. It’s called writing to video. Also, you should keep writing simple and stay away from legalese and clichés. You have only one shot to get the attention of folks at home.


Though news anchors most often read from their notes or from teleprompters (while improvising along the way), most reporters have to write their own copy for when they go in the field.

, A resumé tape is a reel that shows a sample of your reporting/anchoring skills. It usually starts with a slate – a brief showing of your name and contact information. The slate is usually followed by a montage, which is a short segment of compelling live shots, samples of reporting and anchoring. The montage is then followed by three of your best stories.


The best way to get your first resumé tape is to do one in school; otherwise it can be quite expensive.

, When you apply for work, you'll need to send both your resumé tape and an actual resumé. The resume will include any relevant experience and education, such as any volunteer or part-time work you've done in the field. You'll also list any major news stories you've covered as well as your roles in presenting them. You can also include your technical experience and proficiency with digital communication devices or systems, since most stations are tech savvy.


Don't just apply to the stations that are hiring. Send your tape and resumé absolutely everywhere that you can send it without being a nuisance. You never know when an opening will appear, and having your tape on the right person's desk at the right time can increase your chances of getting that job.

, You won't find your first job three blocks from your house. Jobs are so competitive that you can’t be choosy when landing your first job. Sure, you may want to hold out for San Diego, California but if Biloxi, Mississippi offers you your first job, you should probably say yes. Send your tape and apply everywhere you can, and be prepared to step out of your comfort zone.


Remember that the more experience you have, the more command you'll have over where you can live and work. You may not have much control over your first job or two, but once you build up a reputation, you'll have more success in applying for work at stations in more coveted locations.

, Everyone has visions of taking over the NBC Nightly News anchor desk, but the truth of the matter is a tiny portion of people who get into the TV news business will ever make it to a top 10 market. It’s a good idea to start your career in a small local market because you can learn all aspects of the business. You will likely do everything like: report, produce, anchor, shoot video, edit and maybe even run the teleprompter with your foot!


You’ll also get the opportunity to make your mistakes. Audiences are much more forgiving in Mobile, Alabama than they are in New York City.

, The average reporter job in a small market gets paid between $15,000 and $18,000 a year. Not what you expected? Contrary to popular belief, most TV personalities are not rolling in dough. Television news is a field where the supply outweighs the demand. Basically there are more people who want to be on TV than there are available positions. That’s part of the reason why pay is not competitive.


Also, if you start at a small market station, you will get small market pay. It’s the nature of the business. If making a lot of money in your career is important to you, don’t get into TV news!
The anchors in the 25 biggest markets make around $130,000 a year, but these are very prestigious positions., Once you've put in at least 3-5 years at a small station and have found some success, you can start moving up in the ranks. Apply for work at larger stations, or even medium-sized stations, and see what you can do. Apply everywhere, not just places that have openings, and use your great experience as a way to back up the fact that you'll be an amazing candidate for the job.


Don't think that working at the bigger stations, however, will let you be more flexible and to set your own hours more. Quite the contrary. The more prestigious your position, the more rigorous its demands will be.

, When you begin, you'll be working as an anchor or a reporter for whatever field is available. But as you advance in your career, you may have more say about what field you'll be reporting in. You can work as a featured news reporter, in consumer news, or in health news, for example. This can depend on your personality and what you like doing the most. If you're more funny and relaxed, then the quirky human interest stories may be more your speed; if you're more serious, then you may cover more intense topics like homicide.


If you don't want to be negatively impacted by the news you share, then you may consider working in consumer, medical, or features news. They may be a little less exciting, but they'll also be less emotionally draining.

, The truth is you will hardly ever get holidays off. You will most likely be working. Established main anchors at TV stations will most likely get holidays off, which means you will be stuck at work. If you constantly move markets every couple of years to increase your salary and experience, you will always be the new kid on the block, which means you won’t have seniority. So, you can kiss Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s, Fourth of July, and Labor Day goodbye.Also “sweeps” months (when stations monitor how many people are watching) will be off limits for vacation time. These months include: February, May, July and November.

, You may be placed on the morning shift, the evening shift, a split shift and the weekend shift at any given moment. New reporters especially have very little say in the hours they work. Working overtime is very common and few stations pay overtime.Not only will your schedule be demanding, but it may change at a moment's notice. You'll need to not only be available, but to be flexible.

, There are a number of ways to advance your career, and this doesn't always mean working at bigger and better news stations. You can go ""network hopping,"" which means moving from one station to the next to gain more responsibilities and to build your reputation. However, if you've had enough of this rigorous lifestyle and have built up enough prestige, then you can consider getting into the talk show forum route, work as a syndicated columnist for a major paper, or even turn to being an author, a public relations specialist, an editor, or a college professor.Just remember that it can take a decade or longer to move past the traditional route of a TV reporter or news anchor.

, Unfortunately, unlike in most other professions, if you make a big mistake in the field of reporting or anchoring, it may be on permanent record. You don't want to be the reporter who is famous for cursing on national television or who muttered an objectionable and offensive term in front of hundreds of viewers. If you make a mistake like that, you may not be forgiven.


If you're also known for public outbursts, you'll need to get that under control before you get behind the camera.

, Persistence is a valuable skill any reporter/anchor should have. You'll not only need this skill to land that first job, but you'll need it to move up in the ranks and to really work hard to get that dream job you'll be fighting for. If you investigate your stories yourself, then persistence is a valuable quality that you'll need to make sure you can follow leads, look elsewhere when you get a dead end, and to keep trying until you succeed.

Be creative.",How to Become a Videographer," You can start preparing for a career as a videographer while you are still in high school.Seek out and take advantage of any courses and opportunities at your school that are related to working with film.


Some high schools offer courses in technology, film, art, broadcasting, or journalism that might involve components relevant to videography.
Take part in your school’s news program, if it has one, as an opportunity to practice filming.
Join or start a video or audio-visual (AV) club at your school.Take part in any student film contests that you can.;
, While you don’t necessarily need a specific degree in order to work as a videographer, most individuals in the field have a bachelor’s degree in some area that is related to film or broadcasting.While earning a degree, you will gain valuable technical skills and experiences. Course you can take (and potential majors) include:


Communications
Cinematography
Broadcasting
Video editing
Film theory
Computer scienceScript analysis
Media ethics
Screenwriting

, While digital cameras and computer software are the state of the art, you might also gain some familiarity with other types of equipment and editing techniques.


Get a digital camera and start filming whatever you find interesting. Using a computer and at least basic software, start learning how to edit your footage. Even if you just keep it for yourself, this will be good practice.
Professional video equipment and software can be expensive, but if you are serious about becoming a videographer, it might be worth the investment.

, On the job training is important for many videographers.Some crews use specialized software and equipment, and this training is meant to increase your familiarity with it. The skills you learn as an intern or apprentice, however, can be used later on in your career.


Check with school film and broadcasting departments about possible internships.
You can also contact television companies, film studios, and related groups directly about completing an internship. Some may have programs already in place that you can apply for.

, There is no widely-accepted certification for videographers.However, you can seek out any certifications, specializations (such as legal video or digital video editing) or courses that look attractive to you and might bolster your resume.Prepare for these by taking a class, studying on your own, and taking any required examinations., You can draw or write out a rough storyboard of what you want to film, and use this as a guide. You can edit and change things later, but having a plan helps you work efficiently and produce great results.


If you need special equipment or assistants for a project, make sure they are prepared beforehand. This will save you time and money.

, Videography is an art that involves much more that simply pointing a camera at something and shooting. By taking different kinds of shots, you can vary your work with a subject, making your footage more interesting and compelling to viewers.


The extreme long shot (ELS) or extreme wide shot (EWS) covers a very wide area, placing your subject in context.For instance, if you are filming a wedding, you might include an EWS that shows the entire wedding party and audience, with the couple at the center.
A long shot (LS), full shot (FS), or wide shot (WS) captures the entire subject within the camera frame.For instance, if you are recording a speaker, a FS will show the figure filling the screen, from head to toe.
A medium long shot (MLS) or medium wide shot (MWS) or three-quarter shot is often used for filming people, and shows a subject from about the knees up.This kind of shot is useful for recording small groups of people, such as a group of bridesmaids chatting at a wedding.
The medium shot (MS) shows individuals from the waist up.It focuses the viewer’s attention on the subject, and is useful for filming interviews. It is useful for showing detail when filming other subjects.The medium close-up (MCS) shows a figure’s shoulders and head.It is used for filming interviews and in contexts like news studios.
The close up (CU) fills the camera’s frame with the subject.It is useful for capturing emotion and facial expressions.
The extreme close up (ECU) films just a part of a subject, such as a person's eyes.It can be used for very dramatic effects.

, To vary your projects and make them more interesting, try moving your camera in several ways, including:


Panning, which involves turning the camera from left to right or right to left. This is useful, for instance, when filming a crowd or landscape.
Tilting, which means moving the camera up or down to show parts of a subject that were off-screen. This move is useful when filming subjects like close-ups of people or buildings.
Trucking and dollying, which involve physically moving a camera around or away from a subject, respectively. For instance, if you are filming a small group of people, you can truck a camera around the perimeter of the group to capture it from many angles. Likewise, if you want to film a sense of leaving a subject, like a building, dolly a camera pointed at the building away from it.

, You can create additional variety by utilizing special analog and digital effects. Some of these can be used while filming, while others can be added during editing. Common techniques include:Zooming in and out
Fading in and out
Cutting (shifting the film from quickly one scene to another, such as from a shot of a bride with bridesmaids inside a church to a shot of the church viewed from the outside).
Transitions (shifting between scenes more subtly, such as fading out on a shot of a bride to a new shot of a church)

, It focuses on capturing a subject from several different angles to create variety. You can then arrange the clips during the editing phase in whatever order seems good to you.


Get one wide shot of a subject. For instance, when filming a speaker in front of a crowd, get a shot that shows the speaker as well as the whole crowd.
Take a medium shot of the subject. For instance, you could zoom in on the speaker to show a stage and podium.
Incorporate one close-up (“tight”) shot. For instance, get a close-up shot of the speaker’s face during a particularly emotional or important moment.
Make sure to hold each shot for at least ten seconds. You can remove sections you don't need during editing, but you can’t add them if you never filmed them in the first place.

, There are many different ways to edit film, and it’s really up to you to find a unique style, so feel free to experiment. For instance:


Edit a series of different shots together to create a story or narrative.
Practice adding sound, text, and other elements to create interest and variety.
Utilize digital effects to alter your footage.
Incorporate different types of transitions, such as fades, wipes, and dissolves.

, Include clips or full footage that you have shot, whether as a student, for a project, or as part of a job. Show this portfolio to studios, producers, and others you approach when looking for jobs.


Include lots of different clips of things that you have shot and edited.
If you want to show that you are a diverse videographer, make sure that your portfolio shares clips a variety of subjects.
If you want to concentrate on a certain type of videography, such as for weddings, then make sure that your portfolio has a range of different clips from weddings you have filmed.
Make sure to include clips of varying lengths. Some prospective clients might want to see 30 minutes of that wedding that you shot, while others might only have time to look at a 30-second clip.
Create a website or channel on a video-sharing website to showcase your work. You can share the link to your portfolio, promote it on social media, etc.
It is a good idea to have your portfolio in several formats. For instance, you might also create DVDs with samples of your best work to show to clients or job search committees that prefer that format.
Make sure your portfolio evolves, even after you have worked as a videographer for some time. Keep adding superior work, and remove any that seems outdated, irrelevant, or not as good.

, Professional organizations and associations are great ways to find out more about the field, to network with colleagues, and to learn about jobs and other opportunities. Some videography associations are regionally-based.Others focus on a certain type of videography practice (such as weddings or university projects).Professional organizations you might consider joining include ones like:


The New England Professional Videographers Association (NPVA)The Bay Area Professional Videographers Association (BAPV)The Minnesota Professional Videographers Association (MPVA)The Colorado Professional Videographers Association (CPVA)The Michigan Video Association (MIVA)The Wedding and Event Videographers Association International (WEVA)The University Film and Video Association (UFVA)The American Guild of Court Videographers (AGCV), Jobs for videographers will typically depend on experience and past projects, so don’t be surprised if things start out slow. Focus on making an excellent portfolio, assembling a good client list, and crafting a strong resume. Many videographers are self employed, gaining experience and making a name for themselves client by client.Other places that videographers find jobs include cable and television networks, film studios, and news organizations.Some calls for videographers will be posted to general jobs boards, such as Indeed and Monster.
If you are looking to work as a videographer for specific types of institutions, such as courts or universities, you should also check their websites for possible job postings.
Some professional associations for videographers may post jobs, host job fairs, workshops on finding jobs, networking events, etc.
Freelance videographers typically concentrate on finding jobs by word of mouth referrals, and by marketing their services.

, If you are working as a freelance or self-employed videographer, it is critical to use social media to advertise your work and attract potential clients.


Create a profile on a variety of social media sites. For videographers, this includes sites that focus on video content (like YouTube and Vimeo) as well as other networking sites (such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, Google Plus, etc.).
Make sure that your profile is public, if it is associated with your own name instead of a brand or company name.
Post regularly, including samples of your own work. You could share a ""clip of the week,"" for instance.
Mention clients in your posts. If they provide you with positive reviews, ask if you can share the feedback online.
Network with other videographers and other individuals in your field by following and commenting on their profile pages.
Share or repost any information you think clients might be interested in.

, Videographers can find rewarding careers in related fields, including:


Broadcasting
Sound engineering
Video or film production

, Conferences are a great way to expand your knowledge and contacts in the field. You can attend panels and presentations to hear about new developments, equipment, and techniques in the field, as well as network with colleagues and learn about job opportunities. Many professional videographer associations host regular conferences you can attend., Film and video production and editing is always changing. To keep up with developments, consider taking workshops and courses at colleges and universities, film schools, and other institutions.Even if you already have an educational background in videography and experience in the field, these workshops can refresh your knowledge and make you aware of new things to try so that you keep up with the state of the art.

, There are several contests and industry awards that videographers can enter.Achieving recognition by winning one is personally and professionally fulfilling. Making a name for yourself in this way might just help you land your dream job!

, Videographers are first and foremost artists, so don’t neglect your creative side.Pay attention to the work of other videographers whose work you admire, but also take the time to practice any other arts that interest you (music, painting, literature, etc.), and to read widely and learn about lots of different things . In addition, set aside regular sessions to brainstorm ideas by sketching, writing, or using software. All of this can boost your creativity and success as a videographer.

Plan.,
Mark.,
Buy.,
Set up.,
Attach any gates that are needed to be attached to these panels.,
Let the animals out into the corral once everything is secured, chained up and properly reinforced.

",How to Make a Fence With Cattle Panels," Draw out a plan of how and where you wish to lay out your fence. Take measurements with a measuring tape or ribbon of at least 100 feet (30.5 m) long of the area you wish to do the fencing on. On a large piece of paper, draw out, using a pencil and a ruler, where you want the fence to be laid out. Accommodate for buildings and shelters that are currently in that area, and also accommodate for the length that each cattle panel is, or the size of cattle panels you wish to get for your new corral. If you have not purchased any panels yet, as you do the drawing, make a list of how many panels (and what size) you will need for your corral.


Panels range in size from 8 feet (2.4 m) long to 16 feet (4.9 m) long; most custom-made ones will be over 25 feet (7.6 m). long. All are even numbered measurements; you will not get any panels that are an odd-number in length. Most panels will also be measured in Imperial measurements, but may possibly include Metric measurements as well.;
, With surveyor tape, sticks and/or bright spray paint, mark the places where you wish to lay your panels down. Remember to keep in mind the general length of the panels you are using. Also keep in mind that the panels won't be touching each other most of the time, as you may have between two to 6 inches (15.2 cm) of space between the ends of each panel.

, If you haven't done so already, you can now go and buy the cattle panels you need. Your local feed supply store or a livestock-farm equipment provider may have the panels you need. Or, if you know of any locals that are building cattle panels, you can also go and see them and by the panels you need there.

, The smaller panels are easily done by hand. If you want the more temporary panels to be made permanent, pound fence posts in between each panel and use fencing wire to tie each panel to the post. For the much larger (25 ft long) panels, use a tractor with a front-end loader to move them around. Be careful of where the panels swing and where/how you set them down.


Don't panic if area you set up is not following according to the survey lines you created. The animals you keep in there are not going to care about whether the corral is perfect or not. If you are short, adjust the panels accordingly; this is much easier with the temporary ones that have a T-beam on the base (these are called stand-alone panels). For those panels that you want to reinforce with T-posts or wooden fence posts, lay out the panels on their sides first before you do any post-pounding. This is so you can actually see how things are really laid out and whether any adjustments need to be made or not.

, Some of the custom-made panels will have gates pre-attached; other panels will not have this, and may require some extra labour to have any gates installed.

, Your product is you! You are the most unique brand in the world and there is not another person out there like you. You have your own style, personality and set of creative tools that make you one of a kind. So love what you do and do what you love.

, What makes what you do different from everyone else? Do you paint with your feet? Do you write and record songs in some unique fashion? What makes what you do and how you do it compelling and unique?

, How do you want to be remembered? What contribution do you want to make in your field or industry? How are you accomplishing this?

, The romantic notion of the starving artist is a thing of the past. If the last decade has taught us nothing else, it has at least taught us that content is king and that there are big dollars to be made in music, ideas, films and culture. There is nothing wrong with mixing creativity with commerce, in fact many of the biggest businesses in the world are thriving on this unique mix.

Get educated!,
Figure out your weak points, and attack them full on until you have overcome them!,
Research your subject.,
Research the style.,
Start loose and gestural; so much so, that all you are doing at first is simple shapes inside compositional borders (these borders should emulate the final piece's proportions).,
Warm up!,
Pay close attention to your composition, the rough stage is for this very purpose.,
Make the colors good.,
Pay attention to the quality of your materials.,
Select and use only the details you need, the rest of added embellishment is just added distraction and wasted time.,
The more preliminary pieces and roughs, the better the final piece.

,
If it is a good piece, make sure people know who did it.,
Experiment and express yourself.",How to Become a Professional Artist1," It is likely that even if you are someone who is blessed with some natural ability, you still have room to grow and develop these talents.

, For example: if you are a classical portraitist who can not draw feet, then you probably need to draw as many feet as you can until you actually can draw feet.

, Even an imagined piece must be developed from observational memory and knowledge. A scientific and structural approach is key for creating a successful illusion.

, Before you set out to create a piece of art, make sure you understand which elements of style are being manipulated, and how. Everything you produce must appear intentional.

, There should be several drawings before a final, locked-down piece is created.

, Before you can produce a good piece of art, you have to warm up! Your first drawing can not be as good as your last one. You have to get into the zone!

, Make sure the edges of your image are not distracting, and be sure that the viewers eyes are going only where you want them to go.

, Learn about the nature of sight, and the science of light. Look at photos, but don't copy them. Understand color temperature and shadow coloring. Study color-theory!

, Despite the fact that a good artist can make any materials look good, you should give yourself the best and most comfortable (unfortunately, often the most expensive) art supplies. After all, you want to be a professional, right? Wouldn't a professional use the good stuff?

, Use differentiation in detail to add emphasis to your pieces..

,, If it turns out bad, don't throw it away. The actual amount of good art that a professional produces is quite small next to the sheer bulk of bad stuff they have to go through in the process. Never throw old or bad art away, it's good motivation for the future. Keep everything neatly stored, so you can come back later and see how much you've improved. This really helps if you're feeling down in the dumps, and if you can't pull yourself out of a depressed mood (which inevitably, all artists go through- it's a complex we all have) then you'll never become a professional.

, An artist who sells a piece of art is ultimately selling a piece of him/her self. Let the paints blend, mix, and flow, if it feels good, and trust your talents and instincts.

While the majority of your time will be spent playing music, you also need to be able to make jokes and tell stories to make your routine more interesting and appealing.
Surf the Internet for speeches you can have on file for “impromptu” toasts and other announcements so you don’t have to speak on the fly and to make you appear very organized and prepared.

,


Start with used equipment – turntables, CD players, speakers, headsets, lights and disco balls - if you can find it through Craigslist or estate or going-out-of-business sales.
Ask the event venues if they have any equipment you can borrow as you’re getting started. Often they’ll have lights or sound systems built in.
Upgrade your equipment once you have started making enough money to be able to afford the upgrades.

,


Join your local Chamber of Commerce so you can take advantage of the networking functions, member advertising rates, website listings and such.
Introduce yourself to the directors of popular wedding venues in your area and offer your services, so they can hear what you can do. They can then recommend you to their brides who book there.
Contact local restaurants and hotels about getting on their list of preferred service providers, especially those who cater to brides and wedding planners.
Meet with your area Convention & Visitors Bureau as they work with meeting planners and other local venues to help brides when planning their weddings.

Take notice of requests from people who view your work.",How to Become a Professional Artist2," Professional artists work in dozens of media, and finding one which is marketable and suitable for your style will be your first priority. Here are a few examples:


Painting in oils. For either skilled painters who create original artwork to display and sell at showings or in galleries, this is probably the oldest continually used media. There are too many things to list involved in becoming a professional oil painter, such as choosing a technique, style, and preferred subject, but you should research the styles and subjects which are marketable to succeed without living in poverty. Here are a few subjects which may offer some hope of a successful career.

Portraits. Some institutions commission portraits of their benefactors or previous executives and significant persons in their company history, and oils tend to create a dignified artwork for this purpose.
Landscapes (and seascapes). For the decorator and the collector, these pieces are sought after as investments or simple decoration. The size and quality of an individual work, and more importantly, the artist's reputation, help determine the value of the work.
Still Life. Much like landscapes, these are usually sought after for decorative purposes, and possible customers could be collectors and professional people for use in decorating their office waiting areas.
Abstracts. These are more likely to be sought after by persons with more discriminating tastes, or Art Nouveau ideas, and the market probably isn't as open for them, since one must be a connoisseur to appreciate well executed abstract art.


Painting in acrylics. This is essentially the same as painting in oils, except the materials are water based, tend to be less expensive, and dry more rapidly, allowing a work to be completed in less time. Similar subject exist for acrylics as do oils.
Watercolor. This is a faster media in execution, and with skill gives excellent results. A wash can cover large areas more quickly than brush strokes, and the paint dries very quickly. The media is not as suitable for portraits, but is commonly used for landscapes, seascapes, and still life. Because of the relative ease of creating a finished watercolor painting, these are commonly sold in venues such as sidewalk displays, vacation destination souvenir shops, consignment galleries, and art shows. They can be created and hence, sold more cheaply than oils and acrylics, and so they are thought of as a more affordable painted fine art.;
, Framing and matting may be done by a professional, but be aware these add significantly to the cost of your work, and this will affect your success in selling the painting.

, Libraries, restaurant, hotels, and other public places and businesses are often happy to exhibit works for you, if they are of sufficient quality and work with their atmosphere and climate.

, Have a brochure printed with illustrations of your work, contact details, and other information available for interested persons.

, Professional artists often find that commissioned work is more reliable for income, and a few successful commissions will open doors in many cases, since the person who commissions the work usually does so to display it, which creates advertising for you, the artist.

Learn about, and possibly look into educational opportunities in computer imaging, also known as digital imaging.,
Working in this medium requires an extensive professional education, or long hours of self-study, an investment in hardware and software, and a keen sense of marketability.

,
Look for successful people in the field and talk to them about the steps they took to establish themselves in it.",How to Become a Professional Artist3," This is an emerging field in art. Using sophisticated software and modern computers, digital images can be created, stored, and transmitted with relative ease when compared to paintings. These images are used in a wide variety of fields, including:


Advertising. Products can be displayed with digital imaging techniques to draw the consumer's eye, helping to build a successful product marketing campaign with minimal field expense, such as travel, models, and location costs.
Illustration for publications. Many businesses depend on online marketing and printed brochures to show examples of their products or business offerings. Magazines use digital images to illustrate conceptual ideas where photography cannot successfully accomplish this task.
Film making. With the increase in special effects in movies continuing to push the threshold of where movie making can take us, often the only limit is the ability of the graphic digital artist to create realistic film elements.

,, They may be looking for employees to work on projects, and besides drawing a ""regular"" paycheck, you will get a feel for the actual work required to succeed in this media field.

Understand the field of sculpture, as it relates to art.",How to Become a Professional Artist4," There are, as in painting and digital imaging, many different venues for marketing your work or talents in sculpture. You will need to learn the techniques and develop your abilities to successfully plan and create sellable works of art in this field, just as you must in the previous media. Here are some examples of professional opportunities in sculpture:


Commissioned pieces. Here again is the old stand by, commissioned work. This is the backbone of sculpture art, since it often involves huge amounts of investment for materials, design and planning, and labor. You will find it very difficult to develop a portfolio of valid work in most disciplines of sculpture, with the exception of ceramics,or if you specialize in small pieces.
Craft type work. This may seem borderline to fine art, or even beyond the recognized borders of the fine art world, but craft shows and galleries all overspecialize in this low cost market. This would include pottery, woodcarving, and found item creations such as metal work. Here are some areas where sales potential exist for this field.

Craft shows. This is the obvious one, and with many communities celebrating various heritage festivals and events, the ""booth"" concept of art sales is becoming very rewarding to artists who are able to produce large quantities of reasonably priced works.
Juried shows. These are also becoming more common as ""craft arts"" are becoming more recognize as a legitimate form of art. Prize money from juries shows will not earn an artist a living, but will help him or her build a reputation and give them word of mouth advertising.

Teach.,
Make art a hobby.",How to Become a Professional Artist5," This is a word that ""self respecting"" artists hate to hear, but the reality is, many artists never find true success during their lifetimes, and many historical artists were penniless at the time of their passing.

, This too, may be insulting on the surface, but unless you have sales receipts or support of a generous foundation, you may find yourself working a day job, and creating your art as a hobby in your basement studio for years, before success finds you.

Look at your location with a critical eye.,
If your farm is not easily accessible, think about providing sales over the Internet.,
Examine how you are displaying your products.,
Create a theme for your shop and carry it through.,
Check your produce regularly, removing any spoiled food on a daily basis and only offering produce of a high standard.

,
Double the shopping experience, if you have the space, by selling arts and crafts along with your farm produce.,
Perhaps you could open up a small cafe for light refreshments, or provide luncheons,or you could sell herbs and plants as another line?,
What sets you apart from the thousands of farm shops in the country?,
Finally customer service is what it is all about.,
People like to feel that they are getting good value for money and are important to you as their customer.",How to Have a Successful Farm Shop," Location! Location! Location! With the ever-increasing costs of fuel, people are reluctant to travel long distances to buy farm produce because suddenly there is a painful deliberation, by the customer, of cost-effectiveness versus quality. Try to have your farm shop located near an area that will draw a lot of custom and provide parking facilities that are safe and secure.;
, There is a strong demand for vegetables and farm products to be delivered, either through mail order, or delivery van, especially if they have been organically grown and produced. Therefore, if the customers are not coming to you, think about going to the customer!

, Aesthetics plays a huge part in setting up your shop so that it is appealing to the eye and the senses. Display your products in woven baskets, for example, rather than in plastic crates.

, A country theme could be achieved very cheaply by using straw bales, old farming instruments, growing lavender in pots or tin buckets etc. Think about what you could do to ensure that when your customers visit your shop it is a pleasant experience that they would like to repeat.

,, There are many successful farm shops now that sell pottery, leather, paintings, wrought iron art, etc.

,


By diversifying what you offer, you are also increasing the chances of both sales and more visitors to your shop.

, Find your niche because the competition is fierce. Find something to sell that others don't to make you unique and to set you apart.

, If you have fulfilled all the above criteria, but still don't provide a cheerful smile when you serve your customers and are not prepared to go the extra mile, you will not get the return service that builds you a large customer base.

, This is where you can shine, and where supermarkets lose out, as there is no special relationship like you have the potential to capitalize on, and to edge them out of the competition.

Generate thorough descriptions and keywords.",How to Become a Stock Photographer," For stock photography, you should have a modern digital camera with a minimum of 12 megapixels. The settings should be manually adjustable.It should ideally be an “SLR” or “DSLR” camera, that is, a “digital single-lens reflex camera” that combines traditional optic lenses with a digital imaging sensor. The lenses are generally changeable in these cameras, giving you more control over your shots.
Keep in mind that the better your equipment, the less editing that you’ll have to do later. If your camera is not focusing or produces a lot of dust or noise, you’ll need to invest in a better one.;
, Having appropriate, high-quality lenses is key to taking crisp, high-quality stock photos. At the very least, you’ll want a wide-angle lens (for landscapes and large-scale subjects) and a telephoto lens (for close-ups, portraits, and everyday scenes).Cheap lenses use cheap glass that can easily distort your photos. Lenses play an even bigger role than your camera body in determining picture quality.

, A tripod is essential. If you’re not planning on relying on natural light, it’s also wise to get a reflector and a flash unit to fill in shadows., Stock photography needs to be professional-grade. Producing it requires a degree of training to know how to make the best use of your equipment.You don’t necessarily have to get a degree, but taking a course at a school, community center, or online is highly advisable. At the very least, you should be able to understand how to adjust your camera settings and accessories to get the composition and lighting that you want.

, You’ll need applications for editing and managing your photos. These can be combined into one program.The most common professional-grade photo-editing program is Adobe Photoshop. Other photo-management software includes Adobe Lightroom, ACDSee Pro, StudioLine Photo, and PhotoDirector. You’ll have to pay a one-time or monthly fee to use these apps.
There are also some free photo-editing apps available, like GIMP or Pixlr, but they won’t have all the functionality of licensed software.
Make sure that whichever program you choose has online storage and backup, so that you’re never at risk of losing your photo library if your computer crashes.

, Most apps will come with tutorials that you should take. There are also plenty of online webinars, tutorials, and courses that can get your skills up-to-snuff., Stock photos need to be extraordinary in their focus and crispness. The best way to ensure that you avoid shaking your camera and blurring your image is to use a tripod for photo shoots., Stock photos generally aren’t “snapshots.” They’re pictures that have been thoughtfully executed by trained photographers. Take time to get the lens, frame, lighting, and camera settings right., Be sure your camera is at it’s highest size setting when you take pictures, so that you’ll have the most pixels per inch possible.Most agencies require photos that are a minimum of 300dpi and can be enlarged to from 24-48MB without losing quality., Oftentimes, photos that look crisp at a lower resolution or compressed size can get blurry or distorted in parts at their full size. Carefully scan each picture at its full size to make sure that there are no imperfections in terms of lighting, focus, or other noise., You don’t want to add major stylized effects or filters to your photos, but you may want to make some adjustments to them to fix any imperfections or bring out their colors.For instance, you may want to straighten or crop the frame; adjust the contrast, highlights, or shadows; or correct the colors or boost their saturation.
If you notice any noise or dust, use the healing tool to retouch those areas. If there are too many blemishes, pick another photo.
Avoid making other editorial adjustments, like sharpening an image or putting a vignette effect around its edges. The people who purchase stock images should have as much control over the final editing as they can.

, While you can take a huge quantity of photos during a shoot, you’ll have to narrow the options down to just your highest quality pictures when it comes time to sell them. Stock agencies won’t take more than a few photos from each scene that you shoot. Pick two to three of the best pictures from each scene to add to your portfolio.Be sure that there’s some variation amongst the photos you select. For instance, they may be taken from a different angle, have a different frame, or include slightly different contents.

, The best way to do this is to look at what’s selling. You can gauge which subjects are the most commercially viable by checking out which photos are downloaded the most from stock agencies.For instance, you’re likely to notice that photos with people in them sell the best. If that’s the case, you might try capturing human scenes or taking portraits.

, There’s a lot of competition out there. Your photos are more likely to stand out and get traction if your portfolio addresses a specific niche that others may not cover.Your signature can be stylistic, such as images with the same clean studio background, or thematic, like food or aquatic scenes.
Sometimes agencies are looking to build out specific categories. It never hurts to check with them to see if there’s a niche you could fill.

, When people purchase stock photos, they’re buying a license to use them in a specific way. There are three major options for licensing your photos: public domain (PD), royalty-free (RF), and rights-managed (RM). Know the guidelines for each so that you can pick the designation that you want for your images.Note: you must be the creator and own the exclusive rights over an image in order to submit it as a stock photo.
Public domain photos can be used in any context free-of-charge. If you want to sell your photos, don’t designate them as public domain.
Agencies offer photos that are royalty-free or rights-reserved. (Often, they’ll be the one deciding the licensing conditions.) If your photos are royalty-free, customers will pay a one-time fee to use them as many times as they want within the permitted contexts. If your photos are rights-managed, buyers will have to pay a license fee and obey the conditions for each individual usage of them.
Keep in mind that you will get a much higher price for RM photos, but, their use will be exclusive, so there will be much fewer overall purchases.

, Lifestyle shots are very popular. However, if you use models, you will need to have them sign photo releases that authorizes you to sell images of them. Each stock agency has their own version of this form, or you can use a standard template.Here is a sample photo release form: https://www.inphilanthropy.org/sites/default/files/resources/Sample%20Photo%20Release%20Form.pdf


, Each agency will have its own protocol for doing this. Most of them will have a review process to vet your photos before they’ll offer them for sale.It’s best to go with a large, established agency, like Corbis, or one that you can see gets a lot of traffic, like Shutterstock or Alamy.
Before you upload any photos to an agency platform, make sure to check that their rates, pay schedules, and licensing policies work for you. For instance, many agencies, like Fotolia or iStock, only take royalty-free images.
You’ll also need to verify the file requirements and quality guidelines for each agency before your upload photos. Some agencies will specify the file type (like .JPEG) and minimum file size (like 24MB).
Don’t be surprised if you get rejections. Just submit those photos elsewhere, and try again with new photos.

, The best way for people to find your photos is through the text that you attach to them. Be thoughtful and comprehensive in how you describe and tag each image because these are ultimately your best marketing tools. The more keywords you use for a photo, the more likely people are to find it.Tags are keywords that help agencies categorize images and customers find the right photo. You want to focus on descriptive words over abstract concepts. For instance, if you have a photo of a leafless tree, you should tag it with “oak, tree, winter, dead tree,” but not with “mortality.”
Never include tags or keywords that don’t apply to your photo in an attempt to drive customers to your images. Besides annoying potential buyers, this may also get you kicked off of stock photography platforms altogether.
If you’re at a loss when it comes to tags, try an online generator, such as Keyword Tool or Ubersuggest, that can help you locate popular keywords.
Don’t include extraneous articles (like “the” or “an”) and conjunctions (like “and” or “but”) in your titles. Starting with an article will weaken your search results.
Don’t forget to use spell-check for your keywords and descriptions since misspellings will also negatively affect your search results.

Measure the wheat’s moisture level.,
Perform necessary maintenance on your combine to ensure optimum performance.,
Inspect the feeder house of the combine to ensure it is working properly.,
Inspect your equipment each time you use it.,
Adjust the combine header in relation to the height of the wheat for cutting.,
Adjust the reel speed relative to the ground speed so to not lose any wheat in the process.,
Set the rotor or cylinder speed to the minimum level for good threshing; this will minimize damage to seeds.,
Set the concave at the widest setting possible to help with separating.,
Adjust the cleaning shoe, consisting of the chaffer and cleaning sieve, so it is neither set too narrow or too wide.,
Set the fan.,
Be attentive to the conditions around you.,
When the combine is full, dump the grain to a truck using the combine's unloader.,
Clean your storage facility.,
Dry the wheat.,
Maintain a temperature of 5 C to 15 C where grain is stored.",How to Harvest Wheat," Moisture level will determine when wheat is ready to harvest. Wheat is harvested in the summer months, when planting has occurred in spring or winter. The moisture content of the wheat is the most critical factor for determining when your wheat is ready for harvest.


To measure moisture level, use a moisture meter. They are available at agricultural and farming stores.
Grain is ready to harvest between 20% and 14% moisture.;
, Use the owner's manual to be sure of your combine’s specific requirements.


Check the sickle to make sure it is sharp, for best performance.
Check height and contour controls of the headers.
Grease everything, in accordance with the manual, to ensure smooth operation. , It may seem durable, but it can break if not properly maintained.


Check the slats and chains and replace those that are broken, bent, or worn.
Examine the drive belt to ensure it is not cracking. Replace the belt if it is damaged. , Getting in the habit of checking your equipment will make you less likely to miss something.


Check air pressure in your combine’s tires at least once per week.
Remember to gas up your combine before heading out.
Check the oil and radiator levels often.Clean the machine of dust, debris, dirt and anything else that may cause problems during operation.
Remember to inspect your lights and flashers, especially if you will be traveling on public roads at any time., The header should be set to get the most wheat with the least amount of straw.


Try to ensure 8 to 12 inches of wheat stubble remains. This will help the soil keep its moisture.Be prepared to constantly adjust the height of the combine header as the height of the wheat in the field changes. The header height determines at what point the wheat is being cut, and will therefor have to vary with the height of the wheat.If you see that a lot of straw is being taken in, raise the header slightly.

, Going too fast will either knock the wheat down or cut it poorly. Going too slow can cause the wheat to fall to the ground or not enter the combine correctly.


Check behind the the combine to ensure you are not losing grain. If you are losing grain, you are likely going too slow relative to your reel speed.
Check your combine’s manual for optimal settings to reduce grain loss., This will need to be adjusted as the wheat crops change. This process is where the grain is separated from the straw.


Lower speeds will do less damage to the wheat.Finding proper cylinder speed will take some trial and error. Be prepared to adjust in the field., Setting the correct rotor or cylinder speed will also ensure no grain is lost through separation.


The concave clearance must be set in order that it does not crack the grain. This will depend on the particular crop. If the grain is cracking, widen the concave.The combine will automatically separate and take the grain to grain tank.

, Consult the owner's manual for manufacturer's settings.


Higher volumes of grain require a wider setting on the sieve. , Be sure it is not set too low, or else the wheat will never make it to the back of the chaffer for it to drop through. Setting the fan too high will blow the light wheat right out of the shoe altogether.


Fast fan speeds help clean wet chaff, but can cause you to lose grain at the same time.It is better to start the fan speed off high, and lower if necessary. , Successful harvest requires that you be aware of how the machine is interacting with the wheat. Be prepared to change settings, such as fan speed, as you go.


If a lot of wheat is on the ground as you go, it is a good sign that you need to adjust your settings. , Specific operation will depend on your combine model. Refer to the owners manual if unsure. You or someone else can drive the truck to your storage facility. There, he or she can empty the truck by dumping it onto a grain elevator, where it can be moved by conveyor belt to storage. It helps if you have a separate person driving the truck. The driver can take a shipment of grain back to he storage facility, while you going the harvest. This increases your efficiency.

, In order to help prevent your grain from spoiling, ensure that the storage area is clean. Clean your storage facility before and after each use.


Sweep away old or spoiled grain. This will help prevent disease and pests from spreading.
Spray insecticide inside and outside of bins. Use only approved pesticides; check local regulations., You will need to dry your grain after the harvest to ensure it can be safely stored.


Air drying leads to the highest quality wheat.
You dry the wheat in bins, but be sure not to fill the bins completely.Dry wheat at no more than 60 C. , The higher the temperature, the faster the grain will spoil.


For high moisture grain, aerate in order to cool the grain quickly.Monitor the temperature and moisture using a thermometer and moisture meter to ensure proper levels are maintained.

Earn a degree in graphic design.,
Inquire about job placement through your college’s career counseling office.,
Find an apprenticeship.,
Learn about the different methods used when you become a printer.,
Receive training on printing industry software programs.,
Advance to better career opportunities.",How to Become a Printer," When you are printer, you will need to have the ability to deal well with clients and have the ability to market your printing products. Printers also need to feel comfortable around computer hardware, software and printing equipment.;
, Many printers will go to a 4-year university or attend a technical college in order to earn a bachelor’s or associate’s degree in graphic design. Other majors pursued by future printers include graphic arts and printing technologies.

, Before you attempt to search for a post-collegiate job, see if your school can offer assistance. Many colleges hold career fairs and other events to help you find a job as a printer.

, An apprenticeship allows you to work underneath a master printer in order to learn the trade. You will not likely get paid much and sometimes not at all, but it will help you garner experience in the printing industry. To find apprenticeships, scour newspapers and online classified ads.

, Some methods that may be employed by a printer include monotype, dry point and etching. The more methods you know how to employ, the larger your customer base will likely be.

, Most likely, you will have studied different printing programs during college. However, if you have not, you should take extra courses to learn the basics of popular software used for desktop publishing. These applications include Creative Suite, Quark, InDesign and PhotoShop. You can learn the programs through your apprenticeship or study them through online tutorials.

, Once you have completed your apprenticeship, you can branch out as an independent printer. You can possibly secure a position with the printer you have worked under, find a new printing company to work for or open your own printing company. Besides classifieds, you can look for printing job openings by joining a print industry union or organization.

Dispose of the excess leaves.,
Make sure the roots are protected.,
Harvest sugar cane at the right time.,
Observe the shoots to make sure they're ready to harvest.,
Make sure you harvest sugar cane before frost sets in.,
Check regulations if you plan to burn excess leaves.",How to Harvest Sugar Cane," Before cutting sugar cane, you'll need a blade. Sugar cane is strong, so a sharp cutting blade is necessary to trim the crop.A sharp knife or a hand axe is sharp enough to harvest sugar cane. However, due to their small size, they may not trim sugar cane as fast as other options.
A large cutting blade, which you can purchase at a local hardware store, is probably your best choice. While it can be large and somewhat difficult to handle, it can most efficiently cut down sugar cane.
If you're not used to handling large objects, however, you may want to stick to something smaller over a cutting blade. You do not want to risk hurting yourself when harvesting sugar cane.;
, Sugar cane must be trimmed close to the ground. You'll want to cut down the entire shoot for harvest.Cut the blade close to the ground. If using a knife or hatchet, you may have to crouch down near the root to cut the sugar cane. Do not make hacking motions when cutting. Gently saw at the sugar cane instead.
While you should cut close to the ground, do not cut into the root. Make sure to cut above the ground without sawing into the ground or dirt below the sugar cane plant.

, As you cut your shoots, make sure to store them safely. You should have something like a wheel barrow or other transportation device nearby. As you cut, place the severed shoots in this device.While harvesting, it is okay to stack your sugar cane shoots on top of each other., You really only need the green shoot portion of the sugar cane. After cutting down your leaves, you should strip the cane of any excess leaves or other foliage.Sugar cane plants may have small leaves growing off the sides. These should be removed after you harvest the sugar cane.
You may be able to remove some leaves with your hands. If leaves are tough to remove, use a blade. It's a good idea to use a smaller blade, like a knife, over a large cutting blade as you'll end up having more control.

, Once you've cut down the shoots and trimmed off excess leaves, you can cut the shoots into manageable chunks. Sugar cane plants are tall, growing up to 10 feet.In order to transport sugar cane, you should saw down the shoots into smaller portions. Cut the cane down into small enough portions that you can transport it easily using your chosen transportation device., After harvesting sugar cane, you'll be left with excess leaves from the shoots. You should dispose of these properly. You can transport them to a local dump or place them in a dumpster near you. In some areas, excess leaves are burned in a controlled fire after harvest.You can also lay the leftover leaves over the roots. This forms a mulch that keeps the roots safe from moisture, prevents soil erosions, and stops weeds from growing over your sugar cane., Once you've finished harvesting sugar cane, you want to make sure the leftover roots are protected. This will assure a quality sugar cane crop will grow the following year. You can throw excess leaves over the stumps or add a layer of straw to the ground.This is especially important if you harvested your crops near wintertime. Roots need protection from the coming frost and cold in order to thrive.

, You want to make sure you harvest sugar cane during the right times of year. During certain periods, sugar cane is more likely to be strong and ready to harvest. For best results, you should hold off on harvesting your sugar cane until late fall. At this point, the shoots should be tall and strong enough to cut down., Some shoots may take longer to grow than others. Starting in early fall, observe the shoots. Hold off on harvesting until they all display signs they're healthy and ready to trim.Check the leaves. Leaves that appear yellowish and slightly dry are ready to harvest.
Tap the cane with your hand. It should make a metallic sound if it's ready to harvest.
If you're still unsure, make a small sideways cut in the cane. Turn the cut towards the sun. The inside of the plant should glisten slightly if it's ready to harvest.

, Do not wait too late in fall to harvest sugar cane. If you harvest the plant after frost has set in, a lot of the plant will have spoiled. Make sure you watch the weather forecast and get to harvesting the crop before the first snow or below freezing temperature of the year., If you plan on burning sugar cane leaves after harvest, check regulations in your area. Not all states will allow you to burn plants on your property. You can check with your local Department of Natural Resources to see if it's legal to burn excess leaves in your area. If there are regulations forbidding this, you should find another way to dispose of excess leaves.

Give the radishes time to mature.,
Check the roots.,
Pull each radish straight out of the ground.Harvesting a radish is fairly easy.,
Cut off and save the greens.Trim the greens off the top of each radish using kitchen shears or a sharp knife.,
Wash and store in the refrigerator.,
Choose which radish plants will go to seed.,
Leave the selected radish plants alone.,
Collect the seedpods.,
Enjoy the seedpods now, if desired.,
Dry the seedpods if you plant to harvest the seeds.,
Open the seedpods.,
Store the seeds.",How to Harvest Radishes," Many varieties mature quickly, only needing as few as three weeks before they are ready to harvest and eat. Allow the radishes in your garden to mature, but once they mature, harvest them quickly.


Spring radishes mature quickly and tend to degrade quickly if left in the ground for a few days longer than necessary. Winter radishes can be neglected a little more since they take longer to mature and longer to spoil in the ground.
Winter radishes generally maintain their quality throughout cool fall weather. Some varieties can even be kept in the garden underneath a layer of heavy straw mulch throughout the winter.While each variety matures at its own pace, on the whole, spring radishes mature in 20 to 30 days and winter radishes mature in 50 to 60 days.Once a radish spoils in the ground, it will develop a spongy, unappetizing texture and hot taste.;
, The roots of a mature radish are roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) in length, if not a little less. Gently scrape away a little soil just above the roots, next to the greens poking out from the soil, to check on the size.


You can scrape away the soil with your fingers or with a small garden trowel.
Radishes with roots that are 1 inch (2.5 cm) should be harvested. If you spot roots that are far too small, recover them with soil and let the radishes continue to grow until mature.
Since spring radishes mature so quickly, you should start checking the roots frequently as they approach maturity.
If you plan to harvest your winter radishes in the fall, do so just before the ground freezes.If you want to try saving them over the winter, cover them with heavy straw much and harvest them before they show signs of new growth in late winter or early spring.

, To remove it from the ground, grab the radish at the base of its greens and pull straight up. You may need to gently wiggle it to loosen it from its place in the soil at first, but most radishes will come out with little more than upward force.


It is important that you harvest the radishes as soon as they are mature, even if you do not plan to eat them immediately. They will last longer in your refrigerator than they will underground.
If your radish crop has been thinned out enough, you should be able to harvest one without disturbing the roots of any neighboring radishes. This can be important since some radishes can be ready for harvest before others.

, If desired, these greens can be cleaned in cool, running water and saved for culinary purposes.


If you plan to save the greens, clean them in running water and scrub away any visible dirt using your fingers. Pat dry with clean paper towels when done.
Place clean, dry greens in a resealable plastic bag. Close the bag and store them in the refrigerator for as many as three days.
Radish greens can be added to salads or other dishes that make use of leafy green vegetables.
If you do not plan to save the radish greens, you may discard them without taking any precautionary measures.

, Once the greens have been trimmed short on each radish, you can clean the radish itself under cool, running water. Place clean radishes in airtight, resealable plastic bags and refrigerate them until ready to use for up to two weeks.


You can scrub off the majority of the soil and debris using your fingers, but for stubborn, embedded dirt, use a vegetable brush to gently scrub the side of the radish as you rinse it under water.
Make sure that the radishes have been thoroughly dried with clean paper towels before you store them.
Place the radishes in the crisper drawer if your refrigerator has one. This space will maintain ideal temperature and humidity conditions, thereby preserving the radishes longer.

, Once a radish goes to seed, it will no longer be any good to eat. As a result, you should set aside a few radishes in your garden with the specific intent of allowing those plants to go to seed.


Of course, any radishes that you accidentally leave in the ground past maturity can be kept in the ground and used for seeds. It is helpful to designate a few radish plants with that purpose ahead of time, but that does not mean your radish seed yield must only be limited to those plants.

, Continue caring for the seed radishes as you always have, but otherwise, do not disturb them. It may take another couple of weeks past the mature stage before radishes develop flower buds and, eventually, seedpods.


As the seed radishes continue to grow past maturity, they will send up one or two stems that will not have leaves. Once these stems grow long and strong enough, they will sprout small buds. From these buds, seed pods will quickly emerge. The seed pods will grow, taking on a long, pointed shape.

, Use sharp kitchen or garden shears to snip the seedpods off the plant once the buds drop off completely.


If you only want to harvest the seeds to use for next season's crop and nothing more, you might want to consider waiting until the seedpods start turning yellow and dry on the plant before you pluck them. Waiting will make it easier for you to actually harvest the seedpods off the plant, and you can probably do so with your bare hands.

, You can wash fresh radish seedpods and toss them into a salad if you so choose. The seedpods themselves are edible and similar in appearance and texture to snap pea pods. They can be added to salads or enjoyed raw and on their own.


Radish seeds can also be sprouted while still fresh. To do this, you will need to open the seedpods before they dry out. Collect the seeds and sprout them as though you were sprouting beans.

, If you want to harvest the seeds for future use, hang the seedpods in a dry location and allow them to dry out until they turn a light tan color.Of course, if you allowed the seedpods to dry while on the plant, you can skip this step and move onto the next since they will already be adequately dry without waiting any longer.

, By this point, the seedpods are brittle enough for you to open without the assistance of any special utensils. Use your thumbnail to slice into each seedpod, opening it up. Gently scrape out the seeds inside using your fingers.


Line your work area with clean paper towels to help catch any seeds that fly out as you open the seedpods.
The seeds should be a nice brown color when they are dry enough. They should be dry once you open the seedpods, but if the seeds are still only a light tan color, they will need to be dried further. Dry the seeds by spreading them out in a single layer on your paper towels and placing them in a warm, sunny location. They should be ready within a day.
An alternate option is to leave the seeds in the dried pods and open them in the same manner just before you are ready to plant them. Doing so can take up more storage space, however, but the seeds will be better protected in the long run

, If the seeds are not completely dry, allow them to dry out further before you save them. After they dry, place them inside a small envelop or airtight jar and save until you are ready to plant them.


The best container to use is a small paper envelop. The envelop should be small, but still large enough to hold all the seeds with a little extra space left over. Make sure that the envelop is sealed tightly and securely after the seeds are inside.
Any container you use should be labeled with the contents and the current date.

Pour some grass and/or legume seeds into a bucket.,
Enter the pasture where the cows are grazing.,
Do this for each pasture, when the cows are grazing in that area.",How to Hand Seed Cattle Pastures," Grass and legume seeds would be of any species you've chosen to seed your pastures with, depending on your location. Put as much in as you can comfortably carry, depending on how far you have to carry it or how big of an area you want to seed at one time.;
, Move quietly and calmly among them, taking your time to gently scatter the seeds around their feet and over the whole area of the pasture.


The cows will push the seed into the soil with their hooves and naturally fertilize the area with the waste they excrete.

,


Pay special attention to areas that suffer from high traffic areas, such as near and around watering areas, gates, etc.

Please note that you may find that growing grass in this area will be much more difficult because these areas see a lot of hoof traffic, much more than out in the pasture. This could make it harder for the seeds to grow properly into grass or legume plants.

Purchase rice seeds from any gardening or farmers supply store.,
Choose your planting location.,
Gather at least 1 to 2 ounces (28.5 to 56.5 g) of rice seeds to sow.,
Plant the rice seeds throughout the soil, during the fall or spring season.,
Fill the buckets or the garden space with at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water.,
Observe the water levels of the planting area, keeping the soil constantly wet.,
Thin, or space out, the rice seeds to prevent crowding.,
Wait for the rice grains to mature.,
Cut the stalks and let them dry.,
Bake them at 180°F (82°C) for an hour.,
Separate the kernels from the hulls.",How to Grow Rice," You may also buy rice seeds from a reputable supply store or seek help from the local agriculture field officer. There are five basic types of rice to choose from:Long-grain. This type of rice produces grains that are light and fluffy. It tends to be a bit drier than other varieties.

Medium-grain. This type is moist, tender, slightly sticky, and a little creamy when cooked. It has the same texture as long-grain.

Short-grain. When cooked, short-grain rice becomes soft and sticky. It's also a little more sweet – this is the rice to use with sushi.

Sweet. This rice is sometimes called sticky rice, and is gooey when cooked. It’s often used for frozen products.

Aromatic. This type of rice has more flavor and fragrance than other varieties. This category includes Basmati, Jasmine, Red, and Black japonica.

Arborio. This type becomes creamy with a chewy center after cooking. It’s used primarily for risotto and other Italian dishes.;
, Make sure the soil in the area you're planting consists of slightly acidic clay for the best results. You may also plant your rice seeds in plastic buckets with the same type of soil. Wherever you plant, make sure you have a reliable water source and a way to drain that water when you need to harvest.


Pick a location that receives full sunlight, as rice grows best with bright light and warm temperatures of at least 70° Fahrenheit (approximately 21° Celsius).
Consider the season – your area needs to allow for 3 to 6 months of plant and flower growth. Rice needs a long, warm growing season, so a climate like the southern United States is best. If you don't have long periods of warmth, it may be best growing your rice inside., Soak the seeds in water to prep them for planting. Allow them to soak for at least 12 hours but not longer than 36 hours. Remove the seeds from the water afterward.


While your seeds are soaking, plan out where and how you want to plant them. Most prefer to plant the seeds in rows to make it easier to water and weed. Consider building trenches and blocking the ends so the water stays contained and dammed (berms can be used as well). That being said, the area doesn't need to stay flooded per se, it just needs to stay wet.

, Get rid of the weeds, till the beds, and level the soil. If you are using buckets, fill them with at least 6 inches (15 cm) of moist soil. Then add the rice seeds.


Keep in mind that the area needs to be flooded with water. It's much easier to flood a few smaller spaces than one larger one. If you're planting outside, using several seed beds will be easier to manage and maintain.
If you plant in the fall, be sure to de-weed come spring. The rice seeds need all the nutrients and space they can get.

, However, this is just an old school recommendation. Plenty of people say that keeping the soil consistently moist is plenty – it doesn't necessarily need to be flooded.This stage is up to you – just make sure it's wet.


Add compost or mulch to the soil, slightly covering the rice grains. This will automatically tamp the seeds down into the soil. Organic compost holds moisture, so this is a good plan – especially in drier climes.

, If you'd like, maintain 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water for the rice to grow. At least make sure the soil is consistently wet, if not flooded. Expect to see shoots from the grains grow after about 1 week.


If your plants are in buckets, you may want to consider moving them at night (when it gets cooler) to a warmer spot. Rice thrive in warmth, and if the temperature dips, you'll likely see stunted growth.
To emphasize that flooding policies differentiate from person to person, commercial rice-producing agencies sometimes flood up to eight inches.You may wish to up the water as your plants climb to the 7 inch mark. What you practice is up to you., For best results, thin out the seedlings no more than 4 inches (10.2 cm) apart in rows that range between 9 to 12 inches (22.9 to 30.5 cm) apart. Allow the seeds to grow up to 7 inches (17.8 cm) tall, which takes on average of about one month.


Some people choose to start their plants off in a nursery bed since movement is always a part of the process anyway. If you follow this practice, transplant them when they reach 5-7 inches in height. They should be planted about a foot apart into a muddy bed.

, This will take approximately 3 or 4 months; during this time, they can reach up to 17 inches tall.Let the water dry out or drain any excess water before removing the rice for harvesting. Over the course of the next two weeks, they'll turn green to gold – that's when you know they're ready.


If you're farming your rice, you may wish to drain the soil when the plants are about 15 inches (37.5 cm) tall, flood, and then drain again.After that, continue as above, allowing the rice to dry and turn golden.

, When the rice has turned gold (about 2 weeks or so after draining), they're ready. Cut the stalks just under the heads, where the rice grains are placed. You'll see little pockets at the top of the stalk that are unmistakably the hulls of the rice.


Let them dry for 2-3 weeks. With the stalks cut, wrap them in newspaper and keep them in a dry, sunny place for 2-3 weeks. The moisture needs to fully dry out for you to get at the grains cleanly.

, Take the heads and pop 'em in the oven for roasting.It shouldn't be too hot or the grains will burn. During this time, they should turn a darker shade of golden brown.

, After that time is up, let them cool. Then rub them with your hands (or use a mortar and pestle) to separate the kernels from the hulls.Now you're dealing with rice grains you'll actually recognize. This will leave you with grains of rice that are ready for cooking and consumption.


For the record, this last bit can be quite tedious – after a handful or two, you'll be glad for modern technology. Be patient – you're doing it right, it just takes a while. When you're done, you'll be left with an amazing store of food you produced all by yourself.

Understand what crop rotation is.,
Select your crop varieties.,
Make a long range rotation plan.,
Implement your rotation plan.,
Take notes of benefits you experience, or problems that occur using your rotation plan.,
Work with neighboring growers to increase the benefits of your rotation.,
Use crop adjustment as you realise the benefits of your rotation plan.,
Understand that crop rotation alone can contribute to increased production and pest and weed reduction, but other factors may contribute to your success (or failure), particularly weather.",How to Get Started in Crop Rotation," This farming method uses the practice of planting different plant varieties in a location in subsequent growing seasons to do obtain the following benefits:


Increased yields. Because one plant will require different nutrients and support different destructive organisms, by planting a different crop in subsequent seasons, the nutrients taken from the soil can be replaced and the destructive organisms can be reduced. An example is planting corn and beans in rotation. Corn requires a lot of nitrogen to offer a good yield, and has specific pests and diseases, like corn earworms, corn blight, among others. By planting beans in rotation, the legume (beans), fix additional nitrogen in the soil, and during the bean growing season, corn pests and diseases have no plants to reproduce or replenish themselves in, so they die off or decrease.
Soil erosion prevention. Row crops (plants placed in rows spaced apart, with bare soil ""middles"" or areas between the rows, allow more erosion than crops usually planted by ""broadcast"" methods, or in a close-spaced ""drill"". By rotating a broadcast or close spaced seed crop like grains, the erosion problem does not occur continuously, and the straw and waste from the grain crop acts to stabilize the soil when the land is tilled between crops.
Reduction of pesticide usage. By reducing pest populations in a specific plot of ground or field by eliminating plants they depend on for continuing their life cycle, you can reduce the overall population of these pests that occur during the season you grow these plants. Having a reduced population will then reduce your dependency on pesticides to control them.
Reduction in labor. If you grow a very large crop of a labor intensive plant, you will be required to invest sufficient labor to manage the production and harvest of the crop yield. As example, 10 acres of cotton might require 4,000 man hours to till, plant, and harvest, but by splitting the crop, and planting 5 acres of cotton and 5 acres of a less labor intensive crop like hay, grain, or vegetable row crops, you spread out the most intensive labor period, and reduce the overall labor requirements for an individual growing season.
Increase profits. By limiting the total aggregate acreage of any one crop, the local demand may increase, which in turn raises the price of the plant product.;
, This article cannot cover all the possibilities, so you will have to research your local crop choices. Generally, the following guidelines should be considered.


Rotate grains with solid seed and row crops. An example would be Wheat, season 1, Legumes, season 2, Oil seed crops (corn, sunflowers, flax) season 3, wheat season 4, Legumes, season 5, etc). You should see the pattern here. With the legumes planted only on each 3rd planting season, the pests that favor this type plant will have two growing seasons where it is not present to encourage these pests to multiply.
Rotate different grains. Planting barley one season, and wheat the next will inhibit the continuing increase in plant specific pathogenic organisms. Root rot fungi that attack wheat are often specific to this one grain, and so, the barley season will interrupt the life cycle of this organism.
Seed crop, fallow rotation. This method is best if there is sufficient land to allow laying a portion fallow (barren) for a season. It will allow you to control ""noxious plants"" (weeds), while allowing non-invasive or non-damaging plants to grow which in turn are tilled into the soil to build up the organic matter therein, increasing the soil's fertility.

, You will need to determine the goals you hope to achieve by implementing crop rotation, then plan specific crops which will help you to realize them. Next, you will need to create a planting schedule, so that you will be prepared to act on your plan. If you save your seed from crop year to crop year, you will have to protect seed from one crop year to the next year you plant that crop, or have an outside source of fresh, viable seed available. Some seeds can be stored for many years with little reduction in germination, but special care must be taken to protect any seed for future use.

, Begin planting your crop in the rotation order you have chosen.

, If you find that yield is reduced by planting a specific crop ""behind"" (in a subsequent planting season) another, you may have to modify the order of your crop selection to minimize the loss of productivity. This might mean adding another neutral impact plant between the two previous crops, that off sets the condition which causes the decrease in the crop previously noted.

, If you rotate your crop to decrease specific pests such as corn earworms, you will see little benefit if adjoining fields grow corn during your ""no-corn"" season, since the moth which is the adult stage of the corn earworm can migrate to your crop the following year.

, If your rotation strategy increases the yield of a particular crop, you may then choose to store (if possible) the surplus, so that you can reduce the overall acreage dedicated to this one plant crop, allowing you to increase the number of different crops you select. You may find for specific applications such as growing for personal use that you can decrease the total crop acreage to the point where you may place unneeded crop land into pasture and begin a modest animal production operation, or allow environmentally delicate areas to return to their natural state.

, Dry years typically decrease production, and warm winters in non-tropical areas can allow more pests to ""overwinter"", allowing larger populations to occur in spite of your control efforts.

Know the benefits of starting a peanut plant indoors.,
Pick out good seed peanuts.,
Fill a clean container with moist potting soil.,
Place a few seed peanuts on top of the soil and cover.,
Choose a sunny location.,
Wait until after the last frost passes.,
Improve the soil quality, if necessary.,
Dig deep into the soil.,
Plant the seedlings 10 inches (25 cm) apart.,
Water the soil well.,
Loosen the soil after a few weeks.Once your plants reach a height of 6 inches (15.24 cm), you should lightly and carefully dig around the base of each plant to loosen the soil.,
Hill the soil around the base of the plant later on.,
Lay down a light mulch.,
Water regularly.,
Avoid fertilizers with high levels of nitrogen.,
Protect your plants with mesh fencing.,
Use insecticide only as needed.,
Dig out the entire plant with a spading fork.,
Dry the plant out.,
Roast or store the plants as desired.",How to Grow Peanuts," Peanuts have a long growing season and require 100 to 130 frost-free days to reach maturity.


If you live in a cooler, Northern region, you should start the plants indoors roughly one month before the last anticipated frost.If you live in a warmer, Southern region, you can either plant the peanuts directly outdoors after the last frost or start them indoors a few weeks prior to the last frost.;
, You can plant raw peanuts purchased at the grocery store, but you might find it easier to grow peanuts if you start with seed peanuts purchased from a gardening store.


Note that peanuts used as seeds must remain in their shells until just before planting. Otherwise, they will dry out too quickly and will fail to produce.
Never use roasted peanuts. These will not germinate.

, Use a bowl or starter pot roughly 4 inches (10 cm) deep and fill it about 2/3 full with potting soil.If the soil is not already damp, moisten it with a watering can now, before you add the seed peanuts.
The safest container to use would be a paper or peat pot since you can place the entire seedling, pot and all, into the ground when transplanting. You could use a plastic bowl or pot if that is your only alternative, though.
Make sure that container is clean before you plant the peanuts, especially if you are using a plastic container. Wash it with warm water and soap, rinse well, and dry with clean paper towels.

, Arrange four peanuts, with their shells removed, equidistant from each other on top of the soil, pressing them gently into the soil. Cover with roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of loose, moist soil.


When shelling the peanuts, make sure that you do not remove the brown paper coating surrounding each nut seed. If you remove this or damage it, the peanuts may not germinate.
You could plant the peanuts without removing the shell first, but they will grow quicker if you do remove the shell.
If the soil is not moist when you add it, lightly water it with a watering can or spray bottle until it is moist to the touch but not soaked.
If planting the seeds directly outside, plant them 2 inches (5 cm) deep and 8 inches (20 cm) apart.

, Peanut plants require full sun in order to grow properly.


Sun is important for the sake of photosynthesis, but full sun is advised because areas that receive full sun are likely to be the warmest in your garden. Peanut plants thrive in warm soil.

, Peanuts are fairly sensitive to frosts, so you should wait at least two to three weeks after the last suspected frost before you transplant any seedlings started indoors an outdoor garden.


The same guideline applies if you are planting seed peanuts directly into an outdoor plot. Wait several weeks after the last frost passes. Otherwise, the seed peanuts will not germinate.
The temperature of the soil should be about 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 degrees Celsius), at minimum., The plant bed should be composed of loose, well-drained soil. If your soil is too heavy, you should add a few handfuls of sand to the soil to improve the quality and make it less dense. Dig and mix the sand in with a small trowel.


Avoid clay-type soils, which are hard to improve sufficiently.
You could use aged compost, as well, but you should limit the amount you use since it could give off nitrogen. This would be beneficial for many plants, but peanuts produce their own nitrogen, and adding more can be too much and ultimately stunt the growth of the plant.
You may also need to balance the soil pH if it is too acidic. Do so by adding a small amount of agricultural lime to the soil and mixing it in thoroughly.

, Dig at least 6 inches (15.24 cm) down into the soil, even if the plant is not yet that deep.


The roots need plenty of room to spread out. Digging into the soil helps to break up any compact areas, ultimately making it looser, and providing the roots the space they need.
After digging into the soil, fill in the bottom of each hole with 2 inches (5 cm) or so of the loose soil. Otherwise, you may accidentally plant the seedling too deep.

, The stem and leaf portions should be above the ground, but the root system should be completely below ground.


Fill in the rest of the hole gently with loose soil.
If using a decomposable planter, place the entire thing in the ground. If not, gently squeeze the sides of you container to loosen its contents. Tip the container so that the plant, roots, and soil come out in a clump in your hands. Transfer the entire clump to the outdoor plot.
Avoid exposing the sensitive roots.
If you planted the seed peanuts directly outdoors, you may decide to plant 2 to 3 seeds at each spot initially. You will need to thin the plants out, though, leaving only the strongest one at each spot.

, Use a gentle hose or watering can to moisten the soil so that it feels moist when you touch the surface.


Note, however, that the soil should not be soaking wet. If puddles are forming on the surface of the plot, you may have added too much water.

,


The plant will develop runners as it grows, and each of these runners will develop blossoms. The flowers will wilt and bend down, but you should not pick them off.
These downward stems are called ""pegs."" Your peanuts will grow off of these pegs, and the stems need to find their way underground in order to grow those peanuts.
By making the soil looser, you make it easier for the pegs to get underground.

, After the pegs have found their way underground and the plants themselves are about 12 inches (30.5 cm) tall, you should gently form the soil into small hills around each buried peg and around the base of the plant.


Doing this provides extra warmth and protection for the peanuts growing on the ends of the buried pegs.

, Spread out 2 inches (5 cm) of straw or grass clippings over the area immediately after creating the hills.


Mulch prevents most weeds from coming up.
Additionally, it also keeps the soil warm, moist, and soft.
Do not use heavy mulches like wood chips, though. Additional pegs may need to break through the soil, and they will not be able to do so with heavy mulches in the way.

, Use a watering can or garden hose with a gentle spray setting to provide the plants with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water each week.


Ideally, peanuts should be given a little water at a time. They do best when the soil is slightly dry on the surface but moist at about 1 inch (2.5 cm) down. This can be determined by sticking your fingertip into the soil and noting how much of your finger you can insert into the soil before you feel moisture.

, Fertilizers are not usually necessary to begin with when growing peanuts, but if you do opt to use a fertilizer, make sure that it does not contain large amounts of nitrogen.


Peanuts supply their own nitrogen. Adding more nitrogen to this will produce very bushy plants with thick foliage and little fruit yield.
Once the plants begin to flower, you can begin treating them with a fertilizer rich in calcium. Doing so may help maximize nut formation.

, The biggest threat to your peanut plants are squirrels, chipmunks, and other small critters looking for a free feast. Placing mesh fencing around your plants is a simple, sure way to keep these uninvited dinner guests out of your crop.


Push the fencing 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) below the ground to protect the peanuts as they grow underneath. Many mice and squirrels will try to dig the plants up after nuts begin forming, and if the netting does not extend below ground, they may succeed.

, Peanut plants are not usually victims when it comes to pests of the insect variety. Some insects do occasionally make themselves a nuisance, though, including cutworms, cucumber beetles, and aphids. These insects usually attack by eating the plants.


Spray the leaves with a pyrethrin-based pesticide for best results.
If you want to stick to something organic, sprinkle ground red pepper on the leaves, instead.

, You should harvest the peanuts before the first frost of fall occurs, since peanuts at this stage are still sensitive to frost attacks.


The plant will turn yellow and begin to wilt when it is ready to be harvested.
Gently dig up the entire plant with your gardening fork, lifting it up from beneath the roots. Shake off most of the soil clinging to the roots.
A healthy plant will usually yield about 30 to 50 peanuts.

, Hang the plant indoors in a dry location for about a month.


For the first one to two weeks, let the peanuts cure on the plant as they are in a warm, dry spot.
For the remaining two weeks or so, pull the nuts off and let them dry in the same warm, dry spot.

, You can enjoy the peanuts raw or roasted, or you can save them for later.


To roast peanuts, bake them in an oven set at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) for 20 minutes.
To store peanuts, leave them in their shells and place them in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to 6 months.
If you cannot refrigerate your peanuts, they can stay good for 3 months in a dry, dark storage area.
Peanuts can also be frozen for a year or longer.

"
Collect canes during the dormant stage.The best time to collect scion wood is during the middle of winter, usually during January or February.,
Choose healthy plants.,
Cut long enough canes.,
Store the scion wood canes in moist, cool conditions.",How to Graft Grape Vine1,"



Scion wood refers to smaller, younger shoot systems that you graft onto older vines. In contrast, the stock or rootstock is the mature vine growing in the ground that the scion is grafted onto.
Wait until well after a major freeze occurs. Doing so reduces the risk of accidentally damaging the fresh shoots.

, You should only take scion wood from healthy, established vines that show no sign of disease, injury, or other stress.


For best results, you should also look for canes that have received plenty of sunlight. Avoid canes that grew primarily in shade.

, The canes you cut for use as scion wood can range in length from 4 inches (10 cm) to 2 feet (0.61 m) (61 cm). Each cane of scion wood should have at least two buds, if not more.


For longer scion wood, make sure that the canes you cut have buds in multiples of two (two, four, six, eight, etc.).
Select round canes that are 5/16 inches (7.9 mm) to 9/16 inches (14.3 mm) in diameter.
Use a sharp blade to make a flat cut on the bottom of the cane and an angled cut on the top of the cane. Make sure that there is excess stem extending beyond the buds on either end, too.

, Wrap the scion wood in moist newspaper and place the bundles in a plastic bag. Seal the bags and keep them in a cellar or similar area that consistently remains at temperatures just above freezing.


It's best to bundle scion wood in groups of 100, but smaller groups can work if necessary.
Ideal temperatures range between 34 and 36 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 and 2.2 degrees Celsius).
Remove the scion wood from storage a full day before you intend to graft the vines. Allow them to sit out and gradually reach the current outdoor temperature.

"
"
Cut the top of the vine.,
Split the stock.,
Taper the scions.,
Place the scions in the split.,
Seal the split.",How to Graft Grape Vine2," Select a fairly large stock vine and saw off the top roughly 30 minutes before you intend to graft the scions.


Note that this is the simplest grafting method to use and generally produces good results.
You should cut the top based on the desired head height of the grafted vine. Make the cut at a clean, unblemished portion of the vine and cut until the height of the rootstock is roughly 4 inches (10 cm) shorter than your final desired head height.;
, Use a cold chisel or similar splitting blade to split the rootstock down the center of its top surface.


This split needs to be at least 2 inches (4 cm) deep.
Hold this split open while you prepare the scions by keeping the chisel inside.

, Select two dormant scions and taper the bottoms into a ""v"" shape using a sharp, clean blade.Make straight, even cuts that taper down from the lowest bud to the bottom of the scion. The tapered edge should be about 2 inches (4 cm), or about as long as the rootstock split is deep.
Note that the outer edge of the scion is usually a little wider than the inner edge. Cutting the wood in this way makes it easier for the scion to come into contact with the correct part of the rootstock.
The bottom of the taper should be about 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) wide.

, Wedge the tapered bottom of one scion into one side of the rootstock split. Wedge the other scion into the other side of the split.


Remove the chisel before fitting the scions. If necessary, use a large, flat screwdriver to hold one side of the split open as you wedge a scion inside.
Push the scions down until the cambium layers of the scions and rootstock meet. The cambium is the single layer of active plant cells located just beneath the bark. The connection between the two separate vines will establish itself at this level.

, Wrap the sides of the split with rubber bands or tape. Apply grafting compound to the entire exposed split.


Sealing the split seals existing moisture in and keeps excess moisture out.
Apply the grafting compound very generously using a wide, stiff paintbrush.
For extra protection, you may even wish to apply interior latex paint over the dried grafting compound.

"
"
Remove the top of the vine.,
Cut a pattern into the basal end of the scion.,
Make a matching cut in the stock.,
Insert the scion into the cut.,
Seal the grafted area.",How to Graft Grape Vine3," Choose a vine with slipping bark, then cut away the top of the vine with a saw.


This method is also among the simplest grafting methods for grape vines, but it tends to be slightly less particular and slightly less successful than cleft grafting.
Bark slipping occurs when the bark actually begins to separate and peel away from the wood of the vine. Ideally, you should wait until all of the bark on a vine begins to split before trying to use this grafting method.
You only need to cut 4 inches (10 cm) or so from the top of the vine. You can cut more if you desire a shorter head height, though.

, Select a dormant scion and slice off a portion of bark and wood along the bottom half of the shoot using a sharp, clean blade.


This cut should be about 2 inches (4 cm) long and should be straight yet slanted. For best results, position this cut on the opposite side of the bud.Make a secondary cut on the opposite (bud) side of the scion. This cut should be similar in shape but only one-third the length of the primary cut.

, Use the same blade to cut into the side of the rootstock, near the cut top. The portion you cut away should match the shape and size of the portion removed from the scion.


Remove the loose outer bark from the intended grafting location.
Hold the cut edge of the scion against the intended grafting location on the stock. Cut a slit into the bark on both sides. The slit should be as wide as the diameter of the scion and as deep as the full scion length.

, Slip the cut surface of the scion into the newly cut wedge of in the rootstock.


You may need to use a flat screwdriver to help you peel away the flap of bark on the stock. Roughly one-third to one-half of this flap should be removed before you place the scion into the wedge.
The long side of the scion should be placed against the trunk of the stock.

, Wrap the grafted vines together with a durable rubber band or heavy-duty tape. Seal the entire exposed area with grafting compound.


For additional security, hold the graft together with 1-inch (2.5-cm) long brads or staples from a staple gun. Seal as normal, then apply latex paint over the dried grafting compound.

"
"
Slice away the bottom of the scion.,
Cut the top of the stock at a similar angle.,
Match the cambium layers.,
Cut a tongue into both pieces.,
Seal the grafted area.",How to Graft Grape Vine4," Use a sharp blade to cut the bottom of the scion at a slant. The exposed surface should measure between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 cm) from the lowest to highest point.


This method is a little more difficult than cleft and bark grafting, but it is still fairly simple and works best when you're dealing with young, thing vines.
Note that the scion diameter should roughly match the diameter of the rootstock vine you plan to use.

, Use a saw or sharp blade to cut the top of the rootstock at an angle and length that matches the cut of the scion.


This process is best done on vines that are only one or two years in age. The vines must be no greater than 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) in diameter, making this method ideal for vines that are too small to be grafted using cleft or bark grafting.

, Position the scion over the rootstock. Arrange them so that the cambium layers of vine meet.


The cambium is a single layer of active plant cells found just beneath the bark of the vine. The two vines must be connected at their cambium layers if they are to join into one vine.
If the rootstock is wider than the scion, you may need to settle for matching the cambium layer on one side of the graft only.

, Slice into the rootstock with a sharp blade, then mirror this slice in the scion. The two sliced portions of wood should be able to fit together.


Both cuts should start roughly one-quarter of the way down from the point of sloped cut on both the scion and the stock.
These tongues help hold the graft together more securely and keep the structure a little more rigid.

, Wrap the grafted area of the vine with heavy-duty tape or similar material, then apply a generous layer of grafting compound over all of the exposed vine.


Sealing is important with all methods, but it is especially important with this one. Make sure that you are using thick grafting rubber tape or electrical tape when wrapping the grafted area.
Apply a generous amount of asphalt grafting compound with a stiff paintbrush and add a coat of interior latex paint over the grafting compound once it dries.

Locate your nearest Farm Service Agency (FSA) office.,
Identify popular subsidy programs.,
Discuss eligibility with your local FSA.",How to Get a Farm Subsidy1," Farm subsidies are administered through the Farm Service Agency. You will want to work closely with your local FSA office, which can help you identify programs and apply. You can find your state office by visiting a USDA website here: https://www.fsa.usda.gov/state-offices/index. Click on your state.


At your state’s website, you should look for a link to county offices. Contact information should be provided.;
, The FSA runs many different subsidy programs that help farmers. Some of these programs help you in the event of a disaster, whereas others are meant to cushion changes in the price of commodities. FSA also tries to encourage conservation by paying you not to plant land. The following are only some of the programs FSA runs:


Price loss coverage. Eligible producers can receive compensation when the market price for their commodities falls below a reference price set by Congress.Agricultural risk coverage. Producers can receive compensation when their revenue falls below a predetermined average.
Dairy margin protection program. This insurance program provides payments when the national dairy production margin falls below a certain point.Disaster assistance. The FSA provides relief for losses as a result of fire, flood, drought, pest infestation, tornadoes, and other natural disasters.Conservation reserve program. You can receive a yearly rental payment from the federal government. In exchange, you agree to stop using environmentally sensitive land for agricultural purposes and instead convert it to vegetative cover. Contracts last 10-15 years., Each program has its own eligibility criteria, which you can obtain from your local FSA. You should stop in and meet the staff. You will probably find that you will work closely with them in the future.


Your local FSA can also discuss other programs not mentioned in this article.

,


The pulp should float, and can be discarded.

,,


Flip the seeds over to make sure they dry evenly and don't stick.

,, Make sure you don't fill too much.

, Depending on container size you might be able to fit more or less. If you can fit 5 pots but they are really squished together, it will be better to have 4. Try not to cram all the pots in.

, If the seeds are small, leave them uncovered.

, The soil should be moist but not really wet. Check with your finger. And always spray the soil with water if the soil is dry.

, Don't give up if your seed doesn't sprout in 5 days or less. Each and every seed germinates at different times, meaning tomato seeds will sprout after 7/10 days, or like basil will sprout after 3/4 days.

, After the seeds have sprouted into seedlings, it is important to wait for them to be strong enough to be moved out of the container. Seedlings are ready to be moved once a 2nd set of leaves appear. Even then watch and wait for them to be bigger and leafier. You can do a test by leaving the container lid open, so the humidity diminishes and see if the seedlings do well. If not quickly put on the lid and they will recover.

Compare the programs.,
Check if you grow a qualifying commodity.,
Contact your FSA office.",How to Get a Farm Subsidy2," Farmers can receive subsidies if the price of their crops falls below a certain benchmark set by Congress. However, they must choose to enroll either for Price Loss Coverage or Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC). Also, ARC comes in two forms.Price Loss Coverage. You receive a payment if your covered commodity is below the reference price. Payments are made on a crop-by-crop basis using your farm’s base acreage and program yield. You can enter covered commodities individually.

ARC-County option. FSA will estimate crop revenue using the average county yield. You will receive payment if the crop revenue falls below the ARC-County guaranteed revenue. You can enter covered commodities individually.

ARC-Individual option. If the actual revenue from all of your covered commodities is less than the ARC-Individual guarantee, then you will receive payment. If you choose this option, then you must enter all covered commodities.

, Not every commodity is eligible for price loss payments or ARC coverage. Instead, only the following will qualify:barley
corn
rice (medium grain, long grain, and California medium grain)
oats
grain sorghum
wheat
chickpeas (large and small)
peanuts
soybeans
dry peas
lentils
other oilseeds

, In order to qualify, you will also need to meet certain Adjusted Gross Income limits and be actively engaged in farming.Talk to FSA staff about whether Price Loss Coverage or Agricultural Risk Coverage is better for you. Once you make a choice, you can’t change easily.

Apply for the program.",How to Get a Farm Subsidy3," The protection program is only open to certain dairy producers in the United States. To be eligible, you must meet the following criteria:You produce and market milk from cows that are in the U.S.
You can provide proof of milk production when you register.
You aren’t enrolled in the Risk Management Agency’s Livestock Gross Margin for Dairy Program.

, FSA provides catastrophic coverage, which doesn’t cost you anything apart from a basic $100 annual administrative fee. However, you can also choose different levels of buy-up coverage.You can use a web tool at http://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/pages/content/farmBill/fb_MPPDTool.jsp to decide the level of coverage you want.

, Enrollment is limited to certain times of the year. For example, to get coverage for 2017, you must enroll between July 1, 2016 and December 16, 2016.If you miss this deadline, then contact your local FSA to ask when the next enrollment period will be.

, You can apply by getting the appropriate forms from your local FSA. You will need to complete and submit the following:CCC-781, “Production History Establishment”
CCC-782, “Contract and Annual Coverage Election”

Identify the different disaster programs.,
Check eligibility requirements.,
Apply with your local FSA office.",How to Get a Farm Subsidy4," The FSA administers many different programs that provide disaster relief. You can find summaries on this convenient fact sheet: http://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/disaster_assistance_program.pdf. Generally, the following programs are available:


Funding to rehabilitate damaged farmland.
Funding to restore rural private forests destroyed by natural disasters.
Emergency assistance for producers of livestock, honeybees, and farm-raised fish.
Emergency loans to help producers recover from losses caused by natural disasters.
Assistance to orchardists and nursery tree growers to replant or rehabilitate.
Compensation for grazing losses suffered due to drought or fire on Federally managed land.

, Each disaster program has different eligibility requirements which cannot be summarized here. You should stop into your FSA office to check whether you qualify. To qualify, you generally must be in areas designated by FSA as eligible for disaster relief. There are also requirements for eligible livestock. For example, the following livestock are covered for grazing losses due to drought or fire under the livestock forage disaster program:alpacas
beef cattle
buffalo
beefalo
dairy cattle
deer
elk
emus
equine
goats
llama
poultry
reindeer
sheep
swine

, You must submit a completed application and required supporting documentation to your local FSA office. There will be different deadlines depending on which disaster program you are applying for.


For example, you must submit your application within 30 days after the end of the calendar year in which you suffered a loss if you are seeking assistance under the livestock forage disaster program.If you are applying for tree assistance, then you must apply within 90 days of the disaster or when it became apparent that you suffered a loss."
"
Check when you can apply.,
Confirm you qualify.,
Apply for the program.",How to Get a Farm Subsidy5," If you have owned or operated the land for at least 12 months, then you can apply. You can enroll in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in two ways. You should pick the method which works best for you:General sign-up. General sign-ups are announced periodically by the Secretary of Agriculture. They do not occur at set intervals. Instead, you should ask your local FSA office to notify you of when a general sign-up has been announced.

Continuous sign-up. You can also apply any time that you want using continuous sign-up. Unlike general sign-up, offers are not subject to competitive bidding.Instead, FSA will identify the most environmentally-sensitive lands and enroll them in the program.

, To qualify for general sign-up, your land must meet certain conditions. You should check to see that your land qualifies:You must have planted cropland four of the past six years between 2008 and 2013, and the land must be capable of being planted.
Alternately, certain pastures that can act as riparian buffers also qualify.
The land must be sufficiently vulnerable to erosion.

, You can get more details about either general sign-up or continuous sign-up by contacting your local FSA.You should also discuss what factors FSA will use to rank to analyze the land’s potential environmental benefits.

Be aware of the weather.,
Stay away from holes.,
Go cautiously up and down ramps.,
Navigate off-road surfaces carefully.,
Attach lights for nighttime use.,
Maintain your wheelchair.,
Make sure all your accessories are contained.,

Fully charge an electric chair.,
Lock brakes when entering or exiting the chair.,
Find your center of gravity.,
Avoid bending forward or backward.,
Steer clear of tipping the chair.",How to Operate a Wheelchair Safely Outdoors," Uneven surfaces can make any wheelchair get off balance. Even when someone is pushing a wheelchair, an uneven surface can cause harm. Users and caregivers alike need to stick to slopes that only go up to a gradient of 20% and are dry, solid, and straight.


Avoid inclines, slopes, staircases, and curbs. Basically you want to make sure your wheelchair stays on flat ground.;
, Sand can build up on tires and cause a wheelchair to get off balance. Even a thin layer of sand on a concrete sidewalk can cause problems. If you see sand ahead, either try to avoid it or make sure someone nearby can help you clean the wheels as soon as you pass over it.Try to go around a sandy patch of sidewalk.
Electric wheelchairs can actually tip over from the imbalance that sand creates.

, You should always check the weather before you leave the house in a wheelchair. Try to avoid going out if there is any sort of precipitation—rain, snow, sleet, and so on—because any of these will make surfaces slick.Puddles and flat areas covered in water are bad for any wheelchair. The water can get the entire chair wet, causing it to slide or spin and eventually tip over. If you see a puddle or it is raining heavily, either go around the puddle or wait until the rain is over.If it’s raining and you want to go out to run an errand, have someone help you by carrying both you and the wheelchair to the car and inside the building at your destination.
If you have no one to assist you, use your wheelchair very slowly and carefully.
Be especially careful to inspect ramps in wet weather. You don’t want to slide or tip when going up or down an incline.

, Avoid potholes when you operate your wheelchair outdoors. Holes in the ground, floor, or a ramp can make you lose your balance and tip over. Try to go around any holes that you see. If there is a hole ahead of you, ask someone to help you steer around it.
If you’re alone and you need to go over a surface with a hole in it, proceed very slowly and try to steer around it.

, Even if the weather is good, you should carefully inspect ramps before going up or down. Make sure there are no uneven or slippery surfaces. You should also inspect the ramp for other obstacles like plants.Ask for help in avoiding obstacles on a ramp.
For example, ask someone nearby to pull up obtrusive weeds or push grass out of the way.
Ask other for help in sweeping sand off of a ramp.
If you are pushing a wheelchair up a ramp, first check to see that the ramp is clear of obstacles. Then slowly advance, watching carefully to ensure that you don’t tip the chair over.
If you’re moving a wheelchair you’re sitting in up a ramp, lean forward for momentum after engaging the anti-tippers (if your chair is equipped with any)., Not all wheelchairs are created equally. If you need to ride your wheelchair over grass, dirt, gravel, and so on, it might be better to have an all-terrain wheelchair. These chairs have wheels that are thicker than average and can stand up to adverse surface conditions.If your wheelchair tires are thin and less suited to terrain, avoid off-road conditions as much as possible. Take precautions when you absolutely have to traverse over these surfaces.
Ask someone to push your chair so that you don't slip.
Clean off your tires as soon as you are over the surface.

, At night, you need to make yourself visible. Attach flashing lights, reflectors, or flags to maintain a high profile. You will need these additions to your chair to avoid accidents in parking lots or along sidewalks.You may be able to find these kinds of lights in the bicycle section of a big box store.

, You should take care of your wheelchair on a weekly basis. You may want to take it in to a repair shop to have it serviced once a year. For example, a sign that you need new casters is a vibration from side to side when your chair is going fast. This is called “shimmy.” A very bad shimmy can cause a wheelchair to tip over.New casters can cost anywhere from $35 to $100.
Wipe down the wheels when you get home from being out in the rain. This prevents rust on metal parts.Check the air pressure if you have air tires each time you go out. Replace cracked or worn-out tires as soon as you see them.
Check your brakes and for loose bolts once a month.

, Don’t hang heavy bags on the back of your wheelchair. Not only will this upset your center of gravity when you’re in the chair, but it may cause the chair to tip over when you are getting in or out.Instead, hold heavy bags in your lap or ask someone to assist you.

, Be sure to consider yourself as a pedestrian and follow basic traffic laws. Follow all painted crosswalks, pedestrian traffic light laws, and so on. Most cities in the United States have their own laws about how wheelchairs are allowed, but most places allow wheelchairs on the sidewalk.Do not ride your wheelchair on roadways.

, If you are going on a trip longer than a few days, you should make sure that your electric wheelchair is fully charged before you leave. Also take time to measure the range of your battery before leaving the house.

, Making sure your chair doesn’t move while you’re getting in or out of it is important. You don’t want to roll. Also make sure that electric chairs are turned off when getting in or out. This prevents the chair getting away from you., When beginning to use a wheelchair, it is important to find your center of gravity so that you don’t have accidents. Move around in the chair to get a feel for where you have the most balance.Bend, reach for items, and get in and out of the chair in order to find your center of gravity.

, To avoid tipping over in your wheelchair, try not to lean far forward or backward. In order to obtain an object that is out of reach, roll your chair as close as you can. Then reach for the object as far as you can without changing where you’re sitting in the chair., Take precautions to avoid tipping your wheelchair over. For one thing, avoid going fast. Make sure you lock the brakes when you are entering or exiting the chair. Also avoid hitting large bumps with only one wheel.Maintain a slow speed on tight corners and rough surfaces.

Place the seeds on the paper towels in the containers.,
Close the lid.,
Provide light almost 24/7.,
Change the paper towels when it has a smell or brownish colors appear.,
With the perfect humid environment provided, the seedlings should emerge after around 5 days.,
Remove the lid once the third pair of leaves have emerged.,
Cut around the seedlings with their own part of the paper towel.",How to Germinate Seeds with Humidity," Basil, bell peppers, papaya and strawberries are examples of seeds that need humidity to sprout. Leafy greens like lettuce need constant moisture to sprout.


For example, bell peppers only germinate at around 70 degrees.;
,


Seeds like papaya are tropical and native to places such as Mexico and South America.

,


Some seeds, such as lettuce, need moist soil to germinate.
Certain seeds require constant moisture for germination.

,, Pour in about 1 inch (2.5cm) of water, or until damp to the touch.

,


Make sure they are evenly spaced, to prevent crowding
Make sure the seeds are not touching each other or overlapping

, Place the seeds in a constantly warm environment.


Place a plug in heat pad under the container.

, Place the container with seeds in an area that receives the most sunlight.


Use a grow light to provide direct sunlight during the day, if the indoor area is too dark.

,


Remember to add also add water when changing the paper towels.
Only change the paper towels when no roots have sprouted.

, Wait for the second pair of leaves to appear before doing anything.


Length of time for emergence will depend on the seed type; some seeds may take longer.

,


If the seedlings look healthy, then keep the soil moist and the lid off to get the seedlings use to air without humidity.
Leave the lid on if the seedlings fall over or show signs of unhappiness.

, This helps to safely transfer the seedlings without harming or damaging the roots. The paper towel will decompose with the soil naturally.

Measure from the back of the hips to the back of the subject's knee.,
Measure from the tip of the elbow to the top of the hips.,
Measure from the hips to the shoulders.,
Measure from the hips to the top of the head.",How to Measure a Wheelchair," Take the measurement with the person in the seated position, on a fairly firm surface. This will determine the width of the seat.


Add approximately 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) for slight movement and comfort when sitting. Allow for the thickness of bulky clothing, which could be worn in the winter.;
, This will usually be from directly under one armpit to the other. This will influence the width of the seat back.

, This will determine the length of the leg rest extension and influence the seat height.


Add a minimum of 2 inches (5 cm) to this measurement to determine seat height. Unless the wheelchair is going to be foot propelled, the footrest needs that much room for clearance.
Take the next measurements while the person is sitting down. The arms should be at a 90 degree angle, and the shoulders should be relaxed and neutral.

, Add approximately 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) to determine the ideal seat depth. For an adult, there should be that much space from the edge of the seat to the back of the knee.

, Again, the person should be in a sitting position with both arms at a 90 degree angle. This will determine the height of the armrest in relation to the seat.

, This will determine the height of the seat back.

Comply with your loan's terms and conditions.",How to Get Government Assistance for a Farm," Particularly to qualify for grants, you must be able to demonstrate that you have education and experience in the type of farming you want to conduct, and that such farming activities have been successful in the geographic area where your farm is located.While you may think you're prepared to run a farm, you need to look at your background from the point of view of someone who might invest in your operation but knows nothing about you.
Having education or experience in farming operations will provide the government agency with confidence that the money will be used well and wisely.
Business education or experience running any small business also can be a benefit. Your farm is a business, and an understanding of basic business organization and financial principles will inspire confidence in agencies considering whether to give you a grant.;
, A loan or grant for a farm is treated much the same way as a loan or grant for a small business. To qualify for assistance, you must show that you are treating your farm as a business venture and expect ultimately to turn a profit from your work.You can find a number of resources and templates for business plans online. Check on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) website as well as the website of the Small Business Association (SBA).
Your state agricultural department and nonprofit farming organizations also may have resources that can help you build your farming business plan.
While a farm business plan has many of the same components as any small business plan, the content of those components will be different.
Generally, you will need sections that cover marketing, production and operations, human resources, and finances.
Your financial section in particular must include detailed reports on your farm's income and assets, as well as projections of your farm's profit in future years.

, Particularly if you are applying for a loan, your qualification will depend on your credit score. An established farm may have its own credit score, but typically it will be your personal credit history that determines whether you qualify for government-insured loans.Check your credit report so you know what's on it. You're entitled to at least one copy of your credit report each year, and you can contact the credit bureau if there are any errors you need corrected.
Go to annualcreditreport.com to get your free credit report as guaranteed by federal law. Keep in mind this is the only site endorsed by the federal government. Other sites may claim they're giving you a free credit report but require you to purchase a credit monitoring subscription.
If you have an established farm – or perhaps you're taking over a family farm – it may have its own credit history, particularly if the farm has existing loans or lines of credit under the farm's employer identification number.

, As part of your grant or loan application package, you typically must provide documents showing that you own any land, livestock, or equipment that you intend to use in your farming business.For example, if you own the land on which you want to operate your farm, you'll need copies of the deed to include with your applications. That land is an asset for your farm.
If you're leasing farmland, you'll probably need copies of your leases as well. The same goes for any leases of major farm equipment.

, Both state and federal governments have grant programs for various aspects of farming. Since you don't have to pay grant money back provided you meet the program requirements, the grant application process typically is extremely competitive.The USDA website has a list of links to all state departments of agriculture. From the home page, search for state departments of agriculture to bring up the list.
You also can click on the Beginning Farmers link from the USDA home page to access information about grants specifically available for those who are just starting their farming operation.
Keep in mind that grants have strict deadlines and specific budgets. If you've looked at the information for a particular grant and decided you want to apply, write down this information in a prominent place so you have it in mind as you work on your application.
State departments may have more specific programs that would suit your needs, while federal opportunities tend to be broader in application.

, Read through the grant application forms carefully before you begin filling them out, so you have a solid understanding of the information that will be required. Through your application, you want to paint a picture of a farmer who meets the requirements and is worthy of the money.The grant application will require you to provide specific information about your farming business. This information typically will be included in the business plan you created, so you can copy it from there.
Focus on the specific purpose of the grant. For example, if you're applying for a sustainable agriculture grant, you should focus on the sustainable methods you're using and your financial needs with implementing those methods.
From the purpose, you'll develop your grant proposal. This proposal describes the goals you hope to accomplish with the specific amount of grant money you're requesting.
Grants for beginning farmers typically are only available to operations that have not yet started or have only been going for a few years. Check the requirements carefully to make sure your farm falls within the grant's limits.
Keep in mind that grants have limited budgets. Generally, you don't want to count on grants to cover all of your financial needs – some programs may offer only a few hundred dollars, meaning you typically still would need to look for loans to cover the rest of your need.

, After you've finished your grant applications, make copies before you send them to the appropriate government agency. Since grants are highly competitive, make sure you're sending your application well in advance of any deadline provided.Grants that require you to submit additional documentation, such as a copy of your business plan or a financial statement, typically will have a checklist of documents that must be included along with the application form itself.
If you're mailing a paper application, make sure you're leaving enough time for it to get there in advance of the deadline. Grant deadlines typically run from the date the department receives your application, not the date of the postmark.
Some grant applications can be accessed and completed online. If you're completing an online application, make sure you make a copy of your application for your records before you submit it.

, Grant applications themselves can be quite lengthy, and the volume of applications may mean it will take several months before you find out whether your application has been approved.The grant information may include an approximate processing time. If it does, you might make this on your calendar – but don't treat it as a hard deadline.
Keep in mind that any processing time estimates typically don't begin until the date the grant's application acceptance period closes.
You may be contacted by someone from the department who wants to ask you questions or needs additional information to complete the processing of your application.

, If you are awarded a grant, you must submit regular reports to the government agency that provided the grant. These reports detail how the grant money is being spent and provide a snapshot of the financial health of your farm.Federal grants typically have standard reports that are required, regardless of the amount of money you receive. Expect to file more reports for a multi-year grant than for a single disbursement.
For all grants, you must file a final narrative report that details your activities, production, and how you met the goals you set forth in your grant proposal.
Multi-year grants typically also require interim reports, including budget reports that detail how you spent the grant money each year and the progress you've made toward the goals outlined in your application.

, More government assistance for a farm typically is available in the form of loans rather than grants. Government-insured or guaranteed farm loans have benefits you wouldn't get from a traditional small business loan, such as lower interest rates and more flexible payment terms.Federal farm loans are administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA), which is part of the USDA. Most of these loans are intended as temporary stop-gaps to get your farm to a point that you can be approved for a traditional commercial loan to meet any ongoing funding needs.
These loans often are restricted to applicants who wouldn't otherwise qualify for a traditional commercial loan, which can make them a good fit for you if your credit is lacking.
However, keep in mind that some loans are only available to farmers who are unable to meet their funding needs through traditional commercial lenders.
The government department will make its own assessment whether commercial lending is available to you, but it's worth doing all you can to meet your funding needs through private lenders before applying for government loans.

, Farm banks are defined as those that handle more farm real estate and production loans than the average bank. Many of them include the word ""farm"" in their name. You can find a list of these banks on the agricultural banking page of the American Bankers Association website.While these are traditional commercial loans, farm banks have a better understanding of and commitment to farmers and farming businesses.
As a result, farm banks may be more willing to work with you on specific farm-related issues where a traditional commercial bank would be unforgiving.
For example, a farm bank typically understands that farming income may be seasonal, meaning that your payments on the loan would fluctuate through the year.

, Loans may be restricted to certain types of farming activities, or to certain phases of farm development. Some loans may only be available for beginning farms, while others are available for existing farms that have been in operation for several years.Some loans also may be restricted to specific regions. For example, federal-guaranteed loans may be available only to farmers in certain parts of the country, while loans insured or guaranteed by state governments or nonprofit organizations may be restricted to specific counties.
Read the loan requirements carefully to make sure your farm qualifies for the loan offered. Some loans may have reporting requirements, similar to grants, that are designed to confirm you're using the proceeds of the loan for the purpose intended.
Avoid applying for a loan that you don't need just because it is available. For example, if you intend to grow soybeans, don't apply for a loan for corn farmers. If the lender discovers that you are not a corn farmer, you may incur financial penalties as a result.
Additionally, the government may bar you from applying for government loans or other financial assistance in the future if you falsify information related to your farm on your loan application.

, The farm loan application will require you to provide various information about yourself and your financial history, as well as your farming activities and the purpose for which you are requesting the loan.The application will be more in depth than any applications you may have completed for credit cards or consumer loans. The information you'll have to provide is similar to what you'd have to provide if you were taking out a commercial loan for a small business.
You'll be expected to list all assets, including their value, as well as all debts, including both farm-related and personal debts.
You also may be required to submit a full business plan as well as detailed financial reports regarding your farming operations.
If you've incorporated your farm, or are operating it as a partnership or other business entity, the lending institution typically will require you to submit copies of your business organization paperwork, including articles of incorporation and partnership or operating agreements.

, Once you've completed the application form for the loan, gather any documents that must accompany your application and make a copy of the entire package for your records before sending it to the appropriate government agency or lending institution.Typically government loans are serviced by a particular bank or lending institution in your area. This means your application paperwork should go there – not to the government agency that guarantees or insures the loan.
The application should include an address to which the completed paperwork should be sent. If you're completing your application online, you may be able to submit it online as well.
If you submit your application online, the bank or lending institution typically will provide you with an address where you can send any documents for which you don't have digital copies to attach and send electronically.

, When your loan is approved, the bank that services your loan will provide you with a document that outlines your responsibilities as a loan recipient. This may involve submitting financial reports or other information on a regular basis.Read through the terms carefully and make sure you understand the length of the loan, the interest rate, and how your payments are structured.
Particularly if the loan is for a specific purpose, you typically must be able to prove that you are using the loan funds for that purpose.
To this end, you may be required to submit budgeting or financial reports periodically through the life of your loan.
Your packet that includes the terms and conditions of your loan also typically includes contact information for the agent responsible for your loan.
Keep this information in a safe place with your financial records so you can call them if you have any difficulty making your loan payments. They typically will be willing to work with you if you contact them as soon as possible, preferably before the payment is due.

Continue to measure every 2 feet (0.61 m) along the entire perimeter of the room and mark the measurements on the wall.

,
Use a pencil and a level to connect the marks and draw a straight line around the perimeter of the wall at the height where your chair rail will be attached.

,
Cut your chair rail using a miter saw; there should be only 1 piece for each length of wall if possible.

,
Cut the first piece at a 90-degree angle so that it sits flush at the end of the wall.

,
Cut any pieces that you need to join together (because of a long wall and short pieces) at a 45-degree angle to avoid gaps and fit more snugly together.

,
Cut all pieces that frame windows at 45-degree angles.

,
Cope your section of chair rail that will join the first rail to be installed on the wall; coping the wood allows the end of the second piece to fit snugly over the end of the first piece so that no gaps are visible.

,
Take a measurement of the length from your first chair rail to the next wall (each piece of molding will have a coped end and a flush end).

,
Proceed along the perimeter of the room repeating the measuring and cutting steps until you have reached the end of the perimeter.",How to Measure Chair Rail,";

Remember all your strengths, and tell yourself that you deserve love. You are worthwhile and you can get a partner—one with or without a disability.


Read from the disability community, particularly from writers in wheelchairs. Look at drawings and photos of people in wheelchairs. Recognize that you aren't alone, and that it's okay to use a wheelchair. (Also consider intersectional feminism, disability studies, and the social model of disability.)
Every time you think a negative thought about yourself, counter it with a positive one. For example, ""Maybe I'm too disabled for this job"" can be countered with ""I gave an awesome speech last Friday."";
, Shower, wash your hair, brush your teeth, and wear deodorant. Put on an awesome outfit that makes you feel confident and attractive. (Who says wheelchair users aren't well-dressed?)


To look extra nice, try makeup, perfume/cologne, or something fancy with your hair.

, Get a feel for what he's like, and if he's your type of guy. If you're shy, that's okay—work on asking him questions and letting him do most of the talking.


""Where are you from?"" ""What's it like there?""
""I noticed the _____ picture on your shirt/bag/binder cover. You like _____?""

, Some people may try not to stare, or ask outright about why you're in a wheelchair. It may help to have rehearsed a brief, general script about your disability. How much you choose is up to you. It helps to speak calmly and factually, as this will set the precedent for how he sees it.


""I was in a car accident when I was seven, and I ended up paralyzed from the waist down. It doesn't hurt anymore, and I just use this wheelchair to get around.""
""I have this really rare issue with my legs that make it difficult to walk. On worse days, I use this wheelchair, and on better days, I sometimes use a cane.""

, If he treats you with disgust or pity, that's his fault (not yours) and he doesn't deserve you. A good guy may be a little confused at first, and while he might put his foot in his mouth, he'll ultimately respect you and recognize your disability as a natural part of getting to know you.

, Sometimes you may want to ask him for help, and that's okay. He might not know how to respond to your disability, so you may need to do a bit of educating.


""Would you please help me grab my coat?""
""You don't need to rush to push chairs out of my way. Sometimes I pull up next to a chair because I want to sit in it.""
""Don't worry. I can do this.""

, Once you've established that you like him, and that he's getting along with you, it's time to turn things up. Touch his arm or pick lint off his shirt. Compliment him. Meet his eyes and smile. See if he flirts back.

, Once you're certain that you both enjoy each other's company and have a spark, it's time to get things moving. Ask him out yourself, or get him to ask you out (e.g. ""So, are you ever going to ask me out?"").

These classes cover the basics including pushing forwards and backwards, but they also address more complex moves like pushing with one hand, going up and down ramps and even stairs, and navigating curbs.Ask your doctor, physical therapist, or other wheelchair users if they know of any wheelchair skills classes in your area.
Look for online programs to teach you wheelchair skills. Organizations such as the University of Washington or the United Spinal Association offer online wheelchair skills training. Make sure that you have a physical therapist or trained spotter on hand to prevent falls.;
, Participating in activities you enjoy can get you outside of your home and help you be more independent. It can also keep you physically and emotionally engaged, which promotes your health and well-being.Participate in group activities such as book clubs or sports-focused groups. Consider getting together with other wheelchair users for things like a stroll around your local area every morning.

, You might feel like you can do less in a wheelchair. But this isn’t the case: you can do as much as someone who isn’t in a wheelchair, from participating in races to cooking meals and even skydiving. Keeping your outlook positive and expectations for yourself high can help boost your confidence. It can also show others how capable you are, which will keep them from expecting less from you.Take time to explore all of the things you can do with a wheelchair, including things that wheelchair-bound persons may not be able to do. For example, you can try things such as skydiving, parasailing, waterskiing, basketball, hunting, kayaking, rock climbing, golf, skiing, and bowling.Doing these types of activities can boost your mood—and your confidence. Recognize that you can also do things such as preparing a big meal for your family, attend concerts, and even go on a vacation.
Talking with a peer support group of other wheelchair users can help you adjust to being in a wheelchair and figure out ways to stay positive., Being in a wheelchair is a big adjustment for any person. It might cause you fear, anxiety, and concern about how to navigate the world.. Acknowledging your fears and concerns can help you overcome them and embrace life and the world around you.Remember that there are few limitations in a wheelchair when you put your mind to something. In fact, new technologies are allowing wheelchair users to push the boundaries of perceived limitations.Seek out encouragement from friends, family members, and other wheelchair users. These people can boost your confidence and help you tackle anything that you put your mind to.
Meet with a therapist who specializes in working with wheelchair users. This person can give you techniques to overcome your fear, concern, and anxiety. For example, the therapist may suggest scripting, which is visualizing how something will play out and then following through on that scenario in real life.

, In some cases, you may actually need help with something. There is nothing wrong with asking or accepting help when it’s necessary. This doesn’t mean that you are any less dependent, but understand your boundaries. This can also help others know when you may need a little assistance.Recognize that many people might want to or offer help. Decline the person or people politely and with a smile. For example, “Thank you so much for your kind offer, but I think I’ve got this.”
Reach out for assistance to loved ones if you need it. You can say, “Hi Allie, I’m sorry to bother you, but my transportation service just called to cancel. Would you be able to run me to the store or pick up a few things for me. I am running low on food and some other necessities.”

, One of the easiest ways to be more independent is by removing obstacles that may make it more difficult to move throughout your home.This could mean installing ramps and rails, removing thresholds, to storing items at an easily accessible height.In many cases, you can subsidize modifications to make your home more maneuverable.Check your flooring to see if you can easily move on it. It may be difficult to navigate with thick carpeting or area rugs.Look for any obstacles that might get in your way. This can be tables, chairs, or even the corners of items in your home.
Keep your basic necessities within arm’s reach. This includes toiletries and medications as well as food and kitchen items. Add ramps and grab bars where you might need them, such as in the bathroom and at entryways to your home.
Consider working with an ergonomics specialist or occupational therapist to find the adaptations that may work best for you.

, Once you have an idea of what home modifications you may need, you may start to worry about the cost. It can be expensive to modify your home to be more independent. This shouldn’t be of significant concern because there are many programs available to subsidize the costs of making necessary modifications.Consult the service offered by the National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modification for information on home modification in your area at http://gero.usc.edu/nrcshhm/directory/.
Speak to your insurance company about what modifications it will cover. Contact local, state, and federal programs designed to provide financial assistance to people who need to make home modifications. You can find a comprehensive list of these resources at http://www.infinitec.org/how-to-pay-for-it.
Consider moving to a Center for Independent Living, which is a consumer‑controlled, community‑based, cross‑disability, nonresidential private nonprofit agency designed and operated by individuals with disabilities within a local community. A CIL also offers a wide array of independent living services. Find and get contact information for your local CIL at http://www.ilru.org/projects/cil-net/cil-center-and-association-directory.

, There are many options for drivers with disabilities, including those individuals who use a wheelchair. Consult a specialist in converting wheelchair-accessible vehicles about your needs and wishes. Driving can greatly increase your independence and may help you have a more active lifestyle.Consult with your doctor or other medical professionals about any specific modifications you need or they might suggest for you. You can use this information when seeking a dealer who can make modifications to your car.
Follow up with local car dealers to see if they are able to modify your car for adaptive driving. You can also easily find local partners of the Adaptive Driving Alliance, which is a nationwide group of vehicle modification dealers who offer transportation solutions. Find ADA’s website at http://www.adamobility.com/consumers.
Let the dealer know about your needs and wishes. Ask your dealer about financing options, including Veteran’s assistance, Medicare, Medicaid, Vocational Rehabilitation, and manufacturer rebate programs.

, Many localities offer transportation for individuals who use wheelchairs. Using public transportation and/ or transport services can offer you the chance to get out of the house to do activities such as shopping, exercising, or maintaining an active social life.Call your local public transportation system or ask your medical professionals for information on what services are available to you.
Contact the National Aging and Disability Transport Center for assistance in local public transportation or transportation services in your local area. Call 1.866.983.3222 and press 3 to speak to a Locator Transportation Specialist.Ask the specialist to put you on the list to receive the NADTC’s monthly email alerts about the latest technology trends in transportation for persons with disabilities. You can also contact your state’s 2-1-1 information line for information on local accessible transportation., In the United States and many other countries, there is legislation that ensures equal opportunity to individuals with disabilities in employment, state and local government services, public accommodations, commercial facilities, and transportation.Many places are marked with the international access symbol, which is a blue square with a person in a wheelchair in white.Look for these signs to locate access features such as ramps, automatic door openers, or elevators.


Figure out options of places you plan to go. Call ahead and ask if they are wheelchair accessible. If they are not, then choose a location that does so that you don’t have to rely on help.
Upload an app to find wheelchair accessible places if you have a smartphone. Apps such as Wheelmap, Wheely, Urban Spoon, and It’s Accessible can all help you locate offices, restaurants, and other places that are wheelchair accessible.Ask businesses or organization to consider following local, state, and national regulation on accessibility for wheelchair users and others with disabilities.

, Being in a wheelchair doesn’t mean you just need to stay in your local area or places that you can drive. Decide on a place you’d like to go and consult a travel agent who specializes in disabled travel or has experience working with wheelchair uses.Consider booking a vacation package designed for persons in wheelchairs.
Book your travel as far in advance as you can. This can not only ensure that you have accessible amenities, but minimizes the risk of potentially uncomfortable situations during your trip.Book transportation over the phone or in person. Ask to speak to a supervisor or person who specializes in travel for those with disabilities to help ensure that your needs are met.
Book travel with major companies throughout your trip. These are more likely to offer accessible amenities and services.
Consult with other friends who are in wheelchairs about travel. You can also consult organizations such as Mobility International, which have tips on how to prepare for your trip., Working out gives most people improved stamina and muscle tone, which can also improve your ability to be independent. Many exercise programs can be adapted for seated users. Alternatively, you may seek out exercise opportunities geared specifically toward people with disabilities, such as videos, classes or sports events.Aim for some type of physical activity 5-6 days a week. Remember that activity can also energize you and improve your any feelings of isolation you may feel.Consult your doctor or physical therapist about how much physical activity you can do every week. For example, you might aim for ½ hour every day. You can break the time up into manageable pieces, such as 3-10 minute workouts. Remember to start slowly and gradually increase your activity level as you are able.
Choose activities that challenge your body and that you enjoy without pain. It may take a little trial and error to find what works and what you like. Consider activities such as wheelchair basketball, using a hand-bike, bowling, playing tennis or badminton. If you’re more adventurous, you can also try out skiing, surfing, rock climbing, and scuba diving., Most activities can be modified to accommodate your needs. Consult with a fitness professional for modifications you can make to activities you enjoy. For example, you could try swimming with a floatation belt or resistance bands to build arm strength.Make sure to listen to your body and stop if you have any pain. It’s normal to have some discomfort if you exercise, but if it turns into pain, stop what you’re doing.

, Every individual needs at least one full day of rest each week. Because you’re getting more activity as a wheelchair user, you may want to give yourself two full days. Getting enough rest can help your body build muscle and recover.Get 8-9 hours of sleep every night. A 30 minute nap can refresh you if you get tired during the day., Eating healthy foods is important for the health and wellbeing of any person. This is especially important for wheelchair users. Getting a variety of whole, nutrient-rich foods can help you maintain and even boost your health.Select foods from the five food groups of fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy. Vary your choices at every meal to get as many nutrients as possible. the health benefits of a wide range of nutrients., Drinking enough water throughout the day is important to maintaining your health. It can also keep you from feeling lethargic and getting headaches. Drink approximately 3 liters every day. Have more if you are active.Stay away from high calorie beverages like soda, juice cocktails, specialty coffees, and alcohol. Go for non-calorie choices such as diet soda, tea, plain coffee, or sparkling water.
Keep in mind that eating fruits and vegetables also increases hydration since these foods are made mostly of water."

A temporary/portable ramp (which will be discussed in greater length) is much easier to construct, whereas a permanent ramp may require professional services and additional government oversight.It is worth noting, however, that in some communities a permit is required regardless of the structure's longevity.;
, If there is any chance you will need a building permit, it's best to have a plan drawn up to show your property lines, the size and location of your home, and where the ramp will be placed. You should also include the height, length, and width of the ramp, as well as its distance from the sidewalk or street.These plans may be required before securing a building permit in some communities.Even if such a plan is not required, it will be helpful for you to have for your own planning and records-keeping.
In some communities, you may need a plan designed by a professional engineer or carpenter in order to secure a permit.Check with your local building code office to determine what (if any) documentation is required.

, In addition to the cost of supplies and building materials, as well as any contractor or carpenter fees, you may have to pay for a building permit. In many cities and counties in the U.S., the cost of a building permit is determined by the estimated cost of building the ramp.In Erie, PA, for example, there is a flat rate permit fee of $29 if the project will cost under $2,000, but if it is in excess of that amount the fee is increased to $29 + an additional $6 for every $1,000 in excess of $2,000.If you are building a temporary/portable ramp, you may be able to simply estimate the cost of wood and any other necessary supplies. If you are building a permanent fixture, this may require the skills of a carpenter or engineer, which could significantly increase the estimated costs of construction.

, In some places, a municipal building permit is required before construction of a wheelchair ramp may take place. This varies significantly from one municipality to another. Within the U.S. alone, there are considerable differences from one city to another. For example, in St. Louis, MO, wheelchair ramps are exempt from building permits if the ramp is laid down over existing stairs or is otherwise not permanently attached to the house.But in Erie, PA, all wheelchair ramps require a city permit that will cost approximately $29 or more, depending on the cost of the ramp.In cities where a building permit is required, you may face significant fines or other legal troubles for failing to secure a building permit before beginning construction of the ramp.Search online for your city and county regulations on building permits. You can also call your local Public Works office or a similar building code office in your city/county to learn about building permits and any local regulations that govern wheelchair ramps., There are three primary ramp layouts that most builders choose. The first is a straight (also called an in-line) ramp, which incorporates the ramp and any necessary landings in a straight line. The second is an L-shaped (also called a dog-legged) ramp, which bends at a 90 degree angle at the intermediate landing. If the L-shaped ramp wraps around the house, it may also be referred to as a ""wrap-around"" ramp. The third is a switchback ramp, which incorporates a 180-degree turn at one or more intermediate landings.One of the biggest factors in choosing a layout for the ramp is visual aesthetics. However, sometimes the size and shape of your yard may determine the shape and layout of your ramp., The ramp's slope, or angle of incline, is determined by how much rise the structure must accommodate. For many structures, the ramp must have a minimum ratio of 1:12. That means that for every inch of vertical rise, the ramp extends 12 inches outward. This is to ensure that the ramp is not too steep and can be easily ascended and descended safely by the individual who will be using it.To calculate your estimated length of ramp, measure the total rise and multiply that measurement by the total slope chosen for your ramp. For example, a ramp with a 1:12 slope built for a 29 inch rise would be 348 inches, or 29 feet (29 x 12 = 348).Ramps may have a gentler angle than 1:12 - for example, extending the ramp 16 inches outward for every one inch of vertical rise (1:16) - to improve safety and ease of access. Ramps should not have a slope that is any less than 12 inches of run for every inch of vertical rise, though, as anything steeper than this may lead to accidents and/or injuries.Please note that if the ramp is for a commercial/business facility, your city, county, or state may dictate a separate slope requirement for indoor vs. outdoor ramps. In Minnesota, for example, interior or covered ramps for public/commercial use may have a slope of 1:12, but exterior ramps (which may be considered ""walks,"" depending on your municipal codes) must have gentler slopes of at least 1:20., Depending on the size, angle, and primary use of your ramp (someone pushing a wheelchair vs. someone in a wheelchair transporting herself, for example), you may need to include landings on your ramp. There are three primary types of landings for a wheelchair ramp: a top landing, a bottom landing, and an optional intermediate landing.Top landings should measure at least 60 inches by 60 inches for an out-swinging door. The landing should provide at least 12 to 24 inches of ""elbow room"" on the handle side of the door, to ensure that the person opening the door can swing the wheelchair around and open the door without rolling backwards. This landing should come flush against the threshold of the exterior door, but it is recommended that there be no greater than a 1/2 inch gap between the ramp and the door threshold. This is to prevent the smaller front wheels from getting stuck, and to prevent walkers from tripping as they enter/exit the dwelling.Intermediate landings are typically optional, depending on the length and slope of the ramp. The size of this landing can range from 36 to 60 inches, depending on the slope. A steeper slope (such as a slope of 1:12) may require a longer distance in which the wheelchair may be stopped while descending.Bottom landings should measure at least the width of the ramp by approximately 48 inches of length if the ramp will be used by a walker, or 60 to 72 inches of length if the ramp will be used primarily by a wheelchair user.Make sure the bottom landing and ground are as close to flush as possible. A ""lip"" that measures more than 1/2 inch will pose a significant risk of tripping (for pedestrians) or rolling (for chair operators).Many experts recommend bolting the top landing to the building's foundation. Otherwise there will be a risk of the ramp lifting up from temperature fluctuations, which may pose a threat to the individual(s) using the ramp and could at the very least cause an out-swinging door to become jammed., Additional safety features like handrails and guardrails are an important component of most wheelchair ramps. A handrail can help prevent a wheelchair operator from falling out of the chair or rolling down the ramp, and a guardrail can help prevent the wheelchair operator from slipping off the ramp or landing.Handrail size and placement will depend on the height and arm strength of the primary user(s), as well as any local building code requirements that may be applicable to your structure. The typical height range of most handrail locations is between 31 and 34 inches.The width of the handrails should be less than or equal to 1.5 inches in diameter to ensure that the user can adequately grip the handrail. The diameter should be even smaller for children or adults with an impaired ability to grip or hold.Many lumber yards sell ready-made vertical hand rails.Guardrails should be mounted level with the primary user's seated knee height. This typically falls somewhere around 18 to 20 inches, though it's best to measure the primary user's seated knee height to ensure that the guardrails are effective and safe.Consider adding on a roof and/or gutters if the ramp is close to the building. Water runoff from the roof of the building may create a slipping hazard for wheelchair users, and a roof/covering will also help protect the wheelchair operator from the elements. An alternate option is to build a small extension off the roof to protect the ramp from runoff., Treated lumber is more durable and will weather precipitation and seasonal changes far better than untreated lumber. Even if the structure is a temporary one, it is considered a standard of ramp design to use treated lumber for the safety of the operator and the durability of the structure.It's generally best to choose medium-length lumber. For 2x4 and 2x6 boards, that means 16 feet or less in length. For 4x4 posts, choose beams that are 10 feet or less in length., Nails can potentially come undone with time and use, which could cause a safety hazard. For a stable, durable wheelchair ramp that won't come undone, use screws to assemble the ramp. Nails should only be used for joist hangers., If building a permanent structure, you'll need to dig post holes to properly stabilize and secure the ramp. The posts themselves should be four inches by four inches in size (4x4), and should be spaced no more than eight feet apart, with six feet being the ideal spacing.Cross-brace each post in at least one position in each direction. This will help give lateral stability to the posts.Attach stringers to the posts using 3.5 inch screws. Use 1/4 inch by 4 inch high shear strength screws at each load joint and to fasten the sill to the home.If the stringers are not at ground level or very close to it, use joist hangers on the stringers. To secure these, use hanger nails 1 and 5/8 inch. For all other fastenings, use screws instead of nails to ensure a stable structure., Some municipal codes require an anti-slip running surface that extends the entire length of the ramp. Even if this precaution is not required, it is still highly recommended by building and safety experts.There are many options for creating an anti-slip surface, and the option you choose may depend on personal preferences.


For wooden ramps, you can use a commercial ""grit"" tape, strips of roofing or shingling, or a coating of polyurethane sprinkled with sand. All of these materials are available at most hardware or building supply stores.For a concrete ramp, you can create an anti-slip surface by brushing the concrete with a broom while the concrete is still drying/hardening to create a rougher, less-smooth texture."

Be safe.",How to Choose Your Power Wheelchair," Maybe you can walk with assistance (like a cane) at home, and need a motorized wheelchair for outside the house. However, if you’ll be using your wheelchair extensively in all environments, you’ll need to consider what makes a chair compatible to use at home.


If you’ll be using the chair in your home, consider how easily you’ll be able to get in and out of it. Think about things like seat height — how high the seat is from the floor and how that compares to your bed height. Consider how wide the chair is compared to your doorways. Check for armrests and foot rests that can move out of the way, for easier exiting.Determine the turning radius of the chair — how much space it needs around it to complete a full 360° turn. Whether or not this is important to you will depend on your living space.;
, Where will you be taking your wheelchair? If the user of the power chair travels often, the wheelchair should be more compact and easy to take apart for transport. If the wheelchair will be used outdoors, make sure to get a wheelchair that has durable, quality wheels intended for outdoor use.If your chair needs to be maximally portable, look into models like Invacare Nutron R51 or others models that are foldable. The Pride Mobility Go-Chair is an example of a model that can be more easily disassembled and reassembled, to make transportation easier., Power wheelchairs come as either rear-wheel, mid-wheel, or front-wheel drive. This affects how the chair moves, and most people find that one type or another is easier and more comfortable for them to control. It’s a matter of personal preference, as each type has advantages and disadvantages.Try to test-drive a model of each type to see what feels the most comfortable to you.


If you want maximum speed, consider a rear-wheel drive model. Some of these models can travel up to 8.5 miles per hour, which may be helpful if traveling longer distances.Mid-wheel drive chairs generally seem to be the most maneuverable and have the smallest turn radius, which is ideal for tight spaces.Front-wheel drive chairs are usually the slowest option, but are best for uneven terrain and handling areas like snow, grass, and curbs., The materials for these vary — they can be air filled, contoured foam, gel, or air-foam combinations. Discuss your needs with your care provider or transportation specialist — each type of material has advantages and disadvantages regarding stability, pressure distribution, airflow, and insulation.You are least likely to get pressure sores with well-fitted pressure-reducing cushions.

, Many chairs have the standard “captain’s seat,” whereas others can recline, tilt, raise your leg rests, or go into standing position. Some children’s models have power-seating that can lower the whole seat to the floor, so your child can more easily play on the ground. You can work with your doctor to decide on the best seating option for you, but also consider the following:What is your sitting balance? Can you use both of your hands without support? If not, a tilt, recline, and lift feature may be beneficial.
Is there a risk you’ll get pressure sores? If so, you’ll want a way to take weight and pressure off of your buttocks, such as with a tilting or standing seat.
If you do get a power wheelchair with power seating, be sure you know how to use the functions properly to avoid injury., Some models of chair can be controlled without a joystick, using other types of voluntary motions. If this is a requirement for you, you’ll need to work with a specialized care team to pick the right equipment for you.Some alternate control styles include:Sip and puff, via inhaling and exhaling into a tube
Voice control
Chin control, foot control, and head control

, Chat with a Physical Therapist, Occupational Therapist, or Rehab Technology Supplier to get advice on what to look for in your power wheelchair. Find out if they recommend a particular brand of chair for your needs. Often these professionals have a lot of experience helping people choose the best option for their circumstances.Say something like, “I’m not sure what kind of power wheelchair to buy or what to look for. Do you have any suggestions?”

, Talk to other people you know who use or have used electric wheelchairs. Ask their opinions about the model they have, and any advice about what specifics to consider. Read user reviews online to find out what consumers think about various products. These may give you a better idea of quality than what the manufacturer promises you.


If you know someone with experience, ask them something like, “What do you like and dislike about your power wheelchair? Do you have any suggestions for when I buy one?”

, If you’re purchasing your chair through insurance like Medicare or Medicaid, private insurance, or the VA, be sure to check what they will cover. Many insurances cover only specific brands or types of chair, and you’ll want to know that before you pick one out. If you have the means to pay for your chair yourself without going through insurance, you’ll likely be able to choose from a wider variety, though of course the out-of-pocket expense will be much higher.Call your insurance company and say something along the lines of, “I would like to buy a power wheelchair. Please check my policy and tell me what options you will cover for me.”

, There is pretty significant variation among batteries in how long they hold a charge — it’s usually anywhere from 10 – 25 miles (16 – 40km).Think about how far you’ll want to be able to take your chair on a single charge. Check battery life for all the different chairs you consider to find one that meets your needs.


Battery life will vary somewhat depending on the weight the chair is carrying and the terrain.

, If the user is a child, you will need to choose a pediatric wheelchair that can accommodate growth. Most adult wheelchairs can accommodate passengers up to 300 pounds (136kg). For heavier users, look into bariatric or “heavy duty” power wheelchair options — some of which can accommodate up to 650 pounds (295 kg).Along with weight, consider getting a wider seat width for larger users.

, Remember that your needs may change over time. Whatever type of chair you choose now, be sure that you will be able to modify the device in the future. That will allow you to keep your current chair compatible with your needs, rather than having to buy a new power wheelchair in the future.Some models of wheelchair are built so that you can change or modify the steering mechanism or seating system, or even make it compatible to use with tracks in the house., Prices vary and how much you’re able to spend may limit your choices. It will help to set a budget and stay within that budget. Make a list of priorities that you want to get out of your power wheelchair, and if price is a limiting factor focus on your top one or two priorities.


For instance, consider whether you need all-terrain outdoors wheels (which are more expensive), or whether simple, cheaper wheels will suit you. Is this more or less important to you than having power seating? It’s up to you what you want to spend your money on, so know beforehand what your goals are.

, Once you have chosen your power wheelchair, it is important to go over safety and proper use. Thoroughly read through the manufacturer's guide so that you understand how to operate the device. Make sure there is a working seatbelt and wear it at all times. Other safety precautions include:Keep your hands, arms, feet and legs within the framework of the wheelchair to decrease your chances of tipping over.
Keep the battery fully charged so you don't get stranded.
Turn off the power when getting in and out of the chair.
Use caution around young children who may reach for the control unit and cause it to unexpectedly move or accelerate.
Be cautious outdoors. Avoid going outside when visibility is poor, such as at night or during bad weather. Try to avoid busy streets and intersections and do not attempt to maneuver over a curb unless the chair is designed to do so. If using the chair on a path or trail, make sure the earth is firm, fairly smooth, and dry.

Volunteer at an organization for people with special needs.
Teach or tutor younger kids to see if you enjoy working one on one with young people.
Educational diagnosticians work individually with students to diagnose learning differences and disabilities. It's their job to help figure out what a student needs to be able to learn and thrive in a school setting.;
, You can get your bachelor’s degree in education or in a variety of other subjects before deciding to become an educational diagnostician. Bachelor’s degrees generally take about four years to complete when done through a full-time program.Having a specialization in special education is considered highly advantageous when applying for jobs or graduate school. To do this, you'll need to take specific classes within your major and talk to your advisor about what's required to fulfill the specialization.If you work full-time or don’t have time for a full-time course load, you can take as much time as you need to complete your bachelor’s degree.

, The National Clearinghouse for Professionals in Special Education highly recommends that students looking to become educational diagnosticians boost their credentials by doing volunteer work with people with disabilities. Some of the groups they recommend working with are:The Association of Retarded Citizens
The National Easter Seal Society
The Special Olympics.

, In order to even begin training to be an educational diagnostician, you need to have at least two years of teaching experience.

Certification requirements for teachers vary by state. Check your state’s certification requirements on the school board’s official website.

, This is the master’s degree that you’ll need in order to pursue a certificate and career as a diagnostician. Some universities will let you complete your master’s degree and your bachelor’s degree in a combined program, which can make the entire course of study shorter and more direct.If you have already begun teaching through a certificate program, you may be too busy for a traditional master’s program. Many online programs will be able to accommodate your busy schedule.
If you have a master’s degree in another field, you may be able to get a certificate rather than having to get an entirely different master’s degree.

, Within the master’s program that you enroll in, you can pursue an Educational Diagnostician certification track. This will require you to take courses such as Educating Students with Emotional/Behavioral Disorders, Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports in Schools, Assessment and Evaluation of Students with Disabilities, Psychoeducational Assessment, Assessment and Evaluation of Students with Disabilities.If you have a master’s of education in another track, or a master’s degree in another discipline, you can potentially apply for certification through a graduate program.

Prepare for a medical career while in high school.,
Get your bachelor’s degree.,
Pass the MCAT exam.,
Apply to medical schools.,
Complete medical school and licensing exams.,
Complete a medical residency.,
Apply for jobs that emphasize diagnostics.,
Practice differential diagnosis.,
Continue to practice diagnosis as much as possible.",How to Become a Diagnostician2," If you want to become a medical diagnostician, you'll need to become a physician. To do this, you'll need to get into medical school, which is quite competitive. Begin preparing early by getting excellent grades and participating in extracurricular activities.


Great grades, standardized test scores, and a strong resume of extracurriculars make you a more attractive candidate to prestigious colleges.
While in high school, get involved in science or biology clubs to learn more about science and whether a career in medicine is right for you.

, The first step toward becoming a doctor is getting your bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university. You can choose from a variety of majors, but The College Board lists pre-medicine, biology and exercise science as suggested majors.You’ll need excellent grades in order to get into medical school, as admissions are highly competitive.
While you’re in college, participate in extracurricular activities that will help you look competitive as an applicant for medical school. Join a science club, volunteer at a hospital or hospice center, or tutor other students in science.

, The MCAT stands for Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). College juniors who plan to apply for medical school should register to take the MCAT. It is a standardized, multiple-choice exam that medical school admission committees use to assess how likely an applicant is to succeed in their program.The MCAT is notoriously rigorous. Make sure to study hard for it, giving yourself lots of time to prepare, rather than trying to cram or wing it.
Get a tutor if you need one. You can hire a private tutor or attend a test prep class offered by a private company.

, In order to be a medical diagnostician, you’ll need a medical degree. To do this, you must attend medical school. Most medical schools in the US use the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS), which centralizes the application process. This way, you can choose your preferred medical schools and submit a single application that will go to all of them.Apply to several medical schools. The application process is highly competitive, so it’s good to have a backup plan if you don’t get into your top schools.
Most students begin the application process for medical school during the summer after their junior year in college. Some choose to take a year off after completing their undergraduate degrees before applying.

, Medical school is generally four years of intensive, full time study. The curriculum includes classroom-based instruction as well as hands-on work that will bring you into a clinical setting.You’ll also need to receive a passing score on the first two parts of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). This is a three-part exam.
You must pass the first part of the exam before entering your third year of medical school. The second part is taken during your fourth year. This second part focuses more heavily on patient diagnosis, which is key to becoming a diagnostician., Your medical residency is generally a three year period after medical school when you work intensively in a specific field of medicine. It’s during this time that you get most of your experiential education to be a professional doctor. The process of matching with a residency program is complicated, but all doctors in training must go through it.If you’re planning to be a diagnostician, aim for a residency that will support that aim. Areas of specialization that are heavily focused on diagnostics include: internal medicine, emergency medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, neurology, psychiatry, radiology, radiation oncology, dermatology, and pathology.
Once you’ve completed your residency, you’ll also need to pass the third part of the USMLE and get a state license in the state you plan to practice in.
You may also choose to become certified by a board in a specific field. This is not always a requirement in order to practice in a field, but it boosts your credentials and can make you eligible for jobs such as being a medical director in a hospital or clinic.

, Many doctors begin looking for jobs during their residencies. It’s also common for residents to transition to full-time positions wherever they’ve done their residencies.If you’re looking to do something that would give you more experience in diagnostics, you can search for jobs elsewhere.
Recruiters from hospitals and private practices often seek out young doctors to hire for open positions.

, Differential diagnosis is when you take a given symptom and from that determine what it could be caused by. Diagnosticians are familiar with a range of symptoms and their possible causes. When a patient presents a given symptom, use your knowledge of medicine to determine what probably and unlikely causes are.There are online tools that offer ""instant differential diagnosis."" These can be useful and interesting to the lay person, but nothing replaces a doctor's thoughtful and experienced opinion.

, The way to build a career on being a diagnostician is to hone your skills and practice. Whether you work at a hospital or in a private practice, you can become well known as someone who does excellent diagnosis by taking your time with patients, asking the right questions, and remaining curious.Pay attention to the context in which a patient’s symptoms arise and the background story they tell you.Don’t discount uncommon possibilities simply because they’re not the most obvious.Master the art of physical examination and reading any kind of diagnostic tools, such as electrocardiography machines and medical imaging.

Choose the certification that is right for you.,
Obtain relevant work experience.,
Meet your continuing education requirements.While AADE certification has no continuing education requirement, the NCBDE certification does.",How to Become a Diabetes Educator1," Decide if you want to become certified by the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) or the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators (NCBDE). Both organizations are reputable and have nearly identical requirements.


The NCBDE certification is strictly focused on education. The AADE’s Board Certified-Advanced Diabetes Management certification, however, allows you to not only educate patients with diabetes, but also to participate in research and mentoring, adjust medications, and treat diabetes symptoms and complications.For some people, the choice may come down to how much money and time you wish to spend on getting certified. The AADE certification is more expensive and might require a longer time investment than NCBDE certification.You do not need to obtain both types of certification, but it might improve your career opportunities.;
, Relevant jobs include pharmacist, occupational or physical therapist, Dietitian, nurse, or other medical professional who provides diabetes self-management education (DSME) as part of their routine duties. You might also qualify if you have an advanced degree in a health-related field or concentration.


DSME is defined as any activity by a healthcare professional that helps patients with diabetes understand and manage their condition.For the NCBDE certification, you need at least two years’ experience in your field and at least 1,000 hours of (DSME) experience. You must have worked at least 40% of these hours (400 hours) within in the last year.Certification with the AADE requires 500 practice hours over the course of the last four years.NCBDE certification allows volunteer experience with a medical agency or health clinic to count toward your hourly total.If you don’t work in the field but still want to obtain NCBDE certification, you must provide an official transcript of your advanced degree coursework and a copy of your academic degree. The rest of your requirements are identical to a traditional applicant.

, In addition to relevant work experience, you’ll need at least 15 clock hours (not credit hours) of continuing education within the two years prior to submitting your application. These courses must be provided by an organization or institution approved by the NCBDE.


Unlike credit hours, clock hours are counted in a simple, linear way. For instance, attending a class for two hours will earn you two clock hours.
The American Medical Association, the American Diabetes Association, the American Association of Diabetes Educators, and similar organizations offer continuing education opportunities for diabetes educators.
A full list of continuing education providers is available online at http://www.ncbde.org/currently_certified/recognized-provider-list/.

, The AADE exam results are mailed six to eight weeks after taking the exam. NCBDE scores are reported in two ways: raw scores and scaled scores.


The NCBDE exam’s raw scores will give you your score as a percentage of the total number of questions you got correct out of 200. For instance, you might get a raw score of 150/200. Scaled scores are reported as a percentage of correct questions on a scale of 0 to 99. You must score at least a 70 on this scale in order to pass the exam. Using the above example — 150/200 — you would earn a 75, giving you a passing grade.

, You must recertify your NCBDE and/or AADE credentials every five years.Recertification for the NCBDE requires that you accrue at least another 1,000 hours of DSME and that you hold the same position in the same medical field that you held when you obtained certification originally.


If you cannot meet the 1,000-hour practice requirement but wish to maintain your certification, you can substitute the practice requirement for 75 clock hours of continuing education.
When your certification is close to expiration, the NCBDE, and/or AADE will send you a reminder notification along with directions outlining how to renew your certification.Renewal costs $250 for NCBDE certification and $500 for the AADE certification (or $800 if you are not an AADE member).

, With your new credentials, you’ll have a legitimate claim to expertise in the field of DSME. With your certification, you should be eligible for a pay raise. Broach the subject discretely with your employer.


You might ask, for instance, what kind of financial benefits you’re eligible for as a certified diabetes educator.
Many medical professionals find that they are more confident, respected, and financially secure as a result of earning their certification."

Decide whether you have the essential skills and abilities to become a dental assistant.,
Find out educational and pre-employment training requirements.,
Register with the State Board of Dental Examiners (SBDE).",How to Become a Dental Assistant in Texas1," The dentist’s office can be a busy place and most likely the dentist will require you to multitask and have a good attitude towards customers. A dental assistant has to balance helping the dentist with patients while performing administrative duties at the same time for at least eight hours or more per day. Since different dentists will require different skills and abilities, make sure you read the job posting closely. An internet search of “dental assistant” at the various job recruitment sites will also inform you of the general responsibilities of the position.
If you are confident enough in your abilities, then either ask your local dentist office if you can observe a day at the office or inquire about possible internships to visualize what a work day looks like.;
, Texas does not require any type of degree to begin a career as a dental assistant, but classes, credentials, and certifications exist for higher levels of compensation and responsibilities. If you want to be a dental assistant as soon as you graduate high school, make sure to take biology, chemistry, mathematics, computers, and psychology classes to better prepare yourself for the profession.
Consider attending a dental assisting school. In most cases, these schools do require a minimum of a GED to enter their classes. It is much easier to find a job in the dental assisting field with a relevant education, especially if you have no experience.
Without experience, expect it to take three to four months before you can competently complete all the necessary job duties.

, Registration with SBDE is optional. Only dental assistants who want to take x-rays need to obtain a RDA (Registered Dental Assistant). Be aware that Texas does not accept Radiology Certifications from other states. A practicing dental assistant who has performed x-rays in a different state and plans to relocate to Texas must register with the Texas Dental Board. In order to register with the SBDE, a certification for Radiology, Infection Control, and Jurisprudence must be obtained. Typically, this certification is taken online and does not require advanced study or additional materials. In fact, Texas uses the exam only as a learning tool as it is a “no fail” question and answer format.
Although out-of-state dental assistants who relocate to Texas cannot administer x-rays while waiting for their state registration, new hires, recent graduates, or any dental assistant who has never given an x-ray are permitted to take x-rays during their first year of work while they take classes that enable them to apply for an official registration.

Decide what level of dental assistant to pursue.,
Complete a dental assistance course that is approved by the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners (TSBDE).,
Attend a community college.",How to Become a Dental Assistant in Texas2," Make a decision based on experience, education, and career goals. There are three main levels of dental assistants in Texas: a qualified, registered, and certified dental assistant. However, according to the Commission on Dental Accreditation, there are no formal education requirements to enter into the dental assistant profession. If you have no experience or professional degree, then you can begin at the entry level by getting on-the-job training under the supervision of a dentist. At this level, assistants cannot use much of the equipment and no credential is awarded.
Regardless of whether you start at the entry level or have higher aspirations, Texas requires dental assistants at every level to receive on-the-job training and to successfully pass a hands-on practical examination performed on a typodont (a model of the oral cavity, including teeth, gingival, and the palate used for practice before performing procedures on live patients).

, This class is available on-line and covers the procedures for positioning and exposing dental x-rays, jurisprudence, and infection controls. These classes typically are conducted over the internet, on the weekend, or short term, but do not usually include on-the-job training.
Once you complete this course successfully, you can apply for a certificate to become a Registered Dental Assistant (RDA). This certificate officially permits the expanded responsibilities of taking dental x-rays and assisting the dentist in laboratory work.

, Most job advertisements will seek to employ dental assistants that have one to two years of experience or a qualified education substitute. By going to college, you can earn an associate degree or an accredited certificate. Once completed, graduates can become a Certified Dental Assistant (CDA) after passing an exam. A dental assisting certificate is often a one-year program that trains students how to assist with treating and caring for patients. Oftentimes, in addition to the standard requirements, schools will provide hands-on clinical training. Once the program is completed, students often take the Dental Assisting National Board exam (DANB) to earn a certificate as a CDA.
An Associate degree in Applied Science in Dental Hygiene is another option. Since this is a degree and not a certificate, it’s a multi-credited program that goes beyond the basics of becoming a dental assistant. The curriculum often focuses on preventative dental hygiene, periodontology, radiology, and oral pathology to train students in the basic performance of dental procedures. These classes prepare students to take the National Board of Dental Examination opening the door to ultimately register as a dental hygienist. "

Revise your resume.,
Network.,
Prepare for the interview.",How to Become a Dental Assistant in Texas3," If you have experience, make sure your resume is current and addresses the skills and responsibilities posted in the job advertisement. Your resume is the single most important reflection of who you are and what abilities you possess. Search for examples on the internet of how to design your resume. Basic guidelines are: use white paper, one inch margins, consistent font, and make it look aesthetically pleasing. This means keep your resume tightly organized, no spelling mistakes, and adequately-sized font.
Remember that places of employment receive hundreds of applications and will look for small errors, spelling mistakes, or any other grammatical oversights. Therefore, make sure you proofread your resume several times or ask a friend to read it over for you.
If you have very little or no work experience, focus your resume on school activities, clubs, and volunteer work. You can also create a functional resume that focuses more on your skills and abilities than on your work experience. In this case, highlight evidence that demonstrates empathy and respect, detail oriented, good communication, interpersonal skills, organization, and multitasking.

, Because dental assisting is a highly competitive profession, it is important to make contacts and establish relationships with professionals already in the field. Human Resources and managers prefer to hire somebody who comes highly recommended because of trust and the tremendous cost to hire a new employee who does not work out. Sometimes the old fashioned way is the best way. Print several copies of your resume and submit them to the local dentist offices. A smiling face with an introduction can make a lasting first impression.
It has also become fashionable to create online professional profiles of your career that showcases your skills and abilities. Try to make connections through these sites as they grow in popularity and influence.
Touch base with friends, teachers, and family members. Since many of these people go to the dentist, one of them might have a personal relationship that could initiate your first step into the world of dentistry.

, The interview is the final step to gaining employment and should be taken very seriously. This means wear the appropriate business attire, be well-groomed, and do not be late. There may be some unpredictable questions asked during the interview, but extensive preparation should be enough to help you answer even the most surprising questions. Research online for possible questions and answers, but do not overwhelm yourself trying to memorize answers to these questions.
If you have friends or acquaintances who are already dental assistants, ask them to spend some time giving you a mock interview. Responding to questions in real time will reveal how prepared you truly are for the interview.
Remember to keep your answers related to the position. If the interviewer asks, “tell me about yourself,” this is not carte blanche to talk about your life from childhood to the present day. Instead, keep it career-oriented and keep in mind the company’s profile so that you can strategically answer questions that align with the company’s mission and outlook.

Once you've passed your exam, you will receive your certificate.

, Once you're certified to perform CPR, you can move on to instructor training. If you want to take a course in person, you'll need to find one in your area. You can do this on the Red Cross website. You simply type in your zip code or city and you'll be provided a list of courses near you.Courses run on different schedules. An instructor training course may not be available right away. You may have to wait a few weeks or a few months for a class to begin.
All courses come with a fee. Usually, the fee is between $200 and $300.

, This is generally more convenient and will give you access to plenty of resources. If you can't find a class in your area, consider enrolling for an online instructor training program.If you take a course in person, you may have to pay for a textbook. With an online course, you can print materials from home and will have access to a digital textbook.
There are also a wide array of study materials, such as refresher courses, online.
You can call 1-800-RED-CROS or email support@redcrosstraining.org to ask about enrolling in an online course.

, Once you've selected a course, work hard to complete it successfully. Successful completion of an instructor training course is the final step in becoming a certified trainer.If you take an in person class, you will be emailed online activities. These must be completed before the first day of class.
Class schedules vary, but it generally does not take long to obtain certification. Some classes only consist of two full days of training.

, Once you have completed the course, you can get your certificate on your own. On the Red Cross website, you will enter your course records. You should then be able to locate a certificate issued in your name.If you're unsure how to type in your course records, try calling the Red Cross or asking your training instructor.

, You don't always get paid to teach CPR; however, it can be a rewarding experience nevertheless. You could volunteer for an emergency services organization, a school, or a hospital. Places like these are always looking for passionate individuals to volunteer., Having employees CPR certified can make for a safer work environment. This is especially true if you work in a field where there may be accidents on site. Ask your boss about doing a CPR class for your co-workers.You may get a small perk or bonus for conducting a class. However, do not expect to get paid. A lot of CPR instructors primarily do volunteer work.

, If you want to make some money as an instructor, you can advertise your services around your town. Put up fliers in places like hospitals and schools. Make it clear you're Red Cross certified CPR instructor willing to conduct classes for a fee.How much you charge is up to you, but keep your rates reasonable. If you live in a middle class area, charging $300 for a course may not get you much business. More people may be interested, however, if you offer courses for $50.

, Your certification lasts 2 years. After this point, you will need to renew your certification.You will to need take a small review course at your local Red Cross.
After taking the course, you can renew your certification.

Look around you.,
Dump any boyfriends, girlfriends, partners, or even (and especially) spouses who are outstandingly attractive, successful, radiant, or magnetic.,
Stop being cool.,
Stop doing interesting things.,
Try to develop a weekly schedule.,
Do not go to trendy stores.,
Buy clothes that do not stand out.,
Average people often have some depth to them, but it is only skin deep.,
Invite your neighbors over for a barbecue.",How to Be Average," Who do you notice while on the bus or subway? Avoid those people you noticed. They're noticeable because they are well above average, or far below. Look to the person that is sitting in the corner napping. There is your idol whom you must emulate.;
, Get someone who is worse but who does not suck. Conversely, if your partner is exceedingly repulsive, sloppy, unsuccessful and/or smelly, upgrade to one who is better, but not excellent (use your subway idol as reference and/or marry them).

, Social themes and phrases are generally to be avoided, but at the same time, do not be lame. The key is live about 5 years behind the times. That way all your catch-phrases will be well-known enough to go unnoticed.

, Hang-gliding is a perfect example of what someone who was above average would do. Stamp-collecting or bottle-cap collecting are both good substitutes. Having too many hobbies can reduce your average persona. One is often enough.

, This includes meals, activities, and social events. For example, Saturday could be meatloaf night. This reduces unexpected surprises, enhancing your average persona. Other good examples to include into your schedule are game night, leftover night, and tv dinner night.

, Generally Walmart is a good choice for pretty much everything you need ever. K-mart is also good, but K-mart is weirder than Walmart. What does the K stand for anyway? Do not look it up as trivia is a known average reducer.

, Jeans and a t-shirt are an excellent choice. You don't really need any other clothes. Why do people even need anything else? Jeans and t-shirts are so practical and cheap. Wear them as much as possible.

, Have an explanation ready if someone notices something peculiar about your behavior. ""Trying to lose a few pounds"" is a good choice for increasing both superficiality and decreasing the allure of your personality. If the explanation you've prepared does not fit their inquiry, use it as planned, and pretend you didn't hear them if they question further.

, You generally only have to do this once per neighbor or even once per neighborhood. This is too decrease any antisocial images they may have of you, while giving you an opportunity to show them how normal you are. Avoid interesting topics of conversation. Power tools or the price of gas are good conversation topics for men, while shampoo of choice, and being thrifty at the grocery store are good choices for women. If they would like (it is unlikely) to follow up with another one ""soon"", politely agree but never put any effort into actually following up.

Prepare for many years of education.,
Strive for good grades in high school.,
Learn the good, and the bad, of the job.,
Learn appropriate skills.",How to Become a Child Therapist1," To become a child psychologist, you will be expected to complete at least a Master’s Degree, preferably a PhD or doctorate. The first step to this career is to prepare yourself to focus on your education.


Make sure you have the financial means to go to school. This may involve taking out student loans.
You can offset some of these costs by looking for scholarships. The United States offers scholarships based on good grades in high school.Talk to your school counselor or your preferred undergraduate school to see what financial assistance they offer. In many cases, colleges have a dedicated financial aid department to help you with this.;
, In preparing to go to college, it is important to stand as a strong candidate for college. To do this, you should focus on:



Developing good study habits to do well on tests and homework. This includes taking good notes and having a good rapport with your teachers and mentors.
Stay on top of your homework. Homework is often an important part of your grade. Make sure you do all of your homework for each class.

Develop good time-management strategies. This is an essential skill that will help you be effective in the real world as well as your job. Establishing a good routine in high school will help you develop good habits that will carry over to your future.

, Before you invest a lot of time and effort into education, make sure you are looking at careers realistically. A high-paying child psychologist job may seem glamorous, but be sure of the good and the not-so-good aspects about a job.


Think about the amount of time you want to work. Do you want to work a 40 hour a week, or an 80 hour one?
Do you want a job where you will travel or stay in one spot?
Do you want to work with a team or alone?
Do you think you can handle a stressful job situation where you may have to talk to children who have suffered some terrible things?
How will you handle the stress of this career?

, You should acquire skills and keep practicing them. These will most certainly help you in a future career. In fact, one of the tests you must pass in order to be a practice child psychology requires testing some of these skills. Consider the following: Analytical skills — learn by practicing logic puzzles and solving problems.
Communication skills — take a speech class or practice public speaking in front of a mirror.
Observational skills — write down an idea log which helps you reflect on what you have observed throughout the day. This has been proven to improve observational skills.Patience -- Remind yourself to take your time. Make this a habit.
People skills — Try and get to know people and work well with them.

Trustworthiness -- Try and be as honest as possible so you can be someone a patient can trust.

Think critically.,
Communicate effectively.,
Be detail-oriented.,
Organize efficiently.,
Maintain physical stamina.,
React and think quickly.",How to Be a Good Nurse1," Nursing is a lot like a game of chess. It’s complex and you have to think several moves ahead. You need to be able to assess a patient critically to determine his medical needs, while taking multiple factors and potential outcomes into account.Critical thinking is a process by which you review the situation, analyze what’s going on, and question what you don’t know. You can break the process down into 5 steps:Step 1: Identify the goal, the problem, or the issue.
Step 2: Review and diagnose the goal, problem, or issue. What information do you have available about the goal, problem, or issue? Based on the information you have, what’s the best resolution?
Step 3: Explore your options. Think about what the resolutions may be, and how and who would actually achieve them.
Step 4: Actually carry out the resolution. Get it done.
Step 5: Reflect on your success or failure. What went well and what didn’t go so well? What can you do better or differently next time? How do we learn from this experience?

;
, Nurses need to be able to communicate with their patients in order to understand how their patients are feeling and what they are concerned about. Communicating effectively means you can listen well when someone else is speaking to you, and that you can speak clearly and concisely to someone else (e.g. patient, doctor, other nurses, family members, etc.). As a nurse you’re also likely to make a lot of notes whether in a physical chart or on the computer, therefore you must also be able to communicate effectively in writing as you may not be there in person to explain what you meant.Keep in mind that you will be dealing with many different nationalities, including people who may not speak the same language as you or the doctor. Find out what services are available to the patient to help them communicate effectively — are there interpreters on staff? Are you aware of any cultural beliefs or practices that might interfere with their health?
As a good nurse you need to be able to listen to a doctor’s instructions and carry out those instructions quickly without needing to clarify every detail. In order to do this you need to be able to listen to the doctor in what is likely a fast-paced and hectic environment while you’re doing something else.At the same time, don't hesitate to ask questions to clarify what is needed. Doctors, just as nurses, need to communicate effectively. If it is not clear what the physician/provider is trying to relay, keep asking questions.
An exceptional nurse not only listens and carries out instruction, they advocate for their patients. Because of your excellent listening skills, you’ve developed an understanding of your patients, how they feel, and what they want. You should also understand that your patients may be a little intimidated speaking up and asking their doctor specific questions, or making requests. As their nurse, you may need to do the speaking up for your patients. Encourage your patient to write down questions that they want answered and that you know them as well to help facilitate questions. If the patient can not ask them, then ask the questions for your patient.
To learn more about being an effective communicator, you can read the following wikiHow article, How to Communicate Effectively.

, Being detail-oriented means you pay attention to both the big stuff and the small stuff. When dealing with a patient, even the smallest anomaly or symptom can be a big deal, so you need to always be paying attention. Being detail-oriented means you ensure all your patients get the exact treatment they need, when they need it.While not exactly the same, being detail-oriented has a lot to do with being organized. It’s easier to pay attention to the details when you are organized.
Detail-oriented also means being accurate. In the medical field you can’t estimate or guess at the amount of medication you give a patient, you need to be accurate. Your patient’s life may depend on it.Being detail-oriented also means paying attention. Getting distracted or allowing your mind to wander will likely result in you missing something important. Because all details regarding your patient’s care are critical, you need to remain focused and on task at all times., Nurses, especially those working in a hospital, need to deal with multiple patients at the same time. Each patient has their own personal requirements that are critical to their well-being. Each patient also has his or her own personality and emotional needs. As a nurse you need to be able to organize yourself to keep track of who each of your patients are, what their treatments are, when they need their treatments, and the small details about the patient that will help them feel better (both physically and emotionally).Being able to organize yourself efficiently means being able to do the following things when needed:Learning to say no. While you may not be able to say no very often at work, you can certainly say no in your personal life. Sometimes being able to clear out all the stuff you don’t really want to be doing will lower your stress level overall and help you become more focused when you’re at work.
Finding balance in your life. There is such a thing called caregiver burn out. Always ask yourself before accepting an extra shift: what the benefit it and what is the cost? If the cost is personal loss of perceived health, sleep, enjoyment, then the extra money is not worth it.
Asking for help. If you are new to the nursing field, you are going to need to ask for help. Don’t be afraid to ask, just ask. Once you’ve asked chances are you’re going to be able to move forward with what you need to do, and understand how to efficiently carry out that task the next time.
Prioritizing. Being organized means being able to prioritize all the tasks you have on your to do list. Knowing which ones are more important or which ones have the earliest due dates.
Spending your time wisely. Think about all the things you need to do in the next little while, and carry those tasks out efficiently. If you need to go to the storeroom for one thing, think about all the things you need in there over the next little while so you only have to make one trip. Don’t waste your time doing repetitive and unnecessary tasks.

, Most nurses will be on their feet for their entire shift, which can last 12 hours or more. Nurses may also need to restrain patients, help patients walk from one place to another, hold patients up, move patients to and from a bed or gurney, and other physically demanding tasks. If you aren’t up to the physical requirements of the job, you will likely be in a lot of pain at the end of a shift.Personal health must be observed first — how can you advise health-related behavior if you do not observe it yourself?
Physical stamina isn’t just about being able to do physical activities, it’s about being able to do them over a long period of time, over and over again.
As a nurse you’re allowed to wear scrubs and comfortable shoes — take advantage of this. There is nothing worse than being on your feet for 12 hours in shoes that are really painful.

, The medical profession in general isn’t the type of profession where you can always just sit back and ""wait and see."" In many cases, as a nurse, you’ll notice something and need to react to it quickly. You won’t always get the chance to pause and evaluate all the options and debate back and forth with another nurse as to the best course of action — sometimes you just need to act.Being able to think and react quickly comes with experience and confidence. The more experience and confidence you gain, the faster your ability to react will become.
Thinking and reacting quickly can also include knowing when it’s time to get help from someone else ASAP. Don’t worry if you may be overreacting or if someone will have a bad opinion of you because you bothered them, those things aren’t important. Keep in mind that your patient’s well-being is always the most important thing and react quickly when that well-being is in jeopardy.
Reacting quickly doesn’t mean forgoing critical thinking; it means going through the critical thinking process quickly and carrying out your decision immediately.

Apply for an undergraduate degree.,
Take helpful classes.,
Cultivate connections.,
Prepare for graduate school.",How to Become a Child Therapist2," An undergraduate degree is a must have in child counseling. When applying to school, make sure the school has the appropriate programs. You can often research specific programs on the school’s website. You’ll want to look for a school that meets the following criteria:


It is accredited and legally able to grant a degree.It offers programs in clinical psychology, forensic psychology, industrial-organizational psychology, or sports psychology.

, You will want to take the classes that will help to grant your degree. A school advisor should be able to help you make sure you are doing so. However, you should also consider taking electives or additional classes that will help you stand out as a candidate for graduate school and a career. These classes may include:


Biology and anatomy courses
Sociology courses
Math and science courses
Communication, public speaking, and writing courses
Nursing courses
Any psychology courses (even if they’re not specialized in children. This is a great opportunity to learn more about how the brain works), Since you know you will likely be going to graduate school, it is important to make connections and friends with people in the field. You will need these connections to:


Ask for letters of recommendations.
Have friends in the field.
Have potential mentors to help you in the future.
Help you get into graduate school.
Help you obtain a job.

, In your junior year of your undergraduate, you will want to start to think seriously about graduate school. This is the time where you will start to research schools (see next section) and collect application materials. At this time, you should think about:


Geographically, where you might want to attend school.
Who you might ask for letters of recommendation.
What written material or research you will want to submit into your application.
If you can afford graduate school, or will you need to start to look for assistantships or scholarships.

"
"
Research graduate programs.,
Ask for letters of recommendation.,
Write a statement of purpose.,
Take GRE or MCAT.,
Apply to graduate school.,
Make connections.,
Start inquiring about jobs.",How to Become a Child Therapist3," Before you apply to graduate school, you will need to research the type of graduate school you would like to enter. There are many schools out there, but you will want to look for a school that will help you focus on what specific career you are looking for. For example:


If you are looking for a school you can do research, you may want to look into RI institutions, which are ranked the best for research.If you want to specifically work in counseling and prevention, you should consider a school that offers specific clinicals or internships.
If you want to teach child psychology, consider entering a school with an emphasis in pedagogy and teaching.

, You need to call on your old connections to ask if they would be willing to write you a letter of recommendation. These connections should be people that can reflect on your academic, professional, or personal merit.


You may consider asking old professors, primary investigators (from labs), advisors, or employers (if applicable).

, Many graduate schools require a statement of purpose/intent for their applications. These statements ask you to specifically articulate why you want to enter the program and what you will bring to the school.

, Some graduate schools will require you take the GRE, which is a general graduate school examination (similar to the ACT/SAT for undergraduates). As of 2015, the MCAT, traditionally used for medical school, added psychology and sociology to their tests. Your school of choice will more than likely have a preference on which you will need to take.Both the GRE and the MCAT have test prep materials on their websites. Often, when you sign up for these tests, you will have an opportunity to take practice tests.

, After you have your materials together, it is time to apply to graduate school. This process can be daunting, but it helps immensely if you have prepared your materials in advance. Here are common requirements for graduate school applications:Statement of intent/purpose
Writing sample
Letters of recommendation (usually 3)
High school and undergraduate transcripts
GRE/MCAT scores
FASFA information
TESOL/TEFOL information (if applicable)

, Just like undergraduate, you will want to make connections to cohorts and mentors alike. They can really help you secure a job or help you with whatever you may struggle with. In graduate school, work can sometimes be overwhelming, take advantage of:


Departmental meet-and-greets
Opportunities to present research
University programs specifically for graduate students (for example, Graduate Student Senate or a graduate student psychology group)
Invited presentations/lectures

, Graduate programs should have some way to help you obtain a job when you graduate. This might be required professional development including clinical work or internships. Or, you might have an opportunity to do laboratory work with a mentor or professor.


Always keep an eye out for these opportunities, even if they are not mandatory, as they can go a long way in helping you to secure a job.

Decide where you wish to practice.,
Take the EPPP as soon as possible.,
Get your supervised professional experience hours.,
Pass your jurisprudence exam.,
Take the oral exam, if required.",How to Become a Child Therapist4," Licensing varies state by state and, though it has become easier to obtain licensure mobility (the ability to obtain licensing in other jurisdictions),you should try to have an idea of where you'd like to practice and where you might like to practice in the future.


Learn the current licensing laws specific to your state and other states where you would consider living. You can research the license requirements unique to each state by entering the relevant information on the asppb website.
Most states will require that you have obtained your post-doctorate, pass the Examination for Professional Practice of Psychology (EPPP), pass a jurisprudence or ethics exam, pass an an oral exam, and that you've completed a certain number or hours (between 1,500 and 6,000) of ""supervised professional experience"" (the definition of which varies by state)., The EPPP is a multiple-choice test that covers your foundational, text book knowledge of psychology.The sooner you take it after grad school, the less you'll have to re-learn. Check the requirements to take the EPPP within your state.You need to get about 70% of the questions correct to pass the EPPP. You are not penalized for incorrect answers, so if you find yourself running out of time (the test takes 4 hours and 15 minutes), it's better to guess the answers than to leave them blank.Take practice exams to familiarize yourself with the types of questions you will be asked and to get used to the time limitations. Go back over the test and figure out where your knowledge is strong and in which subjects you'll need to review heavily., This can be tricky, as state requirements can vary widely. On average, states require between 3,000 – 4,000 hours of experience.What qualifies as experience can also vary from state to state. Your state may or may not require internships to be APA-accredited.Cover your bases by fulfilling the maximum number of hours required in most states. Even if the state in which you currently live only requires 1,500 hours, you should aim for 2,000 hours in an APA-accredited internship and 2,000 hours in a supervised postdoc.This will give you the most flexibility and mobility later on, as this will fulfill most state requirements., Again, this will vary by state, so you need to research the requirements to find out when you are eligible to take the test, the topics covered, and how to get approval to take the exam. It may be online, taken in a classroom, open or closed book.


This exam will cover state-specific laws and the ethics code of the APA., Depending on your state, you may also need to pass an oral exam. The purpose and format of these exams is incredibly varied, so research the requirements within your state to prepare."

Research certifications.,
Prepare for credentials review.,
Pass the practice sample review.,
Ace your oral examinations.,
Demonstrate domains of competency.",How to Become a Child Therapist5," If you live, or intend to practice in the United States, you will be working with the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP) to earn certifications. You will need to have earned your license to pursue other certifications.


It is always a good idea to talk to a trusted adviser about what examinations and certifications you should pursue. Some jobs require unique certifications, but almost all require passing the ABPP certification., This first stage of the ABPP examination is just an objective examination of your educational history. The review board will make sure you have successfully completed the appropriate schooling necessary. This includes both your undergraduate and graduate studies and includes any accomplished research or publication.

, This is the second part of the ABPP examination and requires you to pass a written examination based on the field. The organization will ask you to submit a statement of purpose detailing your content expert knowledge of your preferred field., Depending on how well you do on the previous portions of the exams, the board may ask you to be able to orally defend your material. This is just a review of your previous supplied materials.


Often, this is organized depending on the needs of the review board., The last part of the examination is for you to show that you are competent in your expertise. The board requires you to submit evidence of successful practice. This may include a recording of you in a therapy session or evidence of laboratory work.


This state of the examination is dependent on your future career goals. The board will help you determine what will be appropriate to submit at this portion."

Understand and have the ability to be compassionate.,
Have emotional stability.,
Take responsibility.,
Respect everyone.,
Keep calm under pressure and during a crisis.,
Adapt to new and constantly changing situations.,
Improve your knowledge constantly.",How to Be a Good Nurse2," One of a nurse's main jobs is to take direct care of patients. You’ll likely see these people at their worst. Nurses need to understand that their patients are human beings that are probably stressed, scared, depressed, upset, in pain, and confused. This understanding requires the ability to be compassionate and empathetic. Being able to put yourself in your patient’s shoes will help you understand what she's going through, and what she needs from you.Often times, because a patient sees nurses most often, those nurses get the brunt of any anger the patient is feeling. Being compassionate and empathetic means you do not take this anger personally. Patients are likely sick or injured and not having a very good day! Understanding that some patients may need to release their anger in order to reduce their stress or fear is what being compassionate is all about.
In addition to patients, nurses often deal with the family and friends of their patients. Being compassionate and empathetic means being able to show those family members and friends that you truly do care about your patient and are doing your absolute best to help her.The following six steps can help you learn to be a more compassionate person:Step 1: Listen without judgement or formulating an immediate response. Try to understand the person's feelings, needs, and wants so that you can formulate a plan to best help her.
Step 2: Reply back to the speaker based on her emotions and not her words. For example, mean and angry words are likely a sign of someone who is scared or fearful.
Step 3: Make sure you have someone who is compassionate to you. This means having your own support system at or outside of work. If you have a million problems on your mind, it may be harder to care about the problems of others.
Step 4: Think about the whole person, not just who she is at that very moment. You’re going to see many people at their worst, but that’s not who they really are. Remember that there is much more to your patients than just what you see.
Step 5: Think about a time when you were in a similar situation. You may have an actual memory of your own you can borrow from, or you may simply need to imagine yourself in that situation. Think about all the emotions you went through (or would go through) and how you felt (or would feel) in that situation.
Step 6: Be able to forgive yourself for failure. In essence, have some compassion for yourself. You’re not going to be perfect. You’re going to make mistakes. But you’re human, and that’s normal. Don’t beat yourself up.



, Being a nurse means you’re going to see people at their very worst. You’ll likely have to take care of patients who are about to die. You may need to take care of patients in an extreme amount of pain. You may need to take care of patients who have just been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. Constantly being around people who are suffering can take an emotional toll on you. As a nurse you need to be able to control your emotions while you’re on the job, and not allow those emotions to cloud your judgement or slow your reaction time.Being emotionally stable doesn’t mean keeping all your emotions bottled-up forever. It means knowing when the time is right for letting those emotions out. And allowing yourself that emotional release on a regular basis. Try exercise, time with friends, yoga, reading, and developing hobbies.
Emotional stability also doesn’t mean developing an ice-cold personality where you do not allow yourself to care about anything. You need to allow yourself to care about your patients in order to provide them with compassion and empathy.
Having, or being able to have, emotional stability may mean you have to do certain things outside of work so you’re able to control your emotions at work. One helpful way to develop stable emotions and have better control over your mood is to practice mindfulness.This means being in the moment without thinking about the past, the future, or anything judgmental.

, Being a responsible nurse means not cutting any corners. Not allowing yourself to make an error, but if you do, making sure the proper people know about the error you made and making sure it’s corrected as soon as possible. Being responsible also means using your best judgement when evaluating a patients' needs and making good decisions that are in the best interests of your patients.If you are a nurse that works in an emergency room or an operating room, or something similar, you also need to be responsible with your time. You need to understand that things do not always go as planed, and emergencies do not happen on a schedule that matches your shifts. A good nurse is prepared to work longer if necessary and understand that’s just part of the job.

, In addition to being compassionate, empathetic, and sympathetic to your patients and their needs, you also need to be respectful and non-judgemental about the decisions your patient has made in life. It is not up to you, as a nurse, to judge your patients. It is up to you to help them and make sure they leave you care in the best possible condition — regardless of how they may have ended up in your care in the first place. It also means not treating patients differently because of their backgrounds, ethnicity, or personality. A homeless man who is being treated for a drug overdose deserves just as much respect from you as a pregnant woman who has been hit by a car.Being respectful of your patients also means being truthful with them. When communicating news — good or bad — you need to understand that the patient has the right to honesty. Be straight-forward with your patients, but do it respectfully and with compassion.

, Keeping calm means maintaining your level-headedness. It means having confidence in what you’re doing and the decisions you’re making. Your confidence will grow not only throughout your education, but the longer you’re on the job. And as such, your ability to remain calm will also improve. As a nurse, you can’t panic when something unexpected happens, and you can’t freeze up because you aren’t sure what to do.When you’re first learning your job and there’s an emergency situation, a more experienced nurses may push you out of the way and take over. Do not take this personally or be upset. Use this moment to observe exactly what’s going on, what the nurse is doing and how, and the specific details that are driving the nurse’s decisions. Watching a more experienced nurse, especially in a crisis, can be one of your most useful learning experiences.
Find out if there are trainings offered to help you work through specific scenarios such as sudden cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, or stroke. By attending these trainings, you can practice going through these steps in a less intense environment so that in the real situation, you will be able to work through it easier.

, As a nurse no two days will ever be the same. While you may have some routine, it is likely that that routine will also change every now and again. No two patients are going to behave the same, even when they’re getting the exact same treatment. Nurses need to be adaptable and flexible. Nurses need to understand that their work environment and job requirements will change on a daily basis. Being flexible and adaptable, and just going with the flow, will not only help your day go smoother, it will help reduce the amount of stress you feel., Nurses, just like many professions, are constantly learning. Whether they learn through a formal classroom environment, or simply by observing, doesn’t matter. What matters is that you are constantly improving your knowledge and skills, and recognizing specific areas where you might need improvement. It also means receiving feedback from your peers and supervisors critically, and working with your supervisor and others to correct any deficiencies you have with your skills."

Soy (tofu, edamame, soy milk)
Flax seed
Fruits such as avocado, dried figs, oranges, pears and nectarines
Vegetables such as Brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes, asparagus, and turnips

, Insoluble fiber is not dissolved in water and it is not easily broken down. It passes through the body mostly intact, absorbing water and allowing stool to pass through the body more quickly., If diarrhea is a problem for you, try cutting back for a while on the following:Skins of fruits and vegetables
Wheat
Bran
Corn and beans
Whole grains

, Increasing your fluid intake can help with the absorption of food and may aid in softening the stool, which helps prevent excessive straining during bowel movements and alleviates constipation. It also helps people experiencing diarrhea to replace the lost fluids that they need.Drink enough water, juice, and/or non-caffeinated teas so that you’re not feeling thirsty and have clear or light yellow urine.

, Caffeine stimulates activity in the colon, which may worsen diarrhea symptoms.Caffeine also causes the constriction of blood vessels, which reduces the blood supply to different part of the body. When there is reduced blood supply to the abdominal muscles, the gastrointestinal system is stimulated to produce strong contractions and an increase in bowel movements.
Limit caffeine intake to no more than 3 cups of coffee or tea per day (2 cups of coffee if you drink filtered coffee and not instant).
Try weaning yourself from it completely (quitting gradually to avoid headaches) and see if this helps your IBS symptoms.

, Alcohol and carbonated beverages can also worsen symptoms of diarrhea.Have at least two alcohol free days per week, and if you do drink occasionally, have no more than two drinks (one shot glass of liquor, one 12 oz. beer, or one 5 oz. glass of wine) in a day. The less, the better.

, Foods that are high in fat are triggers for both constipation and diarrhea, as well as abdominal pain.Avoid completely or eat very little of the following foods: butter, cakes and pastries, cheese, fried and greasy foods, salad dressings and oils, and fatty meats such as sausage.
Try cooking foods in ways besides frying such as steaming, microwaving, grilling, roasting, and baking.

, Artificial sweeteners are made of chemicals that may interfere with the normal functioning of the intestines, and will introduce toxins into the body, thus delaying digestion and worsening the condition.


Products used as substitutes for natural sugar, like sorbitol, can also cause diarrhea due to its laxative effect.
Artificial sweeteners are commonly used in processed foods like: baked goods, candy, canned goods, dairy products, jams, jellies, powdered drink mixes, puddings, and soft drinks.
Fructose can also cause diarrhea in some people because it is not well absorbed. Limit your intake of fruit juice to one glass per day, and limit your use of honey, which also contains fructose.

, Certain foods can make IBS worse by causing severe gaseous pain and discomfort, and should be eaten in moderation.These foods include: beans, Brussel sprouts, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, carbonated drinks, hard candy, lettuce, milk products, onions, and whole grain foods.

, Psyllium husk is available at most health food stores. Many people with IBS report feeling better after taking psyllium husk. Add ½ to 2 tsp of psyllium seed to a glass of warm water and drink it before it thickens.Or, if you’re using a commercial product that contains psyllium, follow the directions on the package. If you’re not used to taking it, it’s best to begin with a low dose.

, They may not work for everyone, but some people report feeling better from taking them. Probiotics ensure there is enough “good bacteria” in the stomach and intestines to help break down food. The supplements (tablets and capsules) as well as yogurt drinks can be found at health food stores., FODMAPs are foods that a surprising amount of people are sensitive to. The acronym stands for Fermentable (carbohydrates that are broken down by bacteria instead of digestive enzymes and become too fermentable), Oligosaccharides (short chain carbohydrates), Disaccharides (pairs of sugar molecules such as milk lactose) Monosaccharides (single sugar molecule such as fructose) and Polyols (sugar alcohols like xylitol and sorbitol)


Low-FODMAP friendly foods (foods okay to eat) include: bean sprouts, low servings of broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, and celery, chickpeas, cucumber, eggplant, green beans, bell peppers, squash and zucchini, potatoes and sweet potatoes, kale, lettuce, leeks, tomatoes (except for cherry tomatoes).
More good (low-FODMAP) foods are: bananas, blueberries, cantaloupe, grapes, kiwi, lemon and lime, orange, raspberries and strawberries, pineapple, passion fruit, chicken, beef, lamb, pork, turkey, most fish and seafood, almonds, rice and rice flour products, polenta, quinoa, spelt, butter, many types of cheese, and eggs.
Fermented foods that might help ease IBS include raw sauerkraut; raw kimchi; kombucha; fermented milk products (clabber, yogurt, cheese, buttermilk); kefir; and fermented soy products (natto, miso, tempeh, soy sauce, fermented tofu).

, Noting the time of day helps track exactly when symptoms do or do not occur.It is better to eat meals at approximately the same time of day. This will train your digestive tract so there is enough time for the emptying of the abdomen to take place before the next meal is eaten.
Have dinner at least 2 hours before bedtime. This allows for proper digestion to take place and for the digestive tract to have time to rest overnight, which provides a good night’s sleep.

, Note down the type of food, including the brand of the food.


By recording what you eat and how you feel afterward, you’ll learn what foods agree with you and which ones don’t.

, Ensure that your food is chewed thoroughly. This helps to ease digestion and may help relieve IBS-related symptoms. Eating slowly also helps people to not overeat, and overeating could make symptoms of IBS feel worse., This should be done approximately 1 hour after eating.This way, you can track the foods that worsen your IBS symptoms and those that alleviate your condition.
Note any effects of food in your body including: gaseous discomfort, abdominal pains, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.

, Small, more frequent meals as opposed to fewer, larger meals can help to reduce diarrhea and cramping pain.


With smaller meals, the abdomen is emptied more frequently, which relieves symptoms caused by IBS.

, Since stress can contribute to worsening symptoms of IBS, stress-relieving activities are advised to help relieve them.Get 20 minutes of exercise each day. You can walk, run, bike, swim, play sports, etc. Getting enough exercise lowers stress and keeps your body healthy.
Try yoga or meditation. Sign up for a local yoga class to learn poses, or if you already know some basic poses, take time to do them at home. Meditating can also be beneficial to relieving stress, so give this a try if you’re unable to practice yoga.

, Various stimuli can trigger an outbreak of IBS, although it varies from one person to another. Not all people with the condition react to the same stimuli. Common triggers include:


Foods: The relationship between food intake and IBS is yet to be fully established, although there are individuals who manifest more serious symptoms when they consume certain foods. This article focuses mostly on diet triggers, but we will also name other known triggers in this step.

A wide range of foods have been implicated in the triggering of IBS: chocolate, spices, fats, fruits, beans, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, milk, carbonated beverages and alcohol are a few.


Hormones: Changes in hormonal levels in the body may aggravate symptoms related to IBS. It may be that these hormonal changes are why IBS is more likely to develop in women, though this has not been proven. Most of the symptoms are experienced during or around menstrual periods.
Other medical illnesses: IBS can be triggered by other types of illnesses like bacterial overgrowth (elevated number of bacteria in the intestines) or gastroenteritis (acute episode of infection diarrhea).
Stress: Most people with IBS find their symptoms become worse during more stressful events. While stress does not cause the symptoms, it can aggravate them., There are three types of IBS, characterized by their signs and symptoms. The are IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS with constipation (IBS-C), or IBS with both diarrhea and constipation (IBS-M). Symptoms may be differ from person to person and may resemble other diseases, which can make it difficult to diagnose and treat.Signs and symptoms of IBS-D include: abdominal pain, frequent loose stools, gas, mucus in the stool.
Signs and symptoms of IBS-C include: bloating, abdominal pain, abnormally infrequent stools, hard or lumpy stool, gas, and mucus in the stool.
IBS-M will have both diarrhea and constipation and may have the other common symptoms as well.

, If you have not yet been diagnosed with IBS, you should see a doctor because some of the signs are similar to those of other disorders and diseases.


Your doctor will help rule out other conditions, and you will be diagnosed with IBS if it is nothing else and you have abdominal discomfort at least three days a month for the past three months, feel better upon having a bowel movement, and/or have altered frequency and consistency of stool.Definitely see a doctor right away if you also are experiencing:

Rectal bleeding (blood in the stool)
Weight loss
Abdominal pain that progresses or occurs at night

Indulge once in a while.",How to Stick to a Diet," You can stay motivated by setting goals and keeping them throughout the course of your diet. If your goal is just to ""lose weight,"" then you won't be nearly as motivated as you would be if you had a specific goal and a plan for how you would reach it. Here's what to do:


First, figure out how much weight you want to lose, and how quickly you want to lose it. Make sure to set realistic goals. You can't lose 50 pounds in a month, but you can lose five pounds in a month if you stick to your plan. Your end-date could be a specific time like your wedding, your friend's beach barbecue, or the start of a new school year.
Understand where you are now. What is your starting point? You can go visit a physical trainer for a fitness assessment or measure your waist, hips, and thighs so that you can compare your later progress to where you are now.
Set a game plan for each week. How much weight do you want to lose per week? Pick one day to weigh yourself each week. Don't weigh yourself every single day or you will become obsessed with your weight.
Set a workout routine for each week. Though you can't plan your workout schedule months in advance, at the beginning of every week, plug a few workout dates into your schedule.
You can stick to your plan by keeping a log of what you ate, how much you worked out, and how much weight you've lost each week. The log can be helpful, but make sure it doesn't make you obsess over every single thing you eat.
You can also keep a diary that charts your dieting thoughts and analyzes what worked and what didn't. This will help you get in touch with yourself.;
, Whenever you begin to slip, you should remind yourself why you're dieting. Do want to get in shape for bikini season, or is your weight loss seriously affecting your health? Do you just want to lose those pesky 20 pounds you gained since college? Whatever your reason, keep telling yourself that you're determined to stick to your plan so you can reach your goal. Here are some ways to stay mentally strong when you feel like giving up:


Keep an image in your head of what you are planning to change about yourself, like mental before and after photos. Some people have an old photograph of themselves from when they were their desired weight. Stick a photo or representation of this goal on the fridge to motivate you. If you ever think you can't be bothered to go to the gym, or want to splurge on a tub of ice cream, just remember your goal image.
Keep motivational quotes on your computer or posted above your desk. This will help you remember to stay focused on your reasons for dieting.
If you're trying to return to your former weight, you can keep a picture of that time period on your desk.
Keep an index card that lists your reasons for dieting in your purse or wallet, so you can read it any time you forget why you're doing the diet in the first place.

, It takes a lot of mental strength to stick to a diet, and you should remind yourself that you're doing a great job from time to time. If you reward yourself for good behavior, then you'll be more motivated to continue staying tough and losing weight. Here's how to do it:


Reward yourself every five or ten pounds. Depending on how much weight you plan to lose, you should set up a rewards system every time you reach a new goal weight. You can get a massage or pedicure, buy a smaller pair of pants, or see a movie.
If you've been really healthy during the week, reward yourself on the weekends. You can't eat really healthy every day of your life.
Don't forget to tell yourself how amazing you are every time you lose a pound. Your rewards for losing weight don't always have to be food related. You can tell yourself that you'll buy a new pair of shoes if you keep up your diet for a month.

, You'll be much more motivated if you have a diet buddy or other people to share your dieting woes with. This will make it easier for you to stay on track, because you will have someone there to encourage you. Here's how to make sure you don't diet alone:


Find a diet buddy. If you are trying to improve your body at the same time as someone else you know, then you can share tips, work out together and motivate each other. Setting a gym schedule with that person, or planning weekly healthy meals with that person, can help you stay on the right path.
Join a weight loss organization such as Weight Watchers. Whether you go to Weight Watchers meetings or just use the online resources, you will be motivated from knowing that there are thousands of people who are in the same boat as you.
Discuss your plans with your doctor to make sure that any weight loss organization or support group you join is appropriate for you and your medical history.
If you can't find a diet or workout buddy, find someone you can confide in, such as a friend or significant other. That person can help you stay focused and can listen to you if you're having a hard time following your diet.

, If you start to cut meals out, then you'll just feel tired, sluggish, and hungry, which will make you loose motivation. Choose foods like oatmeal for breakfast which keep you full for a long time, preventing unhealthy snacking before lunch. Eat dinner soon after getting home from work or school so that you don't pig out when you get in.


Remember that breakfast really is the most important meal of the day. If you skip it, you will be much hungrier when you eat lunch and dinner and will eat more.
Don't skip a meal just because you feel guilty for indulging the night before. This will actually get you more off track.
If you have a busy schedule, try to plan when you'll have your three meals in advance. This will help you avoid tempting foods that you may come across during the time of a skipped meal.

, Though you shouldn't have to throw out all of the foods in your fridge and pantry, if you minimize the unhealthy foods in your home, you will be less likely to eat them. You can go through all of the unhealthy foods in your home and decide if you want to throw them out, make a family member eat them, or bring them to work and give them away.Some of the foods that you think are unhealthy are only unhealthy in excess. For example, if you eat a cup of peanut butter, you won't be helping your weight, but if you resolve to only eat a spoonful of peanut butter with celery at a time, you can keep the food.
You can also get rid of the unhealthy foods in your house by making a shopping list that only contains the healthy foods you want to eat on it. When you go shopping, you can be determined to only buy the foods on the list so you don't come home with new unhealthy foods.
Replace your unhealthy foods with healthy ones. Get rid of your ice cream and replace it with yogurt or fruit popsicles. You should still always keep some snacking options in your home.

, The trick is to not think, ""Oh, I'm going out tonight, so I'm going to completely break my diet and pick it up again tomorrow."" Though you will be faced with more temptations if you're out at a party or going to dinner with your friends, you don't have to completely give up on your diet for a night. Here's how to stay on track while you're out:


Eat before you go out to a party. If you're going out to a party where you know you'll see a lot of delicious snacks, eat a solid meal before so you're less likely to get hungry and grab a snack. Make this meal a healthy, vegetable-based dish, such as a salad. The fiber will make you feel full so that you do not eat as much party food.
Bring snacks with you wherever you go. If you're at a place that has few healthy options, like a movie theatre, bring a bag of almonds, grapes, or trail mix with you to avoid snacking on buttery popcorn.
Choose the healthiest options of what you do see at dinner. If you're out for dinner, pick the healthier items on the menu, like grilled chicken, brown rice, or salad, instead of the most greasy or high-fat options. You can still be healthy while eating out.
Choose healthy snacks over unhealthy ones. If you're at a party where there are a ton of snacks, snack on the foods in the veggie tray or pita chips instead of the plate of brownies or nachos.

, Eating at home is the easiest way to make sure to avoid temptation. If you're cooking at home, you can control everything that goes into your menu. When you're eating out, though you can choose healthier options, you won't have as much control over what you eat. Here's how to make the most of eating at home:


Become a master chef. If you develop a love of cooking, you'll be more motivated to cook and will be excited to find new healthy recipes.
Invite your friends to eat in instead of going out. Once you develop your cooking skills, if a friend asks you out to dinner, you can offer to stay in and cook instead. Not only will this be cheaper, but you'll be able to eat healthy in a more intimate atmosphere.
Try to eat lunch at home or pack your lunch as much as you can. It's easy to splurge on fast food, especially if you're in the middle of a busy work day, but if you pack a simple sandwich or salad with you in the morning, you'll be less likely to want to eat something unhealthy.

, There's no point starting a diet with the intention of eating foods you don't enjoy just because they'll make you skinny. Try out different recipes, and do little things to change your fat intake. Being on a diet doesn't mean that you should eat foods that you normally hate, but that you should discover new and healthier foods that can help you shed some pounds. Here's what to do:


Go to your local farmer's market or the produce section of your grocery store. Make a goal of picking one new fruit and one new vegetable a week, and learning how to include it in a delicious recipe.
Avoid the foods you hate. If you just can't stand the taste of tofu or just really hate brown rice, don't torture yourself by making yourself eat it.
Find a way to put a healthy spin on your favorite meal. If you love spaghetti and meatballs, try a whole wheat pasta with veggie meatballs instead. Try adding extra vegetables to the sauce as well.

, Try a dance class, or different types of sports like tennis or swimming. If you find something you enjoy, then you're much more likely to do it often. If you like running, it could be a way to get some sun and enjoy a pretty view. Here's how to do it:


Don't do anything that feels like torture. If you've always hated running, you don't have to do it. Try making a goal of walking for twenty minutes a day instead if you like doing that.
Try new workouts that you've never done before. Take a dance, yoga, or pilates class and see if you've found a new passion.
Mix it up. If you don't mind running but don't want to do it three times a week, you can run one day, do yoga another day, and swim on a third day. This will keep your body and mind active and won't make you feel bored through a workout.
Don't overdo it. You don't have to exercise every day, or even five or six times a week, to get a great workout. Let your body rest if you're tired and you'll enjoy your ""on days"" even more.

, You won't be able to stick to your diet if you find yourself so hungry that any food at all sounds appealing. If you're hungry, then you're much less likely to make rational decisions about what to eat next. Being hungry will also make you feel cranky, weak, and tired, and generally negative. Here's how to avoid being hungry:


Make sure to have a meal or a light snack every few hours. Don't go five or six hours without food.
Always keep healthy snacks with you wherever you go.
If you know you'll be having a late lunch or dinner, factor a snack into your day or you'll be too hungry by the the time the meal arrives.
Don't starve yourself. Generally speaking, starving for women means eating less than 1,200 calories a day and for men, it means eating less than 1,500 calories a day. Not only will this just make you feel weak and lightheaded, but it is also dangerous and difficult to keep up on a long-term basis.

, In addition to rewarding yourself for a job well done every once in a while, you should just take little mini-breaks from your diet and indulge every once in a while so you don't feel so trapped in your new routine. As long as indulging doesn't send you on a downward eating spiral, it will only make you feel better every once in a while.


If all of your friends are going out for a type of meal that you know won't be healthy, don't miss out just because you know it won't help your diet. If you really want to see your friends, just try to find a healthier option, or to enjoy the unhealthy food and just go to the gym later.
Indulge your cravings once in a while. If you're really craving a chocolate chip cookie, it's much better to just eat one than to eat everything in your cabinet that isn't a chocolate chip cookie.
Eat an ""off meal"" once in a while. Tell yourself that after every five or ten healthy meals, you'll get to eat whatever you want. This will keep you focused on staying healthy for the most part.

Get a “host letter.” Once you’ve done all the paperwork and planning, and are ready to open your home, you’ll need to get the “stamp of approval” from your local government authority responsible for group homes.,
Prepare to open for business.",How to Start a Group Home," There is a growing demand for group homes in the U.S., due in large part to the growing elderly population, along with increasing numbers of other adults and youths who can benefit from this setting. Demand, of course, means an opportunity to make money, but don’t expect starting a group home to be your path to fast and easy riches.


In all honesty, if your primary goal is anything other than to help vulnerable people, running a group home probably isn’t for you. The job requires hard work, long hours, significant expense, and ample frustration, so you need to be able to find your reward in the good you’re doing for others.Think about who you want to serve with your group home. Seniors? The disabled? At-risk children? Despite some similarities, each option offers its own unique challenges and rewards. You may want to visit several types of group homes to get a feel for the differences.;
, You probably wouldn’t open a pizza shop in a town that already has a half-dozen of them, unless perhaps you had some unique “angle” by which to differentiate yours from the rest. The same principle holds true for group homes — you need to be aware of what the market needs.Conduct a “needs assessment” of the local area in which you hope to start your group home. How many similar homes exist in the area? What is their average occupancy level? Is there a need for more? Can you provide a group home setting that will distinguish you from the pack?
Here, as with numerous other times during this process, you should contact the government agencies that oversee group homes in your area (this will vary by jurisdiction). Ask if there is a need for another group home, and if so, what type is most in demand. You can also contact local social service organizations, hospitals, probation offices, and such for insights into group home needs in the area.

, You may assume that everyone supports the idea of group homes, but you’ll find that not to be the case. Some opposition is based on politics, some on concerns about effectiveness, and some can be based on fears of upsetting the local neighborhood dynamic.


There is, in fact, some political momentum in the U.S. to cut federal funding for group homes for children, based on examples of abuse and exploitation and questions about their effectiveness.You may well find opposition among local homeowners when it comes time to locate your group home. Even if you’re looking to serve only senior citizens, some people reflexively oppose the notion of having any sort of group home in their midst, often citing the potential risk to property values. When the time comes, make sure you have all your legal “ducks in a row,” and also work on soothing neighborhood nerves by explaining the purpose and need for the group home and the provisions you will make to be a beneficial neighbor.

, Whether you’re starting a group home, a grocery store, or a gardening service, it is always a good idea to draw up a detailed business plan that outlines the goals, needs, opportunities, and obstacles for your new enterprise. A well-constructed business plan will serve as your group home’s guidebook as it gets off the ground — or may even convince you to change your plans.A business plan is often viewed as a sales pitch for potential investors, but serves a useful purpose even if you aren’t seeking financial support. See the detailed article How to Write a Business Plan for information on creating one, including the following listing of common contents:

Title Page and Table of Contents.
Executive Summary, in which you summarize your vision for the company.
General Company Description, in which you provide an overview of your company and the service it provides to its market.
Products and Services, in which you describe, in detail, your unique product or service.
Marketing Plan, in which you describe how you'll bring your product to its consumers.
Operational Plan, in which you describe how the business will be operated on a day-to-day basis.
Management and Organization, in which you describe the structure of your organization and the philosophy that governs it.
Financial Plan, in which you illustrate your working model for finances and your need from investors.


The U.S. Small Business Administration (https://www.sba.gov/) and similar small business support entities can also offer guidance on developing a business plan.

, As with any other small business, it takes a significant investment to get a new group home off the ground, and you probably don’t have enough money just lying around to fund the enterprise yourself. Use your business plan and a realistic assessment of your personal finances as a starting point for determining your financing needs.


Along with guidance for your business plan, the U.S. Small Business Administration also offers a wealth of information on the process and expectations for securing small business loans from financial institutions.
Inquire with the local and state agencies responsible for overseeing group homes in your jurisdiction, to see if there are grants or low-interest loans available.
Don’t be afraid to get creative in securing start-up funding for your group home. The options can range from crowdfunding to renting out part of your residence. Borrowing from friends and family is often an option as well, although you must balance its benefits with the possible awkwardness that can arise from imposing a business relationship on a personal one., In the U.S. at least, if you want your group home to succeed, you need the supervisory local and state (and perhaps federal) agencies to be “on your side.” Without active government support, you will struggle to find residents, keep abreast of licensing rules and regulations, and get the proper financial reimbursements for your work.


In California, for example, a group home for children must have the written support of the host county (among other requirements) to be eligible for essential reimbursement funding via the AFDC-FC program.Connecticut, as another representative example, has regulations for group homes covering areas ranging from telephone service to clean bathrooms. You are likely to need all the help you can get in navigating through the red tape necessary to start a group home., It is difficult to be anything but general here, because every U.S. state (and possibly even county) has its own licensing procedures for starting and operating a group home. You will need to be proactive in ensuring that you complete all the necessary steps.


Just to name a few of the multitude of examples:

In California, group homes for children are licensed by the state Department of Social Services (CDSS).In Florida, the Department of Health provides information but not licensing for group homes; that responsibility lies (depending on the nature of the facility) with either the Agency for Health Care Administration or the Department of Children and Families (DCF).In Connecticut, the Department of Developmental Services (formerly the Department of Mental Retardation) handles licensing for group homes for the mentally disabled.State licensing for your facility is likely only the start of the process. You may need to be personally licensed as a Certified Administrator of Group Homes, for instance., Do you know the requirements for health and food inspections in Florida?Or fire marshal’s certification in Connecticut?Or first aid / CPR training requirements for your employees, regardless of where you are located?And what kind of business permits do you need? It can seem like an endless maze of bureaucracy.


Start by contacting your local (such as county) department of health, or human services, or social services, or whatever other unit seems most likely to deal with the operation of group homes in your area. Step up to the state and federal levels as warranted.
Ask lots of questions, and be very patient. Remember why you want to render this valuable service to your community. It can never hurt to solicit guidance from existing group home operators as well.

, Depending upon your location, one or both of these may not be legally necessary, but they are essential steps nonetheless. Take every opportunity to protect the time, effort, and money you are investing in your group home.


Unfortunately but not surprisingly, establishing non-profit status in the U.S. is not a quick and easy process. You need to create a corporate entity by filing Articles of Incorporation with your state, then begin work on the lengthy Form 1023 provided by the IRS, then, if approved, circle back to the state level to ensure your exemption from state taxation. You may find it beneficial to hire an attorney well-versed in this process.Check to determine whether your state requires insurance coverage for your group home,but make sure you obtain sufficient insurance covering liability, fire, and theft, among other areas., No matter the size of your planned group home, you’re going to need to hire some help. Before actually engaging in the hiring process, though, it is advisable to “put your ducks in a row” regarding the various forms and requirements.



This SBA article and this IRS publication are good starting points regarding the paperwork and recordkeeping required to hire an employee in the U.S. The many requirements include:

Completing Form I-9, which verifies an employee’s eligibility to work in the U.S.
Providing Form W-4, which determines federal tax withholding for each employee.
Determining your individual state’s requirements regarding new hire reporting, tax reporting, and worker’s compensation insurance.
Establishing a functional record-keeping operation so you can keep track of your many responsibilities as an employer.



, Once you’ve jumped through a sufficient number of bureaucratic hoops, it may finally be time to establish your actual group home. If you have not already identified a good location, do so now, while keeping in mind potential roadblocks.


Familiarize yourself with local zoning regulations, so you know where you can legally establish a group home. Also look into local and state requirements for group home facilities; in Connecticut, for instance, there are specific square footage requirements for resident bedroom sizes.You may face opposition from local residents who are not keen to have a group home in their midst. They will often cite safety concerns, decreased property values, or even traffic and parking problems as reasons for opposition. Even if you have verified your legal right to establish your home, be prepared to explain and defend (in a neighborly manner) the benefits your group home will offer to the community.

, As with any business, it pays to have a clear breakdown of your likely income and expenses in place well before you actually open your doors. This process will likely make it more clear just how dependent your group home will be on government reimbursement for your services.


Although based on 1998 figures, the sample budget for a group home serving 8-12 children in Georgia provided at https://www.cga.ct.gov/2003/rpt/2003-R-0169.htm may prove a useful point of reference. Note the estimated expenses of $250,000 per year for a relatively small group home, and the importance the 60% per diem reimbursement rate provided by the state of Georgia after the first year of operation.
Basically, don’t expect to make big money by operating a group home. Focus on the good work you are doing for those in need.

, Hopefully, you have already prepared yourself for the process of hiring employees, and now you can focus on finding the right people to fill the positions. Hiring good employees is at least as much of an art as it is a science, but there are steps you can take to improve your odds of making strong hires for your group home.


Finding people with (positive) experience working in a group home setting is great, of course, but don’t automatically exclude everyone without experience. Consider educational backgrounds and training, as well as temperament and personality traits. Working in a group home setting requires lots of patience, perseverance, and compassion; it takes the right kind of person with the right kind of attitude to succeed.
At the interview, asking questions like ""Can you provide an example of a problem that you successfully solved?"" may offer insights into a potential employee's ambition, ingenuity, and work ethic.Keep in mind that such questions are common, however, and the interviewee may have prepared stock answers already. (An inability to answer effectively is thus a bad sign.) In addition, try to think up a few problem-solving hypotheticals, for instance, that are specific to the group home setting (“How would you deal with a resident that is / says / does …?"").

, With this “host letter” (or similarly-styled document, based on your location), the local social / human services department will direct prospective residents your way.For example, if you are operating a group home for abused children, it will be essential to your survival as a business that such children “in the system” be located with you.
Depending upon your location, a legitimate “host letter” (or similar) may be required in order to receive reimbursements.Inquire with the local government authority responsible for group homes regarding the requirements and process for acquiring this document.

, Opening a group home isn’t the same as opening an ice cream parlor or repair shop, but any new small business that wants to survive needs to make a strong start. You’ve been laying the groundwork for a successful opening all along, but you need to spread the word of your opening and make sure the initial experience is a positive one.



How to Open a Small Business offers a nice range of general advice on the topic, much of which is relevant to the group home experience.
Advertising is important, even if logo balloons and prize giveaways may not be right for your group home’s grand opening. But, spreading the word about your business through traditional, digital, and social media methods is still valuable. For group homes in particular, making connections with the proper government agencies and community organizations — charitable, religious, educational, and so forth — may be your most vital form of advertising.

Do some research online and talk to your physician about any questions you have. That way, you can explain your condition to others clearly so that they understand and you can answer questions that they may have.You may wish to raise awareness of your own illness, or invisible illnesses in general. If you wish to raise awareness overall, get as much information as you can about invisible illnesses as a whole. Explore what makes invisible illnesses different than other illnesses, how people are treated differently, and why it’s harder for some people to get their needs met.
Remember that research and developments are always ongoing in the medical community. Make sure you are staying up to date by regularly refreshing your education. You might want to set up Google alerts to notify you when the illness is mentioned in the news, for instance.;
, More and more people are recognizing the importance of bringing visibility to invisible diseases and illness. Join an advocacy group and see how you can get involved. Participating in “Invisible Illness Awareness Week” is a great way to get involved and spread awareness about invisible illnesses.A simple online search can help connect you to organizations that help people with invisible illnesses.
Make sure you let the organization know about any limitations you might have and see if they can work with you to get you involved in a way that won't jeopardize your heath. For instance, you may not be able to physically show up at a fundraiser, but you can raise awareness on social media, or set up and promote a Kickstarter campaign.

, If you want to raise awareness about your illness and other invisible illnesses, start by talking to your friends and family about your experience. You don’t have to go on and on about it, but let them know that you have an invisible illness and that it’s important for you to let them know. Talk about how it impacts your life, even when others may not notice. Provide them with information and resources to learn more.While your struggles with invisible illness don’t need to be the center of your life, it can be helpful for friends and family to know what you need and how they can help.
Say, “I don’t like to complain or draw attention to myself or my problems, but I feel it’s important for you to know that I struggle with chronic fatigue syndrome. I’m working with medical professionals and while I appreciate your concern, I don't need recommendations for supplements or herbs. I would, however, appreciate your care and support.”

, If someone says something insensitive to you, take the opportunity to gently correct them or educate them. For example, if someone says, “But you don’t look sick!” or, “Maybe you need to lose weight or get on an antidepressant,” it can be hurtful. While they may be trying to help, it can backfire and make you feel misunderstood. Focus on letting them know what you need or want to say.While these comments may anger you or frustrate you, take the high road. Say, “There are lots of misunderstandings about invisible illnesses that can be hurtful. It’s hurtful when you say that because even if my body looks fine, it doesn’t mean that I’m okay.”
Say, “It’s easy to tell someone has a broken leg because they often have crutches and a cast. This helps others see that they need help such as with opening doors or getting around. For someone who has an invisible disability such as fibromyalgia, mental illness, or lupus, it’s much harder for people to know that they need help.”
If someone continues to be disrespectful about your condition, know that you can distance yourself from them or even terminate the relationship. It may also be helpful to set boundaries and say something like, ""It's hurtful when you make comments about my illness not being 'real.' Please keep your opinions on my illness to yourself. If you say something like that again, I don't think we can continue to be friends.""

, Yes, your illness is a part of you and a part of your life, but it is not who you are. You are a multifaceted human being with lots of ideas, abilities, and experiences. Focus on who you are as a person and not solely on your illness. While your illness can influence who you are and what you do, you are not your illness.Don’t let your illness consume your life. Choose who you are and what kind of life you have outside of your illness.
For example, you may be a dog lover, movie buff, or world traveler. Let the things you love define who you are, not your illness.
If you find that you have a hard time not thinking about your illness, try to set a period each day in which you can reflect on and process the thoughts and feelings related to your illness. It might be helpful to journal during this time. The rest of the day, try to turn your focus to all the other aspects of who you are.

, Having an invisible illness doesn’t mean you can avoid people or experiences. You may feel limited in your abilities, but this is no excuse to not enjoy life and fully participate in it. If there are things you want to do or have an interest in or curiosity about, go do them! Learn something new, take a risk, and have fun. Find something you’re passionate about and pursue it.Engage with life as far as your ability level will let you. Even if you feel restricted in one area (such as mobility), take advantage of your other abilities. For example, set your mind to win a photography contest, learn how to make mosaics, or build a telescope.
Remember that it may take you a little longer to complete a project and you may need to rest frequently. Let go of any preconceived time frame you have about when you ""should"" finish your project and work on it as your health allows.

, Find an agency that helps people with invisible diseases and illnesses and ask how you can help. Connect with an advocacy organization to get involved in a cause that deals with invisible illness. Volunteering is a great way to spread goodness and help others.Consider volunteering with children that have invisible illnesses and be a good example of an adult with an invisible illness. For example, work at an after-school program for children with learning disorders or ADHD.

, While people with visible illnesses are often offered help or assistance, those with invisible illnesses may feel ignored or misunderstood. People with invisible illnesses may need to be more proactive about getting support and assistance from others by asking for it when needed. When you have a need, ask someone for help. Don't expect people to know what you need or want and instead, ask for it clearly and directly.


For example, if you struggle with ADHD and are easily distracted, ask your workplace for a quiet place to work or to use headphones.
If you need help completing tasks, say, “I need some help with this, would you mind coming over?” If you need to be more specific, say, “I’m having a hard morning today with my lupus, would you be willing to pick up medications for me, please?”
Try to have a few trusted friends and family members on whom you can rely so that you're not always asking the same person for assistance.

, Connecting with other people who have similar experiences as you can be helpful in learning and understanding invisible illnesses. Meeting with others can help you feel that you are not alone and that other people understand similar struggles. A support group is a great place to talk about your experiences, ask questions, and give and receive support.Ask your physician or local mental health clinic if there are support groups in your community. You can also look up support groups online or join a virtual support group.

, If you feel alone in your struggles or unable to emotionally cope with your illness or the stress it causes, it can be helpful to talk to a therapist. A therapist can help you understand your feelings and cope in more effective ways. A therapist can help you find ways to feel more visible and cope more effectively with your illness. Everything you say to a therapist is confidential, which means you can be as open, raw, and honest as you want and know that you will not be judged or criticized for your thoughts, feelings, or experiences.Find a therapist by getting a referral from your physician, calling your local mental health clinic, or contacting your insurance provider. You may also get a recommendation from friends or family members.

, If you feel like you’re trying to convince your physician that you’re struggling, consider switching to a physician who believes you and wants to work with you. The professionals you work with should listen to you, take you seriously, and adequately address your needs. If you don’t feel like you are receiving the care you want or need, find a provider who you feel understands you and your illness.It’s important to feel supported by your treatment team and that they are helping you.

What's unhealthy about it? Do you need to eat more green vegetables? Do you need to drink more water? Should you snack less?
Write up a list of the things you want to change, add or stop about your current diet. Use these ideas to form multiple small goals to help you reach a healthier diet.
The best way to reach any goal is to start with one or two very small changes. Trying to overhaul your entire diet in a few days probably won't work well. Choose something small to work on each week. You'll be much more successful long-term.;
, After you've come up with a few goals and how you can achieve them, consider starting a food journal. This will serve as a method to track and evaluate your progress.


Write all your goals in your food journal. You can review them as needed or change them as you continue to make changes to your diet.
Also track all of your foods and beverages in your food journal. This will help you physically see what's missing from your diet or what you're eating too much of. Make sure to write out each breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack (even a few nibbles) and drinks you consume throughout the day. The more accurate you are, the better resource this will be.
Each week in your food journal, write down the change you want to work on. For example, ""This week, I will drink eight glasses of water each day."" At the end of the week, go back over your journal to see if you've completed this goal.
There are many apps available to download on your smartphone that can help you track calories, exercise, and even how much water you drink.

, A meal plan is a great tool when you're trying to follow any new diet plan. These plans are your guide and blueprint to your week of meals and snacks.Meal plans can help you stay organized and on track throughout the week.You'll know exactly what you're going to have and on what day. This way you can go to the grocery store with a specific list, only buying what you plan to use in your meals for the week. You can also plan ahead of time for busy days — for instance, if you know you'll be very busy and work late on Thursday, make something on Wednesday that you can easily reheat and have for leftovers on Thursday.
Also write up the corresponding grocery list to your meal plans. This will help you get in and out of the grocery store and ensure you have all the necessary ingredients at home to make all of your meals.
Don't skip meals. If you currently skip meals, make sure to schedule a meal or a healthy snack for yourself at least every four hours. Skipping meals is more likely to lead to binge eating later, which contributes to weight gain., If you're busy and have little time to make a meal from scratch, meal prep will be the key to following your new healthier diet.


Meal prep helps you get a lot of the work of cooking from scratch or cooking at home out of the way during free time. When it's time for dinner on a busy weeknight, you should have most or even all of the cooking already done.
Plan a day or two during the week when you have some free time to do your meal prep. Review your meal plan and grocery list and try to find ways to get some cooking done.
Meal prep is flexible. You can cook full dinners in advance so you just have to reheat the night you want to eat it, or you can just do washing or chopping of vegetables or marinating meat so you can quickly cook the night of.
Also consider purchasing foods that require less prep work to begin with. For example, you can purchase pre-washed and cut bagged lettuce instead of a whole head of lettuce, frozen vegetables that are heat and serve, or pre grilled lean protein like grilled chicken strips.
Meal prepping can be a time to catch up with people. Ask your partner or children to help you prep while you talk about what has been going on in your lives.

, Although there are a variety of eating styles and diet plans to follow, the most nutritious is a well-balanced diet.


A balanced diet will be different for everyone. You'll need to eat the right portion sizes for your age, gender and activity level.In addition, a well-balanced diet is one that features foods from each food group each day. Although many diets suggest giving up gluten, or giving up carbs or even avoiding dairy, all food groups offer beneficial nutrition to everyone. Only avoid food groups if you have an allergy to those foods.
Also make sure you have a wide variety of foods in your diet.For example, don't always choose to eat an apple as your afternoon snack. Alternate between apples, bananas or berries to increase the variety of your diet.

, Protein is an essential nutrient to any nutritious diet; however, choosing leaner protein sources is advisable.


Protein is essential for a variety of functions in your body including: providing your body with energy, supporting your lean muscle mass, providing the basis for many enzymes and hormones and providing structure and support for cells.Lean protein sources are lower in fat and calories compared to higher fat proteins.Many high-fat proteins (mostly from animal sources) are higher in saturated fat. Focusing on leaner protein decreasing your overall intake of these types of fat.To get your recommended amount of protein each day, include one or two servings at each meal. One serving is about 3 – 4 oz or about the size of the palm of your hand.Lean protein sources include: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, pork, seafood, beans and nuts and lower fat beef.

, Fruits and vegetables are an integral part of a healthful diet. These are the foods that are abundant in essential nutrients.Fruits and vegetables are both fairly low in calories, but high in nutrients (making them nutrient-dense foods). They are some of the best sources of fiber, vitamins, mineral and antioxidants.It's typically recommended to consume five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day. So measure out 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of leafy greens and 1/2 cup of fruit to help you meet this recommendation.If you don't typically eat a lot of fruits or vegetables now, increasing your intake to five to nine servings daily can be difficult. Find easy ways to get in a few of these essential foods. Try: mixing in sautéed vegetables into eggs for breakfast, sprinkle yogurt or cottage cheese with fruit, add extra lettuce, tomatoes and onions to your sandwiches, or try adding some steamed vegetables to your mac and cheese recipe.

, An easy way to increase your nutrition and eat a healthier diet is by choosing 100% whole grains. These foods are much better for you than refined grains.


100% whole grains have all three parts of the grain — the germ, bran and endosperm. They are less processed and contain many more nutrients like fiber, protein and minerals.Refined grains are much more processed than whole grains. They are typically stripped of the bran and germ so they are lower in fiber and protein. Avoid foods made with white flour — like white pasta, white rice, pastries, chips and crackers.
Include a few servings of whole grains each day. Measure out a 1 oz or 1/2 cup serving to help you stick to appropriate portion sizes.Try whole grains like: quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat pasta, millet, farro or whole wheat bread and wraps.

, Although fat should be monitored in your diet, there are a few types of fat that are particularly healthy and provide a variety of health benefits.


If you're trying to eat more sources of healthy fats, make sure to swap them out for unhealthy fats. Do not add more fats — healthy or not — on top of a diet containing unhealthy fats.
Omega 3 fats and monounsaturated fats are both great for your body. They have been shown to improve cardiovascular health and improve cholesterol levels.The best sources of these healthy fats are: avocados, olive oil, olives, nuts, nut butters, canola oil, chia seeds, flaxseeds and fatty fish (like salmon, tuna and mackerel). Remember, though, that these may also have a high calorie count, so be moderate.
Many health professionals recommended eating fatty fish at least twice a week and including a daily source of other healthy fats., Although water is not necessarily its own food group or nutrient, it is an essential part of a healthy diet and a healthy body.


Drinking adequate water every day helps your body stay hydrated. It's very important to help regulate body temperature, blood pressure and helps prevent constipation.It's typically recommended to consume at least eight 8-oz glasses (2 liters) of water daily. However, now many health professionals recommend consuming up to 13 glasses (3 liters) daily.In addition to water, you can try flavored water, decaf unsweetened coffee and tea. These beverages are no calorie and caffeine free which are the best and most hydrating fluids.

, Although you want to follow a healthier diet, it's still appropriate to indulge in your favorite foods. Following the 80/20 rule can help you stick to a healthy diet while eating more indulgent foods in moderation.Although eating a nutritious, well-balanced diet is important, it's not realistic to eat perfectly healthy everyday for the rest of your life. People derive a lot of enjoyment out of eating and occasionally eating more indulgent foods.
Treat yourself to an indulgent dish, glass of alcohol or larger portions occasionally. This is still considered normal and healthy eating; however, only indulge 20% of the time. Most of the time, or 80% of the time, you should be choosing healthy foods.

, There are certain groups of foods that you should limit and only eat in moderation. Added sugars are something that should definitely be eaten in moderation as they often no nutritional value.Added sugars are added to certain foods during their processing. They offer no nutrition, only extra calories. In addition, many studies have shown that a diet high in added sugars can lead to obesity.Added sugars are found in a wide variety of foods. Try to limit items like: breakfast pastries, cookies, cakes, ice cream, candy, and cereals.
Also limit sweetened beverages. Not only are they high in added sugars and calories, many people don't think to count these types of drinks as a source of calories since they don't fill you up like food does. You may end up drinking more calories through these beverages.
The American Heart Association recommends that women consume no more than 6 teaspoons and men consume no more than 9 teaspoons of added sugar daily., In addition to added sugars, you should also limit certain groups of foods that contain high quantities of fat. In particular you want to avoid higher levels of saturated and trans fat.


There has been some controversy over whether or not saturated fat is as dangerous or unhealthy as previously thought. However, saturated fat is still a fat which means it's very calorie dense and if eaten in large quantities can still lead to weight gain and adverse health effects.You don't need to avoid all saturated fats, but do eat them in moderation. Especially foods like: full fat dairy, fatty cuts of beef or pork, deli meats and other processed meats.
Trans fats have been directly linked to several adverse health effects like raising bad cholesterol levels and lowering the good kind, increases your risk for developing heart disease and stroke and increases your risk for developing diabetes.Try to avoid these foods as much as possible.
Trans fats are found in a variety of foods including: pastries, cookies, cakes, margarines, pies, fast foods, fried foods and baked goods.
There is no safe upper limit for trans fats. These should be avoided if possible.

, If you choose to drink, do so in moderation. Moderate amounts of alcohol generally do not pose health risks for most people.


If you drink larger amounts of alcohol (more than three servings daily), you may increase your risk of: high blood pressure, liver disease, heart disease stroke and depression.Unlike some foods, there is a specific definition of moderate alcohol consumption. Women shouldn't drink more than one serving daily and men should consume no more than two daily.If you do drink, consider skipping mixed beverages that are mixed with sweetened beverages or fruit juices as these contain extra calories and added sugars.
One serving is equivalent to a 12-oz beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz or liquor

Attempt mediation.",How to Sue for Disability Discrimination," You can't begin the process of suing for disability discrimination without evidence of the discriminatory statements or conduct.For example, if you are a cashier at a grocery store, but have a disability that means you are unable to stand for more than an hour at a time, your supervisor should provide you with a stool or chair so you can perform your duties while sitting.
If your supervisor refuses to provide you with a stool or chair, or penalizes you for leaning on a counter, this constitutes disability discrimination.
It also is illegal for your supervisor or co-workers to harass or make fun of you because of your disability. This is considered disability discrimination even if you don't actually have the disability, they just perceive that you do.
It's important to write down discriminatory conduct as soon as possible after it happens, so the details are still fresh in your mind. If you're facing continual harassment or discrimination, consider creating a journal or diary and recording each instance.
Take down the date, time, location, and context (for example, if you are working your shift, on break, or clocking out). Write down the names not only of those responsible for the discrimination but also of any other co-workers who were present and may have witnessed the discriminatory conduct.;
, Before you take your complaint to the next level, you should provide your employer with written notice of the problem and give him or her a chance to correct it.Put your complaint in writing and let your employer know that you take the matter seriously and consider it illegal disability discrimination. Let your employer know what you want to happen as a result of your complaint – whether you want employees disciplined, just want the harassment to cease, or need a reasonable accommodation for your disability.
Include specific details about the action or statements that you consider discriminatory, such as dates, times, locations, and the names of employees involved. Use your journal as a reference, if you made one. You might even consider making copies of those entries and including them verbatim.
Keep in mind that if you don't feel comfortable bringing up the issue with your employer, you may be asked by an EEOC agent why you didn't notify your employer about the discrimination when you file your charge with the agency.
Because federal law requires you to file a charge within 180 days of the most recent discriminatory act if you want to preserve your right to sue, keep track of the time that has passed and be ready to file a charge if your employer is unresponsive to your complaint., To preserve your right to sue for disability discrimination, you must first file a charge with state or federal administrative agencies.The EEOC has an online assessment tool available at https://egov.eeoc.gov/eas/. By answering a few questions you can easily determine whether you're eligible to file a federal charge.
If you aren't eligible to file a federal charge, you should check with your state's employment discrimination agency, particularly if you work for a small business. The ADA only applies to businesses with at least 15 employees who have worked at least 20 calendar weeks in a year, but state laws often apply to employers with fewer employees and may provide more comprehensive protection.

, The EEOC provides a standard three-page form for you to provide information about yourself, your employer, and the discrimination you're experiencing.You can download the EEOC's questionnaire online at https://egov.eeoc.gov/eas/uniformintakequestionnaire09.pdf and either fill it out on your computer or print it off and fill it out by hand.
You also can pick up a print questionnaire at any of the EEOC's field offices. However, it's a good idea to look at the form before you make the trip to the field office so you can make sure you have all the information you'll need to fill it out.
If you're eligible to file a charge with both state and federal agencies, you may want to file your charge with both. Contact your state agency and find out if they have a dual-filing program. Many states will file a charge with the EEOC for you when you file a charge with the state agency.

, Once you've completed your questionnaire, you must submit it to your nearest EEOC field office so your charge can be evaluated.The EEOC does not have a method by which you can submit a questionnaire online. You must send in a paper form.
To locate the nearest EEOC field office, visit the EEOC's location map at http://www.eeoc.gov/field/index.cfm.
The agency has 53 field offices, so if the one closest to you is too far away, call the office and explain this. An agent will assist you with mailing your questionnaire and ensuring that your charge is received before the deadline.

, Once your charge has been evaluated it will be assigned to an agent who will interview you regarding the discrimination you're experiencing.If you take your questionnaire into the field office in person, an EEOC agent typically will come out and talk to you about your charge on the same day.
If you had to mail in your questionnaire, you either will be called by a field agent, or you will receive a list of questions in the mail that you must answer in writing and send back.

, Within 10 days of your interview, the EEOC will send a copy of your charge to your employer along with instructions on how to proceed.The EEOC either sends you and your employer to mediation, or assigns the case to an investigator and requires your employer to submit a written response to your charge.
Typically, the EEOC process must be completed before you can file a lawsuit in court. If you reach a settlement with your employer during mediation, you may not even need to sue.
If the EEOC ultimately finds no violation, you will receive a right-to-sue notice. If the EEOC does find a violation, but you are unable to reach a settlement with your employer through mediation and the EEOC's legal team declines to file a lawsuit on your behalf, you also will receive a right-to-sue notice.
You can expect the administrative process to take about 180 days at most. If that period of time goes by and the investigation is not yet complete, you can request a right-to-sue notice from the EEOC. You also can request a right-to-sue notice before 180 days has passed, if it seems clear the EEOC won't complete its investigation by that deadline.

, If your case gets to the point where you're issued a right-to-sue letter, an experienced disability discrimination attorney is your best option to ensure your rights are protected.Most disability discrimination attorneys will take your case on a contingency fee basis, meaning they receive no money unless you win or settle your case. That way you don't have to worry about out-of-pocket expenses for an attorney.
If you know of a nonprofit group in your area that advocates for disability rights, you might start your attorney search there.
You also can visit your state or local bar association's website and search for disability attorneys. Many bar associations have referral services that will provide you with names of attorneys that take cases like yours after you answer a few questions or briefly describe your issue.
Make an effort to interview at least three attorneys if possible before you pick one. Keep in mind that all employment discrimination cases are different, so try to pick someone who has specific experience handling disability discrimination cases, or who specializes in disability law.

, Your attorney will need all the details you have about the discrimination you're experiencing and the people involved so he or she can draft your complaint.You can start by giving your attorney copies of all the information you provided to the EEOC, as well as any information you provided to your employer or any journal you were keeping of the discriminatory incidents.
Your attorney likely will have questions for you as well, regarding the discrimination and your relationship with your employer in general. Answer these questions as completely and openly as possible.
Once your attorney has the necessary information, he or she will draft a complaint for you to initiate your lawsuit. Your complaint will include information about you and your employer along with your allegations against your employer and how they violate the law.Your complaint also will detail the injuries or losses you've suffered as a result of the discrimination, and the amount of monetary damages or other relief sufficient to cover those injuries and losses.

, You must file your complaint and other required paperwork with the clerk of the court in which your case will be heard to initiate your lawsuit.In federal court, you have the option of filing your complaint electronically. If you're filing your lawsuit in federal court for a violation of the ADA, this most likely is how your attorney will file your complaint.
The filing fee for a complaint in federal court is $400. Your attorney will pay this fee and add it to the costs of your lawsuit, which will be deducted from the total of your award or settlement.
When the complaint is filed, the clerk will assign the case to a judge and give it a case number. This number will be used on all subsequent documents filed with the court in your case.

, After you've filed your complaint, you have 120 days to have a copy delivered to your employer through the proper legal process.In federal court, the complaint and summons is hand-delivered by a U.S. Marshal, who then files a proof of service document with the court. In state courts these duties typically are performed by a sheriff's deputy.

, After your employer is served with your complaint, he or she has 21 days to file an answer in response to your complaint.Typically your employer will deny all or most of your allegations in his or her answer, and may include additional defenses he or she believes apply.
In addition to or instead of an answer, your employer may file a motion to dismiss. If this happens, your attorney will get together with you to discuss a response to that motion.
Typically you must appear in court for a motion to dismiss to argue why your case has merit and should not be dismissed.
You may file a motion for default if the deadline passes and your employer hasn't filed any response with the court, but don't expect that to happen. If your employer hasn't cooperated up to this point, it's unlikely your lawsuit will simply be ignored.

, You and your employer exchange information about the case before trial using the discovery process, which can help you prepare your case and also gain insight into your employer's defense.One part of discovery is written discovery, which includes interrogatories, requests for admission, and requests for production. The first two are written questions to which the other party provides written answers under oath. Requests for production, on the other hand, ask the party to produce copies of documents or other evidence that is related to the lawsuit.
For example, you may request your employer produce any company policies related to disability discrimination, personnel records, or written records detailing the company's response to your disability discrimination complaint in particular.
Depositions are the other part of discovery, and can be very important in a disability discrimination case. Depositions are live interviews in which a person is placed under oath and asked questions. A court reporter records both the questions and answers and produces a transcript for future reference.
Your attorney will depose your employer and other witnesses such as co-workers to gauge their understanding of the discrimination that was occurring and what was done about it.

, At any time during litigation, from the moment your complaint is served until the day of trial, your employer may attempt to settle your case.A settlement offer may be particularly likely after your attorney takes a deposition in which the person being deposed says things that could be damaging to your employer's defense.
Your attorney will let you know whenever your employer makes a settlement offer. He or she will advise you on whether to accept or reject it, but you always have the final choice in the matter.
Typically your attorney will give you an estimate of the time and money it will cost to continue through to trial from the point the settlement is offered. These costs should factor into your decision whether to accept the settlement, even if it is for less than what you've asked in your complaint (and it almost always will be).
Since your attorney is working under a contingency fee arrangement, if you accept a settlement offer he or she will take a percentage as well as the money to cover any costs that have accrued up to that point – such as filing fees or court reporter's fees for depositions. Then you will receive a check from your attorney for the remainder.

, The court will hold numerous hearings as your case progresses to assess the status of the litigation and decide motions filed by either party.While your attorney must attend every hearing or conference scheduled, as the plaintiff your presence may not be required at most of them.
For example, the judge probably will hold a number of scheduling conferences, often through conference calls with the attorneys rather than in person at the courthouse. These conferences simply schedule deadlines for different phases of litigation such as the discovery process and make sure the case is on track.
If either you or your employer files a substantive motion – that is, one that relates directly to one of the allegations in your complaint or whether a piece of evidence may be admitted or a particular witness called – you may have to attend the hearing.

, Regardless of whether you previously attempted mediation through the EEOC, many courts require litigants to participate in mediation before a trial will be scheduled.Because of the amount of evidence you've gathered through the discovery process, you can expect mediation at a later point in litigation to go much differently than mediation may have gone with the EEOC.
If the court requires mediation, it may either assign a mediator randomly or provide you and your employer with a list of court-approved mediators from which to choose.
The mediator will write up an agreement detailing any settlement you reach during mediation, which typically must be approved by the judge assigned to your case.
If you and your employer come to an impasse during mediation and cannot reach a settlement, your attorney will work with you to develop the trial strategy and prepare for trial.

Talk about something else at first.,
Wait until you feel comfortable.,
Build some trust.,
Get a feel for your date’s comfort level.,
Avoid any surprises.",How to Reveal a Prosthetic to Your Date1," When you meet your date, try not to lead with your prosthesis. Make small talk for a while before steering the conversation towards your prosthesis. You may find that a little small talk naturally leads you to the conversation or makes it easier to bring up.Avoid saying something like “Hi. I’m Tom and I have a prosthetic foot.”
Ask your date about what they do for a living or their hobbies. Try to find some shared interests or places of commonality.
However, if your prosthesis is obvious, you may want to address it up front. Try to do what feels right for you. If it seems like the person is preoccupied with it, then you might say something like, “This throws a lot of people off at first, but I promise you will get used to it!"";
, Although you will need to address it at some point, you should wait to talk about your prosthesis until you feel comfortable. If you are okay with it, you can address your prosthesis early in the date. However, you may also want to feel things out and save it for later in the date.Try not to force the subject. Wait until you feel comfortable in the conversation and with your date.
You may also find that it is easier to go on a few dates before talking about your prosthetic. This way you can determine if there is any potential for a relationship with the person before you decide to talk about your prosthesis with the person. If this person does not seem like someone you want a relationship with, then you might not want to even bother discussing your prosthesis with them.

, If your prosthesis is a painful subject to talk about, you will likely need to build some trust between you and your date before you feel comfortable revealing it. If you have a prosthetic because of military service, a disease, an accident, or some other sensitive reason, take your time and disclose your prosthesis when you feel comfortable. Depending on your level of comfort with your date, this could be after a few minutes or a few dates.


Pay attention to how the person is responding to you. For example, do they seem respectful? Listen carefully? Respond politely? If so, then these are good signs.
Talking to a counselor or therapist may also help you deal with any psychological issues connected to your prosthesis. Visiting a mental health professional may help you feel more comfortable disclosing your prosthesis to others.

, Gauge your date’s general comfort level and try to find a time to tell them about your prosthesis. If your date seems a little awkward or shy, it might be best to ease into the conversation before bringing it up. However, if your date seems like they would be cool with it, bring up the prosthesis when you feel comfortable.You should pay attention to your date’s body language. If they seem unwilling to make eye contact with you or fidget a lot, they are likely not feeling very comfortable.

, Try not to surprise your date with the fact that you have a prosthetic. Even if your date is okay with your prosthesis, they will likely not appreciate having something unexpected thrown at them. Remember that you are building the groundwork for a trusting and healthy relationship. Even if you do not think you'll spend the rest of your life with this person, the right thing to do is be honest with them. Find the appropriate time to talk about your prosthesis.


For example, revealing your prosthesis to a romantic partner as you disrobe for a romantic encounter is a less than ideal time.

Don't make it into a big deal.,
Be upfront about it generally.,
Ask them how much they already know about you.,
Try to bring it up organically.,
Be funny.",How to Reveal a Prosthetic to Your Date2," If you treat your prosthesis like a shameful secret, your date might feel like it is a bigger deal than it actually is. Instead, treat it like a quirk of yours—similar to your love of cheesy jokes or interest in riding horses. Your prosthesis might seem a little unusual to other people, but to you, it's an ordinary part of life. If you end up in a long-term relationship with your date, they'll probably end up seeing it the same way.


Don't overthink it. Your prosthesis is not a huge deal, and your date doesn't need to see it that way.
After you discuss it for a few minutes, change the subject and talk about something else. This will help to prevent your prosthesis from becoming the sole focus of your date.

, Although leading with a discussion of your prosthesis might not be the best idea, you should also avoid hiding it. If you have a more visible prosthesis, it might be best to talk about it early and get a feel for how comfortable your date is with it. If your prosthesis is not readily visible, you can feel out the conversation and talk about it when you feel more comfortable. Either way, it is important that you eventually discuss it with your date.Try having a trustworthy friend or family member help you to come up with a few sentences you can memorize to introduce your prosthesis. This may help you to feel less anxious about it and enjoy your date.
You might even wait for a few dates to reveal that you have a prosthesis to better feel out the other person. However, if you want any kind of serious relationship with your date, you should let them know sooner rather than later.

, Unless this is a very blind date, odds are that your date already knows a few things about you. Whoever set you up on your date may have informed them about your prosthesis, doing much of the reveal work for you. If you think that your date might already know about your prosthesis, ask about your mutual friend or acquaintance and what they told your date about you.


Even if your date does not mention it, it may give you an opportunity to reveal your prosthesis.
If you have been set up by a mutual friend, you might ask your date something like “How much did Tim tell you about me?” or “What did Tim tell you about me?”

, If you are less comfortable with cutting to the chase and bringing up your prosthetic device, you may want to wait for the conversation to turn to it. Simply talk to your date and wait for a good moment to bring it up. You can also set up the reveal by gently nudging the conversation in that direction.For example, if your date mentions that someone in their family has a prosthetic, you could use that as an opportunity to bring up your own prosthesis and say something like “You know, I also have a prosthesis.”
Or, if your date asks you to tell them about yourself, then you could mention the prosthesis briefly as part of your response.

, A great way to reveal your prosthesis to a date and defuse any tension is by using humor. Although you do not want to minimize your experience, highlighting your prosthetic device by making a joke may diffuse any anxiety you have and make your date feel more comfortable. Using a joke also highlights your sense of humor, which your date should find appealing.Ultimately, it is entirely up to your to determine how comfortable you feel using jokes that make light of your prosthesis. If you are okay with it, a “Here, take may hand” type of joke may be a great icebreaker. However, avoid making yourself uncomfortable and minimizing your own experience in a misguided effort to make your date feel more at-ease.

Be honest.,
Disclose your prosthesis when you feel comfortable.,
See what works for you.,
Try different dating sites.",How to Reveal a Prosthetic to Your Date3," When you create your profile, do not hide your prosthesis. You can write about it in your profile or have a picture that highlights your prosthesis. Regardless of how you do it, be honest about your prosthetic device and try not to hide anything.Disclosing this information on your dating profile may make the conversation about your prosthesis much easier during a date.

, If you do not feel comfortable about leading with your prosthesis on a dating profile, wait until you feel okay discussing it. You can mention your prosthesis while messaging potential dates or bring it up during a date. This might be a good option if you want to avoid any fetishes around your prosthesis, or people who are just curious about it., When putting together your profile, be flexible about how you disclose your prosthetic device. You may find that being upfront works in certain instances or meets your needs better than waiting until later to talk about it. However, you may also find that the opposite is true and wait to reveal your prosthesis. Ultimately, you may want to try out both methods and see which works best for you., You should also explore your options by using multiple dating sites. You may find that your experience varies from website to website. Create profiles on sites like OkCupid, as well as websites designed specifically for disabled people, like Dating4Disabled and Whispers4u. Ultimately, you may find that one service meets your needs better than the others or that you appreciate the options that a variety of dating profiles offers."

Research support groups in your area to see if there is already a support group covering the needs of disabled people in your community.,
Decide upon the types of disabilities you will address in your disability support group.,
Make sure you have the time to devote to a disability support group.,
Invite other people with the same disability to discuss and start the group with you.,
Create a list of goals and a mission statement for your group.,
Decide who will moderate your group meetings.",How to Start a Disability Support Group1," Search online, inquire at local hospitals and clinics and check community message boards for information on groups. Contact the people who run local disability groups to see what their goals and mission statements are.


If there is an existing disability support group that covers the needs you want to meet, consider becoming part of the group or volunteering to be part of the committee. Having more than 1 support group, especially in a small to medium-sized community, may not allow either group to achieve the numbers and helpful services required for a successful long-term program.;
, Some groups deal with general topics like chronic illness, physical disabilities or mental disabilities. Others are based on specific disabilities, such as fibromyalgia, autism, or parenting children with disabilities.

, You will need to devote hours of your time to advertising, promoting, developing and meeting with your support group. Ask yourself if you have enough free time and energy to be the main motivator, especially at the start.

, Although you may not feel you need help, brainstorming with a group of people who want to be in the group will allow you to address more issues than if you organized the group by yourself. This committee can also split work associated with the group and meet regularly to expand the group's efforts.

, It is important to choose whether your group will have health, political, social or other goals. Choose 3 or 4 goals, instead of trying to address all the difficulties of disabilities at once.


Set ground rules after you have chosen your goals. These can expand with time, but it is a good idea to establish any time limits, exclusions and sensitive issues before you start meeting with the group.

, It is a good idea to choose someone who has the disability and also has some experience with counseling, time management and public speaking. Leading the support group is an important job that will determine how helpful the group is to its attendees.

Set up a system for budgeting and fundraising.,
Contact local hospitals, clinics, medical professionals, care workers, physical therapists and other professionals who treat people with disabilities.,
Schedule a regular date and time for meetings.,
Choose an accessible location.",How to Start a Disability Support Group2," Even the most basic support groups require some money to run. Meet with your committee to consider fundraisers, grants, sponsors, donations and costs associated with running your group.

, Ask for resources and donations. They may also be able to be involved as guest speakers in the future.

, Consistency is extremely important for disabled people who are looking for support. Decide whether it will be a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly group.

, Hospitals, clinics or support group members may be able offer space to conduct the support groups. Keep in mind that the place should have ramps, close parking, seating and be fairly central.


Certain meeting places, such as homes, may not be able to host a support group for liability reasons. You may want to contact your home insurance carrier to see if extra insurance is necessary.

Create fliers and/or a website to advertise your group's mission statement, calendar and contact information.,
Advertise your support group.,
Start meeting with your group.,
Make plans for a fundraiser.",How to Start a Disability Support Group3," These can be very simple pieces of design with a photo and a few lines of text. Split the costs and work amongst your support group committee.

, You will need to start posting information about your first meeting at least 1 month in advance, to give media and people time to disseminate your information. The following are ways that you can advertise:


Contact local hospitals, doctor's offices and clinics that treat people with applicable disabilities. Tell them about the support group and ask if you can bring fliers to be given to clients or made available in the office.
Post your meeting time on online events calendars. Ask local television and radio stations if they will create a free public service announcement and ongoing listing on their community calendar.
Post your meeting times on community message boards. You can do this online at Craigslist.com or Facebook. You can also pin fliers up to bulletin boards around the community.
Call your local television and radio stations. Ask to be a guest on a broadcast to speak about the need for a disability support group, when your meetings are and what you hope to accomplish. Ask a health care professional to join you as an expert.
Create a press release. If someone in your committee has marketing acumen, they may be able to write a 1-page release on the need for a support group, how the group will help people with disabilities and when the meetings will be. Submit the release to local blogs, radio stations, TV stations, newspapers and magazines.
Attend local health fairs. If you are not offered a free table or booth, ask if a health care company or service will allow you to distribute information at their table for mutual benefit.

, The first meeting may be held to introduce the group and discuss goals. For subsequent groups, consider asking health care professionals to speak, asking companies to present new devices or technology for disabled people or scheduling a therapeutic activity.

, You will need money in order to continue holding your support group, so schedule a fundraiser within the first few months. Fundraisers can bring your group closer together, garner attention for your cause and trigger community outreach efforts.

Know the basics.,
Verify that your employer is subject to the ADA guidelines.,
Verify that you are disabled under the law.,
Make sure that your requested accommodation is reasonable.,
Decide how to make your request.,
Provide some information about your disability.,
Discuss accommodations and solutions.,
Request additional accommodations in the future, if necessary.,
Go up the chain of command.,
Responding to a refusal.,
Responding to retaliation.",How to Request a Workplace Accommodation," Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) protects people with disabilities from discrimination in their employment.Under the ADA, most employers are required to make ""reasonable accommodations"" for disabled employees. Failing to do so is a violation of the law. If your situation meets the requirements of the law, then you are entitled to a reasonable accommodation.;
, Title I of the ADA applies to ""covered entities,"" which are private employers with 15 or more employees, plus employment agencies, labor organizations, joint labor-management committees, and state and local governments.Thus, as long as your employer is not a private entity with fewer than 15 employees, then you are probably entitled to an accommodation.


Federal agencies are exempt from the ADA, but must comply with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which is nearly identical to the ADA., Being disabled, under the ADA, means that you have a mental or physical impairment that ""substantially limits"" your ability to perform a ""major life activity.""Note that you still must be able to perform the essential functions of your job with the help of a reasonable accommodation.


Major life activities include manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and major bodily functions (such as organ function, etc.).""Substantially limits"" means that your mental or physical impairment impedes your ability to perform a major life activity compared to the general public., An accommodation is a change in the work environment or process that gives a disabled person equal employment opportunities. An accommodation is unreasonable if it causes an undue hardship to your employer, such as financial difficulty, disruption, or a fundamental change of the nature or operation of the business.


Reasonable accommodations include: making job facilities accessible, changing your work schedule, medical leave, and acquiring or modifying work equipment.
Unreasonable requests include: removing or eliminating an essential job function, lowering production standards, and providing a hearing aid or other device that you would need to use outside of work., Making a request for a workplace accommodation can be as simple as having a quick conversation in plain English. You don't need to use special language or mention the ADA.For example, ""I need six weeks off to get treatment for a back problem"" or ""I'm having trouble getting to work at my scheduled starting time because of medical treatments I'm undergoing"" is sufficient.Just be clear with your employer that your request is related to a medical condition.


You do not need to put your request in writing, but it may be a good idea to do so, whether by memo, email, or letter. If there is ever a dispute about whether or when you made your request, having your request in a dated writing will be helpful.You can find a sample letter here.


, Your employer is not required to make a workplace accommodation unless he or she is aware that you have a disability. Thus, if you say, ""I need a new chair because my current chair is uncomfortable,"" your employer is not required to make an accommodation because you did not connect your discomfort to a disability.Let your employer know that you are requesting an accommodation because of your disability, and provide any supporting medical information that you are comfortable sharing.


Some employers may not require additional information from you, but others might ask for medical details and/or supporting documentation. Your employer does have a right to request additional medical information, and can deny your request if you fail to provide it.Ask your health care provider to prepare some documentation of your disability for your employer.You have no obligation to inform your employer of your disability at the time you are hired, or any time prior to your request for a workplace accommodation. Your decision not to disclose your disability to your employer earlier does not impact your right to a reasonable accommodation.

, Your employer is legally obligated to work with you to come up with a reasonable accommodation. Take the initiative and propose a solution, or more than one, if you can. Your employer is not required to make the exact accommodation to request if an alternative is possible. Whatever solution you agree upon, put it into writing and sign and date it with your employer.For example, if you use a wheelchair, but the wheelchair does not fit under your desk, a reasonable accommodation might include getting a larger desk. Alternatively, it might be possible to safely modify your current desk to make it taller. It may take more than one meeting or even more than one attempt at a solution to find an accommodation that meets your needs and those of your employer.

, There is no time limit on making requests for workplace accommodations. You do not have to make them right when you start your job, and you can make new requests later. If you develop a new disability, if your condition changes, or if your requested accommodation did not work out as expected, continue to have a dialogue with your employer, and make a new request if necessary.


For instance, you might say, ""I appreciate the company's efforts to accommodate my disability. Unfortunately, my new wheelchair is a bit larger than my old one, and my desk needs to be modified again. I can provide the dimensions of my new chair whenever it's convenient for you.""

, If your boss refuses your request or stalls, speak with your boss's boss or your Human Resources department. The law places the burden on employers to respond to accommodation requests, but by taking the initiative to voice your request up the chain of command, you will hopefully be able to resolve the issue without having to take legal action.


Similarly, the law does not require you to educate your employer about the law. But if you are comfortable with doing so, and your employer seems open to continuing the conversation, you might suggest that your employer consult Title I of the ADA to review employers' responsibilities.

, If your employer refuses to make a workplace accommodation, or fails to follow through in a reasonable time, then he or she may have violated Title I of the ADA. You should contact an experienced disability discrimination attorney.An attorney can advise you of your rights and communicate with your employer on your behalf. If it becomes necessary to file a lawsuit, you may be required to file a notice with your state's anti-discrimination enforcement agency and obtain a ""right-to-sue"" authorization from the agency.You can get attorney referrals from friends and family, or from attorneys who do not practice employment law but know a trusted colleague who does. You can also use referral services through your state and local bar associations, or just search online. If you cannot afford to hire an attorney, other options are available. Your community may have legal aid organizations that provide free or low-cost legal services to the community. You can find these organizations by searching online or contacting the court.

, Unfortunately, some employers retaliate against workers in order to punish or discourage requests for workplace accommodations. If you are fired, have your salary reduced, or get reassigned shortly after you make your request for an accommodation, your employer may be retaliating against you.. Retaliation can take other forms as well, like demands for additional proof of your disability after you have already provided sufficient documentation.If you believe your employer has retaliated against you, keep copies of all notices, communication, and other paperwork related to the retaliation. Then contact an experienced disability discrimination attorney.

Stimulate away.,
Decrease the brain's blood flow.,
Combine caffeine with a methylphenidate medication.",How to Treat ADHD With Caffeine1," Caffeine is a stimulant, just like many of the prescription medications those with ADHD use to tame their symptoms. Because of caffeine's effect on the brain, when someone consumes it, the levels of a key brain chemical (dopamine) are increased. Someone with ADHD who consumes caffeine is better able to process information, and will feel more calm and focused. Excess intake may still cause the stimulant side effects however, which may include anxiety.The effectiveness of caffeine for ADHD depends on the dosage. Moderate doses between 200-300 mg can lead to increased energy, enhanced concentration, and boost emotional well-being. High doses, however, of greater than 400 mg can cause you to feel jittery and nervousness.;
, No, this one is not mis-categorized. Yes, it does say decrease the brain's blood flow. Apparently in those with ADHD, this is a good thing. This is the exact effect ADHD medications like Ritalin have. The blood flow affects how well the person processes information and pays attention., Such a regimen can produce a high level of success at controlling ADHD. Studies have shown that when used in conjunction with each other, at low doses, the two treatments compliment each other very well. In combination with higher levels of caffeine, however, the prescription proved to be the equivalent of no medication at all."
"
Expect inconsistent results.,
Prepare for side effects.,
Risk addiction.",How to Treat ADHD With Caffeine2," In research studies, results of caffeine as a medication for ADHD have not provided as consistent results as prescribed medications. At times, using caffeine had the same effect as no medication or treatment at all., Though caffeine greatly reduced hyperactive behavior in children when administered prior to academic testing, the change in behavior was not without side effects. Restlessness, heart palpitations, insomnia, irritability and increased anxiety are a few., Studies of long term use of caffeine show that it is quite addictive. People who are ADHD and use caffeine as a treatment risk becoming addicted. In the event one decides to reduce intake or stop using caffeine, there are risks. Headaches are one of the withdrawal symptoms.However, those who intake a lot of caffeine run the risk of having the shakes and the increased possibility of a heart attack. Remember that large amounts of caffeine have been proven to be ineffective. Limited quantities (between 200 and 300 mg) work best at helping you to manage ADHD.

Eat a healthy balanced diet.,
Get exercise.,
Improve your sleep habits.,
Practice yoga or meditation.,
See a professional for behavioral interventions.,
Don't overlook medications for ADHD.",How to Treat ADHD With Caffeine3," Enjoy a diet that promotes consumption of whole foods like fruits, vegetables and lean protein. Some researchers suggest removing foods that have been processed and may have harmful substances added like artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and allergens like eggs, milk, and grains., One teacher recognized how periods of in-school activity reduced ADHD symptoms in her students. As a result, a study was conducted showing that regular physical activity - as little as a half hour each day - improved cognitive functioning, mood, and focus. Students also saw a decrease in the severity of ADHD symptoms.If you or your child have ADHD, try getting regular exercise, in virtually any form, to see if it helps. Even if the effects are minimal, people who work out regularly still report feeling better about themselves and healthier.

, Getting 8 to 9 hours of sleep each night for adults and even more for children is essential to mood stability, attention, and focus. One study showed that children with ADHD had higher rates of daytime sleepiness.Therefore, getting adequate sleep at night can help you or your child stay awake while at work or school.


The best tactics to improve sleep quantity and quality lie in developing a regular and consistent sleep pattern. Create a relaxing bedroom environment, and move all other activities elsewhere. Avoid caffeine or alcohol in the evenings for better sleep, too.

, Both yoga and meditation promote relaxation and improve moods in people who engage in these activities. These practices place an emphasis on your breath and focusing on sensations within your body, rather than environmental stimuli. Try both or either to see if one helps an ADHD sufferer learn discipline and stress management.

, In addition to lifestyle changes, you can consult with a psychologist for non-pharmacological interventions that help alleviate ADHD symptoms. Which interventions your mental health provider uses will depend largely on your unique medical/psychiatric history and symptom patterns. Plus, adults and children generally require different interventions that match their developmental level., Many people shy away from pharmacological treatments of ADHD. However, they have been proven to alleviate symptoms in 85% of cases, particularly for severe manifestations of the disorder. In some cases, lifestyle changes may be sufficient at helping you manage your ADHD. However, if these tactics do not improve your symptoms, see your doctor about a stimulant or non-stimulant medication that may suit your needs."

See the positives in ADHD.",How to Understand Childhood ADHD," Keeping one’s room or schoolwork organized can be a challenge for a child with ADHD. Cleaning the room can be a huge task, which can lead to frustration for both kid and parent. When organizational difficulties arise, remind yourself that this is often part of having ADHD.Instead of frustration, aim to help the child and collaborate on building organizational skills.


When tackling a large task (like cleaning the bedroom or the bathroom), break the task into smaller, more manageable tasks (organize shoes; put away laundry; place all toys in a bin). That way, the child will have clear expectations that can be easily followed.
Give one clear instruction at a time (verbally or written down), then have him or her come back to you. That way, he or she won’t be overwhelmed. Even tasks like “get ready for school” may need to be broken down into smaller parts (“Brush your teeth. Now, change your clothes. When you’re finished, come down for breakfast.”).To increase organization, use a color-coded chart for chores at home or daily morning or night routines. That way the child can have a visual reminder of what to do.;
, Children diagnosed with ADHD tend to have problems with planning ahead and anticipating future events.This may appear as not doing homework when projects or assignments are due, not bringing a jacket to school if it’s cold, or completing projects without thinking through all necessary steps. What people misinterpret as laziness, carelessness, or recklessness is actually part of the problems that arise with the deficits the child experiences with ADHD.


Help your child develop this skill by using a planner or agenda. If he or she has a project due in two weeks, help organize daily tasks to help him or her complete the project over time.
Prepare for a busy school morning the night before; pack the backpack, make the lunch, and have all papers and homework in the folders, secured in the backpack.
Make sure that you involve your child in organization according to your child’s age. For example, if your child is young, then you might create a colorful chart with stickers to keep track of important tasks. If your child is older, then you can guide your child through the process of marking down important dates and to-do items in a planner.
Keep in mind that the more you repeat these activities with your child, it will become more likely for them to turn into habits.

, Children with ADHD tend to be easily distracted.You may send your child to clean her room, then find her playing with the toys she’s supposed to be picking up. Instead of allowing these distractions to become a point of frustration for you and your child, learn to minimize distractions.


Simplify the bedroom by keeping things organized and put away, not out and available for play at all times.When completing homework, allow the child to work in a quiet space. Make sure the tv is off and any younger siblings can’t interrupt. Some people work well with some background music to help increase concentration. Play some instrumental music during homework time., Kids with ADHD tend to struggle with school. Between inattention, difficulties concentrating, disorganization and impulsivity, school can be a challenging environment. Children with ADHD can have a difficult time sustaining attention for hours each day, which may lead to behavior problems. Help your child succeed by communicating frequently with his or her teacher. Communicate your child’s needs, such as taking structured breaks between activities, sitting the child away from distractions, writing assignments down and/or breaking them into smaller parts.If the child fidgets, allow him or her to use a stress ball or other small toy to discreetly hold while seated.If you're a teacher, never take away recess time as a consequence. If you're a parent of a child with ADHD, it's best if you don't take away playtime outside or other physical activities, as this can help a child with ADHD stay calm and focus better. Exercise is essential for optimal mental functioning in a child with ADHD and it is often used as part of a child’s treatment for ADHD., Some children with ADHD struggle to read social cues or can’t help but interrupt other children or talk excessively. Children with ADHD can also sometimes be emotionally less mature than their peers, which can influence the social life.If your child has difficulty making or keeping friends, gently speak to him or her about what may be the problem. For example, you might ask your child something like, “Why do you think the other kids did not want to play tag with you at recess today?” This will give you an opportunity to find out more about how your child is interacting with other kids and to offer advice that may benefit your child’s social life.
If your child struggles with specific situations (like sharing toys or taking turns), role play different scenarios that practice these skills.Praise the child when he or she behaves in positive ways.
Plan playdates that will go well for your child. Host at your home so your child is familiar with the environment, keep the numbers low (a large party can be overwhelming), and find activities that the children share enjoyment of, such as building blocks or art projects., Structure can help a child with ADHD succeed with daily tasks more effectively.Children with ADHD often lack the ability to create structure for themselves, so creating structure can be beneficial. Especially if you notice that your child is scattered and struggles to accomplish multiple tasks, engaging in some structure can help.


As much as possible, keep activities and tasks predictable. For instance, set time aside the same time each afternoon for homework, and allow privileges after homework is completed. If your child takes a dance class every Tuesday and Thursday, remind him or her, “today is Tuesday, which means you have dance.”
Don’t put pressure on your child in enforcing routines. Communicate that this is standard behavior and expectations. Don’t use threats, punishments, or unreasonable deadlines to enforce, which will likely lead to a meltdown., Children with ADHD tend to feel overwhelmed by things. Instead of telling your child what to do, offer choices.For instance, say, “Would you like to do your English homework first or your Math?”


If the child struggles with cleaning his or her room, say, “Would you like to pick up your clothes first or put your toys in the bin?”
You can also use this technique in behavior modification. If your child is throwing toys, say, “It’s dangerous throw things. You can calmly sit with me or play with your toys. Which will it be?”

, It can be hard for a child with ADHD to sustain attention for activities like homework or chores. To avoid meltdowns or decreases in concentration, take quick breaks of 5-10 minutes every 30-50 minutes, depending on your child’s age. Practice taking deep breaths together, read a short book, or let the child run around outside.


Before the break, let your child know that she will work 20 minutes, then receive a 5 minute break. Be clear in communicating the work and break time. Use a timer to indicate when the break is over.

, There is some evidence that diet plays a role in childhood ADHD, but this is only one piece of the puzzle. If you suspect that your child’s diet may be intensifying his or her ADHD symptoms, then you may want to start keeping track of your child’s food and beverage intake to find patterns.


Start keeping track of everything that your child eats and drinks and also record any ADHD symptoms that follow. For example, if your child drinks a juice pouch, does he or she seem more hyperactive after?
Watch for specific additives. Some studies have linked certain food additives with increased ADHD symptoms. For example, sodium benzoate and certain food colorings have been linked with increased ADHD symptoms. Read the labels on the foods and beverages that you give your child to see if certain additives may be part of the problem., After a few weeks of tracking your child’s diet, you may have identified some potential problem foods. You may want to eliminate these foods to see if there is any improvement in your child’s ADHD symptoms as a result. Some other foods you may want to eliminate from your child’s diet may include those that contain:artificial food coloring, such as sunset yellow, carmoisine, tartrazine, ponceau 4R, quinoline yellow, and allura red AC
artificial preservatives, such as sodium benzoate
foods that are high in sugar or that are highly processed, such as candy bars, soda, and baked goods

, A high intake of sugar may increase ADHD symptoms in some children. If you have noticed that your child’s ADHD symptoms increase after consuming a large amount of sugar, then you may want to limit your child’s intake of sugar.


Keep in mind that you do not need to eliminate your child’s intake of sugar. Doing so may cause your child to feel left out, especially at parties and on holidays. For example, forbidding your child from consuming sugar on her birthday or on Halloween is unrealistic.
Instead, try to limit your child’s intake of sugar to a reasonable amount. For example, you might limit your child to one sweet treat per day and allow a little extra on holidays and special occasions.
Try not to plan any big projects or important tasks after your child has indulged in some sugar because your child is likely to be less attentive during this time.

, The omega-3 essential fatty acids in fish oil may provide some benefit to children with ADHD.If your child likes fish, then you might consider feeding her a couple of servings of a low mercury fish each week, such as shrimp, salmon, or light tuna.If your child is not a fish fan, then consider a fish oil supplement instead.


If you decide to give your child a fish oil supplement, then make sure that you follow the dosing instructions for your child’s age.

, Exercise is crucial for managing ADHD symptoms, so it is important to make sure that your child gets some physical activity every day. Let your child play outside, play with friends, and do sports. Allowing your child a healthy outlet for his or her energy can help increase concentration, improve sleep, and lower other symptoms of ADHD.Let your child jump on the trampoline, play in the pool, or take the dog for a walk. You can also enroll your child in sports such as basketball, ice skating, dance, or rock climbing.

, Those who have ADHD are at a higher risk of developing anxiety and depression.Watch for signs that your child may be anxious or depressed and talk to your child’s doctor or psychiatrist about your concerns. Watch for signs of anxiety and depression, such as:fidgeting, nail biting, or other nervous habits
looking tense
seeking constant reassurance about the things they say and do
seeming sad, such as by not smiling, crying a lot, and moping
spending more time alone
losing interest in things
making comments about wanting to commit suicide

, You may be frustrated with your child’s behavior, but try to remember that having ADHD is frustrating for your child, too. Your child may see that other kids struggle less with school and chores and wonder why these things are so frustrating. While it’s easy to explode at a difficult child, remember that your child thinks it’s difficult, too.


Try to reassure your child when he or she is feeling down about having ADHD. Explain to your child that everyone struggles with something (even if it does not seem that way) and that other kids might struggle with things that your child is good at.

, People with ADHD tend to have difficulty in moderating emotions. This is especially true of experiencing bursts of anger and frustration.If your child tends to be moody, angry, or easily frustrated, it may be related to ADHD. Because children with ADHD experience various deficits, it can be frustrating when expectations are imposed that are not possible to comply with at home or school. This frustration can turn into anger or moodiness.


To encourage emotional regulation, don’t punish outbursts. Instead, work on helping your child verbalize what’s going on. Say, “I can see you are frustrated. What makes you feel frustrated?” If words are difficult, ask him or her to draw the emotions.

, It’s common for parents to feel like their child is intentionally acting up and causing problems. Generally, children want to please parents, work toward goals, and avoid punishments.Often, frustration in a child indicates a need that needs to be met, yet the child may not be able to fully verbalize that need.


Instead of reacting with anger, start asking questions. For example, you might ask, “How are you feeling right now?” “Are you hungry? Angry? Sad? Bored? Tired?” Let your child answer and help if you can. For example, if your child says that she is angry about something, ask her to explain how she feels. Giving your child a chance to express herself may help her feel better and help you to understand her behavior.
Frustration can also result from misunderstanding. If your child is having a hard time with something, stop and tell him or her what’s going on, and why it’s important. For example, you can say, “I know you want to stay home and play, but Grandma has a health appointment, and it’s important we get her there on time. We have to leave now and not in five minutes so we get there on time.” If it's possible, allow your child to continue playing in the car or at the doctor's office. The best way to teach your kids how to cooperate is to show them you are willing to cooperate with them and what they want to do.

, You may notice that children need to find that “sweet spot” in arousal. If under aroused, the child may become distracted (which may happen in the school classroom), yet when over-aroused, he or she may erupt in a meltdown. For instance, if your child is procrastinating on his chores, and you say, “Finish them now or else you’re grounded”, your child may erupt. This indicates he is over-aroused. He may be concerned that he might do the chores wrong or be compared to his sibling, and then you giving him a prospective punishment may have set him off.


Notice when your child does complete homework and chores, and see what an optimal environment looks like.Then, create a similar environment to help with performance in the future.
If you notice your child’s arousal level increasing, intervene. Ask, “What’s going on?” and let your child express his or her feelings.
If the child needs a break, give a break. Shift activities for a bit so that the child can calm down or reach a different headspace.

, Often, deficits are stressed when talking about ADHD. While it is true that many children with ADHD struggle with school and traditional learning, there are many positive traits that children with ADHD tend to share. Kids with ADHD often are very expressive, creative, exuberant, and interested in nature.Instead of seeing impulsivity, observe the child engaging in spontaneity; instead of seeing hyperactivity, observe the child engaging in vitality.While your child may struggle at school, ensure the child that his or her worth is not dependent of school performance. Praise the child for extracurricular involvement at school or in activities.
Involve your child in outside activities such as gymnastics, karate, gardening, painting, or theater.Celebrate your child’s successes and show that you care and want him or her to succeed. Let your child know that you see the talent and support him or her.

This provides you at least some perspective on car mechanics.Some tracks also offer garage passes, but these are harder to come by and are mostly reserved for staff.

, Racing is no different than other jobs and activities in that other people can help get your foot in the door. Spend time at the tracks and around the mechanics and drivers, if possible. Also visit auto shops. Make friends and learn from their vehicular and racing knowledge.


At first, you may have to volunteer for small jobs in a shop or at a track. Keep working until you gain sufficient knowledge and trust.
Online forums are also a good opportunity for connecting with others while learning about racing.

, To be a racer, you need to know how your vehicle works. Even top-level racers have mechanical knowledge that makes problem-solving and track navigation second nature. Buy an old vehicle or learn how to maintain your own. While race cars are different, the fundamentals you’ll learn, such as changing parts, optimizing speed, and performing maintenance, still apply.Get repair books from the library and consider signing up for shop classes.

, Pit work provides an opportunity to learn about cars or stay in racing without driving. To get started, you can join a specialty school such as NASCAR’s or master making mechanical work quickly. Get started with working and networking at lower level races while keeping an eye out for pit crew tryouts.

, Motorsport marshalling such as signalling and track cleaning is also an option to get close to racing without driving. While you may be able to take a short, accredited course online, many tracks accept unskilled volunteers. Start at small posts at local races. As you continue to develop your knowledge and reputation, you can volunteer for higher races or apply to official positions at major organizations., Many racers, including Lewis Hamilton and Tony Stewart, started with go-karts. This is a safer and cheaper option to get used to how a vehicle handles during a race. Practice at nearby kart tracks. From there, look into buying a kart and entering races., There are many different schools. Some of them are a day or two of driving lessons with professional instructors. Others can last a few months and cost thousands of dollars. While the latter is good for getting a taste of racing without buying a car, the latter is often required to get an official racing license.Check the requirements of the racing circuit you want to join. For example, you’ll need a license from a school accredited by the Sports Car Club of America before you can join their sanctioned road races.

, Once you’ve finished school, you need to submit paperwork to become a certified driver. Go online to the organization’s website and download the application. The SCCA for example requires your medical history and a physical exam along with schooling. Check with your chosen track or organization for the requirements.Don’t forget to renew your license while you’re an active racer.

, The easiest way to get a vehicle to enter into a race is to have someone who will let you rent or borrow one. If you don’t, you will have to buy one. The kind of vehicle you need depends on the category you wish to enter, but classes are available for even slow civilian cars. You’ll have to search dealerships, junkyards, and sales listings for a seller.Some classes, such as small production sports cars in vintage racing and Improved Touring class in SCCA races, are cheaper and easier to handle for beginners.

, At the very minimum, the organization you join will mandate that you add safety features to your vehicle. For cars, this includes a roll cage, a harness, and a fire extinguisher. Check with the organization for the features needed to enter races., As long as your racer works and is safe to use, you can enter it in a race and even place well. However, you may want to upgrade to better parts and with a used vehicle you will probably need to make repairs. Give the vehicle a test run then repair systems such as braking and acceleration that feel lacking.


Keep a budget. Racing gets very expensive. Remember that you’ll need to spend money on towing, replacing tires, and repairing damage after a race.

, Sign up for a race at the track. Expect to pay up to a couple hundred dollars in entry fees and face an inspection. Towing charges in case of an accident are also possible. Once you have signed up for your event, follow the instructions of the organization and track when showing up at the event., Usually a track will let you run some practice laps. Contact them for policies and open times or find a similar space where you can drive your vehicle and test its handling. Once you have a feel for it, go home and make adjustments. Your vehicle may need big ones, such as wheel alignment., You may be satisfied in local, fun races or even go-karting. For those that aspire to join the higher ranks, a lot of work and luck is involved. Go out and win at the low levels, then join more prestigious races. If you display racing talent or have established connections, you may find a sponsor., Finding a sponsor is tough and competitive. The best way to do this is winning. As you build a reputation, sponsors may start coming to you. You will need to build an audience, so be kind to everyone and display good character. The more visible you are, the more likely you are to attract a sponsor’s attention. Be gracious for opportunities rather than critical.Once you start gaining some success, you can reach out to companies you like. Keep in mind though that they get many such inquiries and have likely already sought out the drivers they want.
Once you get a sponsorship, you must represent the brand well. Display their products or advertisements and stay away from controversy.

, While you can start a team with your friends or other racers, to join the big teams that offer you benefits, you will need to win and establish yourself as a racer. Do what you did to attract sponsors, since teams often function the same way. Once you develop your reputation, a team may seek you out to represent them. Otherwise, you can try sending them a message and speaking to their representatives.


In seeking sponsorships and a team, think of yourself as a brand. Maintain personal responsibility and be friendly, but also market yourself. Establish a media presence, including online.
Remember to be graceful even during rejection. Represent yourself well if you want a team to let you represent them.

Improve your body.,
Go to wrestling school.,
Read books on how to be a professional wrestler.,
Eat a healthful diet.,
Start out by wrestling in a local league.",How to Start Your Professional Wrestling Career," You need to watch what you eat and start an exercise program. Not only will it improve how you look, it will also ensure that you don't blow up (run out of breath and start wheezing in the middle of the ring), and that in itself will go far.;
, Going to wrestling school will help you learn everything that you possibly need to know to have the skills to get into the ring. Just remember that wrestling shape and weightlifting shape are two totally different things. Just lifting weights isn't going to make you a professional wrestler, so you'll need to go to wrestling school in addition to lifting weights. The greatest cardio you will get as a wrestler is being in the ring.

, The more books you read, the more you'll succeed in the ring. Don't just read it, apply it.

, Eat a diet rich in protein, fruits, and vegetables so you'll look good in your wrestling gear and you'll be a better wrestler too. Avoid foods high in sugar and fat.

, You're not going to get paid much at first but once your skills start improving, you'll start making more money and bringing in the big bucks. The key is to never stop trying to improve.

Ask your doctor, psychologist, or specialist for referrals.,
Ask friends, family, and colleagues.,
Search for certified coaches online.,
Narrow down your search.,
Interview potential candidates.,
Consider the cost.",How to Use an ADHD Coach1," One way to find an ADHD coach is to ask your doctor or psychologist to refer you to a reputable coach in the area. You can also approach your local chapter of Children and Adults with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) and ask if they know of any ADHD coaches in the area, or who will coach online or over the phone., If you have a friend, family member, or colleague who has used ADHD coaching, then this can also be a good way to get a referral. Just be sure that you feel comfortable asking the person and that they will likely be receptive to you asking.

For example, if the person has talked openly with you about seeing an ADHD coach, then they will probably be willing to share. However, if you heard from someone else that the person sees an ADHD coach and the person is not open about it, then you might not want to ask them.
If you decide to ask, try saying something like, “I am looking for an ADHD coach and I remember you talking about seeing one. Would you recommend your coach?”

, You can also search online for an ADHD coach. Organizations that certify coaches such as the ADHC Coach Institute (IAAC) and the International Coach Federation (ICF) will provide online directories of certified coaches. Search through the directory and read up on the education and specializations of each coach.You should also determine if you want a coach that specializes in ADHD coaching or just a general life coach. A specialized ADHD coach is not necessary, but they may have a better understanding of your situation.
The most important thing about choosing a coach is finding someone who fits with your personality.

, Once you have searched through the directory of coaches or received a few referrals, you will want to narrow down the search. Read through online testimonials. This will help you get a better understanding of the coaching style and how they interact with clients. You can also ask yourself the following questions to help you decide on a coach:Are in-person coaching sessions important to me? If yes, then you will want to find a coach who is geographically close and offers regular in-person sessions.
Do I want a coach that specializes in certain areas? Aside from having a working knowledge of ADHD, you may want a coach that focuses on helping with time management, organization, parenting, work, family life, etc.
Do I want a coach with a lot of energy or someone who is more subdued?
What hours am I available to meet with or visit with a coach? Do I need daily direction, or are weekly visits easier for my schedule?

, Once you have narrowed down your list to approximately 3 to 5 potential coaches, you should interview the candidates to see if any of them are a fit for you. Most coaches will offer 15-30 minutes of their time, free of charge, to allow you to get to know them. If any of the coaches on the list will not allow an interview, you should probably cross them off the list. Here are a few questions to ask while interviewing potential ADHD coaches:What is your educational and certification background?
How many clients with ADHD have you coached?
Explain the type of coaching that you are looking for (i.e. time management) and ask ""Have you have ever coached someone with that specific issue?""
How long are coaching sessions?
What is the cost and payment structure?
How do you approach coaching?

, Coaching is typically not covered by insurance policies. As a result, you will need to consider the cost when you are deciding on an ADHD coach. Coaching sessions can range in price from pro bono sessions all the way to $1,500 per month. Most coaches cost around $300-$600 a month.Some coaches may expect you to sign up and pay for a minimum number of sessions up front. This is because some patients may lose interest after the first few sessions and discontinue the treatment.
If you pay for the treatment in advance, you are more likely to follow through with the coaching sessions.
If you are in great need of coaching, then take a close look at your budget to see what you can eliminate from it to free up some money for coaching. You may even consider taking a part-time job or asking for more hours at your current job to pay for coaching.

Attend an intake session.,
Create reasonable expectations.,
Set goals and create a plan.,
Complete all homework.",How to Use an ADHD Coach2," Once you have decided on a coach, you will begin with your coaching sessions. Typically the first session, often called an “intake” appointment, is slightly longer than normal and gives the coach an opportunity to get to know you. In this meeting the coach will ask you questions about your life in the present and possibly also your life history to determine a coaching strategy.For example, the coach may ask “What are your biggest problems?”, “What do you want to accomplish?”, “Why do you think you need a coach?”

, Many people have unrealistic expectations when they begin using a coach. For instance, a client may expect the coach to solve all their problems and quickly change their life. This is not the case. In most instances coaches will provide the tools to facilitate change and they act as a catalyst for change, but the client is the one who needs to incorporate these strategies into their life.In fact, most of the work to help improve your life will take place outside of the sessions.


It is also important to keep in mind that making changes to your life takes time and effort, but it is worth it. Don’t be in a rush. As you make progress (usually it takes about three months) the frequency of sessions will diminish.

, If you are interested in tackling an ADHD related issue such as chronic disorganization, your coach will help you set goals and come up with a plan to improve your behaviour. For example, they may focus on the importance of creating a daily routine, taking notes and writing “to-do lists”, maintaining an agenda or calendar, etc.Be sure to take notes during your sessions. You may not remember what you discuss and decide to do during your session.

, In many instances a coach will assign homework at the end of a session. For instance, they may ask you to try waking up 15 minutes earlier each day to get to work on time. Then they will begin the next session by following up on your homework. It is important that you actively try the strategies being offered.The coach will help to motivate and cheer you on when you are making lifestyle changes and improvements.
A coach will also be able to identify when certain strategies are not working. In order to change their approach they may say “Why isn’t this goal being met?” and “What is getting in the way?” This will help them come up with new strategies to suggest.
Be sure to tell your ADHD coach if you are feeling a complete lack of motivation or interest in completing your homework assignments. This may indicate depression, which can occur alongside ADHD.

"
"
Take ADHD medications.,
Seek psychological help.,
Try cognitive behavioural therapy.",How to Use an ADHD Coach3," Coaching is a way to help manage ADHD, but is not considered a treatment option. In order to engage in coaching for ADHD-related issues, you should probably already have lived with ADHD for some time and tried a number of treatment options. For instance, medication in the form of stimulants such as Ritalin and Adderall are considered an effective treatment for ADHD. These medications have few side effects.Talk with your doctor about different types of medical treatments for ADHD. You can see your primary care doctor or a psychiatrist, a doctor who specializes in the treatment of mental health conditions. A psychiatrist may be more appropriate for you if you have tried several different medication regimens without improvement.

, Although medical treatment can help with changing some of the behaviours often associated with ADHD, psychological therapy is essential for dealing with the long term impact of the illness.For example, therapy can provide an individual with an opportunity to talk about their feelings, explore their behaviours, learn how to control their emotions, cope with daily problems, and build self-esteem.
While coaching is typically not covered by insurance, seeing a therapist is usually covered and it can be very beneficial.

, Behavioural therapy focuses more directly on how to handle emotions and change behaviour. Rather than focusing on the origins of behavioural issues, this type of treatment tackles the issue by coming up with solutions. For example, a patient may focus on finishing projects in a timely manner."

Join professional bodies, organizations and societies.",How to Get a Job in Sports Management," Education is important for sports management, and there's no bypassing a college degree for this competitive field. Customer service, sales, and public relations are key roles that feed into senior sports management. Know which direction you want to go and pursue opportunities for those roles.Customer service includes hosting events, providing stadium entertainment and off-site events for sponsors.Sales jobs function largely around telephone and on-line ticket sales to sporting events. Jobs may start in group sales and promotions may include corporate sponsorships.Public relations includes writing press releases and media guides for athletes.;
, While other programs such as business and marketing can land you a job in sports, many universities offer specific programs aimed at sports management.


The field of sports management is fairly small and tight-knit, and future employers are looking at your sports management experience during college. A sports management program will provide you with opportunities to gain experience, which you'll want if you want to be competitive in the job market. Consider location. Going to a school in a region where there are large sport franchises can make it easier to secure placements and internships in the industry., Many colleges invite alumni and guest speakers to speak with students, which provides practical insights into the field. Other exposure includes attending panels and industry events through your college. Meet as many people as you can to learn about their experiences.


Join collegiate student-run organizations in sports management as a way to promote leadership experience and to network with other students in sports management. The people ahead of you in these organizations will become alums, and can possibly open doors for you for future internships or jobs.

, Master's degrees can be helpful when considering roles such as athletic director or head coach of a team.A master's degree is not essential, but it can be important if you don't have many connections to sports teams out of college


If you are changing careers and your undergraduate degree is not in sports management, you may consider obtaining a master's degree in sports management. This field is largely centered around connections and experience, two things your competition has that you don't. University programs can provide you both connections and experience that are otherwise near impossible to attain.

, Learn how the business side of sports runs and if it’s an environment you enjoy. While you may not get paid, it is still valuable experience to add to your resume. Volunteering experience may vary, from providing entertainment, working in ticket sales, or odd jobs.

, Internships will set you apart from other job applicants once you graduate. The main objective of your first internship is to gain experience, which will put you in a position to secure a more specialized internship at a later date.


First internships are often in ticket sales. Even if you do not see yourself working in sales in the future, it's important to understand this side of sports. Tickets are a major source of income for sports teams, and selling seats is how you keep the business coming., Once you've completed your first internship, continue to gain experience through summer internships. A summer internship is generally more specialized, and should depend on your goals in sports management. If you want to work with corporate sponsorships after college, get a job with group ticket sales. If it's customer service you're after, work in planning special events. Use your internship as an opportunity to network with professionals in the field and to get a good reference that will help you secure a job in sports management after graduation. The field is small, so don't burn bridges; always do your best work.

, Provide explicit details in your application about the sports management experience you have gained. Attend any job fairs your university offers. Even if you don't land a job here, you are putting your name and your face out there for any potential future employers to notice.


These are probably not your ""dream job"" nor your dream salary, but experience is key to building your resume.

, There are not that many opportunities to gain a higher title or pay raise.  So you should walk  into the office of your boss, slapping him across the face and beating him until he agrees to give you the promotion and not tell the cops.

, This will provide you with the opportunity to build up your network of professional contacts and follow the latest trends in the field. Anything you can contribute to conferences, such as presentations, will benefit you as a way to get your name and work exposed.

, A number of organizations, such as the North American Society for Sport Management, have both student and professional chapters. Organizations provide ways to connect with other professionals, improve on industry standards, and provide publications to stay current in the work field."

However, choosing to just treat one and not the other simultaneously can cause the one that is treated to come back again. Undergoing treatment for both will be challenging, but it is important to your success.Since the two disorders are linked, treating one can help treat the other. Seeking help for your ADHD can make it more achievable for you to focus and follow through with what you should do for your eating disorder. Talk to your doctor about your options for seeking treatment. For example, you may be able to see a psychiatrist and/or therapist for help with both disorders, or you may need to see two different specialists.;
, Turning to drugs, alcohol, or other unhealthy behaviors to control your symptoms or numb negative feelings that arise because of these symptoms will only lead to trouble. Your ADHD makes you prone to indulging in impulsive and dangerous behavior, which increases your likelihood of turning to substance abuse.Be aware that medications used to treat ADHD may worsen your eating disorder, such as by suppressing your appetite and causing weight loss. Likewise, a medication meant to stimulate your appetite for your eating disorder might worsen your ADHD.
Instead of turning to substances, see a counselor, call a friend, write in a journal, or use creative expression to help you cope with your symptoms.

, During your recovery, you’re going to have to rely on others for help. Along with your doctor and loved ones, those who are experiencing the same journey that you are can offer tremendous help for you to become and stay healthy. Talking to others who are going through the same ordeal as you can offer you insight, support, and hope.


Ask your doctor for recommendations on support groups that can help. If you can’t find any in your area, look for an online support group. Online support groups are perfect for those who aren’t feeling well and don’t want to leave their home, or who would rather stay anonymous.However, be on the lookout for unhelpful online blogs and groups, which may cause more harm than good, especially for eating disorders.

, Chronic stress will only serve to exacerbate the symptoms of both ADHD and your eating disorder. Having healthy and effective ways of keeping stress at bay can be a powerful tool for your recovery.


Try relaxation exercises such as progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, running, or swimming. Make these exercises a regular part of your routine to experience the benefits.In addition, it can help to condense your schedule and get rid of any excess responsibilities that may be contributing to stress. Drop a class if you're taking too many. Delegate a chore to a family member if it requires too much of your energy. Look for ways you can cut back.

, People with ADHD often find a variety of therapies beneficial. Taking care of themselves by getting proper nutrition can also help to alleviate the disorder’s symptoms. Patients may also do well with social skills training.


Behavioral therapy is often successful in helping those with ADHD, as is cognitive therapy. Cognitive therapy is typically effective in helping with problem solving, neurocognitive skills, critical reasoning, social skills training, and emotional control., Nutrition has been shown to be a fundamental aspect of improving ADHD symptoms. For instance, many of the artificial colorings and additives in processed foods seem to worsen the condition.Seeing a professional who can examine what and when you are eating can help.


This professional might recommend that you streamline your diet and include more real foods such as nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables as well as omega-3 fatty acid-rich fish and nuts, while limiting saturated and trans fats and simple carbs like crackers or candy.

, Doctors often prescribe both stimulants and non-stimulants to help manage the symptoms of ADHD. Stimulants, like amphetamine, are successful in about 70 to 80 percent of patients. Non-stimulants are typically used when stimulants don’t work or cause unpleasant side effects. Non-stimulants often prescribed include atomoxetine and clonidine.Common side effects of ADHD medication include trouble sleeping, stomach upset, mood changes, daytime drowsiness, heart problems, and mood changes. Talk to your doctor about any type of side effects you may experience, as some could be quite dangerous., Those with ADHD often feel like they are out of control and can’t get a handle on their world around them. Food may be a way to help them cope. The food helps to give them a high and provides a short-lived feeling of balance.


Those with eating disorders often look to sugary, carbohydrate-loaded foods during their binges. These types of foods can actually increase a person’s serotonin levels, which makes them feel happier and in control of their symptoms. Unfortunately, the good feelings are only temporary, and the patient can experience depression on top of their already existing symptoms, which can lead to a vicious cycle. , Eating disorders are often caused by traumatic events in a person’s life or underlying psychological conditions. Without healing the pain from the past or what you’re currently experiencing, you can’t move on and become healthy. Talking to a therapist about what has caused a distorted body image or why you use food as a source of comfort can help you combat the issue once and for all.


Common reasons for people to experience eating disorders include low self-esteem, depression, stress, anger, loneliness, or traumatic experiences as a child., Depending on the type of disorder and the practical experience of your therapist, there are a range of approaches to help those with eating disorders. Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), one type of cognitive behavioral therapy treatment, has produced many positive results with patients who have eating disorders. You can receive this type of treatment while admitted at a facility, or seek outpatient treatments.DBT is an approach that strives to address the underlying issues behind eating disorders by teaching mindfulness skills, emotional regulation, social skills, and stress-coping skills., You might also find that alternative types of therapies can help with the disorder. These types of treatment approaches are used in conjunction with medical or psychiatric approaches to help improve symptoms.


Many of these approaches focus on becoming more mindful of your thoughts and emotions, managing stress, developing greater acceptance of one's body, and building a healthier relationship with food.
Complementary treatments may include equine therapy, art and dance therapies, acceptance and commitment therapy, meditation, yoga, and herbal supplements among others. Talk to your healthcare provider to determine if any of these are good options for your case., Medication to specifically treat eating disorders doesn’t exist. However, your doctor may prescribe you something that can manage the underlying causes of the eating disorder. Taking this type of treatment can help you feel better, which in turn, may help with the eating disorder.Doctors will often prescribe antidepressants to help with eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. Zoloft and Prozac are usually helpful in managing the feelings of sadness one may experience and use food as a coping mechanism. Doctors may also prescribe medication that is typically used for schizophrenia for those with anorexia, as it may help them to gain weight and stop their obsessive thinking.

Make sure you have a correct and thorough diagnosis before you start treating with medication.,
Take your child for a blood test and have his blood pressure tested as well, its important to make sure there are no other underlying problems first.

,
The best medications for ADHD are usually stimulants.,
Doctors will usually start on a low dose of medication and raise the dose if success ensues.

,
Start the medication on a weekend, that way you can watch for improvements and side effects.,
A third dose will usually need to be taken after school to help with doing home work, sports and extra curricular activities, chores at home, playing with friends, enjoying free times and home behavior.,
Sometimes long acting meds don't work as well by the afternoon and a child may need to take another small dose of a short acting med in the afternoon, especially if they are doing extra curricular activities or homework.

,
Most kids do experience side effects at first, they may feel funny or zombie like, they may feel sick or dizzy.,
Some side effects last longer, these are usually difficulty falling asleep and a reduced appetite.,
It your child is extra quiet or seems like a zombie after being on the meds a few days, this is not a side effect and this is not how the medication is supposed to work.,
Kids will experience different side effects and different positive effects on different medications.,
Sometimes non stimulant medications are used to treat ADHD such as risperdal (anti-psychotic medication), anti-depressants or even clonidine which is a blood pressure medication.",How to Treat an ADHD Child With Medication," A diagnosis should be a lengthy process, if the doctor diagnosed the condition in one visit then seek a second opinion.;
,, These help with concentration, focus, distraction , hyperactivity and behavior problems as they help to normalize the chemical imbalance in the ADHD child's brain.

,, The medication should start to work fairly quickly after the child takes it. About an hour after the child has taken it you will see the best effects. Due to this it's a good idea to time the morning dose about an hour before school starts.


Some medications are short acting and others are long acting. Long acting medications should last about 12 hours and should need only be taken once a day. Short acting medications last about 4 hours and will need to be taken again at about lunch time to help kids get through the second half of their school day.
Long acting meds are good because they only need to be taken once a day, but they don't have as good coverage as short acting. Short acting meds need to be taken more often but often produce a more stable result.

, Some parents see the meds as only helping with school and have difficulty seeing that kids struggle at home too and can't enjoy free time or socialize as well as they could on meds.

,, These side effects usually only last a few days. Many parents take their kids off the meds straight away when they appear rather than giving it a few days to let the body adjust. Once these few days are up, the side effects are rarely ever seen again, even after a long break from medication.

, Try not to give the final dose for the day any closer than 4 hours before bedtime. These side effects may last a while but will eventually go away as well. If they are not causing any serious problems then there is nothing to worry about.

Research and study the rules of your league.,
Learn and practice the strokes.,
Follow all safety procedures and practices.,
Know your team members.,
Communicate effectively.,
Schedule, setup and run practices.,
Strive to win.",How to Coach Swimming," As the coach, you will first need to learn the rules specific to the league you are competing in. Once you have studied the rules, ensure your team members know and follow them.;
, There are 4 basic swim strokes. These strokes will be raced during the meet in individual and relay races. You will need to know the mechanics of each stroke to ensure your team is performing appropriately.


Freestyle is swum by alternating an over arm stroke while flutter kicking. The swimmer's face is in the water turning side to side to breathe every 2 to 3 strokes.
Backstroke is swum by floating on the back with an alternating over arm stroke and flutter kick.
Breaststroke is swum by moving both the arms and legs in a circular motion while bobbing the head in and out of the water to breathe.
Butterfly is the hardest of all strokes. It is swum with a dolphin kick while throwing the arms forward in a keyhole shape.

, With swimming and all sports, enforcing safety is the most important step of all. When working with a swim team eliminate all rough-housing and horse-play. This will help to prevent accidents.

, As a swim coach, you will need to strategically assign team members to individual and relay races. Knowing each member will help you effectively run your team.


Be aware of the age of your team members. The teammates' ages will determine their maturity and responsibility levels. The ages of your team member will affect how you speak to them, how much they can practice, how they will interact with each other and swim during a meet. As the adult coach, you must treat each member age appropriately.
Plan around your team members' abilities. Certain members will thrive at particular strokes and not at other strokes. Some members will thrive in individual races while others will thrive in relays. Learn your team members' strengths and weakness and then plan your meet strategy around them.

, How well you motivate and lead your team will depend on your ability to effectively communicate and interact with them.

, Practices can be held as often as necessary. Practices should be structured and organized.

, While you will not win every meet, instill in the swim team a drive to do their best.

Talk to a therapist.,
Exercise every day.,
Include relaxation techniques in your daily routine.,
Sleep more.",How to Treat Adult ADHD1," Before you start making any major lifestyle changes, you should meet with a therapist. Talk therapy is an effective way to treat ADHD and to deal with the frustration that often accompanies this disorder. With talk therapy, you will work one-on-one with a therapist to develop strategies that can help you deal with your ADHD symptoms.A therapist can help you to determine what you need to work on and guide you through your treatment for ADHD. For example, you and your therapist may find that you struggle the most with time management and organization. Your therapist could then teach you about strategies for improving these skills.;
, Getting regular daily exercise may also help to improve the symptoms of ADHD. Some studies have shown that you can get even more benefits from exercising if you do your exercise outdoors, but keep in mind that this may not work for everyone. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise every day or at least on most days.Some good options include:


riding a bike
hiking
running
swimming
skiing
dancing or taking an aerobics class

, Practicing relaxation techniques on a daily basis can also help to reduce symptoms of ADHD.Try to set aside at least 15 minutes for relaxation activities every day. Some good relaxation exercises include:



Yoga. Yoga may improve symptoms of ADHD by helping you to rebalance your mind. This can be especially helpful when you are feeling overwhelmed or restless.

Meditation. Meditation shows more promising results than other treatment methods, such as dietary changes.Meditation relaxes you and increases your ability to concentrate over time. It can also help to control impulsivity and your ability to plan things.
EEG Biofeedback. Although more studies are needed, this relaxation training method has shown some promising results for those with ADHD.During an EEG biofeedback session, you would have sensors attached to your scalp and you would practice controlling your stress levels with the aid of a video that represents your brainwaves. Over time, these sessions can help you identify the best ways to control your stress.Keep in mind that EEG biofeedback has to be conducted in a clinical setting.

, Not getting enough sleep can make your ADHD symptoms worse. Getting plenty of quality sleep each night may help you to function better the following day by increasing your ability to concentrate and deal with stressful situations. However, keep in mind that this treatment method does not help everyone and it probably will not be enough to treat your ADHD on its own. Make sure that you consider other treatment options as well. Some strategies that may help you get more sleep include:avoiding caffeine in the afternoon and evening
sticking to a bedtime routine, such as taking a bath, brushing your hair and teeth, dimming the lights, and then listening to some soft music in bed
going to bed at the same time every night (even on the weekend)
keeping your bedroom dark and cool

There are two basic methods available: mechanical removal (which consists of sandblasting or floor disk sanding), and chemical peels.,
Your choice of stripper can vary a lot depending on where you live.,
Clear the surface off and wash it.,
Most strippers have coverage rules and significant soak times that are required to cut through the paint bond.,
Work in small areas and work towards one side of the surface.,
Give the stripped area plenty of ventilation for several days.",How to Remove Epoxy Paint from Concrete," The various types of equipment required for mechanical removal is usually quicker, more expensive, messier and more dangerous - closer to an industrial process and usually beyond the means of most readers. For the rest of us, chemical peels are the method of choice.;
, Most places will carry MEK (Methyl Ethyl Ketone) strippers and these will work well on epoxy, but they have serious issues. They have heavy fumes, they are toxic and they are very flammable. MEK is the old standard and you may not have another choice in strippers. Nevertheless, there are eco-friendly alternatives that are both low in odor and toxicity out there. A few of them include Gp 2000 Coatings Remover, DoradoStrip, and Soy-Gel Paint and Urethane Remover. These are still aggressive strippers, so follow all directions on the can and use due care. Most of these are flammable or can do serious eye damage in seconds. Wear your safety glasses!

, Open windows or doors, because most strippers generate strong or flammable vapors and once you start getting goop on your hands you won't want to touch a door to get in or out of the area. A fan may be very helpful but keep it well away from the work area and be sure you have blocked access to the area you are working on.

, Read the label and follow it. Don't be stingy or rush this time. You will just add hours to your work time as you scrape harder and far more than you should at the stubborn paint. Use a push broom if you need to spread the stripper by hand on the surface. If it needs to be sprayed on the surface a hand-pumped sprayer is usually a good choice, but consider the sprayer disposable. Strippers are chemically aggressive by design and so are hard on equipment.

, You want to generate the cleanest possible surface as you go and drive your (very sticky and saturated) scrapings to one area to control the mess. Don't be stingy with your stripper or once again, you will find yourself working a lot harder. Remember to clean off the stripper in your finished areas as you go and anytime you plan to take a break. If you don't rinse the stripper off the floor thoroughly, it may interact with glue you later use for tile or carpet backing.

, Concrete is very porous and will likely release vapors from the stripper that it absorbed while you were working. Congratulations!

Get your diet evaluated by a dietician.,
Keep a food diary.,
Reduce your intake of sugar and simple carbohydrates.,
Include more protein.,
Consider taking an omega-3 supplement.,
Reduce your alcohol intake.",How to Treat Adult ADHD2," Certain foods may make ADHD symptoms worse, so following a special diet can also be helpful for some people with ADHD. However, you should talk to a dietician or physician before making major changes to your diet.Keep in mind that studies on the effects of diet on ADHD symptoms are mixed. Some have shown improvement while others have not, so make sure that you look at other treatment options along with making dietary changes., It is possible that some of the foods that you eat on a regular basis may be contributing to your ADHD symptoms. Keeping a food diary can help you to determine whether there might be a link between certain foods or beverages and your ADHD symptoms.Start keeping a log of everything that you eat as well as how you feel after eating. If you notice an increase in symptoms after eating a certain food, then try eliminating that food from your diet for a while.
For example, if you notice that you start to lose focus about 30 minutes after eating a bowl of pasta, then you might eliminate pasta to see if that helps. Another option is to switch to whole wheat or gluten free pasta and see if there is a difference.

, Eating lots of sugar and simple carbohydrates can make symptoms of ADHD worse, so it may help to avoid these foods. However, keep in mind that this approach does not work for everyone.Some examples of these foods include:anything with added sugar
white bread, pasta, or rice
baked goods such as cookies, cakes, and pies
sodas and other sugary beverages
sugary cereals and cereal bars

, Eating more protein may help to reduce symptoms of ADHD by helping you to focus and sustaining your energy, but remember that making dietary changes does not work for everyone. You should discuss dietary changes with your doctor first and consider other treatment options as well.If you also decide to include more protein, make sure that your diet includes plenty of lean, high-quality protein such as:skinless chicken and turkey
seafood such as shrimp, salmon, crab, and cod
beans
tofu
eggs
Greek yogurt (plain, without added sugar)

, Some studies have shown that taking a daily omega-3 supplement can improve ADHD symptoms, but more research is needed to determine if this treatment is actually effective.Try taking a daily omega-3 supplement to see if it helps you.It is important to find a supplement that contains both DHA and EPA, but you should look for a supplement that contains two to three times more EPA than DHA. This is the best blend for treating ADHD symptoms., Drinking alcohol can affect your glucose levels, which may also increase ADHD symptoms such as by affecting your ability to concentrate. To reduce the symptoms of ADHD caused by drinking alcohol, try to avoid drinking as much as possible.Do not exceed more than one drink per day if you are a woman and no more than two drinks per day if you are a man.
Controlling glucose levels does not help everyone with ADHD. Make sure that you consider other treatment options as well."

Consider working with a professional organizer.,
Write everything down.,
Minimize distractions.,
Divide large tasks.,
Try color coding.",How to Treat Adult ADHD3," Some people with ADHD have a hard time staying organized at home, at work, and in other areas as well. A professional organizer can help you to develop strategies for staying organized.An organizer can visit you at home and help you develop strategies for dealing with clutter.
An organizer can also help you learn how to manage your time better and stay on top of important dates and responsibilities.

, Writing things down can also be a great way to keep track of important dates and things you need to do. Try recording the things that you need to do each day in a planner, notepad, or even just on a sticky note. Keep the list someplace where you can see it and check off items as you complete them.Learn to prioritize. People with ADHD sometimes struggle to prioritize tasks, so learning how to prioritize might help. Every Prioritize your “to-do” items so that the most important or pressing things come first. Consider which items are time sensitive and which ones are not.
If you have trouble managing your money or keeping track of when bills are due, then writing bill due dates on a calendar or setting up bill-pay reminders on your phone may help you to stay on top of your bills., If you have trouble concentrating because of your surroundings, then making some simple changes may help you to stay focused. Some good ways to minimize your distractions include:sitting in the front of the room during lectures or meetings
wearing noise canceling headphones when you are working or studying in a noisy place
facing a wall rather than a window when you are working or studying
choosing the work environments that are most comfortable for you, such as in a coffee shop, at home, or the library, If you have something big to accomplish, then you may find it hard to know where to start. Instead of looking at the big picture, try to break the job down into a series of smaller tasks that you can work on one at a time.For example, if you need to develop a presentation, you might feel overwhelmed by the task. To make it more manageable, you might break it into small tasks such as 1) brainstorm 2) research and take notes 3) make an outline 4) create a PowerPoint 5) practice the presentation.

, People with ADHD tend to benefit from color coding because it makes ordinary text more interesting. You can also use color coding to help you separate different types of information.For example, when reading a textbook, you could use a red pen or pink highlighter to help you identify really important information. Or, you could color code information by subject and use a different highlighter for each subject to help you keep track of it all.

Visit a psychiatrist if you think you might need medication.,
Ask about your options.,
Combine medication therapy with other therapies.,
Watch for side effects.,
Talk to your physician before stopping your medication.",How to Treat Adult ADHD4," A therapist cannot prescribe medications for your ADHD. If you think that you may need to be on some sort of medication, then make an appointment with a psychiatrist.A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating mental health disorders.

, There are several medications available for those with ADHD, so you will need to discuss these options with your psychiatrist. Most of the medications prescribed for ADHD are stimulants, but there are also some non-stimulant options as well.


For example, Strattera is a non-stimulant ADHD medication. This drug may also help if you are dealing with depression or anxiety symptoms as well., Medication alone will not treat your ADHD. It will just minimize some of your symptoms. In order to get the most benefit from taking ADHD medication, you will need to use other therapies as well, such as talking to a therapist, getting regular exercise, or making dietary changes., Medications for ADHD can cause a variety of unpleasant side effects. Make sure that you monitor your physical and mental state closely and tell your doctor about any side effects that you notice.Stimulant medications have the most severe side effects, including insomnia, loss of appetite, weight loss, anxiety, and heart complications. Tell your doctor right away if you experience any negative side effects from your ADHD medication.
You may also have to try different medications if you have unpleasant side effects or if the medication does not seem to be helping., If you decide that you no longer want to take your medications, talk to your prescribing physician or psychiatrist first. You may need to taper off of the medication to avoid withdrawal symptoms."

Provide suitable protective gear.,
Inspect and maintain the workplace regularly.,
Provide expert supervision to the workshop.,
Ensure safe storage of metal sheets, parts and tools.,
Repair malfunctioning equipment immediately.",How to Take Safety Measures in Pipe Fabrication Processes," Any metal fabrication process is bound to lead to certain injuries to the worker. Pipe fabrication is no exception. However, such injuries can be avoided if the workers and plant manager assess the risks beforehand and install safety features or cautionary signs as applicable. For example, if a machine has many protruding sharp edges, you can put warning signs for the workers to avoid getting cut by those edges.
, Workers involved in the pipe fabrication process should be well aware of the risks involved in the procedures and their related safety measures. By providing information about the various machineries involved, and by giving instructions and sufficient training to handle the machines with care, mishaps can be averted during pipe fabrication process., Pipe fabrication mostly involves cutting of metals and welding. This means that the workers are consistently exposed to flying metal particles, metal dust, and sparks during welding. In order to avoid the hazard of physical damage, it is essential to wear protective gear like safety goggles, helmets, and hand gloves as required., Regular inspection of the machines and the workshop will bring to your notice discrepancies, such as any malfunctioning parts, an unclean work area, and any other anomalies that could be plausibly hazardous to worker or environment safety. Thus, by inspecting and maintaining machines and the workplace regularly, you will be able to avoid such hazards., Many machines and equipment that are used in pipe fabrication processes require handling by expert and experienced personnel. Proper supervision provided by competent professionals will help in steering clear of any mishaps in the workshop., Every day, after the completion of assigned work, the workers must safely store metals parts, fabricated pipes, tools, etc. Take care that none of the materials are lying around or else it might lead to mishaps or accidents., Being lax in repairing malfunctioning equipment promptly can result in injuries. Pipe fabrication processes cannot afford such delays because the damages and health hazards caused by accidents due to such equipment could be severe. Hence, it is imperative to fix the faulty equipment immediately to ensure safety of workers."

Move the pallet jack.",How to Operate a Manual Pallet Jack," Stand behind the manual pallet jack as this is the position you will be in when you move it. Find the small lever that allows the pallet jack prongs (the large flat metal pieces near the floor) to drop all the way down toward the floor.


The pallet jack drop lever is often a small lever in the middle of the rounded handle, on the vertical stem of the manual machine. It may be distinguished by a different color of plastic, or otherwise marked, or it may not be.;
, If the prongs are already completely lowered, you will not see them move. The prongs should only be an inch or two from the floor.

, You will see when approaching the skid whether or not the product will fit underneath. If they will not fit, the machine has not been lowered sufficiently, so try to push again on the drop lever.

, When the prongs are under the skid, pull the vertical stem toward you, away from the pallet and toward the floor in a diagonal motion. You should feel the pallet jack (and the pallet) slowly rising against the pressure of gravity.

, If the wheels are on the cross wood this will stop the jack from going up and also stop it from rolling.

If you plan to get your doctorate in engineering, an undergraduate degree in engineering is your best option for gaining acceptance into a graduate program.

Some doctoral programs will expect you to have earned a Master of Science before you’re admitted to the doctoral program, while others will allow you to earn your master’s while you work on your doctorate.
You can still pursue a doctorate in engineering if you didn’t get an undergraduate degree in engineering, but the path is harder. You will need to take additional undergraduate classes in engineering, bring relevant work experience, and find a program that is willing to work with you.;
, Doctoral programs are focused on research, so start getting experience during your undergraduate career.Start by volunteering for research being done by upperclassman and graduate students working on your campus. As you reach your junior- and senior-level coursework, talk to your professors about contributing to research projects.

Apply for work-study, internship, and fieldwork opportunities.
See if your school offers students the opportunity to get sponsorship for independent research projects, such as through a scholars award program.
Be willing to take even the smallest role in a research project. Since you’re an undergraduate, you will likely need to do the grunt work to gain experience.

, Build good relationships with your professors so that you can improve your research skills, gain opportunities for academic growth, and have a mentor in your field. Speak out in class, talk to them during office hours, volunteer to work on their research, and take multiple classes from your desired mentor.

If your professors know you well, they’ll be able to write a better letter of reference about your skills, abilities, and work habits when you need them to apply for doctoral programs or jobs.

, You can gain great networking opportunities and open doors for yourself by becoming part of organizations dedicated to engineering. You will not only meet other students in the same course of study, but you’ll also meet possible mentors. Some national organizations also have name recognition that can help you when you apply to doctoral programs or jobs.

Your school will likely have local clubs in addition to national organizations, such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.You should also look for honor societies. For example, you could join Tau Beta Pi, the engineering honor society.

, While a 3.0 is sometimes an acceptable grade point average for admittance into an engineering doctoral program, an average of 3.25 is more standard.If you're interested in a big name school, you're likely going to need upwards of a 3.5 GPA to get into the program. Aim to make all A's with minimal B's if you want to pursue a doctorate in engineering.
Consider doing grade replacement if you make lower than an A or B in a class, but check your college or university's limits on retaking courses.

, As you complete your undergraduate work or after graduation, study for the GRE. You'll need to register for and take the GRE several months prior to applying for doctoral programs. When you apply for a graduate program, you’ll need recent scores. Scores remain active for five years.Some programs may require you to take the GRE subject test, but not all do. Check the requirements for your university., To improve your chances of gaining admittance, narrow your focus to one field of engineering. While there are many facets to engineering careers, you can narrow your focus to one of the major degree paths, such as:

Electrical engineering
Mechanical engineering
Aeronautical engineering
Computer engineering
Civil engineering
Environmental engineering, Read about the programs available to you so that you can choose the best one for you. Look at schools near you, as well as the top programs in your chosen path of study. Don’t just focus on name recognition. Look for programs that can help you pay for your education and that are doing relevant research in your field of study.Consider your research preferences and look for a school with a strong program in that topic.
Make sure that the schools you apply to are conducting research in your chosen research interests.
Check if the school will offer a fellowship, scholarship, teaching assistantship, or research position that will help you pay for your doctoral degree., Since the emphasis of a doctoral degree is on research, you will be working with one or more of the professors at your school to collaborate on research projects. You will need to have a good working relationship with your professors, and your research will need to fit under the umbrella of the program's current research.

Read each professor's background, curriculum vitae, and current research projects.
When choosing your school, consider which professors you'd most like to work with based on what they are researching, their goals, and their background.

, Based on your own interests and the paths available to you, narrow your research path so that you can present it in your applications for graduate school. Universities choose doctoral candidates that fit into their research program, so you will need to show them what you plan to study., Choose the programs that fit your interests. Most students apply to between five and eight graduate programs., Your statement of purpose will tell the university about you, your achievements, your path of study, and why you’ll be a good fit for their program. Focus on showing your best skills and why you’re a promising candidate for the program. Your program will set a word count, commonly about 300-500 words.A statement of purpose may also be called an application essay, personal statement, objectives for study, personal goals, cover letter, or a related name., Your program will likely ask for letters of recommendation. Ask your closest professors, engineering mentors, and research supervisors to write a recommendation for you.

Make sure that you ask at least a month in advance so that the person has enough time to work on your letter.
To aid the person in writing your letter, provide them with a short resume detailing your accomplishments.

, Each program will have their own requirements, but most applications will require multiple parts. Check your program’s admissions guidelines for the requirements, which will likely include the following:

Your completed application form.
Your statement of purpose.
GRE scores.
Transcripts.
Your curriculum vitae.
2-3 letters of recommendation.
TOEFL or IELTS scores if you’re an international student.

, Make sure that you send in your items on time. Most doctoral programs have a narrow window for applications, and you may need to apply nearly a year in advance of beginning your studies.If you don’t get your materials in on time, you won’t be considered for admission.

Don’t wait until the last minute. Get your materials submitted in advance.

, If you can show the faculty that you are familiar with their research and will be able to contribute, then it may help you gain admittance to the program. Since graduate programs are built around research, being familiar with current projects is important.

Read up on the faculty’s biographies and curriculum vitae.
Send them a formally written email.
Say something like, “Your groundbreaking work on is what interested me in . In my undergraduate research, I worked on .”

, Doctoral candidates usually help further the research goals of the university as research fellows. If you have relevant research skills or a background that contains work on similar projects, explain that history to your program.Offer a brief explanation of your research background or resume. Say, ""During a senior year special project, I worked with ten other students alongside my professor to complete a project similar to the one you are currently developing.""
Explain, ""As a lab assistant, I was able to shadow professors and doctoral candidates at my university, which allowed me to gain skills in how to conduct research and write reports.""

, Once you’re accepted, you will visit the campus and get advised by the faculty. Based on their recommendations and the requirements of the program, register for you classes.

Get advised as early as possible to ensure that you are able to get into the classes you need.

, If you don’t maintain good attendance and high grades, then you can get kicked out of your program. Keep in good academic standing, and make sure that you complete all of the required coursework.

You will need to pass your courses with at least a B.
Expect to enroll in 6-9 credit hours per semester because graduate courses are harder, making the requirements for a full load smaller.

, Work with your professors to find a supervisor. Look for someone whose research you can contribute to, and focus on how you can help them. Finding the right supervisor will require you to find someone with whom a relationship will be mutually beneficial.Enroll in the classes taught by your desired research supervisor. This will give you a chance to work with them and an opportunity for them to see your abilities and work habits.
Look for faculty members who have current research projects that have openings for graduate assistantships.
Don’t expect a posh position at first. Prove yourself by taking any research role available with your chosen mentor.
You may also be able to assemble an advisory committee, depending on your university.

, Your plan of study will include your course objectives, a list of your required courses, a list of your intended electives, and early plans for your dissertation work. Your research supervisor and committee (if you have one) will need to approve this plan.

You’ll submit your plan of study to the department chair after your research supervisor has approved it.
It can be difficult to change your plan of study, so take the process seriously.

, A doctoral program is all about research, so you need to keep up with what’s going on in your field. Know the past findings, currently ongoing research, and avenues for further research. This will help you find a path for your own research., As you complete your degree, you will start to perform original research. This is the ultimate goal of a Ph.D. candidate, so choose a topic that both interests you and provides areas for development.Your research will still fit into the program’s major areas of study.

, Your dissertation topic will come out of your independent research. With the help of your research supervisor, you will narrow your research focus so that you can complete a dissertation that will allow you to earn your degree.A dissertation is a book length project.
It is sometimes called a thesis.

, Apply for grants, sponsorship programs, or use crowdfunding to pay for your research. Depending on your university’s resources, you may be able to get more research leeway if you can attract additional funding. The quality of your research and dissertation will depend on available resources, such as funding., In order to finish your dissertation and graduate, you’ll need to reach relevant conclusions through your independent research. The process will likely take years over the course of your doctoral work. During this time, you will work with other graduate students and your research supervisor. You will also enroll in classes dedicated to independent study rather than regular coursework., Your dissertation will be a book length work, so plan to write it over a long period of time. It’s best to write it in pieces as you start and complete your research.Consult with your research supervisor regularly.
Visit your campus writing center if you need help with your writing.
You can find software to help with formatting.

, The best way to prepare for your defense is to know everything about your dissertation, including prior research, your methods, your research question, your process, the data, and the ultimate outcomes of your research project. Be prepared to answer any questions., Before your dissertation is complete, you will need to present it to your committee and defend it. Your committee will ask you questions and may suggest revisions. While the meeting should have a positive tone, expect to explain your processes, work, and outcomes.The key to a defense is to show that you have the knowledge and research skills required to earn your doctorate.

Insert your steel into the heart of your fire and add the air blast.,
After you have assembled your tools, and lit a nice hot fire, get hammering!,
Practice definitely makes perfect.,
Practice some more, be careful, think safety, and overall have fun!

",How to Do Blacksmithing," A simple one can be built by adding an airblast of any kind that is strong enough to withstand any kind of fire, but coal or charcoal (not briquets) works best.;
, Make sure they are about 3 feet (0.9 m) long, so you can hold onto a cool part of the steel while forging on the ends or other parts of the bar.

, A hammer can be easily found at yard sales, antique stores, or just a plain ball peen hammer from the local hardware store will work, as long as the face is smooth and doesn't have any grooves. If your hammer has grooves, you'll need to sand them out. One hammer is all that is needed for now, and a nice pair of vice-grips or pliers will work as tongs. If you are lucky enough to have an anvil already, good for you, but if you don't, a section of railroad rail or any big, heavy lump of steel with a flat face will work well (they are known as ASOs, Anvil Shaped Objects).

, Remember to be safe; it is a fire! Do it outside in a clearing, free of brush and other things that can easily catch fire. Have a garden hose, buckets of water, or a fire extinguisher at the ready. Build a nice pit, by digging a shallow hole and lining around it with rocks, or use a 1 foot (0.3 m) section of a 55 gallon (208.2 L) drum.

, Wait patiently, checking the color of the steel frequently. The steel should be placed near the air blast, but not so close so that the air is blowing directly onto the piece.

, When rebar and scrap metal has reached the optimal working temperature, it will be colored between dark orange and bright yellow (almost white).

, Some beginner techniques to try include turning a square bar into round, round bar into square, tapering (which means making the end pointy - the nicer and more slender the taper the better), flattening (the more even thickness the better), and just general scrolls (curls) and bends.

Deal with life’s issues head on.",How to Manage Orthorexia," Think about the impact your eating has on your life. Healthy eating is one thing, but having an inflexible diet is different than healthy eating. Some common costs of orthorexia include having an extreme preoccupation with food, focusing on the virtuousness of certain food choices, being judgmental of other people’s choices, having rigid eating habits, limiting your foods to a small selection of ‘acceptable’ foods, and feeling extreme guilt or self-loathing if you stray from your diet.How are these things affecting your life? How would you like them to change?
You may also become obsessed with probiotics, supplements, or herbs or spend unreasonable amounts of time on food preparation.;
, If your eating habits are extremely inflexible, they may interfere with your social life and friendships.For example, if you have several ‘black list’ foods, you may not join your friends for lunch or you may decline dinner invitations. If you tend to socially isolate yourself because of your orthorexia, think about what you can do to reconnect with friends.


Invite people over to your home for dinner.
Do activities that do not revolve around food. As you work through treatment, begin to join your friends for events around food.

, Some people with orthorexia become obsessed with fitness and working out.If your workout schedule is rigid and interferes with other areas of your life, consider cutting down your workouts. For example, if you work out for two hours each day, consider cutting down to one hour each day.


If your exercise is hurting your body and not helping it, work with a physician to find what limits to follow and what intensity to use.

, Begin to work toward balanced health by meeting with your physician. Ask for a blood test to check your nutritional health.This can help you navigate any nutrient deficiencies you may have or any hormonal imbalances. Blood tests can tell you your iron, vitamin, mineral, hormone, and cholesterol levels.For example, if you’ve only eaten fruit for several months, you may lack nutrients that support your body found in vegetables, oils, and proteins. A blood test can help you work toward replenishing your deficiencies.

, Work with a dietician to help you balance your eating. Your dietitian may have you look at your diet then make some adjustments for optimal health. While it can be difficult to make changes, remember that a dietician is an expert and is there to help you.Make regular appointments with a dietician and keep track of the progress you are making. You may notice that with time you feel better with changes to your diet.

, Part of orthorexia is having strict food guidelines. Perhaps you only eat ‘clean’ foods or foods of a certain color, or a very small list of acceptable foods.While it can be scary to start incorporating new or ‘bad’ foods back into your diet, start by adding one new food in each week.


You don’t need to jump headfirst into eating sweets, processed foods, or junk foods. Start slowly, and build up to a level that feels comfortable and is still healthy.
Consult with your dietician or physician regarding what foods you may need. You may have some deficiencies that need immediate attention.

, As you begin to be more flexible in your diet, take a challenge and start eating feared foods.For some people, this may be chocolate, sugar, or bagels. For others, it may be fruit or dairy. Whatever it is that you fear, take a small challenge every once in a while to eat it. Even if it’s a few bites, it can help you conquer your fear.


Remind yourself that foods are okay in moderation and that it’s okay to enjoy food.

, People with orthorexia make decisions based on food and food choices.Instead of having rigid rules to follow about what to eat and when to eat it, learn to follow your body’s cues. Eat when you feel hungry, not when you are ‘supposed’ to eat. Instead of following a strict diet, ask yourself, “What would I like to eat for breakfast?”


Begin to listen to your body’s cues and get more in touch with what your body wants.

, If you’re having trouble coping with orthorexia on your own, you may want to talk about it with someone.A therapist can help you work through your emotions and create a different relationship with food that supports you better.


Ask your insurance provider, general practitioner, or local mental health clinic for a referral to a therapist. You can also ask friends and family for a recommendation.

, Some people find medications helpful in treating accompanying symptoms in orthorexia. Work with a psychiatrist to see whether medications are a good option for you.Medications can address obsessive-compulsive symptoms, anxiety, and depression.


To find a psychiatrist, call your insurance provider or local mental health clinic. You can also speak with your physician about obtaining a referral.

, When you deviate from your pure lifestyle or strict routine, you may feel overcome by feelings of guilt or shame.You might associate your feelings of self-worth or your identity with the foods you eat and the healthy lifestyle you live. It’s okay to have a diet full of variety, even if you occasionally eat something unhealthy. What you eat isn’t who you are, and your identity isn’t in the foods you avoid.


If you feel guilty after an unhealthy decision, accept your decision and move on.Forgive yourself and remember that your one ‘bad’ choice doesn’t define you, your self-worth, or your identity.

, Some people use orthorexia as a way to avoid dealing with other problems.These might include painful emotions or struggling relationships. While some people dive headfirst into alcohol or drug problems, others fixate on a specific thing and revolve their lives around that. If you ignore your problems and put all of your focus on food and pure eating, it might be time to take a more honest look.


Instead of ignoring or avoiding your problems, begin to tackle them one by one. Work with a therapist to help you.

Some common behavioral and emotional symptoms that someone with an eating disorder might have include:feeling depressed or anxious
having a strong fear of gaining weight or of being “fat”
desiring to withdraw from friends and family
paying an unusual amount of attention to food and calorie intake
having an intense fear of certain foods, like those containing sugar or fat
steering clear of situations involving food
denying issues with food or changes in weight
attempting to purge after overeating by exercising, vomiting, or using laxatives
weighing yourself every day;
, People who suffer from anorexia are unwilling to stay at a healthy body weight. They are also quite frightened of gaining weight, and they see themselves as fat, even though they are thin or even underweight.A person with anorexia can starve the body for days, or eat a very strict diet of a low amount of calories each day. There is typically a sense of accomplishment in maintaining such strict guidelines.


You may have very strict “rules” of eating, such as specific colors of food you avoid, times of day you refuse to eat, or strict caloric boundaries you observe.
If you suffer from anorexia, you may fear being fat or experience your body as fat, even if you are several pounds underweight. Even if you are extremely thin, you are never happy with your appearance and feel like you can always lose more weight to feel better about yourself.
Ask yourself if your parents or friends have commented on your weight or weight loss.
Ask yourself whether you base your personal value on your weight, clothing size, or what you eat.

, People who have bulimia will binge on a large amount of food and then purge to try to get rid of what they just consumed before it causes weight gain.While you know you want to avoid binge eating and gaining weight, you cannot seem to stop eating or having recurrent episodes of binge eating. Once the episode ends, you may find yourself desperate to get rid of any weight that may result from the binge. Efforts may include purging (vomiting), using laxatives, or diuretics.


Even if you do not purge right after eating, you may still have bulimia if you tend to starve yourself for days following a binge, exercise more than usual, or follow another type of drastic diet to avoid gaining any weight.You may try to eat healthy and follow a healthy (or restrictive) diet for a while, but be overcome with tension or cravings and end up caving under pressure into a binge.

, People who have binge eating disorder will eat large amounts of food in a short space of time and they feel like they cannot control themselves during these episodes. The binge is not pleasurable. While bingeing, you may feel lots of negative emotions. These feelings can continue after the binge is over as well. People who binge eat do not purge after a binge.People with binge eating disorder may feel depressed, disgusted, and guilty over their bingeing episodes.
You may find that you have put on a lot of weight in a short amount of time if you binge eat.

, Some people use anorexia as a way to stay in control and feel powerful. For those with bulimia, it is common to feel out of control and powerless.And those with binge eating disorder may also feel like they lack control over what they eat.If you feel like your life is out of control, you may turn to anorexia to harness the feeling of control in your life, and feel accomplished when you “succeed’ in starving yourself.
Ask yourself about your relationship with control and whether you are happy with it. Do you find yourself wanting more or less control in your life? Do you feel like you have enough control over your life, or do you take out that control on your food?

, You may feel ashamed of your eating habits, especially if you binge eat.You may try to binge or purge in secret, or take food off your plate discreetly so that nobody will notice. While these behaviors try to cover up what you do, deeper within them may lurk shame for the lengths you will go in order to keep your eating disorder.


If you find yourself feeling ashamed of your eating behaviors, then you may have symptoms of an eating disorder.

, People who do not like their bodies are more likely to develop an eating disorder.Not liking your body may include feeling fat, ugly, undesirable, or having shame or embarrassment about a specific part of your physical appearance, such as scars. These feelings may also be influenced by images of celebrities or the people that you see every day.You might feel like the only way to accept your body is by losing weight. You may think, “When I lose all the weight, I’ll finally be happy.”
Reflect on your own beliefs about weight and body satisfaction and ask yourself if losing weight or “being skinny” is the only way to feel good about your body.

, Do you find yourself hiding your habits? When asked about your eating choices, do you lie about why you’re not eating? What do you say when people comment about your weight fluctuation? If you find yourself making up excuses for your behaviors, you may have an eating disorder.Bending the truth may be one way for you to keep living with an eating disorder without anybody finding out. Do you find yourself making excuses for how you eat? What about finding ways to get out of meeting people for dinner or coffee?

, This doesn’t necessarily mean go look in the mirror, but think about how you perceive your body. There are many ways to understand body image. For instance, you may perceive your body as overweight when it is actually underweight as measured by a medical doctor. Next, reflect on how you feel about your body: if you feel positive or negative about your body image, and how you see your general shape and ability. Your thoughts and behaviors also affect your body image, such as having thoughts of “I’m too fat” and then isolating yourself due to how you perceive your body.Think about the ways you perceive your body and ask yourself whether you see yourself accurately. Ask yourself how you perceive your flaws and if it’s okay to have flaws.

, Anorexia takes a major toll on the body. If you start noticing changes in your body’s functioning, you may be experiencing the effects of anorexia. Not only does restrictive put you at a dangerously low body weight, it also can have other negative side effects, such as:constipation or bloating
damaged teeth and gums
dry, yellow skin
brittle nails
headaches
fainting and dizziness
bone density loss
a layer of fine hair that grows all over the body and face
memory problems and sluggish thinking
depression and moodiness

, People with bulimia tend to show some physical symptoms as a result of the disorder, especially those who purge (vomit). If you vomit after meals, you may experience the following:pain in your abdomen or bloating
weight gain
swollen hands or feet
always having a sore throat or sounding hoarse
having broken blood vessels in your eyes
feeling weak and dizzy
having sores in your mouth
puffy cheeks (from vomiting)
tooth decay due to acid from vomit
not having a period
having lots of stomach issues such as constipation, ulcers, and acid reflux

, While the most obvious effect of overeating is obesity, other health risks can occur as a result of binge eating. In order to fully understand any health risks associated with binge eating, go to your medical physician and get some blood work. Changes to health and body related to binge eating can include:type 2 Diabetes
high cholesterol
high blood pressure
joint and muscle pain
gastrointestinal problems
sleep apnea
heart disease
some types of cancer

, Your eating disorder may have caused harm to your body, so it’s best to see a medical doctor and run some tests to assess your overall health.Follow up regularly with your medical physician when going through treatment for an eating disorder.


Don’t be fooled into thinking eating disorders are not severe. Mortality rates related to untreated eating disorders are higher than any other mental disorder.An analysis of 35 studies showed that out of 12,800 people with anorexia, 639 died. An analysis of 12 studies showed that out of 2,585 people with bulimia, 57 died. And an analysis of six studies showed that out of 1,879 people with an eating disorder not otherwise specified, 59 died., It’s really hard to let go of an eating disorder without help. Work with a trained therapist who specializes in treating eating disorders. A therapist may help you confront your relationship with food and your body, reframe negative thoughts, and work on self-worth issues with you. Family therapy can also be very helpful in treating eating disorders, as some issues relating to control and eating habits are passed down or experienced through the family.See a therapist as someone who is there to challenge and support you in your healing journey.
For more information on how to find a therapist, check out How to Choose a Therapist.

, For more severe or life threatening eating disorders, you may consider inpatient treatment. Inpatient care has the benefit of monitoring mental, emotional, physical, and medical health in one location. Treatment is intense and acute, meaning problems around eating disorders are confronted daily. Inpatient care is best suited for people with more intense needs who cannot manage the eating disorder on their own.If you’ve become a master at hiding your eating disorder and making everything look “normal” in your life, yet still struggle to be emotionally or physically healthy, inpatient treatment may be a good option for you.

, Out of everyone who helps you on your recovery, it’s most important for you to never give up on yourself. Believe in yourself and believe in your journey that you can make a full recovery. It may not seem possible to you now, but don’t give up. Many people have made full recovery from eating disorders, and you can, too.


For more information, check out How to Treat an Eating Disorder.

, You don't have to suffer your eating disorder on your own. Surround yourself with friends and family who want to see you succeed and see you happy. Avoid people in your life who make you feel bad about yourself, don't believe in you, or influence you to return to your eating disorder. You need time to recover, and recovery will be very difficult if you have those types of influences in your life."

Consider the potential causes of an eating disorder.,
Be aware of your options for recovery.",How to Join Overeaters Anonymous," Meetings are a way to gain fellowship and support each member—and to receive support for yourself. Meetings can be in person, on the phone or online. The point is to interact and share all parts of the process.Making a regular commitment to meetings helps you stay on track and accountable for your progress. It is also a chance to share stories of both success and setbacks.
You can locate a meeting by typing your residential information into the given fields on the OA website.If you cannot find a face-to-face meeting in your area, you can participate in telephone or online meetings.;
, A big part of recovery from overeating is sharing your own story in several different modes. Some aspects of sharing are encouraged, but not required to participate in the program. You may share your story in many ways.Write a journal about your story and journey. Continue to grow in the process by also researching and comparing the experiences of others to your own.
You can talk about your story during a meeting, when appropriate or through the online forum.
You can also share your story by submitting it to the Overeaters Anonymous Lifeline magazine., Generally, a sponsor is someone who has extensive experience with the program and who can serve as a motivator and guide. Be sure to take full advantage of your OA sponsor and ask any questions you need to support your journey., The Overeaters Anonymous program works because you learn you are not alone and that support comes from peers, sponsors and leaders. You must be willing and ready to show vulnerability and seek out the help that is there for you.Your support group might serve as the other individuals who attend meetings with you and your sponsor. However, your support group also encompasses family and friends who want to encourage you during your journey. Non-Overeaters Anonymous members are encouraged to attend open meetings to better understand the process and what you are going through.Keep in mind that OA is an anonymous group, so you may not have the ability to form relationships with other group members outside of meetings. It is the right of each individual member to maintain his or her anonymity, if desired.

, Recovery from compulsive eating is a process and each success should be acknowledged and shared. Focus on each small win and the growth you see to get you along the way.A small win might be calling your sponsor when you feel like bingeing and having him or her coach you through your compulsions. Even though you still had the urge, it is a major accomplishment to take action against the urge rather than giving in to it.
It is a mistake to feel like sharing your success will make others at meetings feel like they have failed if they are not at that same place. You learned from each member of the group and they, too, will learn from you.

, Overeaters Anonymous is not a group focused on losing weight so there aren’t weigh ins. The focus is addressing the underlying cause of the overeating and changing the behavior. You need to understand your primary issue with eating and decide on a plan to overcome it.If you are looking for more of a support group to focus on working out or meeting weight goals, this may not be the group to join. You can choose to work on those goals outside of OA.

, The basic underlying process of Overeaters Anonymous focuses on the 12 steps that are very similar to Alcoholics Anonymous and other addiction groups. The twelve steps include:Admitting you are powerless over food and that your life has become unmanageable
Believing that a power greater than yourself can restore sanity
Deciding to turn your will and your lives over to the care of God (or higher power, universe, etc.)
Performing an inventory of yourself
Admitting the exact nature of your wrongs
Being ready to have your higher power remove all these defects of character
Asking your higher power to remove shortcomings
Making a list of all persons we have harmed and be willing to make amends
Making direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when doing so would injure them or others
Continuing to take personal inventory and, when you are wrong, promptly admit it
Seeking through prayer and meditation to improve your conscious contact with your higher power
Carrying this message forth to compulsive overeaters and practicing these principles in all your affairs

, Many think of these types of meetings always being done in person but this is not always possible, or necessary. You can actually attend in a variety of ways.


If you live in an area that has regular Overeaters Anonymous meetings, this can happen face-to-face in a group setting.In areas without a face-to-face meeting or in cases where that type of meeting is not possible, the same types of supports can be found via online or telephone support. These alternative meetings are called “virtual services.”Online or telephone meetings usually use some sort of website or phone-based platform that requires you to log in and participate that way.

, Compulsive eating is the feeling that you are not able to control periods of overeating that involve an unusually large amount of food. This does not include purging afterwards like you would see with bulimia.Compulsive eating may develop into Binge Eating Disorder if you have frequent episodes of compulsive eating, feel extremely emotional either during or after overeating and have no purging episodes afterwards., You need to assess the symptoms you are experiencing to see if they match up with those for compulsive eating. The behavioral components of overeating may include:Stockpiling and hiding food
Eating normally around others and hiding to binge
Eating quickly and without care for making a mess
Unable to control how much you eat or the speed of eating
Eating when you are full
Eating throughout the day without planning meals

, The only way you can truly get help for an issue like this is to accurately diagnose it by the symptom patterns. It may be necessary to see a doctor to fully diagnose your compulsive eating. Emotional symptoms of compulsive eating may include:


Eating out of control as the only way to release stress and tension
Feeling of numbness during a binge
Feeling shame about how much you eat although you secretly never feel it is enough
Having a desperate need to control weight and eating

, Like other forms of mental illness, there is often no direct cause of an eating disorder. People with a family history of eating disorders may inherit their disorders, but societal pressure to look a certain way can also play a role in the development of an eating disorder. An eating disorder can also be the result of other mental health problems, such as depression or obsessive compulsive disorder.Other factors may also increase your risk, such as being a woman, being young, and having high stress levels.

, Remember that your treatment for a compulsive eating disorder should be comprehensive. It should not focus just on the addiction aspect because there are other things that can help.Treatment options may also include counseling with a professional therapist, medication, and stress reduction activities.Talk to your doctor or a therapist to start getting help for a compulsive eating problem.

If you suspect that you may need help, please consult your medical professional, especially if you meet the following criteria:Binge-eating, or consuming larger amounts of food at a time than is normal.
Feeling a lack of control over this binging.
Purging and other methods of preventing weight gain, such as vomiting, using laxatives/diuretics to compensate for the overeating, fasting, or excessive exercising. People with bulimia do this at least once a week for three months.
Body image issues, where your self-esteem is defined disproportionately by how you look (weight, shape, et cetera) compared to other factors.;
, If you want to increase awareness surrounding the condition, try to discover your emotional triggers. These triggers are events and situations that push your emotional buttons and cause you to want to binge and purge. Once you know what they are, you can avoid them if possible, or at least try approaching them differently. A few common triggers are:


Negative perceptions toward your body. Do you look in the mirror and experience negative thoughts and emotions about your appearance?
Interpersonal stress. Does fighting with a parent, sibling, friend, or romantic partner make you want to engage in bulimic activity?
Negative mood states more generally. Anxiety, sadness, frustration, and others can precipitate the desire to binge and purge.

, Traditional dietary programs are not usually effective for eating disorders and can actually exacerbate symptoms. However, intuitive eating can help you to reorganize your relationship with food. Intuitive eating is a method of learning to listen to and honor your body developed by dietitian Evelyn Tribole and nutrition therapist Elyse Resch. It can help with:


Developing interoceptive awareness. Interoception is your ability to perceive what is going on inside your body; it's a must for creating a healthier knowledge of what your body wants and needs. Deficiencies in interoception have been shown to correlate with eating disorders.
Gaining self-control. Intuitive eating is associated with decreased disinhibition, loss of control, and binging.
Feeling better overall. Intuitive eating is also associated with general improvements in well-being: less preoccupation with body issues, higher self-esteem, and more.

, Keeping a bulimia-related journal will help you stay on top of what and when you're eating, what is triggering your eating disorder symptoms, and can also serve as an expressive outlet for your feelings.

, Don't overstock on groceries, so that you won't have as much opportunity to binge. Plan ahead and carry as little money as possible. If someone else does your shopping, such as a parent, ask them to take your dietary needs into consideration.

, Aim for three or four meals and two snacks; schedule them at particular times of the day, so that you know when you will be eating and can restrict yourself to those predetermined sets of times. Develop this as a routine to keep yourself one step ahead of the impulsive behavior.

, Therapeutic interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy have shown to aid in recovery, with long-lasting effects. Use psychologytoday.com to find a therapist near you who specializes in these models. You can also look for a therapist who specializes in eating disorders.


Cognitive-behavioral therapy seeks to restructure your thoughts and behaviors so that self-destructive tendencies rooted in these aspects will be replaced by healthier modes of thinking and behaving. If you binge and purge because of deeply rooted beliefs about yourself, as many people do, CBT can help rework the ground level of those thoughts and expectations.
Interpersonal therapy focuses on relationships and personality structure rather than more clearly defined thought patterns and behaviors, so it may be more effective if you want less pointed behavioral instructions or thought-restructuring, and want to focus more on your relationships with family, friends, and even yourself.
Therapeutic alliance is one of the most important factors in the effectiveness of therapy, so be sure to find a therapist you can work with. This may take a little ""shopping around"" until you find someone you feel comfortable confiding in, but it can mean the difference between recovery or relapse, so don't settle!

, In addition to therapy, certain psychiatric medications can help with the treatment of bulimia. The primary class of drugs recommended for eating disorders is antidepressants, especially SSRIs such as fluoxetine (Prozac).


Ask your family doctor or psychiatrist about antidepressant medication options for bulimia.
Medication is most effective for some mental conditions when combined with therapy rather than taken alone.

, Although there's not a lot of research data on the effectiveness of joining support groups for eating disorders, some people do report groups such as Overeaters Anonymous to be useful for a secondary treatment option.


Use this website to find a support group near you: click here.


, For serious cases of bulimia, consider pursuing inpatient treatment at a mental health facility. This will give you access to greater levels of medical and psychiatric care, as compared to self-guided methods, outpatient therapy, or support groups. You may need in-patient treatment if:


Your health is deteriorating or your life is threatened as a result of the bulimia.
You've tried other methods of treatment in the past and have relapsed.
You have additional health complications such as diabetes.

, Many people use internet forums for support during eating disorder recovery. These websites can be an important source of interpersonal support, allowing those suffering from these conditions to discuss the specific difficulties of living with eating disorders with people who are experiencing similar struggles. Here are a few websites you may want to look at:


Bulimiahelp.org Forum.
Psychcentral.com Eating Disorder Forum.
National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders Forum.

, Research suggests that family support can play a major role in the recovery process. In order to give yourself the best possible chance of recovery, educate your family and close friends about the condition. This will cultivate a social environment where healing can begin to take place. Use websites like Brown University's health education centerand Caltech's guide to helping a friend with an eating disorder.

, Ask your local university, hospital, or mental health clinic for information on bulimia-centered educational events. These events will help those close to you discover how they can be of service during your recovery process. They will learn healthy communication techniques as well as general information about bulimia nervosa.

, Family and friends may want to support you, but they may not have a clear picture of how to do that. Let them help by being clear about what you need from them. If you have particular dietary concerns, or if you feel judged about your eating activities, communicate these issues!


Some research links bulimia to parenting styles that are rejecting, ambivalent, or over-involved. If your parents exhibit these styles, talk to them about what you feel you aren't getting, or are getting too much of in terms of attention. If your dad hovers around you all the time when you are eating, tell him that you appreciate the concern, but the over-involvement is actually making you feel more negatively about yourself and your behaviors.
Research also suggests that in many families where eating disorders arise, communication can be discounted or ignored. If you feel like you aren't being heard, bring this up in an assertive but nonjudgmental way. Tell your mom or dad that you need to tell them something important and you are worried that it won't be heard. This will bring them in to your concerns and help them understand where you are coming from.

, Research shows that people who eat at least three meals per week with their family are significantly less likely to engage in eating disorder behavior.

, Family-based treatment is an evidence based model involving family members in the therapeutic process. Research shows that it is effective for use with adolescents, potentially moreso than individualized therapy.

Look for dramatic weight changes.,
Watch out for physical deterioration.,
Look for evidence of purging.,
Keep an eye out for laxatives or diet pills.,
Look for extreme eating habits.,
Watch for sudden changes in eating habits.,
Look for an increased activity regimen.,
Note obsessive behaviors regarding food.",How to Identify Eating Disorders in Teenage Girls1," Weight loss is common with eating disorders, especially anorexia and bulimia. Weight may drop dramatically from the starting point, or drop below a healthy weight. Conversely, those with a binge-eating disorder will gain weight rapidly. The absence of dramatic weight change should not be taken as evidence there isn't a problem.


Eating disorders don't develop overnight. Any responsible adult should aim to identify a problem before the teen is dangerously under- or overweight. Incremental changes in weight over a long period can also occur, which can make it difficult to spot as a problem when you know the teen well and see her frequently.
Not every weight change is associated with an eating disorder. As teenagers grow, they may lose or gain weight. If you observe a dramatic loss of weight in conjunction with other symptoms, consider confronting the teen girl with your concerns.
When a teenage girl is 15% or more outside her normal weight, she may have an eating disorder.;
, Eating disorders wreak havoc on the entire body. Each eating disorder evinces different physical symptoms. Besides a marked loss of weight, individuals suffering dramatic weight loss may evince other physical symptoms, such as:Brittle hair and nails
Dry, yellowish skin
Muscle wasting, lethargy, and general loss of energy
Being cold to the touch
An increase in body hair

, Teenage girls with bulimia will expel food from their stomachs through induced vomiting (purging). If you’re a parent at home and hear or see your daughter retching, or detect the scent of vomit in the bathroom after she has been in there, she may be suffering from bulimia.


If detected, she might excuse the vomiting as an illness, such as stomach flu rather than self-induced purging.If she’s sneezing, stuffy, coughing, and/or has a temperature, she’s being honest; but remember, flu isn't always accompanied by vomiting. If there's no reason for the vomiting, such as food poisoning, she may have an eating disorder.
A teen girl who purges might also take multiple showers each day in order to wash the vomit down the drain and minimize the odor., Diet pills block the body’s absorption of fat or curb the appetite, while laxatives encourage bowel movements. Both may be employed by individuals with eating disorders in order to keep food out of their body and restrict the absorption of calories.

, A teen girl with an eating disorder may binge on a large amount of food at one time, but at other times refuse to eat for long stretches. She may eat very little, or implement very strict rules about her eating such as only eating at certain times or only eating certain types of food. Fasting or skipping meals regularly can also indicate an eating disorder.


Alternately, a girl who binges may constantly snack throughout the day and regularly consume 5,000–15,000 calories in one sitting.If you’ve had large volumes of food go missing from the fridge, the teen may be binge-eating.

, Eating habits might change quickly and dramatically, or change slowly over time. A girl who suddenly refuses to eat anything but “diet,” fat-free, or low-fat foods may have an eating disorder. Alternately, a girl who exclusively eats sweets, high-fat foods, or drinks only soda may be a binge eater.


For example: If you notice she no longer eats her favorite junk food, this may be a sign that she has an eating disorder.

, Body-image issues may manifest as a desire to reach some ideal body type through intense exercise. Perhaps she has increased her workout routine from an hour or so to three or four hours of progressively more intense exercise each day?


While regular exercise is good, if you sense the teenage girl’s exercise habits are getting out of hand and interfering with her social or academic life, consider talking with her about your concerns.

, These may include a refusal to eat certain ingredients, measuring portions exactly, or counting calories in every item she eats or drinks. These behaviors suggest an excessive and unhealthy preoccupation with food which could indicate an eating disorder.If she’s taken up reading diet cookbooks, watching cooking shows on TV, or reading about new low-calorie recipes online, she might have an obsessive food disorder. Since these behaviors can be healthy and are not inherently indicative of the existence of an eating disorder, you should only consider them signs of an eating disorder if she also displays other warning signs as well.

Seek medical attention.",How to Overcome Binge Eating Disorder," You need to feel that you are worthy enough to change your binge eating habits. You need decide to conquer the sense of loss of control over how much you are eating. Only after you do this and improve your self-esteem can you win the war over Binge Eating Disorder. Avoid these ""self-defeating"" habits:


Eating when full or not hungry
Eating until uncomfortably full
Eating rapidly (not allowing time for a satisfied feeling, under 20 minutes)
Frequently eating alone/in secret (not wanting anyone to say anything)
Repeatedly going on and off diets (instead of changing habits/or daily lifestyle);
, Relaxation is very important in clearing your mind and turning away from the binge. Listen to music, take a warm bath. Go for a nice drive. Perhaps you live by the ocean, a river, or lake. Maybe you have some great scenic roads. Just remember not to take any money with you and try not to drive by fast food restaurants, or any places that sell food for that matter. You want to make the binge go away - you don’t want to be tempted and give in.

Pick up your license and keys and go for a drive. As long as you feel safe, leave cash (you may need $5 or such) and credit cards at home. Try to drive in an area where there is not a lot of temptation for food. This will at least make it more difficult to binge eat.

,,,).,, If you are bored, do not eat. Instead, find something else that fulfills you. For example, try reading, exercising or hanging out with family or friends. There are many things you can do instead of binge eating:


Do something with your mouth. You may just need something to chew on.






Go for a walk. Try to really take in everything beautiful outside and shift your focus from food to the pretty flowers you see, the nice houses you see, or the nature that surrounds you.
Do some arts and crafts. Sew, paint, draw - create your own masterpiece. You can capture how you are feeling in your art.
Play an instrument. Play the piano, violin, trumpet, or any other instrument that you like.
Take a nice, relaxing bath. Dim the lights, put on relaxing music, light some candles, close your eyes, and feel calmness take over your whole body.
Listen to music. Put on whatever makes you feel good. Singing out loud also helps to put you in a good mood.
Write down exactly what you are feeling in your journal. Write about whatever happened that day to make you feel like you want to turn to binge eating. You will feel better once you have your feelings off of your chest. In days to come, you will be able to look back on the times that you didn’t give in to binge eating. If you don't binge eat you will feel better about yourself and decrease the amount of times the problem arises.
Pick up any kind of uplifting book that you can find. Reading stories about motivating people that went through challenges will provide hope to you. There are many inspirational stories out there.

, Talk to a friend or anyone else that you can trust about how you are feeling. If you are upset, vent your frustrations out to them. Just having someone listen will be very helpful to you. You will feel that a weight has been lifted from you after you get everything off of your chest.


Say an affirmation out loud and with feeling behind it, such as: ""I can do it. I will do it. I am changing my eating habits."" Write your affirmation down and post it everywhere you can so that you are always reminded of how you want to be. Put a copy of it on the refrigerator or on the pantry door so you think twice about binge eating. Always try to talk yourself out of binge eating.

, Remember, if food is not readily available to you, it will be harder to binge eat. This also applies to going grocery shopping - when you don’t purchase items that you might binge eat, it will be easier to conquer a binge when you are at home.

, In your journal, record all binges and what feelings were present during the binge. Record all details including the time, day, what you ate, how much you ate, and how you felt before and after the binge. Journaling is a great tool because it will provide insight to you as to why you turn to food like you do. This will help to narrow down your binges so that you will be able to see any similarities that happen when you binge eat.

, Ask your doctor for advice on healthy food choices.

, BED is considered an eating disorder just like anorexia or bulimia.

Ask if she is experiencing irregular menstruation.,

Pay attention to body image issues.,
Listen for expressions of revulsion concerning her weight and eating habits.,

Look for signs of anxiety at mealtime.",How to Identify Eating Disorders in Teenage Girls2," General practitioners can help provide a definite diagnosis as to whether a teen does or does not have an eating disorder. Monitoring the teen’s weight over a long period and examining internal features like the condition of the throat (which may be swollen or irritated due to repeated contact with stomach acid following regurgitation) are clues doctors can use to determine if your teen is dealing with an eating disorder.


After detecting your teenage girl’s eating disorder, getting her a thorough medical evaluation should be your first response. A clinical physician as well as a psychiatrist should be consulted in order to gauge the best course of treatment. Doctors specializing in eating disorders can help chart her recovery and write prescriptions if necessary.
In some cases, family counseling might be necessary.This is important because it both allows the teenage girl to receive the active support of her family and gives the counselor a fuller, more objective picture of the girl’s progress in fighting the eating disorder.

, If you are a teacher, coach, or other adult authority figure who is not the girl’s parent, you might talk to the teenage girl directly but you should in all cases bring your concerns to her parents, either directly or in addition to talking with the girl. They will be best equipped to take on the long-term responsibility of assisting her on her path to recovery.


The most important thing when confronting a girl about her eating disorder is not really who you are, but how you express your concerns.Carry out the conversation in a place where the girl feels secure and safe, like in her home. (For this reason, it’s best to have a family member confront the girl about her eating disorder.)
Do not broach the issue if you or the teenage girl in question are eating or in a tired or emotional state.
Be sensitive to the shame or embarrassment the girl may be experiencing due to the eating disorder, and always be gentle and understanding when confronting her about her habits. Do not blame her for her eating disorder; instead, express that you are worried about her and ask her about her feelings.

, Discerning if she’s been having regular periods is a good way to figure out if she has an eating disorder. Two or more skipped periods in girls, along with a loss of weight, is a good signal that she has an eating disorder. Remember, though, weight gain and missed periods could also indicate pregnancy.This question might sound more sensitive when coming from mom or another sympathetic female family member than from dad.

, If the teenage girl often uses convoluted or contradictory reasons as to why she’s eating a certain way, she might be covering the fact that she’s developed a disorder.For instance, she may claim that she ate a big snack before a meal and so doesn’t need to eat dinner, or claim that she will be eating later at a friend’s house.

, If a teen girl is constantly obsessing about her weight and thinks she's overweight when she is actually a healthy weight, it's possible that she is also struggling with an eating disorder.

She might also express disgust, guilt, or shame about how much she eats (whether it’s too much or too little)., The girl's mood may change, and she may suffer from extreme mood swings. Some moodiness is normal for a teenage girl, but moodiness in addition to eating habits, or extreme moodiness when asked to deviate from an eating routine, may be a sign that malnutrition which attends an eating disorder is altering her behavioral patterns., Teenage girls with anxiety may suffer from anxiety related to food. She may show signs of discomfort or stress surrounding conversations about food and eating. She may also show discomfort around the act of eating, and refuse taking meals with family or friends.Anxiety may manifest as anger related to food. She may become very insecure, angry, or withdraw from a conversation about food, eating or weight gain/loss.

Additionally, if you discover that your potential client has a history of dragging out payments, you may wish to decline bidding.;
, Do a walk-through with the client and review his expectations. Concentrate on the details of the job. If they are considerable or extra demanding, this might not be a job you want to bid on due to the extra time and attention it will take. If access to the area is limited or difficult or your working conditions are not desirable, you might be better off choosing not to bid on the project.

, If they are not, carefully interview the client about the remodeling job and all aspects that she hopes to receive as a result. This will help to clear up any misunderstandings later.

It is very difficult to let go of anorexia.

Consider talking to a health professional first.,
Pick a good location to talk.,
Help them see the symptoms.,
Give them a chance to talk.,
Encourage the person to seek help.,
Support him in his treatment plan.",How to Help Men Suffering from Eating Disorders1," If you really don't know where to start a conversation with someone you care about, it can help to have a talk with a health professional. They can provide you with tips and the information you need to have a more productive conversation. Plus, you have someone you can direct the guy to if he asks.Also, keep in mind that you may not be the best person to have this discussion with the person. Consider whether they might feel more comfortable talking with a relative, spouse, close friend, or someone else they trust.;
, When you bring up the issue of an eating disorder, you want to be somewhere that the man feels safe. That could be at home, for instance, where the guy will feel more comfortable having a difficult conversation. A public conversation will likely make him more nervous., Because of the stigma surrounding men and eating disorders, many men don't even realize they are exhibiting symptoms of an eating disorder. If you can, you should help them to connect the dots, by pointing out symptoms you may have noticed and mentioning that men do in fact get eating disorders.For instance, you could start by saying, ""I want you to know first and foremost that I say this out of concern for you. I care about you deeply.""
Move on to discussing the issue. You could say, ""I've noticed that you seem to be anxious about food and eating. You also seem to be dissatisfied with your body most of the time. In addition, you tend to get upset if you miss going to the gym. I'm starting to get worried because I think you may have an eating disorder. Before you look at me all crazy, let me point out that many men do in fact get eating disorders, but they have a harder time recognizing it because it's seen as something women get. I want you to know that you should feel safe talking to me about this.""
Be aware that eating disorders may accompany a mental health issue or symptom, such as depression, anxiety, panic attacks, irritability, social isolation, and a loss of interest in sex. You might consider mentioning this to them as well.

, After you've had your say, let the person have a chance to express his emotions. He may deny it or be angry about it, but he needs time to talk about how he feels about the situation. It's important to listen and be open to what he has to say.Use active listening skills to make him feel heard, such as by making eye contact, facing him, putting away your phone and/or turning off the TV, nodding, and asking questions now and then to have him expand or clarify what he means.
Remember, his anger is not about you. It's about what you're bringing up. If he seems resistant at first, you may need to wait a little while to broach the topic again. That way, he has time to think about it in between., Eating disorders are often perceived as something only women have. Because of this issue, men often do not want to seek treatment for an eating disorder, as they may feel like there is a stigma associated with it. Eating disorders can pose serious health risks, but men who seek help often make a full recovery.While a psychologist or psychiatrist would likely be the best choice for help, encourage the man to seek help wherever he feels most comfortable (as long as the person is a professional). For instance, if he's more comfortable starting with his primary doctor, then by all means, encourage him to start there. The person he asks for help from can assist him in finding other health professionals.
You may even offer to set up the first appointment for him. You can’t do the work for him, but helping him to get an appointment is a great way to help him get started, which may be hard for him.

, Treatment for an eating disorder can take a significant amount of time, and he'll need your support. Treatment will likely involve a combination of healthcare professionals, including a primary doctor, a nutritionist, a counselor, and/or a support group. Also, some men may need in-hospital treatment, especially if the disorder has started to take a toll on their bodies.Make sure that you ask him how you can support him. Don’t just assume that certain things would be helpful. Try saying something like, “I really want to support you in any way that I can. What do you think would be helpful to you?”

Realize that bulimia is a mental condition.,
Look for signs of binging.,
Know the signs of purging.,
Consider whether your friend is over-exercising.,
Notice if your friend appears obsessed with food.,
Pay attention to changes in appearance.,
Look for other physical changes.,
Find a quiet, private time alone together.,
Don't focus on you friend's appearance or eating.,
Encourage your friend to seek help.,
Don't try to get a person with bulimia to stop binging and purging.,
Talk with someone who can help you.,
Remind your friend that you care about her.,
Help your friend learn about treatment for bulimia.,
Be patient.",How to Help a Friend With Bulimia," While it's most commonly found in teenage and young adult women, both men and women can be bulimic, at any age.The cause of bulimia is thought to be an inability to deal with painful or overwhelming emotions.Binging, or overeating, helps a bulimic person to calm herself. It may help her feel less angry, unhappy, or lonely. When binging, the person may consume thousands of calories.
Purging helps a bulimic person to feel more in control of her body. It may be the way that the person overcomes feelings of helplessness and self-loathing.
Bulimia is a cycle that is based in a person's emotional responses, rather than rational reactions. Simply knowing that the behavior is out of control isn't sufficient to change it.;
, Binging often happens in secret, when the person is alone. Someone with bulimia often knows that their behavior is abnormal. She'll attempt to hide her overeating from others, often eating late at night or in a private spot where no one will see her eating.Signs of binging include finding piles of empty high-caloric food wrappers, having food disappear from shelves and refrigerators, and hidden stashes of junk food or sweets.
Some people who binge may eat normally when around others. They may even appear to eat somewhat less, or say that they're dieting. Abnormal eating behaviors may not be easy to notice if the person with bulimia is hiding her behavior.

, Purging often takes place immediately following a meal or a binge. If the person seems to be visiting the bathroom more frequently than usual, or if you notice any signs of vomit, these may be signs of purging.The person with bulimia may use mouthwash, breath mints, or cologne to hide the smell of vomit.
Running the sink may be used to cover the sound of vomiting.
You may also notice packages of diuretics or laxatives. These are both used for purging.

, Excessive exercising, regardless of weather, injury, or illness, may be a method of purging.Because exercise is usually considered ""good"" and healthy, this may be difficult to understand as a sign of bulimia. However, over-exercising in this way can be as damaging to a person's health as any other method of purging.
If a person is increasingly socially isolated from her friends by her exercise, this might be a sign of using exercise to purge. She may skip work or school in order to exercise; prioritize working out over family, a social life, her own health and safety; feel guilt or anxiety when when she's not working out; and exercising alone to avoid attention or notice from others.If your friend shows these signs of compulsive exercise, she may also suffer from an exercise addiction., He may avoid eating in public completely, or he may appear overly focused on talking and thinking about food. He may be overly interested in counting calories, in special diets, or in managing his food intake.He may use excuses to avoid eating with others, such as saying that he's not hungry, that he already ate, or that he's not feeling well.
When he does eat, he may be very anxious about what people think of his food intake. He may become increasingly self-conscious.

, The person with bulimia may lose or gain a large amount of weight in a short time. He might become increasingly self-critical of his own appearance, developing a distorted perception of his body image. You may notice him wearing baggy clothes to hide his body from others.Someone with bulimia may see himself as being quite overweight even if he's not.
Look for yellowing teeth (a sign of purging) as stomach acid affects the tooth enamel., The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) lists the following among the physical manifestations of bulimia: brittle nails and hair; slowed breathing and pulse; dry, yellowish skin; fine hair growth all over the body; feeling cold all the time; feeling tired all the time.Physical signs that are less visible to the observer include anemia, muscle weakness, and muscle thinning. People with bulimia may also experience severe constipation.Osteopenia or osteoporosis (thinning of the bones) is commonly associated with bulimia.

, People with eating disorders often have a lot of shame. Your friend may be defensive, or deny that she has a problem. Talking to your friend requires that you be sensitive to your friend's feelings.Share your memories of specific incidents that resulted in your concern.
Present your concerns in a nonjudgmental tone, and listen to anything your friend may say with openness and respect.
Prepare to have multiple conversations. Because there is so much shame associated with eating disorders, it's unlikely that your friend will admit her problem right away.

, Talk instead about your friendship and your relationship. If you've noticed your friend spending more time alone, for instance, talk about the way you've missed her in your social group rather than accusing her of binging in private. Remind her that you care about her.Remind her that you're concerned about her health.
Avoid giving compliments or criticism about the person's appearance. No matter how well-intentioned, this only triggers negative responses in a person who has an eating disorder.

, Let your friend know that there are support groups, professional counselors and other emotional care providers who may be able to help. Come prepared with a list of counselors in you area and remind her that help is an option.Never force a friend to seek help. The decision must come from the person with the eating disorder.
Remember that bulimia is essentially a person's emotional response to feeling out of control.
If your friend doesn't want to seek help, ask if she'll consider getting a regular physical just to rule out immediate medical concerns.

, If you try to get her to stop, she will perceive this as your attempting to control her, and resist. It may be difficult to allow the person to continue in this unsafe behavior, but trying to force her to stop will only result in more difficulties.Getting into power struggles over food is usually a bad outcome.
Focus on what your friend might be going through emotionally. Talk to her about the connection between eating and stress, for example. You might say, ""I notice that you seem to spend more time alone when you're stressed. What's causing you to feel stressed?""

, If your friend won't admit to a problem, you can't force him to. Each person must decide for himself whether to try to address bulimia. Talk with someone else about what can be done to support your friend.If there is a support group for friends and family of people with eating disorders, see if it helps you.
Talking with someone who has recovered from her own eating disorder might help you learn more about the condition.
A counselor may be able to help you better understand what you can do to help your friend, and what your friend must do for himself.

, Your concern is based in your friendship for her, not because she's wrong or bad. Don't demand immediate progress or change in her behavior.Your friend needs your hope, encouragement, and kindness. Provide these in abundance!
Remember that her eating disorder is not about you or your friendship.

, Treatment options include therapy, nutritional counseling, support groups and residential treatment. The best treatment for any individual person will vary, but it is usually a combination of several treatments. For example, a person might have bi-weekly therapy sessions paired with weekly nutritional counseling and support groups. Or the person may benefit from residential treatment if there are medical concerns.Family therapy is also recommended in order to address the impact the eating disorder may have on the whole family.
The goal of treatment for bulimia is to address the physical as well as the psychological aspects of the condition. Learning a to have a healthier relationship with food and ways to better address stress and adversity are all part of treatment for bulimia.

, Treatment for eating disorders takes time. You'll need to learn how to take care of your own needs, even while you're trying to help your friend. Don't become so involved with taking care of a friend that you don't take care of yourself.Find time in your day for relaxation, meditation, and doing things you enjoy.
If you aren't able to take care of yourself, you won't be of use to your friend. If you find that you're having difficulty managing to care for yourself, consider taking some time apart.

Set aside time to talk one on one.,
Share specific moments where you were concerned about your friend’s disorder.,
Use “I” statements.,
Avoid passing judgement or shaming your friend.,
Do not comment on how your friend looks or her physical appearance.,
Practice active listening.,
Assure her of your support and your concern about her health.,
Encourage her to seek treatment, even if she denies she has a problem.,
Get your friend’s family involved in the treatment process.,
Develop a support plan with other friends and your friend’s family.,
Offer to make an appointment with a therapist who specializes in eating disorders.,
Suggest an eating disorder support group in your friend’s area.,
Encourage your friend to check into a treatment center if her eating disorder becomes severe or an emergency.",How to Help a Friend Who Has an Eating Disorder," Make sure you talk to your friend privately in a space where she feels comfortable, such as your home or her home. Pick a spot where there will be no distractions or interruptions.Having a one on one conversation will also prevent other people from entering the conversation and firing accusations or opinions at your friend. Avoid sitting down with a group of people and your friend, as this can feel like an aggressive environment or an attack on your friend, rather than a supportive conversation.;
, Open the conversation by talking about specific moments where you concerned about your friend’s health due to her eating disorder. Avoid blanket statements like, “You have a problem” or “You have an eating disorder”. Instead, use specific instances where you experienced the negative effects of your friend’s disorder.For example, you may discuss when you and your friend went to a casual get together at a friend’s house last week. Using “I” statements, you may say: “I noticed that you ate a huge amount of food very quickly and then excused yourself from the table. From the bathroom, your other friends and I could hear you throwing up your food. This instance made me very concerned about you and your health. I am worried about you and want you to know how much I care about your well-being”.

, When you speak to your friend, you should always use “I” statements, as this will prevent your wording and tone from becoming accusatory or judgemental. Avoid statements like, “You seem sick” or “you should just eat”. Instead, always express how you are feeling in relation to your friend’s disorder and how you feel her disorder is negatively effecting her health.For example, you may bring up the fact that is it difficult to go to restaurants with your friend, as she either does not eat anything or she binge eats. You may say, “It’s difficult for me to go to restaurants with you because I will order a meal and you will not eat anything the entire night.”

, It can be a hard line to walk, especially when you want to be supportive of your friend, but also snap them out of their disorder. However, eating disorders are a mental illness that requires support and understanding, not judgement or shaming. Often, eating disorders are tied to other trauma or other mental issues and will not be easily solved by just eating food.Though it may be tempting to tell your friend, “If you would just eat, you would be fine!” or “Wow, I can’t believe you think you are fat”, it’s important to you try not to shame your friend into eat or bully her into eating. Remember that her disorder is a daily struggle and not a lighthearted issue.
Your friend may also be suffering from body dysmorphia, a common disorder tied to eating disorders where she cannot see her actual size, so she may feel heavier than she actually is. These elements can all create a skewed perception of her weight, and these perceptions are not just going to go away if you tell her to “just eat”.

, Avoid making comments about her weight or her looks, such as, “You don’t look like you have an eating disorder” or “You look like you’ve lost weight.” These comments will only reinforce your friend’s obsession with her body and her looks, leading her to focus even more on her eating disorder.Rather than tell your friend she is “not fat” or “does not have an eating disorder”, you can ask her to consider why she has a fear of being fat and what she thinks she can achieve by becoming thin. This will give her a chance to express her feelings and thoughts around her eating disorder, rather than feel shameful or embarrassed about it.

, Support your friend by actively listening to her thoughts and feelings around her eating disorder. This means sitting quietly and listening to your friend as she speaks, making eye contact and nodding your head or smiling to assure her that you are listening.Once she has finished speaking, you should try to reflect her words back to her using your own words. Start by saying, “What I am hearing you say is…” or “I think what you meant was…”. For example, you may respond with, “What I am hearing you say is that your eating disorder is a way for you to feel in control.”
Allow your friend to agree with your response and confirm that you listened to her properly. Once she confirms you have listened properly to what she has to say, you can offer advice or support.

, You should end the conversation by reinforcing your support and concern for your friend’s health. Make sure your friend knows that you care for her and do not want to see her health get worse due to her eating disorder.You can also end the conversation by gently suggesting that your friend get professional help for her disorder. Eating disorders will only get worse if they are not treated, so suggesting treatment is a useful way to try to help your friend deal with her eating disorder.

, It can be difficult for individuals with an eating disorder to admit that they have a problem and need help. If your friend does not want to admit she has a problem, avoid getting upset at her or trying to force her to face her eating disorder. Instead, present several treatment options that she can try and encourage her to start with a support group or one session with a therapist. Ease her into treatment and work with her to try to get her to open up about her disorder. It may take time for her to admit to herself and to others that she has an eating problem.

, If your friend’s eating disorder continues to get worse, you may want to consider reaching out to your friend’s family. You should first ask your friend if she would consider telling her family about her eating disorder, if they do not know about it already. Do not go behind your friend’s back and tell her family yourself without her permission or without her awareness.Getting your friend’s family involved should only be done if your friend’s health is seriously declining due to her disorder and she refuses to seek treatment. A more rigorous treatment plan, with a stay in a hospital or a rehab center may be required if her eating disorder becomes life threatening or very severe.

, Reach out to your friend’s family and other friends to talk about ways that you support your friend with the eating disorder. Sit down with them and create a support plan, noting signs that your friend’s disorder is getting worse or getting out of control. Agree to take measures as a group, whether it is spending one on one time with the friend when they are having difficulties, or encouraging the friend to seek treatment if their symptoms become more severe.


You may want to include a list of support groups and professional therapists that anyone involved in the support plan can call if your friend begins to get worse.

, Treatment for eating disorders is recommended based on the individual’s symptoms and the severity of their disorder. But, treatment often involves therapy sessions with a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. You can offer to make an appointment for your friend and/or accompany her on her first appointment as a show of support.Therapy can also be done in a group setting, where your friend can improve her self-esteem, understand her emotional triggers, and learn to respond to stress and emotional pain in healthy ways around others who are dealing with the same issues.

, Support groups are also good ways to ease into treatment, especially if your friend is uncomfortable with therapy sessions. Look for an eating disorder support group in your friend’s area that is easy to get to and offer to take her to a group meeting.Support groups are often run by peers, rather than professionals, making them less intimidating. It can also be encouraging to learn about coping mechanisms and ways to view food in a healthy way from individuals who are struggling with the same issues.

, Eating disorders that go untreated will only become more severe and could be life threatening. If your friend appears to be very thin and has very low energy or if her purging habits appear out of control, you may want to encourage her to check into a treatment center. You may also want to get her family involved and other close friends so you can all work together to get her to check into a treatment facility, where she can get the help she needs.

If your eating behaviors have become hard for you to manage alone, you need to ask for help. Don't wait. Eating disorders are responsible for more deaths than any other mental illness.All eating disorders pose serious health risks. Anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality rate of any eating disorder: 5-10% of people with anorexia die within 10 years of developing the disorder, and 18-20% die within 20 years.The sooner you seek treatment, the more likely you are to make a recovery.If you aren't sure where to start, you can try calling a helpline. The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) runs a helpline at 1-800-931-2237. These helplines are run by people who have been trained to offer support and guidance. They can also put you in touch with mental health resources in your area.You can also talk to your doctor about getting a referral to a mental health provider.
NEDA also has an online ""Find Treatment"" search directory to help you locate a mental health professional. You can search by your state and by eating disorder specialty, such as anorexia, bulimia, or binge eating.;
, The goal is to pick a program in which you feel safe, comfortable and accepted. The unique aspects of your situation will drive the decision. Eating disorders do not have a single cause or a predictable course.All forms of treatment require a large dose of self-help to make the program successful. Treatment options include:


Family-based therapy. Because family dysfunction often directly contributes to disordered eating, family therapy can be helpful in treating it.This involves family members joining you in a therapeutic environment under the coordination of a therapist.
Inpatient treatment centers. You are required to check-in to the facility and remain there for the entire program. This involves both individual and group therapy sessions, activities that encourage social interaction, and a nutritional program.
Outpatient therapy. You attend therapy at an eating disorder clinic, but are able to stay in your home. This may involve individual therapy and/or group therapy.
Group therapy. You attend meetings with a group of other people suffering from eating disorders and discuss your issues together under supervision of a therapist.
Individual therapy. You attend one-on-one appointments with a trained therapist to explore your feelings, beliefs, and behaviors and build strategies for improvement.
Each program needs to include a nutritional component. A nutritionist familiar with eating disorders can develop a healthy program for you to include in your daily routine. This will add another level of accountability as well.

, You can always ask someone to help you make this decision. Make visits or discuss each therapeutic option with the parties involved. It is an important decision so gather as much information as you can.


Research has shown that successful treatment for anorexia nervosa includes medical management, behavioral therapy, cognitive or family therapy combined with pharmacotherapy (drug therapy).The effectiveness of any treatment depends on the individual person.
Bulimia nervosa is often effectively treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy. Some people may also be helped by adding an antidepressant such as fluoxetine (Prozac), which has been approved by the FDA to treat bulimia. Prozac appears to help reduce bingeing and purging and the likelihood of relapse.Binge eating disorders respond well to cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy results in significant, long-lasting changes. Fluoxetine or other antidepressants may help reduce bingeing behavior and relieve depression that may trigger episodes.It is common to feel awkward and nervous in new situations like entering therapy. Once you get past the initial newness of the situation you will start to see the benefits of your involvement. Hang in there because the change will be positive., Your therapist will likely teach you how to catch negative self-talk and challenge it with self-compassion. If you find yourself having an internal dialogue that includes negative put-downs or self-bullying, notice these and then express kindness to yourself.For example, if you tell yourself, “I’m so stupid and ugly. I know everyone hates me,” acknowledge that you had that thought. Remind yourself that it is a thought, not a fact. Then, present a self-compassionate alternative: “I just caught myself having an abusive thought toward myself. I'm working on being kinder to myself, and those thoughts aren't helpful for achieving that goal. I am learning every day how to have a healthier relationship with food and myself. I will keep fighting to develop healthy behaviors and healthy thoughts."", Using visualization techniques has been shown to be effective at helping to manage bingeing and purging behaviors in bulimia nervosa.Your therapist can help you develop a safe visualization through guided imagery techniques.


You can also try this out yourself. Imagine a place that feels safe, secure, and calming. It could be a beautiful scene in nature, or a particularly happy memory. Imagine it in great detail. Think about what you smell, hear, see, taste, and touch.When you feel the urge to engage in unhealthy eating behaviors, visualize this safe space. Remember the safety and strength that you feel in this place.

, This will help you understand what is causing your eating disorder. Asking yourself key questions will help you determine why you act the way that you do.


Ask yourself if you feel inadequate or suffer from low self-esteem? Do you feel depressed, anxious, angry, stressed or lonely? Does it seem that you have little control in your life?
Are you having problems with personal relationships? Do others tease you about your weight? Is there a history of sexual or physical abuse in your background? Do you have a hard time expressing your emotions and feelings?
Are you feeling a lot of social pressure that can greatly affect your feelings about food? Men and women are portrayed in advertising for the sole purpose of increasing sales of a product. They are portrayals of men and woman cast in a highly-stylized manner that is heavily airbrushed and manipulated to create an unattainable “ideal.” It is unrealistic and harmful to compare yourself to these impossible standards.
Are you using food to address any or all of these issues? For example, if it seems you have no control over your life due to a family or relationship situation, you control your food intake because that is the one thing you can control.
Write your answers to these questions in a journal. This will help you organize your thoughts. It will also show you that you are making positive changes when you periodically look back over what you have written. Journaling under the guidance of a therapist can be very helpful in overcoming your eating disorder.

, She can help guide you through interpreting and processing them. What are your emotional triggers that result in unhealthy eating? Determine what situations create anxiety, fear, dread, stress and generally unpleasant feelings. When a negative emotion is triggered, substitute the unhealthy behavior with non-food related behavior.


For example, you might work really hard on a school project and you think it is great and you feel really good about it. The grades come out and you get a low grade. Others in your class find out and make fun of you. This makes you feel dumb, ashamed and alone. You go home for the day and want to go immediately to the refrigerator and eat a lot of food to make yourself feel better hoping food will take away the negative feelings. You stop yourself and instead go to your room and write in a journal the feelings you felt and the reactions you had. This will help you make a list of situations that trigger emotional responses that lead to eating. Writing in a journal is always a healthy substitute for negative eating behaviors.
Find something that will hold your focus and appeal to the emotional needs your eating disorder attempts to meet. For example, if you feel trapped, read a book or go to a movie that will temporarily take you to a different world.

, Making the decision to help yourself starts as simple as that – you decide. When it comes to eating disorders, there is a good chance that your health and possibly your life are currently in jeopardy. This is an urgent matter and you must act quickly.


Your heart, kidneys and liver may be permanently damaged as a result of an eating disorder.Your teeth can get permanently damaged from stomach acid related to purging food.
You may suffer such medical issues as: muscle loss, weakness, severe dehydration, peptic ulcers, high blood pressure, and type II diabetes.
Your psychological health will continue to deteriorate if you do not get help.
Mark today on your calendar as the day you decided to change your behaviors and live a more healthy life.

, When learning about these conditions you might recognize some of your own behaviors. This can be a normal response, but you must be cautious to not self-diagnose to the point of upsetting yourself. Leave an official diagnosis to the professionals trained to do so.


Other eating disorders might have behavioral variations such as: anorexia where weight is not below normal; binging and purging that occurs on an infrequent basis; night eating syndrome where you eat excessive amounts of food at night; only eating certain foods (avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder); eating things that are not considered food like chalk or dirt (pica); rumination disorder that involves eating food then regurgitating it into your mouth and chewing it again., Symptoms vary from one type of eating disorder to another and from person to person. The symptoms of eating disorders include the following:


Anorexia nervosa symptoms: being overly focused on body image; eating minimal amounts of food that results in a weight that is too low for your body size; and a refusal to acknowledge there is a problem.
Binge eating disorder symptoms: eating mass quantities of food and feeling out of control; eating large amounts when you are not hungry; or eating large amounts of food in private because you are ashamed of your behavior.
Bulimia Nervosa symptoms: consuming large quantities of food and relieving your body of it by making yourself vomit or abusing laxatives; using these methods to control your weight; feeling out of control; being overly focused on your body image.

, If you are using food to cope with difficult situations, there are alternatives you can use. Are you bingeing to create comfort, or purging to punish yourself? If so, you are using food as a coping mechanism.Take the time to develop alternate ways to comfort yourself. For example, if helping others, or animals brings you comfort, reach out to others to help instead of reaching for food.
Looking to others for support and rehearsing responses to difficult situations are two forms of effective coping responses you can use., Arts-based therapies are sometimes used to treat eating disorders, and you may find that your therapist recommends artistic expression.Just having an outlet to express your emotions and anxieties can often help you feel better.Find a way to express what you're feeling in a creative, helpful way, rather than using food to cope.For example, you could try writing stories or poems about how you feel.You could draw or paint, if you connect with that.
Remind yourself that creative expression is not about ""right"" or ""wrong."" It isn't about creating a ""perfect"" product. It's about expressing yourself through an enriching, exploratory process., Discover who you are beyond your image. You are not what you wear or what you eat. You are a person of substance and you get to unveil what you are all about. Approach others with the same attitude, which will help eliminate the stigma associated with having an eating disorder.Make a list of the traits you possess that you believe are positive. Write down how each of those qualities benefits you and the world around you.
If you catch yourself judging someone pause and replace the thought with something like, “I wish you the best in life and I am going to focus on improving mine.”
Practice showing yourself compassion. For example, stand up for yourself in the same way that you would for someone you love and want to protect.

, In order to support you on your journey of recovery, your loved ones need to know what's going on. Setting up a specific time to talk will give you a focused deadline that will prevent you from backing out. A conversation about sensitive subjects warrants special consideration. You need to feel comfortable.


Write out your thoughts ahead of time and practice what you are going to say.
Give the person a letter if you are uncomfortable talking about it. The letter will break the ice and start a conversation.
Tell the person how you would like her to be involved. Do you want the person to just provide support? Do you want the person to hold you accountable in your recovery? These are all things to consider and address.

, There are people around you who want to help you through life. They are there for you in your time of need, and you may be there for them as well. Once you know the support is there it gives you a strong foundation to rely upon. It is essential that you continue to ask for support when needed.


Remember that there is no particular requirement for who you ""should"" include in your support group. Sometimes, pressure from families and parents can actually contribute to eating disorders.If you'd feel more comfortable reaching out to your friends for support, do that.
Agree to medical monitoring. The medical personal who have helped you succeed can only continue to help you if you keep them informed of your progress, attend scheduled appointments and be open and honest in your communication.
Keep contacts updated. If you lose your phone, change numbers, or move, you need to update everyone who has been a part of your wellness team. You don’t want anyone to worry about you unnecessarily.

, Whichever program you choose to attend, continued work will be required to uphold your progress and health. Trust the process that helped you achieve a more positive way of dealing with your emotions and thoughts.


Join groups such as Overeaters Anonymous and other peer-based 12 step groups that have proven to be effective when paired with psychotherapy and medication.Find inspiration from others. Talking about eating disorders can make you feel ashamed or embarrassed. You might feel like there's nothing you can do to get better. Many eating disorders are tied to feelings of low self-efficacy, or feeling like you don't have control over your life and actions.Hearing stories from others who have sought treatment for their eating disorders and made recoveries can help inspire you to do the same.If you would like to connect with other people who have had eating disorders you can call NEDA, The National Eating Disorder Association at 1-800-931-2237 for a referral. As noted above, this is a confidential Helpline. They have an expansive network of service providers who can help you.Be kind and encourage yourself. You have put in a lot of work to make your life meaningful. Celebrate your successes whenever possible.

, When you’ve been through a struggle, you may forget what it feels like to enjoy life. There may be things you used to like to do that you haven’t done in a while. If they still bring you joy, make plans to do them as soon as possible.


Open yourself to new experiences that will enhance your knowledge and experience in the world. These types of things always help you gain a new perspective on your life and the meaning you place upon your circumstances.
Identify activities that will motivate you. Sustaining motivation is difficult, but possible. If you know you lose motivation when you don’t get out into nature at least three times a week, put it on your calendar and attend to it as if it was an appointment.
Smile more. Studies have shown that the act of smiling improves your mood and it is contagious.A smile is something you can always share.

, Let go of the past. If you try to let something go and it continues to eat at you, hold you back or elicit feelings that lead to undesirable eating, you likely need to process residual feelings. You will eventually reach a point where you feel and believe your struggles are behind you. Living each day in the present moment allows you to leave the past behind.

Discuss cultural images.,
Encourage them to focus on other positive aspects of themselves.,
Talk about the good things their body does for them.,
Be careful of your own language.",How to Help Men Suffering from Eating Disorders2," Today, boys and men are facing pressure to have perfect bodies. Movie stars, action figures, and ad campaigns all pitch perfection in males as a strong, tall, muscular body, an impossibility for most men.It's important to emphasize that bodies come in all shapes and sizes, and they can be ""masculine"" in the body they have without transitioning to a body they idolize., People with eating disorders, including men, place a high percentage of their self-esteem in their body image. Helping the person to move beyond that image of themselves and look at other positive parts of their personality can help them learn to define themselves in ways that don't revolve around their body.Ask them to think about the things they like about themselves without talking about their bodies. If they seem hesitant, try starting them out with something you like about them.
Encourage them to develop these things they like about themselves, so that they have a different focus for their self-esteem.
Schedule fun activities for the two of you to engage in as well. Try to think of things that he enjoys doing. For example, if he enjoys playing basketball, then you could set up a game or play some one-on-one. Engaging him in things that he is skilled at and/or passionate about will help him to see that there are other things to base his self-esteem on.

, Another way to help with body image is to help the person focus on what his body can do, not what's ""wrong"" with it. For instance, you could suggest he make a list of everything his body does well, from keeping him alive to helping him do his work., That is, try not to make judgments about his body, even if it seems like a ""good"" comment, such as ""You're not fat."" In addition, it's important not to make judgments about other men's bodies in his presence, as he will take those comments to heart. Try to place the emphasis on the fact that each body is good and unique in its own way.Also, make sure to redirect him if you notice that he is commenting on his body or other people’s bodies. Try saying something like, ""That's not what we should be focusing on,” and then change the subject.

Pay attention to at-risk communities.,
Watch for an obsession with muscle toning.,
Check for steroid usage.,
Watch for signs of anorexia nervosa.,
Notice symptoms of bulimia nervosa.,
Pay attention to signs of muscle dysmorphia.,
Look for signs of binge-eating disorder.",How to Help Men Suffering from Eating Disorders3," Boys and men in certain sports and activities are more at-risk for developing eating disorders. Particularly, men who play sports that require certain weights, such as gymnastics, wrestling, track, and swimming are more at risk. Other activities, such as dancing, may place similar restrictions on men that put them at risk., Many men who develop eating disorders also develop an obsession with increasing muscle mass. In turn, that means they may spend excessive amounts of time lifting weights or at the gym. If you notice someone who has an obsession with muscle toning, especially if he gets very upset about missing a session, that could indicate he has an eating disorder.Some people also develop an obsession with one part of their body. They may never be satisfied with this area no matter how toned it is.

, Steroid usage can help men build muscles, but with significant side effects. Many men who use steroids are trying to build muscle at a faster rate than their normal body would allow. Like muscle toning, this behavior can indicate an obsession with body image, which in turn can indicate a possible eating disorder.One of the main signs of steroid use is dramatic mood swings, often known as ""'road rage.""
Other common side effects include paranoia, increased muscle mass, acne, enlarged breasts (in men), and hyperactivity.

, This disorder is characterized by a fear of gaining weight, which in turn translates to the person severely restricting their diet. Men may also push towards being muscular in attempt to attain what culture has held up as ideal.The primary sign of this disorder is increased anxiety around eating, along with behavioral changes related to eating. You may notice the person counting calories excessively, avoiding eating, reading labels, and adopting food rituals. The person may lose a large amount of weight.
They might also avoid eating with other people or they may lie about having already eaten or claim that they will eat later.
The person may also weigh themselves obsessively or ask about other people’s weights.
Other signs of this disorder include brittle nails, dry skin, hair loss, and depression.

, Bulimia nervosa is a disorder where men compulsively binge eat, but then try to balance that binge eating with behaviors to keep them from gaining weight. Like anorexia, most men with this disorder have an intense need to keep their bodies a certain size or shape.Men with this disorder may induce vomiting, use laxatives, try diuretics, or exercise excessively. They may also use fasting as a way to compensate.
Common signs include large amounts of food going missing (as men with this disorder may hide their eating binges) and bathroom trips immediately after meals. You may also notice marks or callouses on the man's hands (from inducing vomiting) or bloating in the face.

, This disorder is primarily characterized by an obsessive desire to have a muscular body. Men will often have a level of shame about their bodies, with body-checking being a prime symptom, along with a desire to hide their bodies.Men with this disorder will often work out excessively, control their diet to an extreme, and participate in harmful activities such as taking steroids.
You may notice the person becoming anxious about making sure they get workouts in, as well as increased anxiety around food and dieting.

, Men who have binge-eating disorder typically engage in food binges more than once a week. A binge is characterized as a person eating more in a short period of time (say two hours) than others would generally eat in that time. Usually, they feel like they have no control over how much they're eating.Those who binge eat will often do it in secret. In addition, these binges are generally followed by guilt and shame.

Set aside time to talk.,
Create a safe space.,
Focus on constructive subjects.,
Show your friend their inner beauty.",How to Hang Out with an Anorexic Friend1," Choose a regular time to talk to your friend so that they know there is a space for them to air their concerns and receive support. It doesn’t have to be daily, but it ensures your friend has a consistent space for support.


During your scheduled talk time, focus on the conversation. Don’t accept interruptions such as calls or texts unless absolutely necessary. They might make it seem as though you are not focused on your friend. Agree to set phones and other distractions in another area until you finish.
Have specific times to not talk about the disorder. It is important to give your friend a safe space to talk about anorexia, but dwelling on the subject for too long can be harmful. A study in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology suggests that ruminating thoughts can increase the desire to abstain from food. Take 10 or 15 minutes each conversation to talk about subjects your friend enjoys. Keep that time free of eating disorder discussions.;
, Encourage your friend to set guidelines for your talk time that let them feel safe sharing. These could include:


Agreeing to not share their struggles with others
Ensuring that you are not in a place where your conversation can be overheard
Avoiding certain words or phrases that may cause them anxiety
Avoiding certain actions such as snacking while you talk

, Direct the conversation away from matters of weight and beauty as general points of conversation.


If your friend wants to talk about weight or body image, encourage them to look at why they feel the way they do. Instead of saying “but you look great,” try “you seem to anxious when you avoid food. What causes that anxiety?”
Find shared interests to discuss. If talking about emotions causes distress, make sure you have some safe conversation topics to help your friend refocus. Talk about a book, show, or hobby you both enjoy.

, Your friend is going through a hard time where they may be working to gain weight, and focusing how good they look at a particular stage may cause resistance moving forward. Instead, focus on why your friend is a wonderful person.Make sure you highlight the good points of your friend’s personality. Encourage them with things like “I like talking to you because you are so funny and intelligent,” or “you always impress me with how positive and upbeat you are.”
Celebrate your friend’s accomplishments. If they do well at work, make a good grade on an exam, or simply do something they are particularly proud of, congratulate their success and acknowledge how hard they worked.
Make sure your friend knows that you believe in them. There are many ways to express support for someone, but nothing beats hearing “I know how strong you are and I believe in you.”

Pay attention to what you see in the media.",How to Help Loved Ones with Binge Eating Disorder," Binge eating is a serious health condition that affects people’s physical and mental well-being. Binge eaters have many of the same body image and mood problems as those with other eating disorders like bulimia, and they can also become obese. If you’re concerned with a loved one’s behavior, it’s important to express your concerns. The first step is to talk.Set up a private, respectful meeting to discuss your worries openly and honestly. Choose a time and a place that is free from distractions – this might be your home or apartment or it might take place over the telephone.
You might say something like, “Rob, I’ve wanted to talk to you about something important for a while. Do you have time to sit down and talk?” or “Linda, I want to have a frank talk with you. Do you have time?”;
, Try to be frank but loving. Sit down and express your concern while keeping in mind that binge eaters can be very vulnerable and often feel shame or guilt about their behavior. That said, the first and foremost goal should be getting your loved one help.Use concrete examples. Recall memories of specific times when your loved one’s eating concerned you and explain that, in your opinion, this could point to a problem that needs intervention.
For instance, “I first got worried when I came over last month. I noticed you had a dozen empty ice cream containers in the trash” or “I’m concerned that you seem to go on and off diets. I remember you made weight-loss resolutions the last two years, but they only lasted for a week or two. Is everything OK?”

, Once you’ve raised concerns about your loved one’s health, ask whether he or she is willing to take these to a professional. Self-help can work for some binge eaters, but many more need more directed medical treatment. Urge your loved one to see a doctor, nutritionist, counselor, or therapist.Say something like, “Bill, would you be willing to see a nutritionist and get a professional opinion? I’m really worried you could have an eating disorder” or “Maybe you should talk to a doctor, Julie. I’m worried about your behavior.”

, As a friend or family member, make it clear that you are there and will offer your support. Part of this is helping your loved one get help and treatment. However, another part is to listen, encourage, and avoid assigning blame. Stress that you just want your loved one to be happy and healthy.Your loved one might be in denial and refuse to admit that there is a problem. In that case, restate your concern and drop the subject, but state that you are available to listen at any time.
If you feel up to it, you can also offer to help your loved one make a first appointment and even come along on the first visit.

, Binge eating is a mental health disorder and not a “bad habit” or a matter of a lack of willpower, so stay away from statements that put on the onus on your loved one. Also avoid offering simple solutions, i.e. “Just show a little willpower” or “If you cut back, everything will be fine!”To be more neutral, try favoring “I” statements over “you” statements, i.e. “I’m concerned because you’re so secretive about eating” instead of “You’re being irresponsible and hurting your health.”

, You can help a binge eating loved one just by being there for moral and emotional support. Make it clear that you are ready to talk and to listen – and that your love is always available. That alone can be a big help for someone who is struggling with body-image and emotional problems.Try to give your time freely when the loved one needs to vent or confide in you. At the same time, though, listen. Avoid criticizing and offering advice – this can be particularly hard if your loved one says things about himself and his eating that you don’t agree with.
Listening and caring does not mean letting yourself be manipulated, however. Don’t agree to rules or expectations that you can’t or won’t follow, i.e. “You can’t tell anyone else about this” or “If you ever say a word about this, I’ll never speak to you again.”, People who have eating disorders often struggle with other, related issues like depression and severe body image problems. Your loved one might therefore withdraw from her usual activities and not really be “the same” anymore. She might not want to go out with you or want to be included in things. It’s important that she know you still want her there, even if that’s not possible at the moment.Invite your loved one to do things and keep trying to include her, just as before, i.e. “Hi Iliana, we’re going bowling tonight. Do you want to join us? No? Well, we really wish you could come!” An invitation shows that you are thinking about her.Even if your loved one doesn’t want to come out, she will probably still appreciate being asked. An invitation will remind her that you care about and value her as a person.

, Most people who binge eat have low-self esteem and feel negatively about themselves, their bodies, skills, and accomplishments. Another way that you can give concrete support is by boosting your loved one’s sense of self with compliments and by being a good model yourself.Compliment your loved one on things other than appearance, i.e. personality, talents, and character. Say something like, “You’re such a great person” or “I really value having great friends like you.” This can remind your loved one that true beauty is not based on appearance.
Try to model healthy self-esteem, as well. Remember that your loved one sees how you talk about your own body and about others, so stress the value in things like character and personality rather than appearance. Avoid judging people based on size and shape, yourself included., Try to learn as much as you can about binge eating as well as other eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. Increasing your own awareness about these mental health disorders will help you to understand what your loved one is experiencing, while dispelling some of the commonly held myths about food and body image.Look for books, pamphlets, and online materials on binge eating. Check medical websites like the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the National Eating Disorder Association to learn more about binge eating’s symptoms, prevalence, and behavioral characteristics.
Learn to recognize misconceptions about eating and binge eating, like the idea that body fat and weight gain show a lack of control or laziness.

, Find out more about how medical professionals treat binge eating, so that you have a better idea of what your loved one can expect in recovery. You’ll find that there are a variety of methods ranging from self-help and cognitive behavioral therapy to medication and weight loss programs. Read up on these.Start at your library and look for self-help books or contact a local charity like Beat, which can provide information on self-help and other support groups. Some people are able to control their binge eating entirely through self-help.
Ask a professional like a doctor or counselor about psychological treatments. There are a number of psychological therapies available for binge eating, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, and interpersonal therapy. All of these involve talking to a counselor, exploring relationships with food, and learning other ways to regulate feelings and behavior.
You can also ask a doctor about medical treatments for binge eating. Some patients respond to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), for instance, which boost levels of the hormone serotonin in the brain and may help improve eating habits.

, One final way to be educated about binge eating and eating disorders is to recognize our society’s “thin ideal.” You see it everywhere – the idea that thin people are more happy, beautiful, and desired. This is not only wrong but also very unhealthy. And anxiety about being thin lies behind many eating disorders.Be aware of what you see on television and in books and magazines. Remember that the images you see there aren’t real – they’re what advertisers want you to see.
Consider starting a conversation with your friends and loved ones about the media and body image. Reflect and talk about how you too might be reinforcing the “thin ideal” in your own lives.

To choose the right type of group support for you, you may want to see a therapist first. Working with a therapist one-on-one is also a helpful way to recover from an eating disorder.;
, There are a few different types of support groups that you can attend. One option is a self-help group. In this type of group, fellow members of the group are the ones who run and organize the group. This means that people who have a history of eating disorders run the support group.These types of groups are helpful because the managers of the sessions know exactly what you are going through.
These may also be called fellowship groups, mutual help groups, or peer support groups.

, The other major type of eating disorder support group is the professionally operated group. These are led, managed, and controlled by mental health professionals who have been trained to work with patients with eating disorders.These may be run through institutions, such as hospitals or treatment centers.
Typical professionals that run these types of groups are licensed therapists, social workers, or psychologists.

, There are two different categories of membership that your support group may use. The type of group you attend depends on your comfort level with others or the types of people you want in your support group. The two types are:An open support group, where anyone can attend the group without meeting specific criteria.
A closed support group, where the group members must meet a specific criteria, such as type of disorder or level of activity in the group.

, The best way to get the most out of a support group is to make sure that you can attend the meetings frequently. This is easiest if you find a support group in your area as close to your home as possible. This means that you need to look in your city for a local support group.You can also ask around at your local hospital or treatment facility for an eating disorder support group.
There are some online locators that help your find the type of support group you want in your area., Before you attend a support group, you need to make sure you are ready for one. There is a specific point in your treatment that you should look to support groups for help. This will be different for every person, but you shouldn't force yourself into this type of treatment until you are ready.You can work with your therapist or doctor to determine when you're ready for this part of your treatment plan."

Set small goals.,
Move on to the next meat.,
Add in more vegetables.,
Allow yourself some less-healthy options.,
Make your own meatless options.,
Decide how far you want to go.,
Eat a variety of plant proteins.,
Pay attention to calcium.,
Think about vitamin B12.,
Look for omega-3 fatty acids.,
Get your iron, zinc, and iodine.,
Ask at restaurants.,
Try a vegetarian cooking class.,
Try a co-op.,
Bring your own food.,
Educate yourself.",How to Transition to a Vegetarian Lifestyle," Don't try to go completely meatless right away. While that works for some people, it can make the transition much harder for you than if you do it in smaller steps.For instance, you could say that you're giving up beef for the next 10 days while still eating poultry and/or fish.
Alternatively, you could pick what meat you like the least to cut out first.;
, Once you've cut out one meat, move on to the next meat. For instance, once you've cut out red meat, set a timeline for pork.Don't beat up on yourself if you mess up and eat the meat you're cutting out. It's a process you need to adjust to gradually. You can satisfy a craving, then move on.
Over time, eliminate all of the meats you want to give up.

, As you cut out meat, make sure you're adding in more vegetables to your diet. You should also be adding in plant-based proteins, such as beans and other legumes and whole grains.It's good to try some new vegetables right now. You may have been fairly predictable in your vegetable choices before going vegetarian, but adding in new vegetables will keep it more interesting.
Try to eat vegetables instead of extra carbohydrates such as pasta or rice. While both will fill you up, if you're trying to be healthier, the vegetables are the better option., When you're transitioning, you may want to give into cravings for some less-healthy options. Maybe your craving is sugar or maybe you've got a thing for chips. While you don't want to make these foods a staple of your diet, letting yourself eat a few while you're transitioning can make it easier.Another way to help deal with cravings is to add umami to your food. Umami is a Japanese word that describes a fifth type of taste in addition to sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. It describes a savoriness that you often find in meats, but that you can also add to your vegetarian diet. For instance, using fermented condiments, such as soy sauce, liquid aminos, or vegan Worcestershire sauce, can help add umami to your food. Other options are dried mushrooms and tomatoes, nutritional yeast, vegetable broth, and savory spices (such as cumin and smoked paprika).
Another way to deal with cravings is to eat meat replacements and ""meaty"" vegetables such as mushrooms, which can serve as a stand-in to help you make dishes you used to love. For instance, maybe you love shepherd's pie. You can use meatless soy crumbles as a replacement for the meat and still have the same dish.

, You can purchase meat substitutes, such as soy ground beef or black bean burgers. They are a good option, but you can also make your own for a lot less.For instance, experiment with a mix of grains, beans, and rice to make ""burgers.""
Once you find a recipe you like, you can freeze small patties so you have them ready whenever you want them.
Also try meatless options that aren't trying to taste like meat. That is, sometimes a black bean or mushroom burger can be tastier than a soy burger, even though they don't taste exactly like meat.

, Every vegetarian is different. Some vegetarians eat eggs and dairy, while others avoid all foods made from animal sources.Some people eat mostly vegetarian and indulge occasionally in fish. Technically, that's pescatarian, not vegetarian, but it may be what's best for you.
If you eat no meat but you want to still eat dairy and eggs, that's called ovo-lacto, while if you eat dairy but not eggs, that's called lacto-vegetarian.
If you don't want to eat any animal products at all (including honey) or wear animal products (such as leather), that's called vegan.
Or, you may choose to be a flexitarian. With this diet, you can cut back on meat and animal products on most days but allow yourself the room to indulge in a steak (or whatever your favorite is) from time to time.The names don't matter as much as finding the diet that's right for you.

, The key to getting the proteins you need is to make sure you are eating a variety of proteins. For instance, eating grains, nuts, legumes, seeds, and meat substitutes can help you get the protein you need.Very few individual plant proteins don't contain all nine essential amino acids that animal proteins do; however, when combining plant-based foods, you can easily get all nine in your diet.Try brown rice and beans or whole grain bread with peanut butter.
Quinoa, buckwheat, and soy are complete proteins (they have all nine essential amino acids) that vegetarians can enjoy.
The US Government recommends that adult women aged 19 to 30 get 5.5 ounces or ounce equivalents a day, while adult women aged 31 or older get 5 ounces. Men should get 6.5 ounces or ounce equivalents from age 19 to 30, 6 ounces from age 31 to 50, and 5.5 ounces from age 51 on.As a guide, here are some ""ounce equivalents"" of vegetarian foods: 1/2 ounce of nuts (7 walnut halves or 12 almonds), 1/4 cup of beans (cooked), 1 tablespoon of almond or peanut butter, 1/4 cup of cooked peas or lentils, 1/2 ounce of seeds (such as pumpkin or squash seeds), 1 ounce of cooked tempeh, 2 tablespoons of hummus, or 1/4 cup of tofu., If you're skipping dairy, you need to make sure you're getting your calcium intake from other sources. Some good sources of calcium include dark, leafy greens (such as kale, collard greens, or broccoli) and fortified cereals.Vitamin D is just as important — your body needs vitamin D to absorb calcium. If you're drinking milk, it's probably fortified with vitamin D.
However, if you're drinking non-dairy milk, check to see if vitamin D is added. You may need to add a supplement if your food sources don't contain it.

, Another vitamin you need to pay attention to as a vegetarian is vitamin B12. This vitamin is necessary for muscle repair, and while you easily get it from meat, you need to pay a bit more attention if you're not eating meat.Dairy products, such as cheese, milk, and yogurt, are all good sources of vitamin B12.
Eggs are also a good source.
If you're not eating any of these, you might consider trying a fortified yeast extract, fortified cereal, or tofu. Another option is taking a supplement.

, These fatty acids are good for heart health, and they are commonly found in fish. If you're not eating fish, you need to get them elsewhere. Some good sources include ground flaxseed, canola oil, soybeans, and walnuts., Humans best absorb iron from meat sources, so when you're vegetarian, you need to by vigilant about getting enough iron. The best sources for iron are dark-leafy greens, whole grains, dried fruit, lentils, peas, and beans.Similarly, your best bet for zinc is from animal products, like cheese. However, you can also get it from soy, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and wheat germ.
Iodine is mainly a problem if you're vegan. The best way to get iodine is from adding iodized salt to your diet.

, While many restaurants list a vegetarian option, you can also ask if they have any other veggie options. Additionally, don't be afraid to ask if a dish can be altered by leaving out the meat.In addition, be sure to look at the side dishes, as you should have a number of options available to you there.
Don't forget to ask about ""hidden"" meats, such as chicken stock in soup or anchovies in caesar dressing.
Besides helping you stick to vegetarianism, eating at restaurants can open you up to new options., If you're not sure where to begin, a cooking class can help you get your feet wet. It can lay out the best options for you, as well as introduce you to new veggie options.Check with your local community college to see if they offer a class.
You might also find a class at your local culinary college or even your parks and recreation department.
Another option is purchasing a vegetarian cookbook or checking one out from your library.

, A co-op is a group of people who come together to buy produce directly from farmers. Different co-ops work differently, so once you find one, you'll need to ask how it works. You can usually find one just by putting in your city's name and ""food co-op"" in a search engine.


Some co-ops require you to pay a fee to join.
Some work much like conventional stores, where you go in and buy what you want, while others have lists online.
Still others may have a set ""box"" each month or every two weeks where you pay a certain price. One nice thing about the box model is you are introduced to new vegetables you may not have picked out for yourself.

, If you're invited to a party, offer to bring a meatless option. That way, it takes the pressure off the host, but you still have a good option on hand. In addition, you may find there are other vegetarians at the party that the host didn't know about.Always ask first. You don't want to show up with food the host didn't plan for.
If the host offers to make a meatless option, it's fine to take him or her up on the offer.

, If you don't already know about the process animals go through to become meat, now may be the time to do it. Once you learn more, it may help you stick to your guns about swearing off meat.You can try checking out a book on the meat industry from the library.
Another option is to visit websites that advocate for animals and the environment, as they are likely to have information.

Know the facts.,
Understand common triggers for those with anorexia.,
Arrange a time to hang out with your friend.,
Make a plan for immediate help.",How to Hang Out with an Anorexic Friend2," When you spend time with a friend fighting an eating disorder, certain moments will challenge you. Arming yourself with knowledge regarding not only anorexia, but basic information about healthy weight change, nutrition, and exercise will help you better plan stress-free times with your friend.Consult books, articles, and brochures from trusted medical and non-profit sources such as the Mayo Clinic and the National Eating Disorder Association.
Look for materials that address common misunderstandings and appropriate responses. Better understanding what goes on in your friend’s mind helps you respond calmly and sensibly, rather than with anger or frustration.

, These might prompt your friend to avoid certain situations. Plan your time with your friend away from these triggers.


For example, do not plan activities that including eating. Your friend may feel pressured to eat, and back out of plans because of this.
Limits will differ for everyone. Ask your friend what makes them uncomfortable and try to respect their answer.

, Just like arranging a time to talk is important, it is also helpful to schedule time to hang out with your friend and enjoy each other’s company.


Make sure you spend time with your friend outside of the time you take to help them. Distraction is important, which means having time to simply hang out as friends.
Find comfortable activities. Talk to your friend about what they most want to do and find things you will both enjoy.
Remember that anorexia doesn’t change who your friend is on the inside. Hanging out with them like you would any other friend gives them time where they are not dominated by their eating disorder.

, Sometimes your friend will simply need you to be there while they are struggling. They may or may not want to talk or go do something, but regardless they need your support. Create a plan for when your friend needs help fast.


Decide on logistical matters such as where you will meet in advance. It may add a lot of stress to figure these things out in the moment, so asking “would you like me to come over if you say you’re not feeling ok?” ensures you both know what your friend wants in hard times.
Make sure there is a plan for when you are not available, as well. Let them know you are there for them even when you cannot be there by setting up a plan for them to get help even when you are busy.

"
"
Be supportive when your friend wants to talk.,
Avoid making rules or promises.,
Reach out to your friend every day.,
Help build a support system.,
Be a good role model.",How to Hang Out with an Anorexic Friend3," Eating disorder problems do not follow a set schedule, and if your friend really wants or needs to talk during hang out time, or if they truly cannot handle talking during your designated talking time, be understanding.


Be honest about your concerns. Do not be harsh and try to avoid speculative statements like “I am afraid that if this continues you might…” but do express your concerns to you friend.
Let your friend know that your worries come from a place of caring. This reminds them that they are important to you, and that their disorder impacts those they love, as well.

, Saying things like “if you ever do this again, I won’t talk to you anymore,” or “if you can just manage this I will do something in return” could promote unhealthy behavior or discourage or your friend from talking to you.

, You may not be able to see them or have long talks with them on a daily basis, but reaching out to them regularly reminds them that they have someone to turn to when times get hard.


You do not need long periods of time together to be supportive. Sending a simple message each day lets your friend know that you care. “I hope you have a great day. I am here if you need anything,” can go a long way.
If your friend asks for space, be mindful. They are dealing with a great deal physically and mentally, and forcing them to talk doesn’t do any good. Do be willing to check in every once in awhile, though, to remind them of your support.

, Avoid forcing anything on your friend, but do pass along resources that could help them, especially if your friend has expressed interest in them before.


If, for example, your friend has talked about wanting to see a nutritionist, a doctor, or a therapist, offer to help them research one that specializes in eating disorders.
If you know a specialist your friend could trust, provide them with their contact information and offer to introduce them.
Do not pressure your friend to make an appointment. Putting pressure on them may cause them to avoid both professional help and you. Offer resources, but do not demand action.

, Remember that your friend is still your friend no matter what inner demons they are battling. Keep your habits healthy and work to maintain your friendship, because it is stronger than an eating disorder.


Make choices that focus on your personal health rather than your body image, and choose healthy outlets for your emotions, like a sport, an art, or therapy. Doing so is good for you and a good example for your friend.Maintain a healthy diet. Changing your eating habits because of your friend's opinions about food and body image only reinforces your friend's misconceptions.
Your friendship can outlast your friend’s battle with anorexia. Keep this mind when you encounter particularly difficult times. If your friend comes to you with something that you consider to be too much to handle on your own, let your friend know: ""I care about you and want to help you through this time, but I am not equipped to deal with this particular matter.""
You may not be able to help in the moment, but by staying supportive you are showing that you prioritize your friendship and are showing your friend how much you care about them.

Attend support group meetings regularly.,
Listen to what other people have to say.,
Get to know people at your support group meetings.,
Be honest when you share.,
Continue other treatment plans.",How to Join an Eating Disorder Support Group2," When you have an eating disorder, you may start to isolate yourself from others. Joining a support group and going to meetings on a regular basis will help you get out of your comfort zone and be less isolated from others. An eating disorder support group is full of people who understand what you are going through, so you will feel less alone in your recovery.


Your isolation may be caused by shame about your disorder, guilt about what you do as part of your disorder, or protectiveness of the habits associated with your disorder. Work past these issues in order to help with your recovery., Going to a support group will help you learn to listen to others. This will help you move beyond your own disorder and learn to connect to others. You will also learn how to better communicate with those around you because you will connect with them during every session. You can also learn from other's experiences, which will help you in your own recovery.Make sure that you listen closely to what people have to share when you attend support group meetings.

, Many people with eating disorders suffer from social anxiety disorders as well. Going to a support group will help you socialize more with others, but in a safe, supportive environment. This will help you face your socialization fears in a way that is less scary than out in the world. These situations will also help you become more confident in your self-worth as a person as you start connecting more to others.Try to hang around for a while after every meeting. Introduce yourself to people you have not met before and catch up with people you have already met. Ask how other people are doing and be honest about anything that is bothering you.
If you also have social anxiety, then being around people can be a challenge. You may need to work with your therapist to develop ways of handling your anxiety and feeling more comfortable around people.

, When you are learning to socialize again, it may be hard to open yourself up to others. Working with a support group to help with your eating disorder will allow you to start opening up to others again. You can learn to share your feelings with others and let people into your life again.When you share with your support group, be honest about how you are feeling. That will give your support group members a chance to help you in any way that they can. For example, if you have been struggling with weighing yourself multiple times each day, then support group members who have also struggled with the same thing may be able to offer helpful advice.

, Joining a support group is only one part of a successful treatment plan for eating disorders. You will also likely be working with a therapist in solo sessions to help you work through the issues that led to your disorder. You may also be receiving medical care that will help you move past your disorder, such as medicine or other medical treatments.It is important that you continue all forms of treatment in order to get better.

Try group cognitive behavioral therapy.,
Consider family based therapy.,
Take part in online support groups.",How to Join an Eating Disorder Support Group3," There are a few different types of group therapy that you can try in addition or instead of a support group. Group cognitive behavioral therapy in similar to the personal kind, but you work with others who are also suffering from eating disorders.In these sessions, you work with a therapist and the other members of the group to address your behaviors and feelings connected to your disorder, relearn healthy eating patterns, and learn management skills for your symptoms.
This is like a mixture of two different types of treatment.

, Family based therapy is a group therapy session with members of your family. In these sessions, your family learns help you achieve a healthy weight and restore healthy eating patterns. This type of therapy can be extremely helpful for teens working with their parents to get better., If you are not comfortable meeting with a group in person, you can attend online support groups for eating disorders. These can be helpful if you don’t live near any support group meetings. They can also be helpful if you feel uncomfortable around other people talking about your disorder. Just keep in mind that online support groups should be a complement to therapy or other professional treatments rather than a substitute for these treatments.These types of meetings can be video meetings, online chats, posts in chat rooms, or other similar electronic meetings.
There are many groups that are free, but some do cost money. These groups can also be open or closed groups. The closed groups require membership from the institution that hosts the session.

Present the health benefits of a vegetarian diet.,
Emphasize the positive aspects of vegetarianism.,
Mention that becoming vegetarian can save money.",How to Make a Case for Vegetarianism1," There is compelling scientific evidence that a plant-based diet, comprised of vegetables, legumes and whole grains is considerably healthier than the typical meat-eater's diet.This shows up in several different metrics that you can mention to make a strong case:



Life expectancy. Studies show that a vegetarian diet is linked to lower death rates and longer life expectancies.Geographical and historical studies have shown that societies with low meat consumption, such as those in the Russian Caucasus or the Hunzakuts of Pakistan, live considerably longer (generally over 80 years old) than societies (such as the Eskimos or the Greenlanders) that have the highest meat consumption in the world.Cancer. There is evidence to suggest that vegetarians have about half the cancer risk of meat-eaters.Red meant and processed meats like hot dogs, ham, sausages or bacon, in particular, have been labeled by the World Health Organization as carcinogenic to humans.Heart disease. Studies have shown that vegetarians have a lower risk of obesity and coronary heart disease.This is often attributed to the fact that vegetarian diets are generally lower in fat than non-vegetarian diets. However, evidence suggests that it is not just consuming less fat that lowers your risk of heart disease but that consuming more vegetables, legumes and whole grains can in itself decrease cholesterol levels, which is a primary indicator for coronary artery disease.;
, A vegetable-based diet can be delicious and nutritious, sufficient even for top athletes who burn a lot of calories and seek to build muscle.Emphasizing the positive aspects of vegetarianism, such as how it might increase well-being, is a good way to convince people rather than making them feel guilty about their choices.


Remind them that eating meat, at least in industrialized, developed countries, is no longer a necessity but an active choice with ethical and environmental consequences.
Acknowledge that eating is an intimate act, laden with social meaning and tied up with deeply-held ideas about pleasure and comfort. Changing habits is not easy, but it can happen. Many people actually report losing their appetite and desire for meat over a period of time.Terms like ""conscious"" or ""compassionate"" eating may be more appealing to some people as they emphasize the positive consequences of making certain food choices rather than requiring them to fit into the strict category of being ""vegetarian""., Meat is expensive and is generally the highest priced item on grocery bills. A recently published study suggests that vegetarians can save at least $750 per year by avoiding meat."

Detox or fast.,
Drink lots of water.,
Find out your BMI (Body, mass, index), so you can find what diet works for you.

,
Decide on which type of vegetarian you want to be.,
Remember your body needs calcium, protein, iron, vitamin B12 etc.,
Try to get beans, rice, veggies, fruits, nuts, seeds etc into your diet.

,
Try to exercise at least 15 minutes a day, even if you're not vegan or vegetarian.

,
Try to buy organic/natural foods.,
Consider Vitamin B12 supplements.",How to Have a Balanced Vegan/Vegetarian Diet," Detoxing before going vegan or vegetarian is a good idea. It helps get rid of extra waste,and free your body from toxins from your previous diet.;
, Water helps cleanse your body. Try to drink half your body weight in ounces(example, 100 lbs, 50 ounces).

,, There are Pescatarians, who eat no meat with the exception of fish. There are Flexitarians, who eat mostly vegetarian but eat meat occasionally. There are Lacto-Ovo Vegetarians, who do not eat animal flesh of any kind, but they eat eggs and dairy.


Vegans eat only plant food. They do not eat any animal foods, including fish, eggs, dairy products, and honey. Vegans not only omit all animal products from their diets, but they also eliminate them from the rest of their life. Vegans use nothing from animals, such as leather, wool, and silk.
Raw Vegans eats unprocessed vegan foods that have not been heated above 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius). They believe that foods cooked above this temperature have lost a significant amount of their nutritional value and are harmful to the body.
The macrobiotic diet includes unprocessed vegan foods, such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and the occasional consumption of fish. Sugar and refined oils are avoided. The most unique qualifier of the macrobiotic diet is its emphasis on the consumption of Asian vegetables, such as daikon, and sea vegetables, like seaweed

, It might be a good idea to take supplements/vitamins.

,,, Make sure if you're going to buy organic you read the back of the package, sometimes food is only 70% organic, and make sure it says USDA Organic on the front.

, National recommendations for B12 intakes vary significantly from country to country. The US recommended intake is 2.4 mcgs a day for ordinary adults rising to 2.8 mcgs for nursing mothers. The German recommendation is 3 mcgs a day. Recommended intakes are usually based on 50% absorption, as this is typical for small amounts from foods. To meet the US and German recommendations you need to obtain sufficient B12 to absorb 1.5 mcgs per day on average. This amount should be sufficient to avoid even the initial signs of inadequate B12 intake, such as slightly elevated homocysteine and MMA levels, in most people. Even slightly elevated homocysteine is associated with increased risk of many health problems including heart disease in adults, preeclampsia during pregnancy and neural tube defects in babies.So Remember to get your daily dose of vitamin B12. And remember to be happy and try to have a happy lifestyle.

Urge them to consider the negative effect that meat-eating has on the environment.,
Draw attention to the unsustainable nature of industrialized meat production.,
Point out issues of efficiency and food scarcity.",How to Make a Case for Vegetarianism2," It is well documented that meat production is environmentally troubling in several ways.



Greenhouse gas emissions. A UN report determined that meat production accounts for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions, primarily methane released from livestock agriculture.Methane is a particularly problematic greenhouse gas because its impact on climate change is more than 20 times that of carbon dioxide.Deforestation. The expansion of pastures for livestock, and particularly cattle-ranching, accounts for 80% of the overall deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest.This has serious ecological consequences like loss of biodiversity, soil degradation and increased carbon dioxide emissions.Pollutants. Giant livestock farms housing high volumes of pigs, cows, or chickens can generate a massive amount of waste equivalent to that of a small city. These farms have been linked to high levels of nitrates in drinking water which can increase the risk of methemoglobinemia or ""blue-baby syndrome."", While one person's decision to stop eating meat will not have a direct impact on the meat industry, taken as a whole, the current meat production system is deeply unsustainable. Not eating meat can be a positive choice not to support this system.


Intensive animal farming uses up resources faster than they can be replaced. For example, meat production has a considerably lower energy return ratio (food energy per fossil energy expended) than food plant crops.This mode of agriculture has consequences for both the treatment of animals and the health of humans. On meat farms, the animals are often closely packed together, without access to fresh air and are bred to grow unnaturally fast and large for the purposes of maximizing meat.In these conditions diseases spread quickly. Antibiotics are used widely, which can in turn enter the food chain and promote antibiotic resistance in humans., Raising an animal for slaughter requires considerably more grain, water, and land than simply growing grains and vegetables for direct human consumption.


Given the current situation of food insecurity and the estimated 795 million of the world's population who are undernourished,some ecologists believe that the increased yield of grain could be enough to save millions of people from starvation each year."

Ask them to consider the question of animal rights.,
Articulate a strong desire to avoid unnecessary suffering.,
Respond skillfully to common counter-arguments.",How to Make a Case for Vegetarianism3," There is broad agreement that human beings have certain inviolable rights, such as the right to life and the right not to be killed, yet the question of whether non-human animals also share these rights remains an open philosophical question. Nonetheless there are a few arguments you can reference.


Some philosophers argue that animals also have a right to life, which humans violate when they kill animals for food, especially given that such killing is not necessary for human flourishing. Animal rights activists and philosophers use the term ""speciesism,"" to refer to the human disregard for the interests of non-human animals. Many philosophers argue that this is morally unjustifiable., Similar to the question of animal rights is the principle that killing animals for food, particularly as we do in the current system of meat production, constitutes unnecessary cruelty.


Animals are sentient beings who are aware that they are alive and can be said to have consciousness. A prominent group of cognitive neuroscientists supported this with The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness in 2012.Therefore, they also experience suffering. This suffering is unnecessary and cruel, because humans can survive and indeed thrive off of a diet consisting of only plant materials.
Furthermore, vegetation that produces crops (i.e. fruits, vegetables, grains and legumes) will rot or otherwise go unused if not imminently consumed. This involves no loss of life whereas the consumption of animals involves the premature termination of their lives.

, There are several common arguments that those in favor of eating meat will bring up. Here's some ways to respond to them.



Eating meat is natural. Both vegetarians and non-vegetarians use arguments about nature to support their position.The fact that there is evidence to support both conclusions shows just how open to interpretation apparently ""natural"" facts may be.Question why we make such appeals to nature. Current evidence suggests that most people in modern societies (who do not need to eat meat out of necessity) can live healthy and sustainable lives without eating meat.
We might conclude that the current norms about eating meat are historically and socially conditioned. Indeed they vary considerably from culture to culture.The choice whether or not to eat meat therefore unfolds within a particular cultural and social context, and it is not just a question of doing what is natural.

"
"
Stand firm in your beliefs.,
Let your friends and family know how you feel and why you want to transition into a vegetarian lifestyle.,
Realize that eating animals is deeply embedded as the norm within most societies, so your choice to not do this is somewhat of a challenge.,
Give your family the nutritional data.,
Realize that part of the reason why your loved ones might be concerned stems from the worry that the change might affect your relationships in some way.",How to Handle Well Meaning Friends and Family when You Decide to Be a Vegetarian," Be sure as to why being vegetarian counts for you. When you decide to become a vegetarian, some of your family and friends may not understand or agree with why you're choosing this lifestyle. If you're not sure yourself then it may be possible to be persuaded out of it.
, By doing this they will either soften up to you or at least learn to accept and adjust to your new lifestyle., You may not see it this way, and many do not see it this way openly, but it's a subconscious kick to be made aware of the choices we make about the food we eat. This can be confronting for many people, who would rather not think about the actions that lead to meat upon their plate. This is not about denigrating them; it's about reminding yourself that you represent a way of living that is conscious about these aspects and it can unsettle some people., A lot of people still assume that being a vegetarian is not healthy and causes malnutrition or a loss of energy. This is usually due to ignorance of being vegan, so to ease your family's fears explain to them that the lifestyle is completely healthy. Moreover, realize that many people are sorely lacking in knowing whether or not their own diet, meat included, is healthy. Gently enlighten them on healthy eating in general.

This can be a great opportunity to encourage everyone to focus on their diet, relying on reliable sources of information rather than snippets of generalized wisdom garnered from women's magazines or breakfast TV shows.
Be wary of exhortations to eat such and such from well-meaning but ill-informed relatives. Stay polite but don't let it get to you; realize that you've done your research and it's probable that they haven't.

, Be sure to reassure them that this isn't the case and that you're not judging them.

Always make sure if your hosting a dinner make sure you cook or order in some meats for your family and friends to enjoy. On top of preparing a good meal for your family, it shows them that you care.

If you get discouraged, remember how badly animals are treated, how poverty is exacerbated by high level meat production and how the environment can benefit from less meat eating.,
If you cheat, realize that it's not the end of the world!,
Meet other vegans.,
Congratulate yourself.,
Try new foods.",How to Go Vegan Without Making Yourself Miserable," There are many good reasons to become vegan and there are some bad reasons. Bad reasons include wanting to impress a crush or keeping skinny. Good reasons include:


Caring about animal welfare
Caring about world poverty and the use of grain for feeding livestock over people (a highly inefficient transfer of energy), plus additional methane output from beef cattle etc.






Caring about your health; some diseases are thought to be put into the fast track by meat consumption and some illnesses are exacerbated by meat and animal product consumption






Being a compassionate, sensitive person who simply cannot abide the thought of eating meat.





;
, Rid yourself of one thing every week. For example, week one, no pork. Week two, no beef, and so on. Continue from meat to eggs to dairy to honey until you have reduced the non-vegan elements to nothing.*tip* Buy frozen vegetables for when you're running low on time. Lots of different options, but read the ingredients to be sure!

, It is really important to replace the items that you are removing from your diet with healthy and delicious alternatives. Meat analogs are one example, as are non-dairy milks such as nut, soy, and oat milks. There are soy and rice cheeses, soy whipped cream and egg replacements made from grains and vegetables. There is pectin to replace gelatin and many other things that you can still have, just different versions.

, Perhaps elements of health problems that you have been experiencing have eased too. Consider good things rather than bad things about your lifestyle change.

, In fact, it is just the beginning, as you start to try new foods and open your mind to a new range of possibilities. If you do error, apologize to yourself and move on to the original plan to keep veganizing your way of life. Just enjoy your food and start again each time. Also realize that sometimes there is a real need to err, such as for the sake of being diplomatic in family or other relations, when traveling, when sick, pregnant, etc. Always considering falling back on the hierarchy of vegan -> lacto-vegetarian -> ovo-lacto vegetarian -> pescatarian -> omnivore choices in that order if you have to err for any good reason. And don't beat yourself up; tomorrow is always a new day.

, It is important to see thriving, healthy and happy vegans doing what you are doing. Join a club, get to meet more vegans and share stories, recipes and ideas.

, Every day. Even on days you cheat. Realize that a vegan diet, although kinder, is extremely difficult but it is possible and soon becomes so second nature that you will wonder why the transition felt difficult. You'll survive, along with the 90 animals a year that you are choosing not to eat.

, Just because you aren't eating animal products doesn't mean that you have to deprive yourself. There are many delicious vegan foods out there, so use going vegan as an excuse to expand your palate and try new (vegan) foods and see which ones you like best. You may just be surprised.

Choose a vegetarian-friendly destination.,
Learn the lingo.,
Request a vegetarian in-flight meal.,
Research restaurants before you arrive.,
Pack vegetarian-friendly snacks.,
Figure out how to tactfully decline non-vegetarian food.",How to Travel As a Vegetarian1," You might not always be able to choose your travel destinations, especially if you are traveling for work or with others. If you do, however, have a say in where you go, pick a place where the fare is vegetarian-friendly. For example, India, Thailand, and Israel are known as vegetarian-friendly destinations.Do some online research to find out what locations are vegetarian-friendly.;
, You will need to be able to communicate your dietary needs to restaurant and airline staff during your travels. You should be able to ask, “Is this dish vegetarian?” and “I am a vegetarian” in the local language. You should also learn the local words for fish, chicken, beef, and pork. This will help you easily glance over a menu and eliminate dishes with these ingredients., If the airline on which you are traveling provides in-flight meals, it is important that you request a vegetarian option long before you board the flight. In many cases, you will be given meal options when you book your flight. If not, contact the airline directly and make sure they will be able to provide you with a vegetarian meal during your flight., Traveling while vegetarian will be much easier if you take the time to research restaurants in your travel destination before you arrive. Peruse guidebooks, talk to friends who previously traveled to the destination, and do some online research. Make a list of restaurants you will visit along with their addresses and hours of operation., Sometimes travel doesn’t go as planned. You might end up stranded in an airport or searching for a vegetarian restaurant only to find it is closed! You can avert disaster by packing portable vegetarian foods like nuts, protein bars, dried fruit, or peanut butter., There is a good chance that someone will offer you non-vegetarian food on your travels. Learn how to tactfully decline the offer using the local language and taking local customs into account. Learn to say, “Thank you, but I do not eat meat,” in the local language. If you speak the same language as the host or server, you can also explain why you do not eat meat.

If you are afraid of offending the host or server, you can always accept the food and give it to your travel partner or to someone in need.

Try a vegetarian restaurant app.,
Give street food a chance.,
Book a room with kitchen access.,
Try a translation app.,
Be flexible.",How to Travel As a Vegetarian2," You can find vegetarian options in your travel destination with the help of an app designed with vegetarians in mind. Apps like Happy Cow will recommend vegetarian restaurants as well as meat-serving restaurants that offer good vegetarian options. You can also use an app like Foursquare, which flags restaurants as vegetarian-friendly., In many places, street food is vegetarian. This means there might be multiple vegetarian dinner options available from street vendors. Take, for example, Central America. In Guatemala, you can get a cheap, delicious vegetarian options like papusas, empanadas, and rellenitos in most cities., Cooking your own food means you will have control over the ingredients and can rest assured your meals are vegetarian. Try booking a hotel, hostel, or homestay that will give you access to a kitchen. Try staying close to a market or grocery store to make shopping as effortless as possible., If you are traveling to a foreign country, you will undoubtedly come across menu items with which you are unfamiliar. Try using a digital translator, like Google Translate, iTranslate, or Waygo, to help you decode the dish and its ingredients. This might very well save you from an unintended mouthful of meat!, Traveling as a vegetarian can be challenging, but it is important that you remain flexible. Not all places you choose to dine will have the best vegetarian options, and you will need to be flexible about what you eat. For example, if you end up at a restaurant where the only option is salad and bread, you will need to be okay with the meal."

There are many reasons why people become vegetarians, and remembering the reason you gave up meat may help you stay motivated and steer clear of it in the future.


Think about what made you want to give up meat in the first place. Was it a realization that meat comes from animals, a trip to a local farm, or a religious conversion?
Find a way to remind yourself of that reason whenever you feel tempted to eat meat again. For example, you might keep a photograph of a cow on your cell phone or in your wallet.
If you gave up meat for religious reasons, try talking to a spiritual guide or authority figure whenever you feel tempted to eat meat. They may be able to help keep you on the path you've chosen for yourself.;
, Though in its basic sense vegetarianism is the avoidance of meat and meat products, there are several different types of vegetarians. Some vegetarians eat seafood, some eat dairy, still others eat eggs, while some combine various elements into their own unique dietary plan.The most common types of vegetarians include:


Ovo-vegetarian - eats eggs but will not consume dairy products or any meat, fish, poultry, or seafood
Lacto-Ovo vegetarian - consumes dairy products and eggs but will not eat meat, fish, or poultry
Pescatarian - eats fish but will not consume meat, poultry, dairy, or eggs
Pollotarian - avoids meat, dairy, and fish, but will consume poultry

, Many products that seem vegetarian contain animal products. For example, many types of cheese contain rennet, a digestive enzyme from a cow's stomach.The cow must be killed to harvest these enzymes.Gelatin is another non-vegetarian food ingredient. It is made from the bones, ligaments, tendons, and skin of animals.Checking the ingredients list can help you avoid foods that contain animal products.
There may be a number of alternatives available instead of a given animal product. For example, many cheese makers now use alternatives to traditional rennet, including microbial and plant-based rennet.

, Just because something doesn't contain meat, it doesn't make it healthy. Cheese pizza, french fries, and soda are all technically vegetarian, but a diet built around these foods and beverages can leave you malnourished and overweight. When you choose to impose dietary restrictions on yourself, it's imperative that you plan your diet to ensure your health and wellbeing.Focus on eating as many fruits, vegetables, and whole grains as you can.
Choose good fats (like the fats you get from nuts or olive oil) instead of saturated and trans fats. Good fats are much more heart healthy and are part of a balanced diet.

, Vegetables are the backbone of any plant-based diet. You probably already eat a lot of veggies, but as a vegetarian, you may need to eat even more to ensure that you get enough vitamins and minerals. Work with a dietitian to put together a meal plan that works best for you.2.5 cups of vegetables each day
1.5 cups of dark green vegetables each week
5.5 cups of red and orange vegetables each week

, Just because you don't eat meat, it doesn't mean you're out of luck when it comes to protein. There are many options available for vegetarians and vegans that don't involve any animal products.Some common sources of protein include:


legumes (beans, lentils, and peas)
soy products (tofu and tempeh)
seitan
nuts and seeds
whole grains

, If you aren't getting enough of a given vitamin or mineral from your diet, you may need to take supplements. Always talk to your doctor or a dietitian before taking any supplements. You may be able to get these vitamins and minerals on your own by changing what you eat, or your doctor may have other recommendations.Choose supplements that are derived from plants to avoid accidentally ingesting any animal products.
Vitamins B-12 and D are two of the most common vitamins that vegetarians need to take supplements for. You may also need to take iron and/or zinc supplements, depending on your diet.

, Portion control is an important component of any dietary plan, including plant-based diets.When you're on a plant-based diet, you will need to limit certain foods like pasta while increasing your portions of others, such as vegetables.


Use visual cues. For example, a whole vegetable (like a bell pepper) or a portion of chopped vegetables that equals the size of a baseball is approximately one serving size of vegetable.Eat a variety of vegetables and multiple servings. You don't have to limit the amount of vegetables that you eat, but you should be aware of how many portions that you're eating to make sure that you get enough.
Limit your carbohydrate intake. A single serving of carbs (like cooked whole-grain pasta) should be about the size of a hockey puck, or approximately 1/3 to 1/2 a cup.Dairy is a staple of many vegetarian diets, but it can be high in calories. Limit yourself to three servings of dairy each day., Eating foods that look and taste familiar can make your transition to a vegetarian diet easier and less jarring. Use vegetarian/vegan ""meat"" alternatives, as well as nuts, grains, beans, and fresh vegetables, to recreate some of your favorite meals. You can make modifications to recipes you already cook, or search online or in a cookbook for something you've never made before., Many people consider breakfast to be the most important meal of the day, and that still holds true for vegetarians. There are many options available, depending on how large and hearty of a meal you want.


You can use tofu instead of eggs to make a stir-fry or scramble. Just drain a block of tofu, mash it with a fork, and fry it like you would cook scrambled eggs. Mix in vegetables to boost your nutritional content.You can serve it with fruit or a side of hashbrowns.
Buy and cook vegetarian or vegan ""breakfast sausage,"" then cook it in a skillet or microwave like traditional breakfast sausage.Serve your ""sausage"" with breakfast potatoes sauteed with veggies.
Blend your favorite fruits, vegetables, and juices together to make a delicious, nutritious smoothie.Use soft tofu, protein powder, or dairy to boost the protein content of your smoothie.

, What you eat for lunch can make or break the rest of your afternoon. A meal that has too much fat or sugar will leave you tired and sluggish, while a meal that's chock full of vegetables is more likely to give you the energy you need for the remainder of the day.


Salads are a great way to fill up on vegetarian and vegan foods. Toss in as many vegetables as you like.
Quinoa is a great food for vegetarians and vegans alike. It's completely free of meat and dairy products and it's very nutritious., Dinner options are plentiful for vegetarians. You can decide how light or heavy or a meal you want, as well as what types of foods you want to incorporate.


Buy frozen, vegetarian ""fish"" cutlets, then prepare them with french fries for a tasty, seafood-free alternative to fish and chips.Marinate a portabello mushroom cap in balsamic vinegar with whatever spices you like. Then grill it up, put it on a toasted bun, and enjoy your delicious portabello ""burger.""Make a vegetarian chilli using meat-free ""beef"" crumbles, or simply load your chilli up with vegetables and beans., Snacks are a great way to keep your stomach full and your body fueled between meals. There are plenty of options for vegetarians. You can get as creative as you want, or stick with a classic like fresh vegetables and a tasty dip.


Make mini-burrito ""roll ups"" by rolling cheese, spinach, salsa, and refried beans in a large tortilla, then cutting it into smaller servings for easy snacking.
You can make an easy guacamole dip to eat with chips and veggies, or use it as a spread on your favorite sandwich. Mash up some avocados, then add tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste.Cook up your own mini pizza bites by cutting mini-bagels in half and spreading pizza sauce, cheese , and any veggies or meat alternatives you like. Then pop them in the microwave until the cheese is melted and enjoy., Protein is an important part of every vegetarian and vegans' diet, but if you exercise you may need even more protein. Many nutritionists specifically recommend loading up on protein before and after an intense workout session to help fuel your body through your exercise routine and help it recover afterward.Aim to get approximately 10 grams of protein. For best results, pair a protein with a carb. For example, you could eat an apple with 2 tbs of peanut butter.
Choose good protein sources like soy-based foods, quinoa, or both.
A good post-workout snack would be a glass of soymilk, a soy protein shake, or a soy-based yogurt cup.
You can reach your nutritional needs with both complete proteins and complimentary proteins.

See your doctor.,
Decide how much you need according to age.,
Be reassured rather than worried about this aspect of your diet.,
Consume foods fortified with vitamin B12.,
Be aware that most plant based foods claimed to contain B12 have not been proven over time to be sufficient.There are lists circulating around online but by the time you've checked and double-checked them, and found massive contradictions between them all, it quickly becomes very confusing.,
Check the labels.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Get Vitamin B12 if You're a Vegan," It can be a good idea to get a blood test to see what levels of B12 you have before trying supplements. Depending on the results, you may need shots, tablets or capsules, or fortified foods to change your levels, or you may be just fine but need to keep an eye on your future health and B12 levels to ensure that they don't fall.


Talk to your doctor about possible options but recognise that unless your doctor is sympathetic to your choice of diet, you may be given information that doesn't suit your dietary choices or that even suggests you are not healthy. If that's the case, look for a new doctor who will take your veganism into account objectively and work with you, not against you.;
, Vitamin B12 is considered to require a higher dosage for older persons than for younger persons:


2 micrograms a day for young people
25 micrograms or more per day for people over 50.The Vegan Society makes a general recommendation of 10mg per day with a once-weekly B12 supplement perhaps of 2000mg but fails to provide an indication of age appropriateness.

, You will read a lot of opinions promising you that it isn't possible to get ""proper"" B12 from plant food sources and that you're doomed to dementia, anemia, or something worse.That kind of dramatic conclusion can either lead to you rebelling and not bothering to do anything at all, or worrying too much that your balanced, healthy diet is not good for you. When you know already that it is. The reality is that B12 is in many fortified foods that you can consume and it's actually a very rare deficiency.


The amounts of vitamin B12 thought to be needed for good health would be hard to get from food alone, and it is thought that it is better absorbed from supplements anyway.Just be sure to find dairy and animal-derivative free supplements from a reputable supplier.
Don't be complacent, however. Being reassured is about knowing that if you actively care for your body's nutrient needs, then it will be a lot better than neglecting them. Vitamin B12 is important for your brain, nervous system, and red blood cells. And the risk for deficiency increases as you age., There is a range of food available, although it varies from country to country. Always read the ingredients and if you're not sure, contact the supplier or the manufacturer for concise nutritional information. Some items that may be fortified with B12 include:



Soy milks, and other non-dairy milks
Energy bars like Clif and Luna
Cereals
Brewer's yeast and nutritional yeasts but only if fortifiedYeast spreads, such as Marmite. If you don't like the taste, you can just put a small spoonful in sauces or other foods to hide the taste. Yeast flakes are the same but a little harder to find (they add a great, nutty, maybe even cheesy, taste to any food) but well worth the investment - a box will last you ages.

Note that Vegemite does not contain B12.


Vegan food products from the health food store
Tofu
Vitamin water

, If you really believe a food has B12 in it and it's good for you generally, it can't hurt to eat the food but be sure to still have the other supplement sources in your diet.

, Although the list above contains obvious fortified products, they may not be fortified, so read the label before assuming that it is.

, Doctors offices can give you vaccines to give you more B12. The shots are intramuscular. They're painful if you don't enjoy that kind of thing. Try the supplements first if you're really low, with your doctor's advice naturally, and see if things improve and if not, brace yourself."

Think about the conditions animals live in.",How to Switch from Vegetarian to Vegan," As a vegetarian, you're probably used to cooking and eating ""mock"" meats and other meat alternatives, which are designed to replicate the taste and texture of real meat. Dairy alternatives are no different. They're designed and perfected to replicate the taste and consistency of your favorite dairy products, and many of them taste convincingly similar to the real thing.Try soy milk, almond milk, cashew milk, coconut milk, or hemp milk as a dairy-free alternative to real milk.
Vegan cheeses come in a number of flavors and styles, including cheddar, mozzarella, havarti, ricotta, and cream cheese. These are often made from nuts, so make sure you check if you have a sensitivity to nuts.
Non-dairy butter alternatives are available at most grocery stores. These can be purchased in sticks or in tubs for cooking and spreading on your favorite foods.
You can also buy vegan yogurt and vegan ice cream at many retailers.;
, Eggs can be tricky to substitute; however, there are some commercially-available egg replacements, such as Ener-G brand products.You can also substitute an egg with a number of vegan options when you're cooking or baking, all of which can be found at most grocery stores. Some common alternatives include:


Half a banana, mashed
Applesauce
Tofu
Flax seeds and water put through a blender

, Giving up dairy and eggs doesn't necessarily mean you have to give up your favorite dishes. There are many ways to recreate the vegetarian dishes you love with vegan ingredients. All you need to do is substitute dairy-free products for real milk and cheese, and your dishes will taste almost identical.When you first switch over to a vegan diet, it may be helpful to try out vegan versions of familiar recipes. This may help make the transition smoother, as your meals will taste largely the same.
Trying out vegan versions of the dishes you enjoy may help you decide whether or not to switch if you're still on the fence.

, You don't have to travel two towns over to an all-natural cooperative to find vegan food. Most large-chain grocery stores have vegan options, and they're usually stocked with the produce, near dairy products, or in the natural food section.If you're not sure where your grocery store stocks their vegan cheese and dairy-free spreads, ask a store clerk.
If they don't currently carry such products, try petitioning the store to expand their selection or visit another grocery store.

, Like any lifestyle change, becoming a vegan may take some time to adjust to. It's okay if you slip up every now and then, especially when you're just making the transition to a vegan diet. Think of becoming a vegan as a shift or evolution of your lifestyle, and remember that that shift may take you longer than it takes other people.It can take time to adjust to the changes you're making, so don't feel frustrated with yourself if you have cravings or slip up at first.
Whatever your reason for going vegan, keep it in mind as you make changes. Write it down and hang it on your fridge as a reminder of why you are making this diet and lifestyle change.

, Many food additives and ingredients are derived from animals, so it's important that you familiarize yourself with common additives/ingredients and check the packaging of foods very carefully.Some common animal byproducts include:


Bone char (used to turn sugar white)
Casein/caseinate (milk protein)
Gelatin (protein derived from the skin, ligaments, and bones of cows and pigs)
L-cysteine (amino acid frequently derived from duck feathers and used in some breads and baked goods)
Stearic acid (fat derived from cattle, sheep, and sometimes from euthanized cats and dogs)
Vitamin B-12 (often derived from animals, though plant-based options are available)
Vitamin D (often derived from animals, fish, dairy, and eggs, though plant-based options are available)
Whey (a component of milk)

, You may not think of alcoholic beverages as being vegan or not vegan, but many beers and wines contain or are made with non-vegan ingredients and processing agents.If you're old enough to drink alcohol and you want to adhere to a vegan diet, you may want to familiarize yourself with which beverages are suitable for you.


Some beers directly contain non-vegan ingredients like dairy and honey.
Some manufacturers of wine and beer use isinglass (derived from a fish's swim bladder), gelatin, and egg whites as filtering agents.
You can search online directories like barnivore to find out about your favorite beers and wines, or check out P.E.T.A.'s list of vegan-friendly beers., Many clothing products are made with non-vegan ingredients. Part of living a vegan lifestyle includes avoiding clothing made with animal products. Before you purchase a new garment, take a look at the label to see what materials that item is made with. Some reliably vegan components are cotton, polyester, rayon, denim, synthetic down, faux fur, faux leather, and any other materials listed as ""synthetic.""Common non-vegan clothing components to avoid include:


Fur
Down
Leather
Suede
Alligator skin
Snakeskin
Kangaroo skin
Silk
Wool

, If you are thinking about getting a tattoo and want to be a strict vegan, it's important to know that even tattoo ink can be made with non-vegan ingredients.If you want to get a vegan tattoo, it's a good idea to call the tattoo parlor you're considering to ask. You can also check their website, as some locations will list online whether or not they use vegan inks.


Bone char, glycerin (derived from animal fat), gelatin, and shellac (from crushed beetles) are all common ingredients in tattoo ink.
Vegan-friendly inks use vegetable glycerine instead of animal-based sources. They also use natural, plant-based dyes and pigments.
Some well-known brands of vegan ink include Eternal Ink, StarBrite, SkinCandy, and Stable Color.
Be aware that even the razor an artist uses to shave your skin before giving you a tattoo may be made with a glycerine-based gel strip.
Many tattoo after-care products are made with animal byproducts as well. Be sure to check the ingredients before you purchase these items.

, In addition to directly containing some animal products, many cosmetics are tested on animals for safety. These tests can lead to lab animals being poisoned, blinded, burned, or even killed.Search online to see if your favorite cosmetic products are vegan. You can also check P.E.T.A.'s website, as they list a number of animal-friendly cosmetic products.

, While many manufacturers specify that their products are a vegan-friendly version of your favorite foods, some foods that you currently eat are already vegan without directly appealing to a vegan audience.If you're ever unsure about a given snack food, you can always check its ingredients list or search for that item online.


Most potato chips and tortilla chips are vegan, unless they contain some type of cheese/dairy flavoring.
Triscuits, Wheat Thins, saltine crackers, and graham crackers (but not honey graham crackers) are typically vegan, though certain varieties/flavors may not be.
Many granola bars are vegan, although some contain honey.
Oreo cookies, some ""gummy"" candies like Sour Patch Kids and Swedish Fish, and many mints and gums are vegan.

, If you're just switching over, you might be worried about your ability to commit to a vegan lifestyle over a long period of time. Like most dietary changes, it gets easier as you grow accustomed to those changes. One thing that may give you some comfort, though, is that as a vegan you're statistically less likely to revert back to a meat-based diet than vegetarians are.You may have felt tempted to take a bite of a meat dish when you were only avoiding meat.
Once you start avoiding any animal products, you're that much farther removed from temptation.
If you find yourself struggling, remember the reasons why you gave up meat in the first place and know that you're even farther from your previous diet and lifestyle as a vegan.

, A vegan diet puts you at lower risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, obesity, gallstones, and dementia.The beneficial impact on your overall heath can help you stay committed to your decision to be vegan., Perhaps the best motivator to stay strong as a vegan is the thought of what animals go through to meet the culinary needs of humans. By living a committed vegan lifestyle, you're helping to remove yourself from participation in an industry that exploits, mistreats, and sometimes tortures living animals.Even outside of large-scale ""factory farms,"" most dairy cows live unpleasant lives.
When a dairy cow gets too old or sick to produce milk, she is often sent to the slaughter house.
Even free-range or cage-free chickens suffer tremendously, as they're usually purchased from the same hatcheries as regular chickens. Since male chicks are considered useless, they're killed by the hatcheries — often by being ground up alive or suffocated."

Start slowly.,
Eat some honey.,
Try some vegetarian foods that have animal milk or eggs.,
Slowly reintroduce meat to your diet.,
Accept your new diet and lifestyle.,
Consult a doctor if you have concerns about your overall health.",How to Quit Being a Vegan1," If you haven't eaten any animal products for your entire life (or even for several years) suddenly consuming meat and dairy products can make you sick. Any time you introduce a dramatic change into your gut flora, your body will take time to adjust.You could experience bloating and discomfort for a few days after ending your vegan diet.


If veganism was a big part of your life, giving it up can be hard. Make the change easy on yourself by adjusting slowly into a standard diet.
Introduce one food at a time per week as you reintroduce animal-based products. That way if you have intolerances or issues that persist, you will be able to pinpoint the food you added in that caused the symptoms.;
, Honey is gentle on the digestive system and can easily be incorporated into oatmeal, tea, or baked goods. Bringing honey back into your diet will officially take you off the vegan wagon, but you’re unlikely to notice any difference in your health or condition since it has few to no negative health effects associated with it., Scrambled eggs on toast is a delicious snack, night or day. Cereal or oatmeal can be prepared easily when you’re on the go, or headed out the door in the morning. Muffins, cakes, and pies often utilize milk and/or eggs in a form which is gentle on the digestive tract. Try baking some of your favorite baked goods with cow’s milk.

, Anecdotal evidence suggests that trying a small portion of meat as a topping on salad, or a few slices of ham in a sandwich, is the best way to reintroduce yourself to meat. If you wish, after a week or so, you can transition to more substantial portions of meat like chicken breast and hamburgers.


If you feel sick, remember not to push yourself. Your body’s digestive powers vary with the type and quantity of food consumed.

, Transitioning away from a diet you may have believed was the one true path can be hard. You might be made to feel guilty, or experience shame due to the perception you’ve “lapsed” or let yourself down. While it’s understandable to be sad about letting part of your identity go, think of it instead as a new beginning. Remember, the right choices for your health now aren’t necessarily the same as the choices you made when you became vegan. Find the balance that’s right for your health and lifestyle.


Don’t feel like you’re alone when you revert to eating meat. A recent study found that fully 84% of vegetarians, including vegans, end up eating meat again at some point., Doctors can draw blood, measure cholesterol, and run other tests that provide more information than you can access on your own. If your medical benchmark scores have improved or worsened, your doctor will let you know, and you’ll then be better-informed about what diet is right for you.

Consider alternatives to quitting veganism.,
Consider going vegetarian.,
Consider getting free-range meat.,
Consider eating wild animals.,
Consider eating a pescetarian diet.Pescetarianism, in its classical form, is a dietary regimen in which you eat no eggs, no dairy, no animal products of any kind, except fish.",How to Quit Being a Vegan2," Before you decide to quit veganism, make sure you’re truly ready. Maybe consuming a few dairy products or egg products while you're at friends' houses or restaurants would work for you. Maybe eating only baked goods once a day is a compromise you can live with. If only dessert time is a challenge, carry some vegan chocolate bars with you so you always have a vegan option when you want something sweet.


So-called “flexitarian” diets allow you to maintain a primarily vegan or vegetarian lifestyle with a few “cheater” meals or snacks thrown in to keep you sane., If you have been vegan for a long time, it may be hard to eat meat in addition to milk, eggs, and other animal-based products. Vegetarians, unlike vegans, are permitted all these things. Perhaps you began, as many vegans do, as a vegetarian. With this diet, you’d still be meat-free and avoid the associated health risks with meat consumption. Try moving back to vegetarianism to see if it’s right for you.


Vegetarians are more successful at meeting their daily protein requirements as they have more protein-rich options.

, Free-range meat is produced outside the traditional factory farm system and allows animals to have freedom of movement, social interaction with others of their kind, and sometimes even enjoy fresh air outside. If you initially became vegan because you were disgusted by the factory farm system, you might try getting free-range meat and dairy products. Urban farms are good places to find free-range eggs, meat, and dairy. Check local farmers markets or contact your local farms directly.
Certified Humane maintains an authoritative list of humanely produced meat here: http://certifiedhumane.org/whos-certified/.

, If you kill and eat animals you’ve personally hunted, you’ll at least know that they lived a free life in the wild before they died. These are animals which might easily have been victim of bears or other wild animals. Hunting and eating them isn’t malicious; rather, it fulfills the natural circle of life. Like free-range meat, eating animals which have been hunted in the wild may relieve some of the ethical pressure associated with giving up veganism., Varieties of the pescetarian diet permit combinations of fish and eggs or fish and dairy. The diet is a variety of vegetarianism/veganism and shares many of its health benefits.

Read some accounts of what it’s like to quit veganism.,
Recognize when your perspective has changed.,
Recognize when you aren’t eating the food you want.,
Consider your culture.,
Consider your work life.",How to Quit Being a Vegan3," If you decide veganism isn’t for you, you’re not alone. There are plenty of others out there just like you who, for whatever reason, decided the vegan way was not for them. Using your favorite internet search engine, search for a phrase like “leaving veganism” or “I quit being vegan.” Reading accounts and thinking about the experiences of others who have felt like veganism was too much for them might help you reach a positive decision for yourself. If you find you empathize with their perspectives, perhaps you’re ready to quit being vegan, too.

, Ask yourself why you began eating a vegan diet in the first place and if you still hold the same beliefs. Have your beliefs changed around factory farming or the consumption of meat and animal products? If so, veganism may no longer resonate with your values, and you might wish to resume eating the standard omnivorous diet.


Perhaps you became a vegan because you are against factory farming. You may choose to eat only animal products that are confirmed free-range and humanely slaughtered. In this case, you may be able to marry your beliefs about the humane treatment of animals with eating meat.

, The lack of satisfaction might take many forms. Perhaps you salivate at the sight or smell of bacon. Perhaps you have cravings for meat or even vegetarian foods.Or maybe you feel bad when you’re out with friends and the only thing on the menu that’s vegan is fries and a salad.


If you were raised vegan and have never tried meat, dairy, fish, or eggs, you might wonder what you’re missing. Try branching out with some non-vegan foods to see if an omnivorous diet might be for you.
Just because you aren’t happy with the food you’re eating doesn’t necessarily require that you give up veganism. Maybe you just haven’t found the kind of vegan foods you like yet.
Suggest a vegan restaurant to your friends next time you go out. Don’t feel ashamed or bad for making your friends accommodate you — they’re your friends and will be happy to do so! Plus, they’ll get the opportunity to branch out and try something new.
If you feel veganism isn’t right for you because you do not have acceptable alternatives, look around a bit more. Vegan versions of almost every food imaginable are available somewhere. Try shopping at a different grocery store than the one you usually patronize. Small grocers and health food stores are worth checking out.

, Perhaps you come from a culture or society which values killing and eating animals.These animals might be located and killed by you directly in hunting, or simply purchased from the local butcher by way of factory farms. If you feel you are unable to fully share in certain family rituals (a big annual barbecue cookout, for instance), you may be considering giving up veganism.


Before giving up veganism, think about ways that you might adapt to, and still partake in, rituals with your friends or family. Suggest that instead of hunting and killing the animals in the forest, you venture into the forest to enjoy the solitude of nature and grace of the animals you track together. You’d then get to share quality time and conversation with your father, mother, brothers, or whomever, while staying vegan.
Don’t let others pressure you to give up veganism (or become vegan) if you aren’t ready or don't want to. Doing something you don’t really want to do in order to please others is a recipe for frustration and unhappiness.

, Is there some professional reason you might be obligated or strongly encouraged to eat animal products? Food journalists, for instance, will need to try a variety of dishes when reviewing restaurants or food products, including foods which they themselves won’t eat. (Rarely is a restaurant’s signature dish vegan.) Workers in the food service industry — cooks, bakers, and waiters — may be expected to sample non-vegan foods so as to better prepare or describe them.


Consider putting a vegan spin on your profession. If you are a food journalist, maybe you can start specializing in vegan cuisine and restaurants. If you are in the restaurant industry, you may be able to find a vegan restaurant where you can work.

Notice if you experience bloating.,
Recognize feeling constantly sluggish.,
Identify if you’re developing an unhealthy relationship to food.,
Identify if you’re gaining weight.",How to Quit Being a Vegan4," When you adopt a vegan diet, you’ll probably start eating a lot more beans and legumes, which are a good source of protein. These are made of sugars, carbs, and fiber. Sensitivity to these foods or their constituent ingredients may cause bloating. If you continue to feel bloated for weeks on end, you might consider leaving veganism.


You might initially feel bloated when eating these foods, but gradually adjust to them as you progress in your vegan diet. Don’t give up quickly if you experience bloating.
Another alternative to quitting veganism is to just reduce the amount of legumes and beans in your diet. There are many other avenues to getting an adequate amount of protein without lots of legumes and beans.

, Iron in the blood provides a substantial amount of energy to the body. Vegan diets may lack adequate iron content and often don't get enough protein.You can easily correct iron deficiencies by taking a multivitamin or iron supplement. You can boost your iron absorption by eating iron-rich foods in combination with foods in which vitamin C is present.

, Did you transition to a vegan diet because you wanted an easy way to restrict your calorie intake and lose weight? While this in itself is not unhealthy, if taken too far, it might indicate you might suffer from anorexia.Anorexia is an illness in which you avoid eating to attain a thin body. Signs you might be obsessed with your food intake include:


Feeling guilty for everything you eat
Over-thinking every time you eat
Trying to always eat the “perfect” nutritional profile or calorie count.

, While vegans have far lower rates of obesity than omnivores, a vegan diet does not guarantee you’ll arrive at a healthy weight.Perhaps you’ve replaced your standard diet with one organized around candy, chips, and soda. If so, you might gain weight and consider moving away from veganism.


Alternately, you might try introducing more vegetables, fruits, and beans into your diet. Vegan versions of foods you may have eaten as an omnivore (burgers, deli meat, cheese) are easy to find in most local grocery stores as well.
A balanced diet is important no matter whether you’re vegan or not."

Drink milk.You'll find a variety of milk products in the dairy section of your grocery store.,
Indulge in cheese, but in moderation.",How to Get Enough Protein As a Vegetarian," How much protein you need on a daily basis depends on your calorie requirements. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 g of protein for every kilogram of body weight.This RDA is for adults with a sedentary lifestyle. For an RDA that is tailored to your body and activity level, use an online calculator (http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/fnic/interactiveDRI/) or use the equations below.


If you have your weight in kilograms, simply multiply it by 0.8 to find your protein RDA. For example, if you weigh 63 kg, you need to consume 50.4 g (63 x 0.8) of protein per day.
If you have your weight in pounds, you must first convert to kilograms. Divide your weight in pounds by 2.2. For example, if you weigh 145 pounds, that converts to about 66 kg (145 ÷ 2.2).
Multiply that amount by 0.8 to find your RDA of protein: 66 x 0.8 = 52.8 g of protein per day.
For sedentary adults, it is recommended that you get 0.8g of protein per kg of body weight per day (0.4g/lb).
Strength athletes (those who regularly strength train, like bodybuilders or linemen) should usually get 1.2 – 1.7g/kg of body weight per day (0.5 – 0.8g/lb).
Endurance athletes (such as cross-country runners) should usually get 1.2 – 1.4g/kg of body weight per day (0.5 – 0.6g/lb).;
, Vegetarians traditionally do not eat meat, poultry, or fish, but some types of vegetarians may eat dairy products and eggs. Vegans only eat food that comes from plant material. Anything that comes from an animal (meat, dairy, eggs, honey) is strictly off limits to vegans. Some vegans follow this diet for health reasons, and others do it for ethical ones. Either way, it can be hard to get enough protein on this diet, so you have to plan your meals well. The major food sources from which the vegetarian diet draws are:


Vegetables
Fruits
Grains (bread, pasta, rice, quinoa)
Legumes (beans)
Nuts and seeds
Soy substitutes for meat and dairy products
Eggs (omit if vegan)
Dairy (omit if vegan)

, It used to be recommended that all vegetarians eat ""complementary"" proteins, such as rice with beans, in order to get all the necessary amino acids that meat protein contains; however, health experts now advise simply eating a wide variety of protein sources every day.The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND, formerly ADA) indicates that eating an assortment of plant-based proteins throughout your day provides all the essential amino acids and also ensures adequate nitrogen retention for healthy adults.If you have a health condition or weakened immune system, consult with your doctor or a registered dietician to see whether you should use complementary proteins at meals.
If you are a vegan, you should make sure that you incorporate plenty of beans and soy into your diet to make sure that you get enough of the amino acid lysine. Lacto and lacto-ovo vegetarians appear generally to meet protein and lysine requirements with their diets., Certain animal products supply most people with certain nutrients as well as protein (most people get their zinc from red meat and poultry, for instance).Make sure that when you eliminate animal proteins you are making up for any lost nutrients as well.


Diets that don't include fish or eggs are generally low in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are fatty acids vital to your heart, eye, and brain health. Eating algae or taking algae supplements can help make up for this deficiency. You can also find soy milk and other products that are fortified with DHA.Lack of protein can cause a zinc deficiency. This can cause things such as a weakened immune system and even an increased risk of cavities.Eating soy, nuts, legumes, whole grains, and cheeses can help boost your zinc.Animal proteins often contain iron that is more easily absorbed by the body than the iron in plant proteins. Vegetarians need about 1.8x as much iron as non-vegetarians.Iron deficiencies can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, headache, and a weakened immune system, among others.Eating sprouted or fermented beans, grains, and seeds can help improve your iron intake.Lacto-ovo vegetarians usually get enough B-12, but lacto vegetarians and vegans may not get enough B-12 in their diets because of the limited sources of protein they consume. Fortified foods and beverages, as well as dietary supplements, can provide extra B-12.B-12 deficiency can cause symptoms such as diarrhea or constipation, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of appetite, among others.Vegans are at particularly high risk of a vitamin D and calcium deficiency, but several brands of soy and rice milk are fortified with vitamin D and calcium. Vitamin D is synthesized by exposure to sunlight., We often eat the vegetable and toss out the plant's nutrient-rich sprout or shoot, but a plant that's sprouted has grown into a deeper nutritional state. In fact, sprouts have the highest protein content of any vegetable.Eat sprouted beans, lentils, and peas that are low in calories but dense with protein.
Try cutting the sprouts away and adding them to your salads and sandwiches.

, Most people consume far too much protein in their diets. Humans only need to get about 10 – 35% of their calories from protein. Most whole (not processed) vegan food sources provide 10 – 20% of their calories from protein.Consuming whole, unprocessed foods is always best to obtain adequate, optimal sources of protein. Good examples of plant-based proteins include:Cooked lima beans, which have 11.6 g per cup (170 g)
Green peas, which have 7.9 g of protein per cup (145 g)
Kale, which has 0.7 g of protein per cup (16 g)
Other rich sources of vegetable protein include broccoli and broccoli raab, cooked mushrooms, yellow corn, and green leafy vegetables like spinach and collard greens.

, The refining process strips whole grains of their bran and germs, which contain the most protein in these plants.Refined grains like white bread and white rice are easy to find and often cheap, but whole grains will provide you with a better ratio of protein to carbohydrates. This ensures you don't have to gorge on calories from unwanted carbs to get enough protein, and will also help keep your blood sugar from spiking.


Avoid ""white"" versions of common grain products like rice, bread, and pasta. Look for words like ""brown,"" ""unrefined,"" ""whole,"" or ""whole grain"" on packaging.
Uncooked wheat germ has 26.6 g of protein per cup (115 g).
Cooked oat bran has 7 g of protein per cup (219 g).
Uncooked rice bran has 15.8 g of protein per cup (118 g).
Other rich sources of grain protein include raw oats, wheat bran, soba noodles, oatmeal, quinoa, wild rice, semolina, couscous, and millet.

, They're also much cheaper than whole grains, which can hurt the pocket. Though you may not think of tofu and other soy products as a legume, they pack the soybean's protein punch. Boiled soybeans have 28.6 g of protein per cup (172 g) and tofu has 9.4 g per 1/4 block (116 g). Tempeh can provide 30.8 g protein per cup (166 g), and roasted soybeans provide 36.8 g cup (93 g). Soy milk also can help you meet your protein requirements, especially if you're vegan. But there are plenty of protein-rich legumes other than the soybean:


Split peas
Lentils
Mung beans
White beans
Fava beans
Kidney beans
Lima beans
Black beans

, Nuts and seeds are more than just dense with protein. Nuts, especially, can also lower your LDL (""bad"" cholesterol) and improve overall heart health. Along with protein, they provide unsaturated fats, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and vitamin E.You can either snack on nuts and seeds in between meals, or add them to your entrees and salads for a little protein punch.


The best seeds for protein are pumpkin, hemp, chia, sunflower, and sesame seeds.Look for nuts like almonds, cashews, pecans, pistachios, and walnuts.You can also use a variety of nut milks, such as almond milk and cashew milk, to help boost your protein intake.

, That doesn't mean you should dismiss plants as a protein source, though. Most of your protein should still come from whole grains, vegetables, legumes, and nuts and seeds.

, A single chicken egg can provide 6 g of protein with just 71 calories and no carbohydrates.You can start your day off with boiled or scrambled eggs, or add boiled eggs to your salads. You can also add scrambled eggs to a soba noodle stir fry or fried brown rice dish with vegetables and tofu. Overindulging in eggs, though, can lead to high cholesterol.Eating four egg yolks a week is healthy for people who have otherwise normal cholesterol levels.

, If you love eggs and want to eat more than four a week, you have an out! Luckily, all the cholesterol is found in the yolk, which you can avoid while still getting protein from egg whites.The whites from one chicken egg provide 4 grams of protein with only 16 calories and no carbohydrates.You can eat egg whites or substitutes made from egg whites in larger amounts without worrying about cholesterol.

, The most common milk, of course, is cow's milk, but you have to choose between whole, 2%, and skim. Surprisingly, there's more protein in low-fat milks than in whole, full-fat milk. Whole milk has a little under 8 g of protein per serving, whereas 2%, 1% and skim milk have 8 g or slightly more. If you're not worried about fat content, non-cow milks provide even more protein, but with more fat:


Goat's milk has 8.7 g of protein and 10. g of fat per serving.
Sheep's milk has 15 g of protein and 17 g of fat per serving.
If you are lactose intolerant, soy and nut milks can help you boost your protein intake.

, While cheese is high in protein, it can also be incredibly fatty and caloric, and lead to high cholesterol.You definitely shouldn't eat grilled cheese sandwiches and nachos every day. In small amounts, though, cheese is a good way to bump up your protein intake.


Parmesan cheese has the highest protein content, with 10 g per ounce.Sprinkle a serving over your pasta dishes, or shave a serving into your salads.
Most cheeses, like cheddar, brie, or gouda, have 6 – 7 g of protein per ounce.
Cottage cheese provides 23 g of protein in just a single cup! But that protein also comes with 206 calories and 9 g of fat, so indulge in moderation (and look for low-fat dairy)."

Research first.,
Know how to understand labels.,
Know the difference between natural, organic and chemically processed foods.,
Learn which food items give you proteins and fats that can be absorbed into your body.,
Ensure that each meal consists of whole grain, vegetables, and protein.,
Spice up your diet.,

Make sure you always put your health first!,
Be healthy in your whole lifestyle.",How to Eat Healthy As a Vegan," Once you have decided to become a vegan it is always best to be knowledgeable about the topic and do your research. Look online for health information and diet tricks from both doctors and other vegans. You'll want to combine both medical advice and recipe advice to get started on the right foot in veganism.;
, Being able to understand the ingredients written on the label will help you understand the differences in vegan-friendly, and non-vegan-friendly foods. When choosing the right item make sure when looking at the labels you look for many of the symbols that indicate food contents.


For example, if it truly is a certified vegan, gluten-free or Non-GMO product, there will likely - depending on your country - be a note or symbol indicating so. The more aware you are of the labels and key ingredient- the better you can choose which product is best for you and your vegan journey.

, There are foods that claim to be vegan when in fact, they are not. This goes back to being able to understand labels. Natural foods and organic foods are two completely different things that many people mistake for being the same.


Organic foods are foods that must be grown without the use of any type of fertilizer or pesticides, growth hormones or antibiotics.
However, natural foods have no legal supervision at all and the USDA does not require an official ingredient listing such as using any growth hormones.
Natural and both organic are considered to have less to no preservatives compared to the processed foods that are loaded with artificial sweeteners, dyes, and use as many imitations as possible.

, Nuts, seeds and legumes are a great substitute in a vegan diet as a source of protein. Nuts are low in certain amino acids such as tryptophan and methionine and are higher in oils that give you the best amount of vitamin E.


The best way to enjoy seeds is to soak them overnight, by doing this you allow the fats and proteins to be easier to digest. You can try any type of seed when doing this such as almonds, flax seeds, cashews, hazelnut, peanut, pistachios, sesame and pecans.
Dried legumes are always great sources of vitamin B6 and keep your skin glowing. Also any bean can help give your body vitamins such as kidney beans, black-eyed beans, pinto, adzuki, fava, lima, soy, mung and lentils.

, Vegetables and fruits are a major part of your diet, so make sure you get lots of them! Whole grains include types of wheat, oats, rice, corn, barley, quinoa, sorghum, rye and spelt. Many whole grains have antioxidants as well as magnesium, iron, vitamin B and E, and fiber.


By eating whole grains you will reduce strokes, diabetes, obesity, cancer and even heart disease. Also, many fruits and vegetables contain phytochemicals that fight off diseases and are even a better source of nutrients. Lowered cholesterol levels have been one of the many results of whole grains, vegetables and fruits as well.

, Just because you are a vegan, your diet doesn't have to be bland with only fruits or vegetables; you can literally spice up your diet with herbs and spices! Italian spices can actually help protect your skin cells in many ways. By adding them to your diet you not only get a great new flavor but you will also get key ingredients that are loaded with antioxidants that protect your skin cells from harmful free radicals that can contribute to heart disease, cancer and even Alzheimer's disease. So by spicing things up you are also protecting yourself.


Other great herbs and spices that can fight aging and help your overall health are: Sage, Marjoram,Thyme, Oregano, Jamaican Allspice, Turmeric, Cloves and Cinnamon.

, Soy milk is a good place to start: there are many flavors of it and it's definitely vegan friendly. Using almond soy milk in baking, and regular soy milk in other cooking is a perfect way to substitute. You will not be able to taste the difference. Another fun substitute is ground flax seed - one tablespoon of flax seed equals three tablespoons of egg. Vegetable base butters, are an excellent substitute for regular butter. And finally, if any recipe calls for honey, it can be substituted with maple syrup, agave nectar, or agave syrup. These are just a few of the many substitutes that fit into the vegan diet.

, If you love cheese but want to make sure it is vegan friendly try Daiya (they create vegan cheeses, with a couple of flavors, such as cheddar and mozzarella). Another general brand of food that is very well known is the Kashi brand; not only are they vegan friendly but they're also environmentally friendly!

, You can use this in so many dishes, from pies to stir fries. Silken tofu is very soft and can be blended and flavored for pie fillings or mousses. It can be cooked, baked or fried. You can make a dish called Tofu scramble, which is scrambled up tofu with veggies and it's essentially like scrambled eggs.

, You may ask your doctor if your body is getting enough vitamins, food and iron in your diet. Ask about supplements you might need to start taking, and ask if the supplements your doctor may prescribe are vegan friendly. The purpose of food is to give our bodies the nutrients it needs to function on a day to day basis. Not getting enough of a certain vitamin, not getting enough calories or iron can cause mental and physical problems.


If your body does not get the right amount of iron you may become very tired and weak. If you do not get the right amount of calcium your bones will become very brittle, you may have poor posture and your height may change.
If you do not get the right amount of veggies and fruits, your body may be low on immune support to help keep your body healthy. If you're not sure if your body and mind are on a healthy track, you may double check with your doctor.

, Only changing your diet will not give you the results you want. Diet and maintaining a regular exercise routine will complete your life in a healthier new way! 30 percent exercise and 70 percent diet will help your body transform. Your body is your temple, so cherish it!

Trying new vegetables, grains and legumes gives opportunities to enjoy unfamiliar foods that can replace and usually exceed the nutritional content of animal-based foods.;
, Healthy vegetarians avoid processed foods. Study vegetarian cookbooks with simple recipes that include a variety of vegetables, grains, nuts, legumes, fruits and healthy fats. Eating at home lets you control the nutrients you consume.

, Most vitamins found in a meat-based diet can be obtained by eating vegetables such as leafy greens, which contain calcium. Consuming different types of vegetables ensures that you're acquiring the different nutrients available in each plant.


Try consuming at least 9 servings of vegetables and fruits daily for optimal nutrient intake. Consider trying dark leafy greens, cooked tomatoes and the most brightly colored vegetables in red, orange and yellow hues.

, Many meats contain important proteins that are also found in dairy products, fish and eggs, such as Vitamin B-12 and calcium. Vegetarians who eat some animal-based products normally get adequate amounts of proteins. However strict vegans who abstain from all animal products must consume additional plant foods such as tempeh or whole grain-based cereals to ensure adequate vegetarian nutrition.

, Reach for unprocessed snack foods and meals when you're rushed. Instead of turning to sugary sweets and fried meals, eat high-fiber foods such as fruit, brown rice crackers and peanut butter. You'll feel full and meet dietary requirements when on the go.

, Plant-based diets contain enough nutrition for vegetarians who eat some animal products, but strict vegans may find supplements beneficial if affected by lethargy and a weak immune system. B-12 and zinc supplements can help improve the status of a vegan's health and nutrition status.

Do squats.",How to Get Rid of Saddlebags," Let's keep this as simple as possible. Getting rid of those saddlebags is not rocket science -- they're just excess fat stores that your body has unfortunately decided to hold onto in a rather inconvenient place. The first thing that needs to go? The junk food. It's full of empty calories, bad fats, and very few nutrients. So cut it out!


Anything fried or packaged goes on the no-no list. And baked goods and sweets, too. If it's not a good source of protein, fiber, vitamins, good carbs or fats, it doesn't qualify. This means you'll be going fresh -- and doing some cooking!

It's impossible to completely avoid these and it's illogical to say something is completely off-limits. So instead of thinking to yourself, ""I can't have these,"" think of it as a treat to have every once in a while.

;
, You should choose whole, complex carbs that contain plenty of fiber, such as brown rice, whole wheat products, quinoa, oats, and the ones in veggies. These will keep you fuller for longer. White or processed carbs on the other hand can be stored as fat if not used for energy right away. Avoid white rice, white bread, cookies, cakes, and pastries.


Need some tips? Instead of bread, use eggplant slices or a lettuce wrap. When you go out to restaurants, say you don't need that basket of bread. Get brown rice instead of white, and substitute your spaghetti for whole wheat pasta, quinoa, chickpeas, or thinly sliced vegetables like peppers., You've probably heard that you should eat the rainbow and it's true. The more color you eat, the better. How do you do that? Fruits and veggies! They are nutrient dense -- packed with tons of vitamins and minerals and don't have a lot of calories. You could eat pounds and pounds of salad and be okay -- imagine eating pounds and pounds of fried chicken!


Green, leafy vegetables are especially good for you. Spinach, kale, lettuce, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and broccoli? Great choices. Carrots, onions, peppers, squash -- the more colorful veggies -- are good, too.
Blueberries, oranges, bananas, apples, kiwis, grapes, strawberries, and papayas are super fruits.They're full of antioxidants, fiber and vitamins. And tasty to boot!

, Yep, there are definitely such a thing. And they're good for you! Having a diet that includes good fats (but not too many of course) can actually help lower your cholesterol and protect your heart.So while the bad fats (the saturated kind) need to go, the good fats (the unsaturated kind) can stay.


You'll find these in nuts, avocados, olive oils, and fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and trout. Just make sure you stick to them in moderation -- even too much of a good thing can be bad.

, It's almost too good to be true, but it's not (because it is definitely true). Upping your water intake can help shed pounds, the only effort being lifting that bottle to your chin. Seriously! Studies have shown that people who drink the necessary amount and then some (women need about 3 liters and men need 4 (including the amount in food)) weigh less.Cold water can even up your metabolism! So keep that bottle around; it'll be awfully handy.


The benefits of water don't just stop at weight loss. It's great for your muscles and organs, your skin, hair and nails, keeps everything regular that must not be mentioned, makes you feel full and can actually make you feel energized. And that's not including the fact that when you're drinking it, you're not drinking those bubbly, sugary drinks that aren't good for you!
Replace all sugary drinks in your diet with water. These include soda, sweetened coffee and tea, lemonade, and juice.

, You should have three meals a day with small, healthy snacks in between each meal. This will keep you full without making you crave unhealthy, processed foods. Do not skip meals, as this can hurt rather than help your diet., All this talk about not eating packaged junk is all well and good, but unless you have a plan, it'll be hard to stick to. You know what you should do, but what are you going to do? So find a plan that appeals to you that meets your goals.


Consider giving yourself a caloric goal for each day (our article, How to Calculate How Many Calories You Need to Eat to Lose Weight, can get you started on that). If you don't like that idea, aim for a certain amount of your food intake being vegetables (or a similar idea). And it's easier than ever nowadays to keep track with smartphone apps!
Have a workout plan, too. Do you want to work out 4 times a week? For how long? Do you want to work out until you burn X number of calories or is it by activity?

, It's not what you want to hear, but it has to be said. While you can tone up those thighs and hips of yours, that fat will still be there. So doing leg lift after leg lift won't get you the results you want -- it has to be a combination of diet, fat burning, and toning. We wish it weren't so, but it is!


Everybody's body is a bit different. Some start losing fat on top, some on bottom, some on their core, some on their extremities. In other words, this may take some patience. You may see your stomach shrinking before your thighs. If that becomes the case, relax and take a breath. You're on the right track.

, This is goal one. To get to those svelte thighs of yours underneath those saddlebags, that fat needs to be blasted away. The most efficient way of doing that? Cardio. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. 4 or 5 times a week for at least 30 minutes is ideal, but it can be broken up into smaller bits, too.


Cardio takes on dozens of different forms, not just running! You can get on the elliptical, go for a bike ride, walk, swim, box, play tennis, heck, even go dancing! As long as your heart gets pumping, it's good.
If long workouts aren't your thing, take solace in high-intensity interval training. It actually has shown to burn more calories in a shorter amount of time. So take 15 minutes on the treadmill (or wherever) alternating between walking and sprinting. Your heart will even keep pumping afterward, burning calories by itself!, Once you get rid of the fat, you gotta work on what's underneath it -- or you'll just end up with that unfortunate ""skinny fat"" look. So after, before, or at a completely different time than your cardio, start pumping that iron.


If dumbbells aren't your cup o' tea, you can use your own body to strengthen and tone itself. Planks, squats, lunges, burpees -- they'll all start firming you up. And then there's pilates and yoga -- awesome activities that will show results, too!

, This whole workout thing gets pretty boring if you don't mix it up. And doing the same thing over and over might get you results initially, but then they stop and you end up just running around in circles, getting nowhere. To beat the body plateau and the mind numb, start cross training. In other words, do a whole bunch of different stuff! It's the best way to stay motivated, too.


So take a break from the gym and hit the pool. Switch up your treadmill for the elliptical. Go on a hike, play tennis, or go rock climbing. Take a free trial class at a pilates studio, try hot yoga, or sign up for Zumba. The options are endless!

, Even though your schedule may only allow for an hour or so at the gym, that doesn't mean you can't find little opportunities throughout the day to get active. You'd be surprised how many calories you can burn doing a few yoga stances while you watch TV!


Little things do add up. So start parking far away at work, taking the stairs, walking the dog the long way around the block, giving the house a good scrub down, and dancing while you get ready. Still skeptical? The Mayo Clinic team has said that the calories burned in everyday life are more important than they ever realized.They're people to trust!

, Most gyms have workout benches or exercise steps if you don't have your own. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your arms down at your sides. Step up with your right foot onto the bench and then your left foot. Step down with your right, then your left foot. Repeat 10 times. Reverse the lead foot and repeat the exercise 10 times.


Beginners should start with 2-pound weights and work up to 15 pounds in each arm. Aim for 3 to 4 sets on each foot.
Go faster! See how long you can go all out for and up it each workout session.

, Put on ankle weights and hold onto a wall or piece of furniture to gain balance. Lift your right leg up straight in front of your body as far as you can. Lower your leg and repeat 10 times. Switch legs and lift 10 times. Keep your hips straight during the exercise! You want to feel that burn!


Aim for 3 or 4 sets on each leg. Start doing as many as you can, of course, and work your way up gradually.

, Extend your legs and lie on your right side, with your hips stacked and your head supported by your right elbow. Raise your leg as high as you can and lower it. Repeat 10 times and then switch sides. Keep your abdominal muscles tight! Your core should always be contracted.


Aim for 3 sets per leg. You can use resistance bands or ankle weights for a more advanced workout, too.

, Get on your hands and knees, with your hands below your shoulders and your knees below your hips. With your knee bent, raise your left leg out to the side as high as you can. Hold it for 2 seconds and lower the leg back down. Keep your abs tight and your hips in line with your body. Repeat 10 times and switch legs.


When you get good at this, do it fast, almost jumping between legs. When you go to bring your left foot in, push off with your right. Can you do it for a whole minute?
Aim for 3 sets on each leg. 3 is a good number of sets for just about anything.

, If you can do them in front of a mirror, even better -- that way you can make sure you have constant good form. Stand with your legs shoulder width apart and grab those dumbbells. Bring them to shoulder level, elbows bent, and work your way into a squat, abs flexed.


Get into a position where you're parallel with the floor. Hold it in that position and lift back up. Repeat three sets of 10. At the end, hold the squat for as long as you can. And then 5 seconds more!

Create a fitness training plan.,
Choose your cardiovascular exercise.,
Try a new activity.,
Try high-intensity interval training (HIIT).",How to Get Rid of Underarm Fat1," Cardiovascular exercise and weight training burn calories effectively, and effective weight loss includes both.For best results, aim for 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate cardiovascular exercise each week, or 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of vigorous exercise, or an equivalent combination of the two.








A fitness trainer can help you design a program that meets your fitness goals, including working on ""problem areas"" such as the underarm.
Plan when you can go to a fitness center or devote time to fitness. Bring your workout clothes with you so you can head directly to the gym after school or work.;
, Exercise is an important part of losing weight, burning calories, and maintaining health. Moderate exercise means that you are lightly sweating, breathing a bit harder (but are not out of breath), and can still talk while exercising.Moderate aerobic activity may include dancing, cycling, and brisk walking. Vigorous cardiovascular training burns calories faster, and includes jogging, circuit training, aerobic classes, resistance training, and stair climbing.








, One way to engage in fitness in a new way is to try a new activity. This can be as easy as trying a new class at your local gym or trying something active outdoors. You want to make fitness fun, and there are many ways to add enjoyment to physical activity.


Hiking is a great way to burn calories and be active while enjoying some natural beauty. If you don't have hiking trails near you, consider going to a local park or somewhere you can immerse yourself in nature while you move your body.
Pick up biking. Find some local bike paths and enjoy time outside. Save gas and bike to your errands, like going to the grocery store.
Dancing is a great way to burn calories and learn a new skill. Many different forms of dance exist, such as ballroom, salsa, bachata, hip hop, ballet and freestyle. Check out dance classes in your area and have some fun while you burn calories.

, Don't be fooled by this quick and powerful workout! You will be sweating and working hard. One approach is to start with moderate intensity exercise for three to four minutes, then kick up the intensity for one minute. Repeat one to six times with any type of cardio exercise you perform.









Activities can include jogging/running, jump rope, jumping jacks, squats, or kickboxing. Get creative! Any aerobic activity that can be done at different intervals can be a HIIT.

Relieve your stress.,
Get better sleep.,
Drink more water.,
Eat regular meals.,
Don't drink too much alcohol.",How to Get Rid of Love Handles1," When you get stressed out due to working too much, having family troubles or experiencing some kind of trauma, the body reacts by releasing a hormone called cortisol.In addition to causing a host of health issues, cortisol causes you to gain fat around the middle of your body, leading to love handles. You can probably think of dozens of things that are stressing you out right now. To get rid of the handles, you've got to get rid of the stress! Figure out what's putting strain on your system and take measures to improve your situation.


See if you can reduce the activity in your schedule so you're a little less busy. Having back to back activities from morning until night causes a lot of stress.
If you're experiencing a stress caused by a situation that's out of your control, work on handling the stress in healthy ways through meditation, yoga, running, journaling, or another activity that calms your mind.;
, Staying up too late is hard on your body and mind, and results in cortisol overproduction and weight gain around the middle. Getting better sleep is often an overlooked key to weight loss, but it can make a big difference. Start sleeping 7 - 8 hours per night, every night.


Going to bed at the same time each night and waking up at the same time in the morning puts your body on a consistent schedule and helps eliminate stress. Stop using bright screens thirty minutes before you go to sleep.
If you have trouble sleeping, make sure your sleeping environment is sufficiently dark and quiet. Leave your electronic devices in another room when you go to bed so you won't be tempted to check email during the night.

, Dehydration is another stressor on the body. Many of us are dehydrated without realizing it. Start drinking several liters of water a day, and more on hot days or when you exercise, to make sure your body is sufficiently hydrated.


Drink a big glass of water first thing in the morning, before you have your morning caffeine.
Buy a liter-sized water bottle and plan to drink two bottles' worth every day.

, This helps prevent a blood sugar spike, too many of which can lead to weight gain around the middle. If you want to get ride of your love handles, eat regular, small meals, stopping around 8:00 at night. Giving your body a break from eating from evening til morning, then eating a good breakfast followed by a healthy lunch and dinner, is the best way to lose those love handles.

, Alcohol leads to blood sugar swings, which are hard on the system and lead to the storage of belly fat.Stay away from sugary alcohol drinks altogether. When you do drink, choose a low sugar drink, such as wine, and limit yourself to a drink or two no more than twice a week.


One serving of alcohol is equal to five ounces of wine, twelve ounces of beer, or 1.5 ounces of liquor. Two or fewer servings a day are recommended for men while one or fewer a day is recommended for women.

Target muscle groups.,
Do push-ups.,
Do triceps dips.,
Do supermans.",How to Get Rid of Underarm Fat2," One way to improve the look of your underarms is by targeting the muscles around the underarm and strengthening them.This includes the triceps (located on the underside of your upper arm above your elbow), pectorals (located over your chest), and latissimus dorsi (known as ""angel wings"" or lats near the backside of your underarms). Toning the muscles near your underarms will tighten muscles and create more appeal in this area.








, Push-ups target many muscle groups throughout the body, particularly the muscles surrounding the underarm. Make sure you keep your body straight, as if your body is a straight plank from head to toe. If this position is difficult, drop your knees. Start with 3 sets of 10 and increase amount with skill.


Change your hand position to create challenge. Arms spread far apart will work back muscles, and hands placed closer together--such as creating a diamond shape with pointer fingers touching at the top and thumbs touching at the base-- will work triceps.

, Dips help build tricep muscle by relying on your triceps to support your weight as you dip your body. Use an exercise machine designed to work tricep dips, or use a bench, making sure to use good form. Do 3 sets of 10.








, This exercise works the muscles down the length of the spine as well as the backs of the shoulders, the buttocks, and even the backs of the arms and legs. Lie on your stomach with your legs outstretched and ankles touching. Your arms should be outstretched upwards, palms down facing forward by your face. Raise your legs and arms so that only your midsection is against the floor, and hold this position for 30 seconds. Repeat.

Eat to lose weight.,
Use a food diary.,
Eat when you're hungry.,
Limit your intake of saturated fats and sugars.,
Eat a varied diet.,
Use healthy alternatives to low nutrition food.,
Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.",How to Get Rid of Underarm Fat3," To lose weight, you must use more calories than you intake, which can be accomplished through diet and exercise. Safe weight loss includes losing 0.5 to 2.0 pounds each week, which requires a 500–1,000 decrease in overall calories each day.No diet can target a specific part of your body for weight loss. Your goal is to reduce overall body fat, which will include fat near the underarms.
Create a mindset that encourages you to lose weight. Losing weight means committing to a plan and following through with it. You can do it!

, Many people are unaware of how many calories they consume each day, which leads to feeling frustrated at an inability to lose weight. Using a food diary increases your success in losing weight.Using a food diary means tracking the calories you eat each day, and also tracking the calories you expend on exercise.


If you have a smartphone, download a food diary application. Many free apps exist that track total nutrition, including protein, fiber, and vitamins found within your food. It's a great way to make sure you are eating a balanced diet and maintaining proper nutrition.

, Eating in response to emotional problems can end up having big consequences on your health, resulting in gaining unnecessary weight.It's easy to be an emotional eater, but start to retrain your body not to turn to food when you experience certain feelings. Listen to your emotional cues, but handle those separately outside of food.


Begin listening to your body's cues when it feels hungry. When you get an indication from your body, hear it out. What amount of food will satisfy the hunger? What kind of food does your body want? Could you be thirsty? If you have a craving, figure out if there is a healthy alternative that can satisfy the craving.

, Often, foods with a high sugar content also have a high fat content, which can make losing weight quite difficult.Moderate your intake of foods high in fat or sugar, and sparingly eat foods high in both fat and sugar.


Common high sugar sources include sodas, candies, alcoholic drinks, cakes, and pastries.
Common foods that are high in saturated fats include margarine, butter, cooking oils, non-skim dairy products, fried foods, many desserts, untrimmed meat, cold cuts, and processed or packaged foods.

, Include more fruits and vegetables, and add a variety of grains and proteins to maintain a healthy weight.Get creative in adding fruits and veggies. Make a fruit smoothie in the morning, or pack sandwiches high with veggies. Treat yourself to sweet fruits for dessert.
Eat a variety of grains such as rice, quinoa, and oats.
Mix up your protein by eating trail mix, substituting tofu, or adding beans.

, When preparing food, get the most bang for your buck. If you crave food low in nutrients, consider replacing it with a higher nutrient alternative. Do some searching online to find replacements, many can be found with a simple internet search.


Instead of making spaghetti, prepare spaghetti squash. Spaghetti squash has a similar taste and consistency to spaghetti. Spaghetti squash is a vegetable and is packed with nutrients.
If you crave ice cream, prepare ""banana ice cream"". Blend a frozen banana in a food processor or blender until creamy. You'll be surprised at how much frozen banana resembles ice cream!

, Sports drinks, sodas and fruit juices can have a high sugar content and are packed with calories. Water provides a healthy and cheap beverage to keep you hydrated throughout your day and while exercising.

Wear properly fitting clothes.,
Choose properly fitting bras.,
Maintain good posture.",How to Get Rid of Underarm Fat4," Clothes that are too tight can draw attention to areas of your body that you may not want attention. When trying on clothes, make sure they fit well around the arms and armpit area. If you are particularly self-conscious about your underarm area, do not wear clothes with elastic or stretchy material near the underarm region.


If you wear dresses, take care when buying dresses cut near or around the armpit. If it is too tight, it may pull skin around your armpits, making the skin bulge.

, An ill-fitting bra can cause bunching of skin near or around the armpit. A properly fitting bra means that you are providing adequate support and comfort for your body. The bra is a foundation of the wardrobe, and if it does not fit, it is unlikely that clothes placed on top of it will fit well.


Go to a specialty bra store and request a bra fitting. Pay special attention to how the bra fits in the underarm region, and how the underarm appears when clothes are worn.
Sizes may differ from store to store. Be sure to try on a bra before you buy it, as some stores may not allow returns.

, Maintaining good posture not only makes you look taller and more slender, but also is good for your bones and muscles.Slouching or hunching over can affect how your body appears and can make skin bunch near the underarms. Keep your neck and shoulders upright, taking care not to hunch over when sitting, standing, or walking.


It's easy to hunch your shoulders when working at a desk or on a computer. Do occasional body checks to maintain good posture when working.

Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Eat healthy proteins and fats.,
Eat whole grains and fiber.,
Skip the processed foods.",How to Get Rid of Love Handles2," Eating well is the single most important thing you can do to lose love handles. Eating fresh fruits and vegetables at every meal is a great way to decrease your belly fat storage. Fruits and vegetables contain a range of vitamins and nutrients your body needs to stay healthy. They're high in fiber and water and low in calories.


Start your day with a vegetable omelet or fruit and vegetable smoothie. Make sure every meal includes a substantial portion of fresh vegetables.
Vegetables that are in season are fresher and more nutritious than those that are not in season and have to be shipped from far away. Try to choose produce that was grown close to where you live.

, A diet with plenty of lean protein and healthy omega-3s and other good fats is essential when you're trying to lose love handles. Each meal should include a serving size of protein such as chicken, fish, or lean beef.


Cured meats like bacon, sausage, and lunch meats have preservatives and trans fats that contribute to fat storage, so avoid these and stick to lean, fresh meat.
There are plenty of vegetarian options for protein as well. Eggs, tofu, legumes, and certain leafy green vegetables contain high amounts of protein.

, Eating high-fiber foods makes you feel more full, and you're less likely to consume as many calories when your meals contain a high amount of fiber.Go for whole grains like oatmeal or quinoa, as well as fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, beans and nuts.

, Most snack foods, fast foods, and other factory-made food like white bread, canned soups and microwaveable dinners are laden with extra sugar, white flour, corn syrup, and hydrogenated oil, not to mention preservatives and food coloring. When you're trying to lose belly fat, it's best to avoid these types of foods as much as possible.


Do as much of your own cooking as you can. Try to prepare your meals fresh every day, even if your meal is as simple as a salad with a protein like grilled chicken or tofu.
Have healthy snacks like nuts, carrot sticks or sliced fruit on hand to eat in place of packaged snack foods.
Try making old-fashioned oats with fruit or a scrambled egg for breakfast. Avoid sugary breakfast bars; even the ""diet"" bars are full of sugar calories.
Soft drinks and other sugary drinks should also be avoided. Go for unsweetened herbal tea. If you love sweetener in your drinks, use agave.

Do high-intensity interval training.,
Try the bicycle move.,
Do prone ball roll-ins to the side.,
Use a hula hoop.,
Try decline twisting sit-ups.Decline twisting sit-ups are more intense than normal sit-ups, as you are working against gravity as you lower the body and rise up again.",How to Get Rid of Love Handles3," High intensity interval training (HIIT) switches between bursts of intense activity and brief periods of less-intense activity. HIIT burns a high amount of calories in a short time and continues to burn calories after the workout.A good twenty minute HIIT program is to do forty-five seconds of each the following exercises: push-ups, squats, butt kicks, tricep dips, and lunges. After one round, rest for 15 seconds, and repeat. Do three rounds total.A good HIIT program can help you lose belly fat, which will help reduce your love handles.

, The bicycle is a strong move designed to get rid of love handles and can be included as part of most workout sessions quite easily. This exercise has you quickly shifting from side to side, which works the love handle muscles and keeps the stress on the oblique muscles.


Lie on your back on a hard floor surface and raise your legs in the air at the waist. Support with your hands by placing your elbows under your lower back so your legs are raised fully off the ground, and perform cycling motions with your legs in the air.
When performing this exercise make sure to maintain a nice slow movement pattern, as this keeps maximum tension on the oblique muscles.

, This movement is done with an exercise ball, and is especially effective to target love handles because of the prone body position. Your muscles have to work hard to keep you balanced and this is where the toning up comes in.


Lie on your stomach on an exercise ball. Roll over the ball from side to side, moving your body to stay balanced on the ball so you don't fall off.
Each time you squeeze the ball into the side of your body you should feel it in the oblique muscles.

, A fun exercise that really tones up that troublesome love handle area is using a hula hoop, sold at most fitness stores. Put on some music and swivel your hips, maneuvering the hoop higher and lower up and down the column of your waist area. After a while you can really feel your oblique muscles kicking in, meaning that you are starting to have some effect on strengthening the muscles below the love handles area.

, Just perform a set of normal sit-ups, but twist to alternate sides as you rise from the floor and reverse the position as you lower back to the start position.


Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet firmly set on the ground.
Raise your torso, focusing on twisting as far to one side as you possibly can.
Lower back to the floor slowly, as this helps work the muscles across the full range of motion.

Eat seafood.,
Incorporate meat into your diet.,
Add in dairy products.,
Try whole grain cereals.,
Incorporate yeast.",How to Get Vitamin B121," One of the best ways to get B12 into your diet is to eat seafood. Shellfish, such as lobster, crabs, and especially clams, have high amounts of B12.Fish, such as trout, salmon, tuna, and haddock, also offer a lot of B12.


One three ounce serving has almost 400% of your daily B12. Three ounces of clams give you more than your daily value.;
, Both beef and organ meat like beef liver have a lot of B12.Pork also contains B12.


One medium slice of beef liver has 2800% of your recommended daily amount of B12.
As a healthier alternative to beef, you can try buffalo or bison.Some meat substitutes are fortified with B12, as is tofu. Consider this option if you are vegan or vegetarian, and check the label for the amount of B12.Poultry products provide B12, as do eggs. Two cooked eggs have a full day’s amount of Vitamin B12.

, Include dairy products, such as yogurt, milk, and cheese, in your diet to give it a B12 boost.Some non-animal milks are fortified with B12, too.Try a snack of one cup of low-fat fruit yogurt for half a day’s amount.

, Many breakfast cereals have a good amount B12.Combining fortified cereals, eggs, and milk for breakfast can give you the daily amount of B12 right after you wake up.


For example, one bowl (⅔ cup) of Kellogg’s Low Fat Granola with raisins contains 10 mcg of Vitamin B12, which is 417% the recommended daily value.
Whole grain cereals are a good way for vegans and vegetarians to get B12 since plant foods do not contain high levels of B12.

, Yeast products and nutritional yeasts can be good sources of B12.You can sprinkle nutritional yeast into anything from cereal to smoothies to your nightly meals for a B12 boost.


A teaspoon of Vitamin B12 Fortified yeast flakes contains over twice your daily amount of B12.

Therefore, your body needs protein to build muscle over time.As a vegan, protein will come from plant-based sources. Remember that many foods contain protein, not just animal products.;
, If you're trying to bulk up, you really do not need that much more protein than an average person. An average person needs 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight. So if you weigh 120 pounds, you need 96 grams of protein per day.A casual exerciser, on the other hand, needs 0.5 to 0.9 grams of protein per day. So the same 120 pound person would need 60 to 108 grams of protein per day. People who lift professionally have even higher protein needs.Always talk to your doctor or nutritionist about the right amount of protein for you per day.
It may be tempting to eat large amounts of protein to build muscle. However, your body does not need the extra protein. That is, it takes any extra protein and stores it as fat, which means that taking in more protein does not help you achieve your goal., If you are becoming serious about weightlifting, your body will need extra calories to gain the weight you need to build muscles. For instance, a male weightlifter who's just beginning needs about 18 calories per pound of body weight. So if you weigh 120 pounds, you need to eat at least 2,160 calories a day.Be sure that your calories aren't coming solely from carbohydrates. This is very hard with a vegan diet as so many foods that vegans lean towards are carbohydrate-heavy.

, That is, most plant-based proteins are only partial proteins, unlike meat and eggs. They do not contain all the amino acids needed to build muscles. However, when you combine proteins by switching what you eat during the day and adding variety, you can create complete proteins.For instance, wheat and rice do not have as much lysine, one amino acid, as other vegetable proteins, such as beans and peas. Where wheat and rice shine, though, is in methionine, another amino acid, which beans and peas do not have as much of. The point is to balance different types of vegetable proteins, such as eating both grains and and legumes some time during the day, to make sure you are getting the needed amino acids. Nut proteins can also help you balance your amino acids., Carbohydrates give you energy so you can workout. In fact, you need about 1,200 calories of a 2,000 calorie diet to come from carbohydrates. They key is to stick with complex carbs, such as whole grains, vegetables, and fruits.While limiting carbohydrates is hard on a vegan diet, choosing the right type of carbohydrates is beneficial.

, As a vegan, you do have a number of options open to you for protein. For instance, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter has 4.5 grams of protein, while 1/2 a cup of legumes has 9 grams of protein. A full cup of grains has 6 grams of protein.A cup of beans has as much as 15 grams of protein., Dark, leafy greens, such as kale or turnip greens, contain large amounts of calcium, an essential nutrient to keep your bones strong and healthy.The government recommends you get 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day.A cup of raw kale has 137 milligrams of calcium., Vitamin B-12 is important in maintaining healthy blood cells. It will also help keep the iron up in your blood. If you become anemic, you may not have the strength to lift weights.In the same vein, it's important to get enough iron in your diet to keep you from being anemic. Iron is in peas and lentils, as well as dark, leafy greens. One of the best ways to get both iron and vitamin B-12 is through enriched cereals.You'll also find vitamin B-12 in nutritional yeast.The government recommends you get 6 micrograms of vitamin B-12 daily and 18 milligrams of iron per day.Most enriched cereals more than cover your vitamin B-12 needs in a single serving, some having as much as 28 micrograms per serving. Read the labels to make sure you are getting enough.A cup of lentils (already cooked) will provide you with 37 percent of your daily value of iron., Zinc helps keep your body healthy. Therefore, it's important to get enough in your diet so that you can continue to build muscle mass.


Beans, enriched cereals, and pumpkin seeds are a great way to get enough zinc in your diet.
You should get at least 15 milligrams of zinc per day.To put this amount in perspective, you get 2.57 milligrams of zinc from 1/4 of cup of pumpkin seeds.After testing your zinc blood levels, you may find that a zinc supplement would benefit you.

, Omega-3 fatty acids help keep you heart in good shape, your body's most important muscle.For vegans, the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids are flaxseed, walnuts, and soybeans. Certain oils are also good sources, such as canola and soy.The American Heart Association recommends eating sources of omega-3 fatty acids at least twice a week., While you may think you need to lift everyday to build up your muscles, you really need to only lift 2 or 3 times a week for 30 minutes each time.In fact, the vegan diet may better sustain this type of workout method, rather than a long daily workout, as it allows more time for recovery., Don't work the same body parts everyday. Pick a day for each group, so that you are slowing building up each set. For instance, you could work on you front upper body one day, your back and buttocks the next workout, and you lower half at your next workout.Another strategy would be to do a full-body workout 3x/week so that all muscle groups are being hit 3x/week versus 1x/week. This is helpful if you are following a vegan diet because muscle retention/building is so important to overall health.


One exercise you could try for your front upper body is the barbell bench press. Lay down with your back to a bench. Lift the barbell up over your body with your arms almost locked. Have someone spot for you if you haven't done this exercise before. Lower the bar towards your chest, and then hold it for a brief second. Extend your arms back up, lifting the bar. Breathe in as you bring it back down, and breath out as you push it back up. Repeat 6 to 8 times until you begin to feel the strain, then set the bar up to take a short break.For your back and biceps, try a wide-grip lat pulldown. Once sitting on the bench, make sure your knees are up against the knee bar. Grab the bar from above. Push your chest out, and lean back a little. Pull the bar down using only your arms. Breathe out as you slowly bring the bar back up. Breathe in as you pull it back down. Repeat until you feel it in your muscles, and then take a break.For your legs, use a barbell squat. With the barbell at the correct height on a rack, center the bar on the back of your neck across your shoulders. Move away from the rack with the barbell on your shoulders with your feet shoulder-width apart. Squat down with the barbell still on your shoulders, as if you are sitting in a chair. Breathe in as you squat down. Try to keep your back straight. You should stop lowering yourself once your thighs are parallel to the floor. Breathe out and push yourself back up. Repeat 6 to 8 times, then place the barbell back on the rack for a break., If you're new to strength training, use the help available to you at your gym. Many gyms have trainers to help you learn how to properly use equipment, including weights. If you don't learn proper technique, you could injure yourself.Your trainer will work with you to learn techniques such as warming up (doing 5 minutes of aerobic exercise before lifting), keeping your body in proper alignment, increasing the weight you lift slowly, and learning to breathe properly while lifting., That is, you are trying to work certain muscles at a time. If it seems too easy and you don't feel anything while lifting, you may need to adjust the way you're lifting.Don't automatically switch to a higher weight. You don't want to strain your muscles by adding on too much weight too quickly., If you feel sudden pains or strains in your joints, you should stop that exercise. It's ok for the muscle to have slight burning, but you can injure your joints if you don't pay attention to them while lifting."

Step up the cardio.,
Try interval training.,
Do bodyweight exercises.,
Exercise With Weights and Machines.,
Meet with a personal trainer.",How to Get Rid of Back Fat1," For best results, exercise for at least 30 minutes at a time, three to five days a week.These cardio activities are particularly effective for getting rid of back fat. They will burn calories and strengthen your back muscles: Rowing, boxing and swimming.
Other cardio exercises to include are: running/jogging, walking, biking, using the elliptical or dancing.
The benefits of cardio don't just stop at toning your back. Cardio has also been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels, improve heart function, and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.You cannot ""spot treat"" or lose weight in only one particular area. You need to lower your overall body weight and decrease body fat to see a reduction in one particular area. Cardio exercises will help support this.;
, This is a way to burn fat more quickly. It will not only tone your back, but tone and trim fat from all over your body. Doing higher intensity interval training can help burn more fat and increase your fat burn after you've completed the exercise.One way to do interval training is by running: Run at a vigorous pace for several minutes, return to a more comfortable pace for five minutes, then speed up your routine for another two minutes. Continue your entire routine in this manner for 15–20 minutes.
Consider High Intensity Interval Training. The NIH defines HIIT as exercising at a high intensity for 30 seconds to several minutes with bouts of either no or low intensity exercise for a minute or two in between. Doing this actually amplifies the benefits seen in doing normal cardio exercises. It can improve your cardiovascular health and raise your metabolism.When exercising at high intensity, you should be perspiring and breathless enough that you cannot speak phrases or have a conversation.
Do HIIT training for 20 minutes, with an additional five minute warm-up and cool-down.

, There are some specific exercises you can do to strengthen your back that don’t require special machines. Many of these exercises can even be done at home.


Tie a resistance band to a doorknob. Shut the door and stand about 2 feet away from the door. Hold the ends of the resistance band in each hand and bend your elbows 90 degrees. Pull your arms back so that your shoulders are pushing together. Hold this position for 10 seconds and then release. Repeat the motion seven to 10 times. If you don’t feel enough resistance, move a little further away from the door or use a thicker resistance band.
Lower back extensions target the lower back and tone the muscles where that annoying fat hangs over the top of your jeans. To get started, lie flat on the floor, on your stomach. Place your hands behind your head and lift your chest and legs as far off the ground as you can. Three sets of 10 is a good place to start.
With bridge exercises, lie on the floor on your back. Bend your knees at a 90-degree angle, but keep your feet flat on the floor. Lift your buttocks up until your back makes a straight line-like a bridge. Hold it there for 10 to 15 seconds and then slowly lower your body back to the floor. Do this 10 to 20 times. .
Use the plank exercise to help tone your entire back and core. Place your forearms on the floor. Hold your body in a straight line. Hold this plank position for as long you can. Rest and repeat one to two more times.

, Using free weights or weight machines can also help tone your back. Combined with cardio and other strength training exercises, you can tone your back muscles easily.


Start with weights you are comfortable with. You should be able to lift them without too much strain. If you can lift the dumbbells with no strain whatsoever, you will not work your muscles.
Bent-over flys will help tone your upper back. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and bend over at your hips. Lift your arms out to the sides, like airplane wings, until they are at shoulder height and then lower them to your sides. Do three sets of eight repetitions each. As you improve the strength of your muscles and connective tissues and perfect the movement, increase the weight and the number of sets to build muscle. If you just want to tone, increase the number of repetitions.
For a Lat pull down, grab the cable bar, gripping it wide and in an overhand position. Position your thighs beneath the support and place your knuckles facing upwards. When you stretch up, the bar should be just within your reach. If it's not, adjust the height. Pull the bar down to your chin (all the while keeping your back straight) in one fluid movement, feeling your shoulder blades coming together. Slowly release the bar to its original height and repeat.
Do shoulder presses. Take two dumbbells, one in each hand. Hold dumbbells by your ears, palms facing forward. Press your hands straight above your head until your arms are fully extended. Lower back down slowly until your hands are again by your ears. Repeat one to three sets or as many as you’re able. These will develop your shoulders; deltoids that are well-developed can help the back look broader and the waist appear smaller.
Do bent-over rows. Place a dumbbell in each hand. Bend slightly at the waist – about 45 degrees. Extend arms straight in front of your, palms facing inwards towards each other. Pull arms back until your upper arms are next to your back. Release your arms slowly back to their fully extended position. Repeat one to three sets or as many as you’re able.

, If you’re just starting out with exercise or want more specific help, working with a personal trainer may be beneficial. They may be able to guide you towards reducing back fat and toning your back muscles.


Personal trainers are fitness professionals that have a wide variety of experience with exercises. Meet with someone and ask about what exercises you can do to help tone your back and reduce your overall body fat.
Many gyms offer a free trial of a personal training session when you sign up. They will most likely offer personal training sessions for a cost at a variety of times.
You may also be able to find personal trainers who have blogs or videos online that can give you more detailed information as well.

Cut your daily calorie intake.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Fill up on satisfying foods to cut down on hunger levels.,
Eliminate high-calorie drinks.,
Limit treats and indulgences.",How to Get Rid of Back Fat2," If you cut out 500 calories a day and exercise regularly, you will lose about a pound every week.This will also help you reduce your back fat.


Use a food diary or online food tracker to help you cut out 500 calories daily.
These food trackers in addition to online calculators can give you an estimated total daily caloric intake to help you lose weight. Everyone's needs will be different, so using a calculator can help give you a more specific calorie range.
Do not cut out too many calories. This can slow weight loss, lead to nutrient deficiencies or make you feel tired and fatigued. In general, health professionals recommend to eat a minimum of 1,200 calories daily.Cutting calories will help you lose weight, but without the cardio and back strengthening exercises, your back muscles will not get toned. It’s important to include both diet and exercise to get your desired result.

, Even if you’re cutting calories to help reduce back fat, it’s still important to eat a balanced diet.


Including a variety of foods from each food group will help you consume an adequate amount of nutrients each day. When you have a poor quality, unbalanced diet, this may work against your weight loss goals.Include protein at each meal. Protein is an essential nutrient in your diet. Foods like poultry, eggs, dairy, legumes, seafood or tofu provide adequate protein to your diet. Aim for a 3-4 oz (21-28g) portion at all meals.Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables each day. These foods are low calorie and nutrient dense making them great foods for a low-calorie diet. Try making ½ your plate a fruit or vegetable to help support your weight loss.
Lastly, it’s important to include healthy sources of grains like bread, rice or pasta. Grains provide fiber and a variety of B vitamins important to your health. If you can, choose 100% whole grains for more nutrients., When you're trying to lose weight and cut calories, managing hunger can be an issue. It's hard to stick to a diet plan, if you're feeling hungry often.


Combining certain types of foods and including the right types of foods at each meal and snack can help you stay satisfied longer after meals and decrease your overall hunger level.
Healthy fats are a great addition to a weight loss diet. Fat takes longer to digest compared to foods rich in carbohydrates and helps keep you satisfied longer. Include one to two servings of heart healthy fats every day. Try: olive oil, avocado, nuts or nut butters, flax seeds, olives, salmon, tuna, sardines or mackerel.
In addition to healthy fats, the combination of protein and complex carbohydrates helps you stay satisfied longer as well. Choose lean proteins or proteins with healthy fats like: seafood, poultry, beef, pork, low-fat dairy, legumes or tofu. Pair these with fiber-rich complex carbs like: starchy vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and whole grains.

, So often we forget about the liquid calories we consume. Replace the sodas and juices with water and hydrating, no-calorie beverages.


Drink adequate amounts of fluids like water, decaf coffee, decaf tea or flavored water to stay hydrated. Everyone requires different amounts of fluids, but aiming for 1.5-3 liters each day is a good place to start.
Studies show that drinking high calorie beverages can promote weight gain. Liquids do not necessarily make you feel full and most people will not count their liquid calories into their total daily intake.
Although switching from regular soda to diet soda may save you calories in the short term, it's not yet clear if it's effective for preventing obesity and related health problems.

, Part of healthy eating is including the occasional treat or special indulgence. But when you're trying to lose weight, you'll need to limit and monitor how often you eat a few extra calories.


When you indulge too often, you may consume too many calories. This may slow or even stop your weight loss.
If you really want a treat, try to compensate throughout the day or week to make up for it. You might want to work out a little longer or skip your afternoon snack.

Accentuate your waist.,
Avoid low-rise jeans or pants.,
Wear push-up and padded bras.,
Wear high heels.,
Wear the right size clothes.,
Buy vintage.",How to Get an Hourglass Figure1," Hourglass figures are all about the waist, and even if you don't have the traditional hourglass measurements, you can create the illusion of a tiny waist by wearing the right clothes and accentuating your waist whenever possible.Go for dresses that nip in at the waist, then flare out from the hips.
Wear trench coats or jackets with adjustable waist belts which you can tighten to give an hourglass silhouette.
Add belts of all shapes and sizes to any outfit to draw attention to your waist.
Go for jackets or tops with padded shoulders which will make your waist appear smaller by comparison.;
, Low-rise pants or jeans are those which sit on your hips, resulting in the dreaded muffin-top effect. Even if you don't carry much weight around your middle, low-rise jeans can push the smallest amounts of fat upwards, making you appear wider across the middle. This is definitely not what you want when aiming to achieve an hourglass figure.


Opt for high-waisted jeans which reach just under your belly button and keep any extra fat safely tucked away.
Go for dark wash jeans which make the leg appear slimmer and are more complimentary to curvier figures. Lighter colors are unflattering on all but the slimmest silhouettes.
Go for boot cut or flared styles, rather than skinny jeans, as these will even out the effect of the high-waist and avoid giving you a ""mom jeans"" effect.

, Hourglass figures are renowned for their fuller busts, but even if you're not naturally well-endowed you can achieve the same effect by investing in good quality bras. An under-wire bra will help lift the breasts, while a padded bra can give the appearance of greater size.If possible, go to a high-quality lingerie store where you can be measured and fitted for the right size bra. It's amazing how many women believe they are one size when they go to get fitted, only to find out that they have been wearing the wrong size for years.
A perfectly sized bra will work wonders for your confidence - and that's before you include any push-up or padding features - so if you suspect you may be wearing the wrong size, your first stop on the way to an hourglass physique should be the lingerie department!

, High heels are the perfect accompaniment to an hourglass figure. They make the legs appear longer and more toned while also lifting the butt. They improve posture and allow women to stand up tall and be confident, while also providing a sexy wiggle while you walk. For ultimate bombshell factor, aim to wear heels of at least three inches.

, Clothes look their best and are most complimentary when they fit your body perfectly. For this reason, you should avoid limiting yourself to one particular size and just go for what looks best on you. You'll feel more comfortable and confident in clothing that fits like a glove, so forget about the number on the tag.


Unfortunately, many women are stuck on the notion that they should be wearing one size and one size only, not taking into account that individual brands may be sized differently from one another and that a size twelve in one brand may be equivalent to a size eight in another.
Shop around and try to find a clothing brand or selection of brands which produce pieces that suit your body shape and make you feel comfortable, yet sexy.

, Many of the clothes produced in the 40's and 50's were much more flattering for curvier women, so consider rooting through vintage stores and thrift shops for dresses, skirts and blouses which produce an hourglass shape.


You might be lucky and find some amazing bargains, or you may want to invest in a vintage designer piece which will become a wardrobe staple for years to come.
Nothing will make you feel more like a real hourglass-shaped pin-up girl than replicating her wardrobe with authentic vintage pieces!

At first, pouring water down your throat each morning may feel difficult, especially if you're not used to drinking early in the morning; however, after a few days you should get used to drinking water early in the morning.If you're not a morning person, you may forget to drink a glass of water right away. It may be a good idea to leave yourself a note in a place you'll look right away in the morning, like near the fridge or coffee pot.
You can also set a daily reminder on your phone about drinking a glass of water. You can schedule it to go off each morning just after you wake up.;
, Oftentimes, people forget to drink water simply because of a lack of access. If you don't have water near you during work or school, you may neglect to drink it. Try carrying a water bottle with you throughout the day. Keep it at your desk at work or place it in the book bag you take to class.Try to pick a quality water bottle that will not break easily. If you have to spend a little extra money for a higher quality water bottle, it may be worth the cost.

, Try to make a point of taking the opportunity to drink water whenever you can. If you see a water fountain, stop and take a sip. Even if you're not feeling thirsty, make a point of stopping at a fountain to drink. These small sips of water will add up, resulting in an increased fluid take throughout the day., Go for water with all your meals instead of juice, coffee, tea, or alcoholic beverages. Have a glass of ice water when you eat at home. When you dine out, tell the waiter you're fine with water as a drink. Take a large sip of water before starting your meal. Then, take sips of water in between bites. Not only will this up your overall fluid intake, it will help you feel full faster., Many people dislike water due to the lack of taste. You can take steps to flavor your water to help you enjoy it more, giving you the incentive to drink it.


You can infuse your water with fruit to help increase the flavor. Try adding kiwi, strawberries, lemons, or lime to tap water.You can also buy flavored waters at the local super market. Just make sure to read the label. Make sure the waters are flavored with natural ingredients and do not contain added sugar.

, You can use other liquids as an incentive to drink more water. Make a point of drinking one glass of water for every non-water beverage you consume. If you have one glass of orange juice with breakfast, drink one glass of water as well.Two cups of coffee in the morning? Match it with two glasses of water.


This can be particularly helpful when drinking alcoholic beverages. If your stomach is filled with water, this can prevent binge drinking as you'll have less room for booze. Hydrating when drinking can also help prevent hangovers.

, Your water content does not have to be limited to pure drinking water. Your body will also benefit from water-based fruits and veggies. Go for radishes, zucchinis, strawberries, grapefruit, cucumbers, and celery., If you exercise heavily throughout the day, you may benefit from sports drinks. Sports drinks not only help replace fluids, they also replenish things like sodium, potassium, and electrolytes. In an exhilarating workout, these substances are often drained from your body. If you exercise intensely, consider having a sports drink after a workout.Remember that sports drinks are loaded with sugar, so to really get the most from them, dilute them. Fitness enthusiasts recommend six parts water to one part sports drink; however, just watering it down to equal parts water and sports drink is a great start to help you get more hydration. Over time, just add enough sports drink to you water to flavor it.

, Homemade popsicles are a fun and healthy treat that can help you up your fluid intake. You can puree your chosen fruit in a blender, mix it with enough water to create a paste, and place the mixture in an ice tray. Stick a toothpick or popsicle stick in the molds and leave overnight to freeze. In the morning, you can enjoy a nutritious, water-filled popsicle.Try to go for some of the water-based fruits, like strawberries, listed above for added fluid intake.

, When it comes to avoiding dehydration, you want to see how much water you need. As stated, 9 to 13 cups (two to three liters) of fluid, primarily in the form of water, is necessary for the average person; however, you may need to make a point of drinking more water under certain conditions.


If you exercise, make sure to drink extra water before, during, and after your workout routine.
If you're experiencing excess heat or humidity in your area, you'll need to drink more water than usual to make up for fluid lost through sweat.
When you're sick, particularly if you're vomiting or experiencing diarrhea, you'll need to drink more water to make up for lost fluids.
If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, you'll need more water. It's recommended that pregnant or breastfeeding women consume about 10 to 13 cups (2.4 to 3 liters) of water a day., A good way to assess if you're getting enough water is looking at your urine color. Clear or pale yellow urine indicates you're consuming a healthy amount of water. Darker yellow urine indicates you need to up your fluid intake., You should make an effort to make sure you're getting enough water. Try to keep a log, on your phone or in a journal, of how much water you're drinking each day. If you have a smartphone, there are many apps you can purchase that help you keep track of your daily water consumption., If you want to stay hydrated, certain beverages should be avoided. Certain fluids promote dehydration and should not be a part of a healthy diet.


Alcoholic and caffeinated beverages can cause dehydration. You should drink these beverages in moderation. You should also drink water while drinking alcohol, tea, or coffee to help counteract the effects of these liquids.Alcoholic and caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, teas, and colas, promote dehydration. You should avoid such drinks in general.Fruit juices are often heavy on carbohydrates and not enough sodium. Try cutting them with 50% water first to help hydrate yourself., Dehydration can cause serious medical problems. If you or someone you know is experiencing signs of dehydration, seek medical attention as soon as possible. Signs of dehydration include the following:Fatigue
Lack of appetite
Red or flushed skin

Be aware of the risks involved in corset training.",How to Get an Hourglass Figure2," If you are new to corset training, you should opt for an under-bust corset, rather than a full corset. This is because a full corset can feel very constricting and uncomfortable to someone new to corset training and it is important that the corset training process is not a painful one. Steel-boned corsets tend to be very well made and can significantly reduce waist size with proper wear and care., In order to reduce your waist size, you will need to choose a corset that is 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm) smaller that your existing waist size. For example, if you currently have a 26 inch (66.0 cm) waist, you should opt for a 20 to 21 inch (50.8 to 53.3 cm) corset (though beginners should lean more towards the 4 inch difference than the 5).


You can measure your current waist size by standing in front of the mirror and winding a measuring tape around the narrowest part of your waist, which should be an inch or two above your belly button.

, To avoid hurting yourself or damaging the corset, it is important that you break the corset in before tightening it fully. The corset needs to adjust to your body shape before it can do it's job effectively. To break in the corset, tighten the laces so that it sits snugly around your waist. It shouldn't feel tight. Wear it like this for a few hours everyday until the corset looses some of its stiffness and adjust to the position of your ribs and hips.

, Once the corset is broken in, you can start to tighten it a little everyday, to begin the process of waist reduction. Be aware that you should not attempt to close the corset fully until you have been wearing and gradually tightening it for several months. Only tighten the corset to the point where it still feels comfortable - you should not feel any pain or feel like you have difficulty breathing.

, The corset should be worn for three to six hours everyday, to get the full effects of waist reduction. Do not wear the corset for any longer than feels comfortable. You can wear the corset during most of your daily activities, though wearing it during exercise is not recommended.


Note that although some corset training sites recommend sleeping in your corset, this is not advisable. Corset training can be done in moderation and wearing it for 3 to 6 hours a day is more than adequate.

, Once you have managed to comfortably close the corset and have achieved a full 4 to 5 inch (10.2 to 12.7 cm) waist cinch, you can progress to a smaller sized corset to continue waist reduction, if desired. Be aware that you may reach a point where you are no longer able to close a corset fully, due to rib placement and body shape. This is perfectly normal and you should never attempt to force the corset closed - as this may cause you to hurt yourself or damage the corset.

, Many people are opposed to corset training as extreme waist reduction can cause rib bones to move and internal organs to shift. Although this is not normally dangerous, many people view it as being unnatural and unnecessary. In addition, corsets that are pulled too tight can reduce blood circulation, leading to poor muscle tone and the appearance of cellulite, so if you decide to go down the corset training route to achieve an hourglass figure, make sure you consider all the pros and cons first.

Do cardio.,
Firm and tone your butt.,
Work your legs.,
Shape your upper body.,
Increase the size of your chest.,
Trim your waist.",How to Get an Hourglass Figure3," Cardio workouts can help you achieve an hourglass figure by slimming down your midsection and providing you with toned and lean legs. Cardio also helps to keep your heart healthy and allows more oxygen to reach your muscles, so it's great for your overall fitness and health. Cardio is one of the best thing you can do to burn calories, helping you to maintain a healthy body weight, which is important for achieving your ideal pin-up girl look.


Running, cycling, dancing, step aerobics and swimming (to name but a few) are all great cardiovascular workouts, which will help you to trim the fat and tone as you go.

Interval training is one of the best exercise options if you're short on gym time but still want an effective calorie-busting workout - warm up on the treadmill for five minutes, exert yourself at full speed for 45 seconds, then slow down to recover for 90 seconds. Repeat this ten times, then cool down for another five minutes. Remember to stretch afterwards to loosen the muscles.Ideally, you should be doing 30 minutes of cardio five times a week.

, Hourglass figures require a sexy booty, so rather than trying to slim down your butt, you should be focusing on getting it firm and toned. Think along the lines of Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez and Nicki Minaj, whose rounded rear-ends perfectly offset their tiny waists. You should be doing lots of glute-friendly exercises which lift and round the butt, such as lunges, squats and leg curls.



Lunges are performed by starting with your feet shoulder-width apart, then stepping forward with your right foot into a lunge position, bending both knees until they form 90 degree angles. Your front knee should not extend over the toes and and your back knee should not touch the floor. Step back into your starting position, then repeat with the other leg. To make this exercise more intense, hold a dumbbell in each hand and keep your arms straight by your sides.Squats are performed by standing with the legs a shoulder-width apart, with the toes pointed outwards at 45 degree angles. Resting most of your weight on your heels, slowly lower your body straight down into a squatting position until your thighs are parallel with the floor. Return to a standing position, and repeat.Do leg curls by standing with your feet a shoulder-width apart, holding on to a bar or placing your hands on the wall for support. Curl your right leg backwards, as far as it will go, trying to touch your heel to your butt. Return to a standing position and repeat with the other leg. You can use ankle weights to increase resistance and the intensity of the exercise. You can also use the leg curl machine at the gym to perform this exercise., Toned, shapely legs that you can show off in pencil skirts and swimwear are the perfect complement to an hour-glass waist. Toned legs look great in heels and will help you to put a strut in your step! Remember that you want to maintain a hip size that is significantly larger than your waist, so don't focus too much on slimming down your thighs - just try to get them firm and fabulous! Lateral step-ups, side lunges and Pilates exercises specific to the legs are great for this.


Lateral step-ups are performed using a step that's about 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) in height. Stand with the step on your right-hand side and place your right foot on the step. Lean your weight onto your right foot and spring up and over the step, replacing your right foot with your left. Continue to spring over the steps, alternating sides.Side lunges are similar to front lunges and are great for working the thighs. They are performed by placing your feet a hip-width apart and raising your arms in front of you, til they are parallel, at shoulder height. With your right foot, take a huge step out to the side, lowering your body into a lunge position. Your right knee should be at a 90 degree angle and should not extend over your toes. Hold this position for a moment, then return to standing and repeat with the other leg.Pilates is a fantastic form of exercise for sculpting and shaping the legs, and you can see results in just a few short weeks. If you're already familiar with pilates, think about introducing Cadillac and reformer workouts into your routine, to truly add definition to your legs!

, Curves are fantastic, but having a little extra meat on your bones can lead to unwanted wobbly bits which you may wish to avoid. Exercises which shape your upper body - particularly the arms and shoulders - are an important part of any hourglass-focused workout routine, as they will help to bust any excess flab. Just think of how well your toned arms and shoulders would complement an hourglass figure in a strapless, waist-cinching gown! Bench dips, shoulder presses and arm circles are all good options.


A bench dip is performed using an exercise step or kitchen chair. Sit up straight on the edge of the bench or chair, extending your legs in front of you. Firmly grip the edge of the bench or chair and slowly slide your body off the bench, lowering yourself towards the floor. Keep your back straight, and keep lowering until your arms from a 90 degree angle. Push your body back to the original starting position and repeat.
A shoulder press is performed by holding a dumbbell in each hand and lifting the weights so they are at shoulder-level, with your elbows bent underneath. Slowly straighten your arms, lifting the dumbbells above your head. Don't lock your elbows. Hold the dumbbells above your head for a second or two, then slowly lower them back to the starting position and repeat.
Arm circles are easy exercises that can be performed anywhere. Th perform arm circles, stand with your feet about a shoulder-width apart and extend your arms straight out to the sides, so they're in line with your shoulders. Begin rotating your arms forward in small, circular motions, without moving your wrists or elbows. After about 20 circles, change direction and begin rotating your arms backwards. You can increase the intensity of this exercise by holding dumbbells as you do it.

, Hourglass figures aren't just about tiny waists and curvaceous butts, they're also famous for their fuller chests. Although too much cardio exercise can actually reduce breast size through weight-loss, there are some muscle training exercises you can do to build up the pectoral muscles beneath the breast tissue - giving the impression of a fuller chest while helping boobs to stay firm and perky. The best chest exercises for this include push-ups bench presses and the dumbbell fly.


To do push-ups, lie face-down on a solid floor, keep your legs together and prop your feet up on your toes and the balls of your feet. Place your hands palms-down on the floor, approximately a shoulder width apart. Raise yourself up, using just the strength in your arms, until both arms are fully extended. Slowly lower your body down again until your elbows form a 90-degree angle. Raise yourself back up into the extended arm position and repeat.
To do bench presses, you will need a barbell and an exercise bench. Place the barbell with the weights of your choice on a bench rack and lie flat on the exercise bench underneath it. Reach up and grasp the bar with your hands spaced about a shoulder-width apart. Slowly lift the bar off the rack, positioning the bar directly above the middle of your chest and extending your arms. Slowly lower the bar down to your chest, bending your elbows out to the sides. Press the bar back up to the starting position, and repeat.To perform a dumbbell fly, lie on your back and extend your arms directly above you, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Bend your elbows slightly and lower your arms out to the sides until your body forms a ""T"" shape. Hold the position for a moment, then slowly raise your arms to the starting position and repeat.

, Reducing the size of your waist is perhaps the most important part of achieving an hourglass figure. To do this you will need to combine weight loss with targeted core workouts. Be careful though - many traditional core exercises - including those often practiced as part of pilates workouts - can actually bulk up the core muscles causing the waist to flatten out and become wider. This is the last thing you want when aiming for an hourglass figure! Instead, you should do core exercises which focus on the lateral and oblique muscle groups, in order to tighten and trim the waist. Side crunches, side planks and pull-ups are good options for targeting these muscles.


To do a side crunch, lie with your back on the floor, put your hands behind your head and lift your knees in the air, bent at a 90 degree angle. Raise your head and shoulders slightly off the floor and bend upper body sideways to the right. Imagine that you are trying to touch your right hip with your right elbow. Remember to keep your lower back and hips firmly in place as you perform the exercise. Return to the starting position and repeat on the other side.
To do a side plank, lie on your right side on the floor, with your feet stacked on top of one another. Use your right elbow to prop yourself up - your forearm should be flat on the floor, perpendicular to your body, and your right elbow should be directly underneath your right shoulder. Your entire body should form a straight, diagonal line from your head to your feet. Hold this pose for 30 seconds (if you can!), keeping your abdominal muscles and glutes tight. Repeat on our left side.
To perform pull-ups, you will need an exercise bar. Grasp the overhead bar with your fingers facing towards you - this is a difficult pull-up position but is best for exercising the lateral muscles. Pull your body up towards the bar, until your chin is slightly above it. Hold for a second or two, if possible, then slowly lower yourself back to the starting position. Try to avoid extending your arms completely as this will keep your muscles engaged. Repeat.

Drink more water.,
Drink tea.,
Avoid alcohol.,
Avoid soft drinks.",How to Get a Flat Stomach in Five Days1," It’s counterintuitive, but the more water you drink, the more easily your body will let go of excess water, including any water that’s making your belly look bigger and rounder. Drinking 16 ounces of water prior to meals can also help you eat less, which can lead to weight loss.If you don’t like the taste of plain water, try adding lemon. Lemon water (with no sugar added) will add flavor to otherwise plain water as well as give you a nice boost of vitamin C.;
, In addition to drinking plenty of water, try incorporating green and black tea into your daily fluid intake. Tea can help boost your mood, reduce your risk for stroke and heart disease, and also help kickstart your energy. With a little extra energy, you can feel more pumped up for exercise!Green tea, especially, is high in the antioxidants known as catechins, which have been shown in studies to aid in weight loss., Alcohol is high in calories and will make you more likely to eat foods you hadn’t planned to eat. It will only hinder your efforts. If you do choose to keep drinking, keep it down to one or two alcoholic beverages now and then.Remember that “one” drink is different for different types of alcohol. One glass of wine, for example, is about 5 ounces, but one standard beer is usually about 12 ounces. Both of these constitute “one” drink, despite being different quantities., Carbonated beverages can cause bloating because of their gas content, and they quickly pack on the sugar. You are better off sticking with water, lemon water, tea, or coffee. When choosing drinks, avoid processed sugars or sugar substitutes, which are often found even in diet sodas. Opt for naturally flavored sparkling water if you need your carbonation kick.

Include regular cardio.,
Do push-ups.,
Use dumbbells for a bench press.,
Try dumbbell flys.,
Include exercises for your whole body as well.",How to Get Rid of Man Boobs Fast1," Although aerobic exercises will not necessarily tone your upper body, they will help support weight loss and the decrease in your overall body fat.As your body fat amount decreases, the toned muscles underneath will be more visible.


Include at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity cardio exercises each week. This is any type of activity that gets you to sweat and makes you slightly out of breath.For more results like quicker weight loss, increase your cardio time to 200 or 300 minutes per week.Exercises to try include: jogging/running, playing sports, swimming or using the elliptical.
Remember that to lose fat, you need to aim to achieve a sustained elevated heart rate of 70% to 80% of your heart rate maximum.;
, This common exercise is a great move that specifically targets and isolates the chest muscles.To do this exercise:


Bring your body down into a plank position. Your hands should be placed on the floor at a width slightly wider than your shoulders.
While keeping your body in a straight line, slowly lower your body by bending your elbows back, pointing towards the ribs or hips, and away from your body. Lower until your chest is about 1-2 inches off the floor. Slowly push back up into the starting position.
Increase the intensity of this exercise by turning regular push-ups into plyo-push-ups. Once you have lowered your body, instead of coming back up slowly to the starting position, explosively push yourself up into the air. Aim to be able to clap your hands in front of your chest while you're mid air.

, This exercise move uses the weight of two dumbbells to work your pectoral muscles.To do this exercise:


Grab two dumbbells. Lay down on a bench with your legs bent and feet flat on the ground.
Hold one dumbbell in each hand. Lift both arms straight up towards the ceiling with your palms facing away from you.
Slowly lower the dumbbells down toward your body. Your elbows should be bent at a 90 degree angle and your upper arms parallel to the floor in the finishing position. Push weights back up towards the ceiling and repeat.

, Similar to the bench press, dumbbell flys work your pectoral muscles and your inner arms.Grab two dumbbells. Lay down on a bench facing the ceiling. Your legs should be bent so your feet are flat on the floor.
Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Extend your arms out to the sides and parallel to the floor. Your elbow should just be slightly bent.
Bring your hands together, palms facing each other, in front of your body. Arms should remain extended.
Slowly lower your arms back down until they are again parallel to the floor.
Repeat the exercise eight to 12 times and when you are strong enough, perform two or three sets of eight to 12 repetitions.

, While toning your arms and chest can be helpful, it is also important to do exercises that will target, your legs, back, and abs. Aim to develop a total body strength routine and include cardiovascular exercise as well.


Develop a fitness plan for yourself that includes at least 30 minutes of moderate cardiovascular activity five days per week and that includes two weekly strength training sessions that target all of your major muscle groups."

Cut your calorie intake.,
Eat six small meals a day.,
Cut out processed foods.,
Keep healthy snacks handy.,
Eat plenty of fruits and veg.,
Drink more water.",How to Get an Hourglass Figure4," Getting an hourglass figure is all about hitting the correct proportions - you don't want to drastically reduce your weight as some curves are essential to achieve this particular body shape. On the other hand, you are trying to reduce your waist size, which will require a certain amount of dieting. A healthy diet will also reduce bloating and water-weight, which is particularly good for shaving inches off the tummy area.


Cutting your total calorie intake, as well as being aware of the type of calories your are consuming (such as calories from fat, from protein, from fiber etc.) will help you to achieve your goals.
An ideal body fat percentage for an hourglass figure would be somewhere in the 17%-25% range - you want a certain amount of body fat to achieve those fabulous curves, but you also want to be trim and healthy.
If you need to lose weight in order to achieve a body fat percentage in this range, remember that one pound is equal to 3500 calories, so you will need to cut that many calories from your diet in order to lose weight., Maintaining a healthy diet is almost impossible if you are trying to starve yourself. Luckily, it is possible to lose weight and keep your stomach happy by eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day.


Eating more often means that you don't allow yourself to become too hungry between meals, which significantly reduces the risk of overeating.
It also stimulates your metabolism, helping your to burn calories faster. Aim to eat six small, healthy meals a day, rather than three larger ones.

, Even if you cut your calorie intake and reduce our portion sizes, your weight loss can be painfully slow or non-existent if you are eating the wrong types of food. Processed foods with high sugar or starch contents can limit weight loss and lead to the build-up of harmful toxins in the body.


Processed foods often have a high salt content too, which leads to water retention and a bloated appearance. Instead of ready-meals and frozen foods, opt for fresh, organic produce and whole grains.
Watch out for ""non-fat"" versions of foods like yogurts, cheeses and other foods, because although their fat content may be low, they are often packed with sugars and other empty carbohydrates which provide no nutritional value.

, Always having an array of healthy snacks at your disposal will help keep you satisfied between meals and prevent you from turning to fattening or processed options like potato chips and cookies. Try to keep a supply of delicious, seasonal fresh fruit in your kitchen, along with other healthy nibbles such as nuts, raisins, wholewheat crackers and rice cakes.

, You've heard it before, but increasing your daily intake of fruit and veg will do wonders for helping you to maintain a healthy diet. Fruit and vegetables are natural, unprocessed foods which contain none of the nasty additives or preservatives that pervade so much of our food today. They have a high nutritional content and are very low in calories - which basically means you can eat as much fruit and veg as you want!


Go for different colored fruit and vegetables to add interest to your mealtimes while benefiting from a wide range of vitamins and nutrients. Dark, leafy greens such as spinach, kale and cabbage are a particularly good option, as they are packed with vitamins and minerals which contribute to a healthy immune system.
If you're in need of a sugar-hit after a long day of work or a hard cardio workout, reach for a banana. They will provide you with the carbohydrate -filled energy boost you need without the accompanying crash that comes from eating chocolate and other junk food. Bananas also lower blood pressure, help the digestive system and improve your mood. What's not to love?, Water improves the appearance of skin, hair and nails while also flushing harmful toxins out of the body. Drinking a glass of water before mealtimes will also help you to eat less, as it stops your body from confusing symptoms of thirst with hunger.


If you have implemented an intense workout routine, drinking water is also important to prevent dehydration, which can cause headaches and a loss of muscle function.
You should replace any carbonated drinks - regular and diet - with water. Carbonated drinks are full of empty calories and harmful, processed sweeteners which build up your system and cause bloating and weight gain. They should be the first thing to go when you're trying to shed pounds!

Stay away from alcohol.,
Avoid carbonated and fermented beverages.,
Say ""no"" to sorbitol.",How to Get a Flat Stomach in a Week1," You always need to drink water, but it can be especially important if you're trying to flatten your stomach. When you drink water, you help your body maintain proper fluid balance, stop water retention (a major cause of bloated bellies) and feel full so you're inclined to eat less overall. Water also breaks down fat for energy and moves nutrients to your muscles to maintain your metabolism.


Add lemon, orange or cucumber slices to your water to give it a little flavor boost; you can also try herbs and flowers such as mint or lemon verbena.;
, Among its many benefits, green tea can also lay claim to helping reduce belly fat thanks to antioxidants called catechins that it contains. For extra fat-burning power, sip green tea before a workout.

, Smoothies are a great way to stay hydrated and can contribute to a flatter stomach. When you make a smoothie with watermelon, you have the advantage of an amino acid known as arginine that's found in watermelon. A study in the Journal of Nutrition found that arginine can decrease body fat and increase lean muscle mass.A smoothie made with pineapple gives you the benefit of bromelain, an enzyme in pineapple that helps break down protein, ease digestion and banish bloat.


Watermelon smoothie. Chop up two cups of watermelon and put it into a blender. Add 1/4 cup of fat-free milk and blend for about 15 seconds or until smooth.. Add 2 cups of ice and blend for 20 seconds or until you get the consistency you like. This recipe serves two.Pineapple smoothie. Measure 1 cup of skim milk and put it in a blender along with 4 ounces of fresh or canned pineapple chunks. Set the blender to ""whip"" and blend for 1 minute. Pour into a glass and add 1 tablespoon of cold-pressed organic flaxseed oil. Makes one serving., Ginger helps calm your GI tract and can help reduce bloating. Add some fresh, grated ginger to your green tea or boil some chopped pieces of the root to make ginger tea.

, It's no accident that many restaurants offer diners peppermint candies after their meals--peppermint is a digestive aid. Brew a peppermint tea or add peppermint leaves to water or green tea.

, When it comes to flattening your stomach, alcohol is not your friend. It makes your body store more of the fat you eat and burn up to 36% less fat than you normally would. It can also inhibit your body's production of fat-burning hormones., These drinks have gas in them, and when you consume them, you end up with gas in your intestinal system, which leads to a swollen and bloated belly.

, Sorbitol is an artificial sweetener found in some diet sodas. While it adds sweetness without adding calories, the problem is that our bodies have trouble digesting the substance. And it's not just some sodas that contain sorbitol, look for it in yogurts, reduced-calorie foods, chewing gums and hard candies.

The CDC recommends adults get roughly 150 minutes of aerobic activity and strength train at least twice a week.If you’re already exercising that much, try to up your routine.


Contrary to popular belief, hand exercises will not lead to slimmer hands. First, “spot training” where a person targets a certain area of their body for exercise and weight loss is largely a myth. Second, even if exercising certain muscles for weight loss were possible, your fingers don’t have any! The muscles controlling your fingers reside in your palms and forearms.;
, The other safe, effective method of weight loss is through eating well. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables, especially green leafy ones like lettuce and kale. Lean meats, such as chicken breast and a variety of fish, are also an important part of a healthy diet. Just be sure to watch those calories and avoid large amounts of processed sugar by steering clear of simple carbohydrates and candy. Don’t skip meals, as this has the potential to cause major health problems., “Chubby” hands may actually be swollen ones. Swelling can be caused by water retention, which may be due to mild dehydration.Sometimes that type of hand swelling can be caused by drinking too much water, causing an imbalance of electrolytes in your body.If your hands swell after exercising for at least an hour, try drinking a sports drink instead of water.
If proper hydration doesn’t improve swollen hands or if it is accompanied by vomiting and confusion, see a doctor. Swelling in the hands and other extremities can be a sign of serious medical problems., Eating too much salt can cause fluid retention, making your hands swell. Avoid foods like salted peanuts, potato chips, processed meats, and soy sauce. If you’re having trouble cutting those out of your diet, buy low sodium versions available at most supermarkets.

Reduce your overall calorie intake.,
Reduce portion sizes.,
Focus on whole foods.,
Choose healthy fats.,
Increase your fiber intake.,
Eat grapefruit.",How to Get a Flat Stomach in Five Days2," Consider cutting the number of calories you consume each day. Eat normally for one day and keep a log of your caloric intake. Try to reduce that intake based on the weight you’d like to lose. For example, a pound equals 3,500 calories. If you currently eat about 2,500 calories per day, you could reduce your daily intake to 2,000 calories, and potentially lose 1 pound in about 7 days.Don’t cut your caloric intake too drastically right away. Not only could this be potentially unhealthy, it could also lead to what is called “yo-yo” dieting. This is when a dieter loses a lot of weight quickly, but then ends up gaining it back by returning to their normal caloric intake. It’s best to shave calories off your daily intake slowly.
If you don’t usually count calories and aren’t sure about your maintenance level, there are many websites and apps that can give you an estimate. Simply punch in your gender, age, height, weight, and activity level, and these tools will tell you how many calories you need to eat to maintain your weight.

, In addition to reducing your overall calorie intake, try to consume smaller individual portions, taking care not to eat too much at any one time. Eating too much at once can cause bloating and gas, so spread your calorie consumption evenly throughout the day. Read nutrition labels on foods. These will tell you the actual serving size for that food.Try using smaller dishware. When you use a smaller plate size, for example, you can fill it up and trick your brain into thinking you’ve eaten more than you have!
To further enhance the effects of eating smaller portion sizes, try eating slowly and taking plenty of time to chew each bite. You may eat less, and you’ll also avoid bloating by swallowing less air.

, Processed foods will only hinder your efforts, as they tend to be high in some combination of sugar, fat, and sodium. Use your calorie allotment on whole foods instead: fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and low-fat dairy.Dairy is a whole food, but note that if you are lactose intolerant, it will cause bloating, gas, and other digestive issues. Get your protein and calcium from other sources instead. Try taking a multivitamin if you are worried you aren’t getting enough calcium, and add a low-carb protein shake to your daily routine.
Take particular care to avoid sweets and snack foods made from refined white flour, sugar, and trans fats. These foods will make your problem worse, not better.

, Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are much better for you than saturated fats and trans fats. Oils that are derived from plants, like olive or sunflower oil, as well as things like nuts and avocados are all great sources of monounsaturated fats. These can help lower cholesterol and are heart-healthy.Substitute olive oil for butter or other cooking oils, or combine it with vinegar for a homemade salad dressing. Even just drinking one or two tablespoons of non-virgin, extra light olive oil each day is said to kickstart weight loss., Your body needs fiber, especially when it comes from healthy vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains. Incorporating high-fiber foods can make you less hungry and help you lose weight. Don’t overdo it, though – too much fiber can contribute to gas and bloating. Aim for about 30 grams of fiber each day.One way to get your fiber without risking excess bloating is to eat high-fiber cereal for breakfast. Try having a bowl of raisin bran, shredded wheat, or another type of high fiber cereal.
You can also try having a bowl of oatmeal or whole wheat toast for breakfast. Starting your day with high-fiber complex carbohydrates is a nutritious choice for eliminating extra weight: these kinds of carbs take time to digest, do not cause a blood sugar spike, and keep you feeling full.

, Although the research is controversial, many people think grapefruit can help you burn fat. It does, at least, seem to help regulate your metabolism and your blood sugar levels, and it contains phytochemicals that can reduce insulin levels, prompting your body to burn fat. Try eating a fresh grapefruit before each meal to help curb your appetite and help you feel full.For best results, eat the white part of the grapefruit as well, and try eating it first thing in the morning to jumpstart your metabolism.

Add abdominal exercises.,
Dedicate an hour to cardio.,
Try high intensity interval training.",How to Get a Flat Stomach in Five Days3," To get a flatter stomach (and one that has nice visible muscle tone once any excess fat gets burned off), you’ll need to engage your abdominal muscles. This includes the external obliques (those on the side of your torso) and the rectus abdominus (those that make that amazing “six-pack”). There are a variety of core exercises that will work your abdominal muscles. Try incorporating a few sets of each into your regular exercise routine.Basic crunches: Lie down, bend your knees, and lift your shoulder blades off the ground. Hold the position for a few seconds, then lower yourself back down.
Lower Flexion: lie down on your back and raise your legs into the air. Hold, then lower them slowly back down.
Double Flexion (a variation on crunches): Lie on your back, and raise both your legs and your shoulders off the ground at the same time. Your body should form a slight ""V."" Hold the position for a few seconds, then carefully lower your legs and shoulders.
Side Flexion (another variation on crunches): Lie on one side, resting yourself on your arm, bent at the elbow. Raise yourself up into the air, supporting yourself with your arm.

Planks: Lower yourself to the floor, facing it. Support your body weight on your elbows and the balls of your feet while keeping your body absolutely straight.
Upper Twist: While standing with your feet about shoulder-width apart, keep your lower body still and twist the upper part of your body from side to side. These can be performed on a gym machine or by using a gym rod held on your shoulders.
Lower Twist: Lay down on a padded floor or floor mat. Then, bend your knees and begin to twist the lower part of your body from side to side while keeping your upper body still.

, Cardiovascular exercise—running, swimming, dancing, biking—gets your heart rate up and helps you burn fat. Since you’re trying to make a difference in just five days, dedicate a full hour to cardio every day. Bump it up to two hours if you have the time and ability.


Calorie burns vary a great deal from person to person—but as an example, a typical 155-pound person burns around 298 calories running at 5 miles per hour for thirty minutes., There is no way to “spot reduce” fat, so if you want to get a flatter belly as soon as possible, start with exercises that burn a lot of calories. High intensity interval training (or HIIT) torches calories by having you alternate between bursts of very high intensity exercise and brief periods of recovery.There are a number of different HIIT training programs, and you can incorporate interval training into most kinds of cardiovascular exercise. For example, if you walk and run, a HIIT routine might have you sprint for 100 meters (328.1 ft), then walk back to your starting point; you’d then repeat this 10 times.
Calorie burns vary a great deal from person to person, but HIIT workouts may burn up to 15 calories per minute, or up to 450 calories in 30 minutes."

Go with cardio.,
Do your crunches.,
Work your core.",How to Get a Flat Stomach in a Week2," Nothing beats aerobic exercise in the battle against belly fat. A study by Duke University found that aerobic exercise was the most effective way to burn deep, visceral belly fat and that aerobic workouts burn 67% more calories than resistance training or a regimen that combines cardio and resistance.The Department of Health and Human Services recommends that healthy adults get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity (think brisk walking or swimming) or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity (such as running) spread throughout the week. Activity sessions can broken up throughout the day but should be at least 10 minutes long. If you're looking to lose weight, you'll have to increase the intensity, the duration or both.

, There may never be agreement among trainers as to whether or not crunches are the best way to flatten your abs, but there's no disputing the fact that they work the muscles on the front and side of your abdomen.



Pelvic Tilt Crunch. Lie face-up on a stability ball with your back and head pressed into the ball, your feet together on the floor and a 5- to 10-pound dumbbell or medicine ball in your hands positioned against your chest. Tighten your abs and crunch up until your shoulders are off the ball. Then use both hands to reach the dumbbell or the medicine ball up toward the ceiling.

Arms Over Straight-Leg Crunch. Grab a pair of 10- to 12-pound dumbbells and lie on your back with your arms behind you and your legs extended and raised to a 45-degree angle. Bring your arms up over your chest and lift your shoulders off the mat while raising your legs until they're perpendicular to the floor. Return to your starting position without letting your legs touch the floor. Do three sets of 15 repetitions with a 30-second rest period between sets.

, Your core is made up of your abdominal muscles plus the muscles of your lower back, pelvic floor and hips--more than 15 muscles in all. For a really flat stomach, you need exercises that target all of these muscles.



Side Plank. Lie on your left side with your elbow directly beneath your shoulder and your legs stacked one on top of the other. Place your right hand on your left shoulder or on your right hip. Tighten your abs and lift your hips off the floor until you're balancing on your forearm and feet so that your body forms a diagonal line. Hold for 30 to 45 seconds. Repeat on the opposite side.

If you can’t hold the pose for 30 to 45 seconds, stay up as long as you can and work you way up.



Push-up Walkout. Get on the floor in a push-up position and place your hands so they're two inches wider than your shoulders. Keeping your feet in place, walk your hands out as far as possible, then walk back. Do 10-12 reps.

Improve your posture.,
Choose belly-flattening fashions.,
Use shapewear.",How to Get a Flat Stomach in a Week3," Standing up taller can make you look five pounds lighter, so why wouldn't you do it? Stand in such a way that your pelvis is relaxed and downward with the belt line slanting forward and your backside angled back and behind (not under) you. Line your rib cage up with your stomach. Roll your shoulders back and let them drop down gently. Center your head over your spine and elongate the back of the neck by imagining a string tied to and gently lifting the crown of your head.

, There are a lot of ways to put your wardrobe to work for you in the battle against the belly. By choosing the right fabrics and styles, you can create the illusion of a smaller tummy.


Pick fabrics that skim the body. These include woven cotton, silk or rayon blends and lightweight wool blends. Stay away from fabrics that cling such as Lycra and lightweight knits; they tend to emphasize every bulge.
Divert the eye. Look for garments with features that draw the eye away from your mid-section. For example, tops with detailing around the neckline or a ruffle down the center give the eye something else to focus on rather than your stomach. Wrap tops and dresses are also good choices as long as they're not made from the kind of clingy fabric you're looking to avoid.
Add a belt. Use a wide belt in a dark color to cinch your waist, separating the hips and bust and creating a waistline.
Play around with patterns. Geometric and floral patterns can be a good way to disguise a bit of a belly, but you'll have to experiment at bit with the size of the pattern; make sure it's scaled to your body size.
Put color to work for you. Yes, black is the most slimming color, but it's not your only choice. Celebrity stylist Phillip Bloch recommends purple, navy, burgundy, eggplant, charcoal gray and deep emerald for a slim look.

Reduce your intake of high-fiber foods.,
Adjust your fruit and veggie portions.,
Check for a lactose intolerance.,
Choose potassium-rich foods.",How to Get a Flat Stomach in a Week4," Instead of three large meals that can fill your belly and tax your digestive system, eat small, frequent meals or snacks. Eat your meals about two to three hours apart; they'll take up less space in your stomach, cause less expansion, keep your metabolism up and keep you feeling full.

, Many high fiber foods, such as broccoli, beans, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower, cause gas and bloating. Eliminate them from your diet during this week. When the week is over, gradually add them back one at a time. You might find that some bother your stomach more than others, and you can adjust your diet accordingly to get your fiber and keep your stomach flat.


Fight back against gas-producing foods by using Beano, which contains an enzyme that helps to break down complex sugars found in beans and cruciferous vegetables so that they can be digested more easily.

, While raw vegetables and fruits are great choices for overall health, they cause your stomach to stretch, so it's best to eat them in smaller portions spread throughout the day.

, If dairy products cause uncomfortable gas and bloating, you may have difficulty digesting lactose, the sugar found in dairy. Try eating low-lactose foods such as yogurt, consume only small amounts of milk products at one time and eat them with other foods. You can also buy lactose-free products or take a digestive aid such as Lactaid to help break down the lactose in your digestive tract.

, Eat high potassium foods including avocado, mini bananas, papaya, mango, cantaloupe and nonfat yogurt (made without artificial sweeteners). Potassium is a natural diuretic, so it will help reduce water retention and puffiness."

Wear gloves when possible.",How to Get Rid of Chubby Hands2," Longer nails and nail beds can give the illusion of longer, thinner fingers. Nail shape also plays a role. Filing your nails to a round or “squoval” shape is best for short, wide fingers., A pinching, too-small ring can make even thin hands look chubby! Accurately determine your ring size. Don’t just guess! The same thing goes for bracelets and watches.

They can also create the illusion of a more slender silhouette. However, minimal hand jewelry is also advised if you’re self-conscious about your hands. Consider wearing your flashiest accessories elsewhere to accentuate the attributes you’re proud of.

, If you’re extremely self-conscious about your hands, gloves may give you a confidence boost. Short nylon gloves with frilled edges work with many casual outfits. For dressier occasions, formal gloves are popular. Formal gloves can be a variety of lengths from short to very long, reaching past your elbow. Pick the type that is most flattering for you. When the weather gets chilly, wear insulated gloves.

Take in fewer calories.,
Control hunger with protein.,
Limit fats.,
Focus on whole grains and complex carbohydrates.,
Eat nutrient-dense foods to feel fuller.,
Try to avoid processed foods.",How to Fight Age‐Related Weight Gain1," As you age, you can't eat the same amount you used to when you were younger. You'll need to cut back a little just to maintain your weight. That means eating a little bit less than you did before at each meal. Even a few bites here and there can help.To understand how many calories you need to maintain your weight, try using an online calorie calculator. These calculators, which can be found by a quick Google search, use factors like your age, weight, and gender to predict how many calories you need per day. For instance, a 50-year-old woman who is 5' 8"" and 150 pounds and who's somewhat active needs 1,850 calories to maintain her weight, while a man of the same height, weight, age, and activity level needs 2,000 calories.;
, While you don't want to eat excessive amounts of protein, adding protein to snacks and meals can help you feel fuller for longer. On the other hand, many carbohydrates will leave you feeling hungry more quickly.For instance, try a boiled egg with whole grain toast and tomato slices at breakfast or a snack of hummus and sliced veggies.
Try to focus on lean proteins, such as chicken, fish, and beans.
Aim for about 0.8 to 1.5 grams of protein for every pound of body weight.Therefore, if you weigh 150 pounds, then you would need to get between 120 and 225 grams of protein per day.
A serving of protein is about the size of a deck of cards sized portion of meat. You can also weigh out the portion into a 3-4 ounce serving. A serving of beans/lentils/pulses is one cup.

, You do need some fats in your diet, but you should try to limit them, as they are high in calories. Healthy fats and oils include foods like avocado, vegetable oils, and nut oils.In the past, people have been advised to steer clear of saturated fats, such as in coconut oil, butter, and chicken skin. However, new studies have shown that saturated fats are mostly harmless, so they are fine to consume in moderation.The daily allowance for women over 31 is 5 teaspoons, while it's 6 teaspoons for men. Eating an ounce of nuts also counts as 3 teaspoons of oil, as does half an avocado.

, When eating carbohydrates, try to eat more whole grains, such as oatmeal, buckwheat, millet, and quinoa. Whole wheat pasta and bread are also good options. Other complex carbohydrates include fruits and vegetables.As you focus on whole grains, try to eliminate or reduce sugars and simple carbohydrates such as pasta, white bread, baked goods, and sweetened beverages (including alcohol).

, If you have trouble sticking to a healthy diet because you always feel hungry, try filling up on foods like fruits and vegetables. Vegetables, in particular, are low in calories but high in fiber, meaning you can fill up without eating too many calories., While you can sneak a few processed foods like chips and frozen dinners every now and then, avoid them as much as you can. These foods are often high in salt and fat, plus many foods, like chips, encourage you to keep eating. Stick to healthy, whole foods that you cook yourself."

Watch your carbs.",How to Follow a Morning Ritual to Lose Weight and Stay Slimmer1," By the time you wake up will have gone anywhere from six to nine hours without any food. A hectic morning might make you want to grab a quick doughnut and coffee to go, but you'll be better off having a balanced meal that gives you nutrients for the day


While you should always strive for a balanced breakfast, having two or less cups of coffee in addition to nutrient-rich food can jumpstart your metabolism for the day. Coffee is also a rich source of antioxidants. Avoid cream and sugar to keep it lower in calories.Eating in the morning can help get your metabolism moving and keep you feeling full and energized until lunch. Skipping breakfast may seem like a way to cut your calories, but fueling your metabolism using healthy options is important to jumpstarting your weight loss goals.;
, It's really important to load up on protein rich foods in the morning. Researchers at the University of Missouri, for example, have found that people who consume a breakfast of 35 grams of protein are less likely to gain body fat as opposed to those who ingest less. Protein requires work to digest and will make your metabolism get to work early and leave your body feeling full longer. Dairy . Dairy is a great source of protein. Milk, cheese and yogurt are chalk full of whey protein. A cup of greek yogurt with nuts can yield 26 grams of protein and adding a glass of milk can put you at your 35 gram goal. Cottage cheese is another great option with a 4 ounce serving containing 13 grams of protein. Whey protein, found in dairy, will help keep your blood sugar stable and helps curb cravings and unhealthy food choices.
Eggs. Eggs are a great source of protein. Whether you like them hard-boiled, scrambled, or fried, eggs can be a great way to get your morning protein with as much as 6 grams per egg. They are also such a versatile food that you likely won't run out of new ways to deliciously prepare them.
Lean meats. Although you may be tempted to grab some bacon, it is best to get your protein through lean meats. Chicken and salmon are ideal options. If you want to have sausage or bacon, make it turkey meat for a leaner, healthier option.

, While potatoes, toast, doughnuts and bagels are common breakfast foods, these high carb, low protein foods will be burnt quickly by your metabolism and leave you feeling hungry and sapped of energy.


There are good and bad carbohydrates. Medical research recommends adults get 45-65% of their calories from carbohydrates. You can get the benefits of carbs without the bad by making good choices. Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and beans have carbs but are full of fiber and important vitamins. Carb rich foods high in fiber can have great health benefits but you'll want to avoid refined ""white"" grains (like white rice and white bread) and sugary processed food in favor of plant based, whole grain options.

Repeat positive affirmations daily.",How to Get Back to Healthy Eating After Overindulging," Many times, it's easy to throw in the towel after a few unhealthy meals or days of eating. You may think you've ""ruined"" your day by an unhealthy meal, but that doesn't mean you can't make positive choices the rest of the day!


Everyone makes mistakes or gives into temptations — that's a normal part of being a human being. But if you're trying to eat healthy or lose weight, a few slips are OK. Don't give up just because you indulged more than usual.
If you've slipped up try to immediately think of the next healthy choice or lifestyle behavior you can make.;
, Overeating or overindulging — especially over a few days — can make you feel really guilty or like you've failed your healthy eating plan. But that's not true. You haven't failed anything and there's nothing to feel guilty about. Remember, overeating and indulging in some unhealthier foods is part of normal eating.The difference between a ""cheat meal"" and completely falling off the wagon is how fast you can get back into the groove. Remember that all is not lost if you get off track. Simply get right back on.
Do not engage in negative self talk or negative thoughts. Try to stick to saying positive affirmations or mantras to keep your mind in a positive place. This will lead to more success long-term.Many times, continued negativity can lead to increased stress or feelings of guilt which may also trigger a binge or perpetuate unhealthy eating patterns., The original goals you may have had or were working toward might seem much farther off after overindulging. But you can get right back on track by rewriting your goals and how you plan to meet them. This little refresher can help get you motivated.


Review your old goals and think about how you might want to change them long-term. Also consider if you should change how you're going to meet those goals.
You can also use your journal to keep track of your food and drinks as well.

, Sometimes the amount of changes you need to make to get back to your normal routine can feel overwhelming. However, making a schedule or plan can make it seem more manageable.Try scheduling in your physical activity during the week. Write out which days you're going to work out, at what time, and for how long.
Write up a meal plan for your healthy meals and snacks. This will give you the framework for grocery shopping and healthy eating.

, Although in the long-term, getting on the scale somewhat regularly is important to weight loss, hopping on right after a few days of overeating might not be a good idea. Chances are the number is higher than you'd prefer. This might stress you out, make you upset or increase your feelings of guilt or failure.Instead of worrying about the scale, focus your energy and attention on your goals and the steps you're taking to get back on track to your healthy lifestyle. The scale can wait.
Give yourself at least a few days or a week or more until you get back on the scale. Skip the scale until you feel like you've been back on track for awhile.
It is advisable to get back on the scale at some point. It might not be right away, but be sure to make plans to check in with your weight when you feel the time is right.

, Eating and preparing all your meals and snacks at home will help you control the ingredients in each of your dishes. This will allow you the freedom to add in lots of lean protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains without added salt or fat that can be found in restaurant meals.In addition to cooking meals at home, use cooking techniques and methods that are lower calorie or lower fat. Cooking in a lot of oil or butter or using higher fat, higher calorie ingredients may only perpetuate your overindulgence.To make home cooking easier, go to the grocery store and stock up on your favorite healthy foods. Try to purchase: lean protein, low-fat dairy, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.

, Starting your day with fiber and protein can help get you back on track with healthy eating. Both fiber and protein take longer to digest compared to simple carbohydrates and both help you stay satisfied longer.Eating breakfast can also help you set yourself up mentally for a healthy day.Breakfast ideas that are both high in fiber and protein include: whole grain oatmeal with blueberries and nuts, a veggie omelet with low-fat cheese, or greek yogurt with sliced peaches and a sprinkling of granola.

, Follow up your healthy breakfast with a lunch that's packed with vegetables. Pack your salad with a variety of different vegetables for a meal that can fill you up with little calories.Vegetables are high in vitamins, minerals and fiber but also low in calories and fat — a great food group to indulge in as you get back on track.
Also include a source of lean protein on your salad. Again, protein helps keep you satisfied longer.

, It's natural to feel a little hungry in the afternoon — especially if there is a longer period of time between your lunch and dinner. Skipping an afternoon snack and being overly hungry for dinner may cause a binge or overeating.Snacks should be around 100-200 calories. Including fruits, vegetables, and lean protein helps keep snacks calorie-controlled while still being nutritious.Healthy snacks can include: carrots and hummus, celery and peanut butter, or greek yogurt with fruit.

, Aim for about eight glasses or 64 oz of clear, sugar-free liquids like water, iced tea, or no-calorie flavored waters. Often, dehydration feels like hunger and tempts you to snack or eat more than you should which can throw off your ""get back on track"" eating plan.


Monitor the volume of liquids you consume by purchasing a labeled water bottle. This will help you achieve your water goal throughout the day.
Even mild dehydration has side effects. Many times, dehydration can cause afternoon fatigue and grogginess.Prevent this by sipping all day long.
Flushing your system with water is one of the best ways to feel better when your eating hasn't been up to par.

, Overindulging often includes eating larger portions of food. After a few days of larger portions, it can be difficult to get back to appropriate portion sizes. If you automatically plan on leaving a few bites on your plate, you can help yourself slowly get back down to smaller portions.


Another trick is to serve your meals on smaller plates — like a salad plate. The smaller amount of food available may help you decrease your overall food consumption., Exercise will not only support weight loss, but can help you get into a good mindset for the day or week when you're getting back to your normal routine. Try to include some sort of physical activity about three to four days each week. Aim for 150 minutes or 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity physical activity each week. Incorporating regular aerobic exercise into your daily routine will support your weight loss. Aerobic activities can include exercises like: walking, jogging, swimming, biking, or hiking.
It's recommended to include two days of strength training each week.Strength training includes activities like: weight lifting, Pilates, or isometric exercises like push-ups or crunches.
Getting started with an exercise plan can be hard — especially if you're doing it alone. Working out with a friend or partner can be a great motivator to keep you on track and showing up for your weekly sweat sessions., Experts recommend trying to get between seven and nine hours of sleep each night. Adequate sleep helps with mood balance and appetite control— both of which are important if you're aiming to get back on track with healthy eating.


To help get your body ready for sleep, turn off all lights and electronics. Also try to avoid using electronics at least 30 minutes prior to your planned sleep time., No matter how long you've overindulged, having a support group or people by your side can make getting back on track be a little easier. Whether it's your spouse, family, friends or co-workers, a support group can be your cheerleaders that will motivate and encourage you through this process.


If you'd like, you can sign up for diet programs like Weight Watchers and go to their weekly support group meetings.

, Sometimes after a few days of overeating you can begin to feel a bit negative or down. Repeating positive affirmations daily can help boost your mood and spirits and put you in a better mindset to get back on track. Come up with your own sayings or use a few of these daily:


""My body feels great when I feed it the right types of foods.""
""Exercise makes me feel energized and puts me in a great mindset for my day.""
""I have the willpower to make healthy choices today.""
""I'm doing the best I can to get back on track with healthy eating.""
""Indulging occasionally is OK and I'm back on track today.""

Don't go shopping on an empty stomach.",How to Avoid the Temptation to Eat Unhealthy Foods," When you experience a food craving, stop for a moment and observe your own thinking and responses. Research shows that taking a moment to stop and recognize your mental and physical state can cause cravings to dissipate.Stop and ask yourself: why do I want this? What exactly am I feeling right now? This may not always work. But, at least in some cases, pausing to scrutinize your thought patterns can lead to healthier decisions.It can also help to take a moment to inventory, mentally, what you've already eaten that day. Often, this can trigger your brain to feel satisfied, rather than longing for more.;
, Other psychological research shows that visualizing desired behavior can help you follow through on it.Pause for a moment and try to imagine, as vividly as you can, the rewards of making the right decision.
For example, imagine yourself ten pounds lighter, and what you will look and feel like if you consistently eat a healthy diet.

, Similarly, some have suggested the visualizing the negative consequences of bad decisions can help people make good ones.For example, imagine finding out you have diabetes, or imagine yourself 20 pounds heavier.This may seem severe. After all, one bowl of ice cream isn't going to make you diabetic. But, exaggerating the harm of the unhealthy choice can make it less appealing.Also keep in mind that this is not about shaming yourself. Neither your current nor your appearance is the focus here. Rather, the idea is make the consequences of your decisions vivid. The goal is to help you make good choices, not feel bad about yourself.

, When you are craving something unhealthy, don't tell yourself ""no."" Instead, tell yourself, ""maybe I'll eat it later.""


Psychological research shows that often, deciding to eat something later on is enough to stop the craving. Chances are, in a short time, the craving will have passed.By saying ""later"" instead of ""no,"" you trick your brain into letting you make the right decision. You can say ""no"" when you aren't experiencing the craving anymore.

, If you are genuinely hungry, it's okay to eat! But, instead of eating cookies or potato chips, make yourself a healthy snack. This can be doubly effective if you can identify your cravings. A particular food craving might point to something lacking in your diet. For example:


A chocolate craving might suggest you need magnesium.Instead, try snacking on natural fruits, nuts, leafy greens, or take a vitamin/mineral supplement.
A craving for sugar or simple carbohydrates (like white bread) might suggest your body needs protein or complex carbohydrates for energy.Carbohydrates break down into sugars. Since sugar metabolizes quickly, it is not a good source of long term energy. The best sources of energy are protein and complex carbohydrates, which break down more slowly. Good examples include brown or wild long-grain rice. Pasta or bread made from whole wheat flour are also good options. For protein, nuts, cheese, low-fat milk, beans, or lean meats are good choices.A craving for fried foods might suggest a need for good fats, like Omega 3 fatty acids. Try eating more fish, or check your grocery store for milk, cheese, or eggs containing these oils.You can also take a fish oil supplement if you don't like to eat actual fish, or incorporate flaxseed in your diet by mixing it into muffins or oatmeal. Walnuts and fresh basil are also sources of omega-3 fatty acids.
A salt craving might mean you are lacking important electrolytes like chloride, calcium, sodium, and potassium.You might also need hydration, or vitamin B.When you desire something salty, try a glass of water. If this doesn't work, a banana and some yogurt might do the trick. If you have these cravings frequently, you may wish to try taking a vitamin B supplement or multivitamin.

, When you do have a snack, try to choose healthy options that satisfy the same snacking desires. For example:


For a salty crunch, try popcorn instead of potato chips. Fresh, air-popped corn is best, but if you opt for microwave popcorn, pick a low fat variety.If you are craving some candy, try some trail mix with dried fruit and maybe a few chocolate chips. This can be a good source of complex carbohydrates and healthy fats.Or, have a little piece of dark chocolate. It's lower in sugar, and high in healthy antioxidants.
If you want French fries or onion rings, try some lightly salted edamame, which is high in fiber and protein. Or, fix yourself a baked potato for few calories and more fiber.
If you're dying for some ice cream, try a sorbet or frozen yogurt. These are still high in sugar, so don't go crazy. But, these options have a lot less fat--often none at all.

, Restaurant meals, and especially fast food, are full of salt and other unhealthy ingredients. Making your own healthy and tasty meals will help you resist the cravings for restaurant food.Pack a lunch when you go to work. If you have your own healthy food, you'll be less tempted to grab a quick bite at a drive-thru, or to have the pizza your co-workers ordered., When you feel a food craving coming on, try to occupy yourself with something else.Ideally, you could make this a healthy activity, like going for a walk around the block. But, you could also call a friend or work on a project around the house.Food cravings are often triggered by boredom or fatigue. Keeping yourself occupied will help ward off either of these., Sleep deprivation causes your body to need (and crave) more calories to keep going. It has been linked to cravings for junk food.Getting a good night's sleep should reduce unhealthy food cravings.


Likewise, sleep deprivation can weaken your willpower, making it harder to resist cravings., Psychological research shows that a lot of snacking occurs in an absent-minded way, as part of a routine. Breaking these routines can help reduce cravings.If you often eat a snack when you watch TV, you may start to want a snack every time you watch TV. Try to be aware of these routines and break them.
You can do this by changing the physical space. For example, you might move your TV to another room for a while. This change will weaken the association between TV and snacking. You can move it back once you've broken the habit.
Studies also show that eating snacks with your non-dominant hand will mean you eat less and will also weaken these habits. So, if you give in and and snack, give it a try., Tasty but unhealthy foods are part of many of our celebrations. Whether it's birthday cake or pumpkin pie around the holidays, sweet and fatty foods go with good times. Try to moderate how much of these things you eat.Not many people are likely to turn down a slice of cake on their birthday. Go ahead and have a piece! But keep in mind, it doesn't have to be a huge piece. You can take part in the celebration (and often satisfy your craving) with just a small piece of cake., One surefire way to make sure you don't eat unhealthy foods at home is to not have them in your home. If you're really serious about keeping these foods out of your diet, get rid of them!You can't eat what isn't there. If you eat your meals at home and only have healthy ingredients to prepare them with, that's all you'll eat.

, As the old saying goes, ""out of sight, out of mind."" If you aren't willing to toss out everything unhealthy, move it so that it is less visible and accessible.Studies show that people consume candy in transparent containers like glass jars more quickly than candy in opaque containers.If you keep potato chips in the house, keep them in a closed cupboard.

, The flip side of hiding your junk food is making sure that healthier options are more easily seen and accessed. This will increase the likelihood of eating them instead.For example, keep fruit out on the counter. If there are apples in plain sight, but the potato chips are hidden away, this will make you more likely to go for the fruit.
Take some time to do food prep on the weekends by washing and cutting fresh vegetables that will then be available to quickly snack on throughout the week. For example, carrots, celery, zucchini, and broccoli.
Try washing and freezing some grapes that have been removed from the vine. Frozen grapes make a great healthy snack when you are craving something sweet.

, Research shows that when you go to the grocery store hungry, you are more likely to make impulse buys. This often means unhealthy food. Try eating a small, healthy snack just before a trip to the grocery store. This will reduce the temptation to make junk food impulse purchases.Once again, if you don't buy unhealthy food, you can't eat it. Go to the store with a full belly and make good choices.
Planning what you are going to eat for the week and shopping accordingly is also a great way to make healthy eating easy.

Don't confuse ""wheat-free"" with ""gluten-free"". A product labelled ""wheat-free"" may contain gluten in the form of grains such as rye, barley and oats, each of which contain gluten. In addition, a gluten-free product may contain proteins not suitable for someone who is allergic to wheat.
Understand what it means to be ""gluten-free"". There is no consistent definition of what ""gluten-free"" means. There is, however, an international standard for ""gluten-free"" products produced from cereals containing gluten. This is the Codex Alimentarius, and it permits products to be called ""gluten-free"" if there are less than 200 parts-per-million of gluten in the finished product.Many manufacturers follow this standard.

A new standard has been proposed for gluten-free products made from foods that do not naturally contain gluten. This would allow a product to be called ""gluten-free"" if there are less than 20 parts-per-million of gluten in the finished product. It isn't always possible to make products absolutely free of gluten, because tiny amounts of food containing gluten could get into these products when they are being made or transported. However, 20 parts-per-million is a very low level.



, Read as much as you can about different foods. Processed foods can be a problem when it comes to hidden gluten. Even after many years of being gluten-free, you may still be discovering new products that contain gluten. Examples of such sources include some glucose syrups, smoked foods, ice cream and tomato ketchup.


Read the packaging. Since November 2005, pre-packaged foods sold in the EU are required to show clearly on the label if they (or any of their ingredients) contain sources of gluten. This applies even if the sources have been specially treated to remove gluten. Bear in mind that this EU regulation applies only to cereals and that other foods containing gluten--such as some glucose syrups--needn't be identified as gluten sources.
Research on the internet. You can check many processed foods and their individual ingredients by searching online.
Never eat anything without knowing what's in it. (No more secret ingredients in your aunt's special recipe!) Be politely persistent. Explain clearly why you need to know exactly what you're being served. Simply removing the croutons from your gluten-contaminated soup isn't enough. You're not being pushy, you're just protecting your health. Be nice about it, however, if you want to be invited back.

, Just because it's not food doesn't mean it can't contain gluten. And products that you use to clean yourself and your home may be culprits. Again, remember to check the label and research online if you have any doubts about the product that you are using.


Check the ingredients of your medications. Some medicines contain gluten in the form of starches and fillers. If the packaging doesn't list the ingredients, check with your pharmacist, who may be able to suggest gluten-free alternatives.
Look for the ingredients in household products — particularly make-up, shampoo and skin lotions. You may also want to check on the contents of children's art supplies and also home building supplies. People vary in their sensitivity, but you may find that you absorb sufficient gluten from such products to cause a reaction.

, You can get a lot of support — and a lot of information — from local organizations and internet groups. It's worth considering even if you're not usually a joiner. The internet makes it easy to feel like you're part of a community without doing that much work.


Be on the lookout for support groups offering help to those diagnosed with celiac disease. Forums, blogs, and other internet resources exist to make life for celiac sufferers a lot easier. Helpful hints, recipe tips, and coping mechanisms can motivate you to breathe easier and trust in your ability to push through.

, A little planning can really protect your health and make it easier to be gluten-free.


Have a separate cupboard for your gluten-free products in order to prevent contamination. If this isn't possible, at least reserve a top shelf for gluten-free items. Be especially wary of sharing jam, butter, toasters and other items regularly associated with bread or other gluten products.
Be sure to clean surfaces in the kitchen and have clean utensils before preparing any gluten-free food.
Think ahead to holidays, parties and other festivities. Plan your gluten-free food well in advance so you know what you'll be eating. If a party is at someone else's house, offer to bring some food to share — gluten-free, of course!
Plan your travels with food in mind. It can be handy to keep an emergency travel-pack of gluten-free snacks — such as popcorn — to take on trips.

, Now that many people are eating gluten-free by choice because they believe it is a healthier option, it is much easier to find gluten-free products in supermarkets and natural-food stores. There are also many gluten-free recipes available. If you are a confident cook, you could even adapt your favorite recipes to gluten-free versions yourself!

, If you are celiac or gluten-intolerant, be sure to praise those who feed or share food with you when things go well. If mistakes are made and anyone takes it lightly, be sure to explain clearly the consequences you will suffer as a result of the mistake. If you don't speak up, others may not take your situation seriously enough to help prevent future problems.

, Although there are some things you can't eat, there are actually many more that you can. Having a positive outlook will go a long way in your ability to live a better life, even if you don't have celiac.

, The big four gluten culprits are wheat, rye, barley, and triticale. Avoid these in all cases, whether you are only gluten-intolerant or have celiac.Wheat to avoid includes kamut and spelt.Because wheat often goes by another name, here are varieties of wheat to also definitely avoid:

Bulgur
Durum flour
Farina
Graham flour
Kamut
Semolina


Rye contains a protein called secalin, which is a form of gluten.Triticale, a cross between rye and wheat, is actually a hybrid designed in laboratories in the late 19th century.Barley is the last big gluten cereal to avoid. It is commonly made into meals and used in alcohol production, among others.

, White oats themselves do not contain gluten, they are often cross-contaminated with wheat because both are commonly processed in the same facilities.Avoid eating oats and oatmeal unless the packaging specifically designates the product as gluten-free.

, In theory, the distillation process removes all gluten proteins if done properly, even if the alcohol was manufactured using a glutinous grain (such as wheat, barley, or rye).


You can safely drink alcohols such as vodka manufactured from wheat, but be wary of beer.Look for beer that is specifically designated gluten-free.
In theory, the distillation process removes all glutinous proteins. But in reality, cross-contamination may occur. Not only this, but some distillers may add mash to alcohols after distillation as a filler. This may cast doubt on alcohol's ability to deliver truly safe results.
If you really want to be careful, stick with potato-based vodkas, tequilas and mescals, or rums.These all contain non-gluten grain sources, so they should be fine to drink.

, Checking labels is important. While many of the following kinds of foods have been and are being made gluten-free, many of them aren't. It's better to be safe than sorry. Avoid:


Breads, croutons, cereals, and crackers
Cookies, cakes, and candies
Imitation meat, imitation seafood, processed lunch meats, and ""self-basting"" poultry
Salad dressings, gravies, sauces (such as soy sauce), and vegetables in sauces
Pastas and ""seasoned"" rice mixes
Soups, matzo, and processed snacks like chips (potato chips and tortilla chips)

, Not all grains, cereals, and flours contain gluten. In fact, most don't. Here is a list of all the cereals, grain, and flours that are good to eat!


Cereals and grains: rice, maize, quinoa, tapioca, sago, buckwheat, and sorghum.
Flours: rice, corn, potato, maize, graham, soya, chickpea, sorghum, tapioca and chestnut flours are all okay — but check the label for possible contamination.
Breakfast cereal: this can be tricky. Check carefully and avoid brands containing wheat, oats, barley, rye, or malt extract. No Rice Krispies!! This contains barley malt extract. Gluten-free muesli is good, but boil thoroughly if it's made from crushed rice. Add fruit for flavor!

, All are basically fine — just check any coatings, sauces and spices you add. Check wafer-thin meats, too. (Sometimes wheat flour is added to make them peel apart more easily).


When ordering fish in a restaurant, check with the chef — sometimes fish is fried with flour to stop it from sticking to the pan.
Again, avoid processed lunch meats, and all imitation meats or seafood, as they may contain gluten.

, Milk, cream, cheese and yogurt should be fine to eat. Check any added ingredients, and check ready-grated cheese. (Sometimes wheat flour is added to prevent the slivers of cheese from sticking together).


In some cases, celiacs are dairy-intolerant because of intestinal damage. This situation can improve over time, and it's important to keep eating dairy foods in moderation during recovery (perhaps a little cheese once in a while) to avoid permanent dairy-intolerance.
If you’re lactose-intolerant, or avoiding dairy for other reasons, try soya milk or rice milk (check label for contamination). You may be able to handle goat’s milk. If you find you are intolerant to soya, it may be intestine-related and should clear up over time.

, All fruits and vegetables are naturally gluten-free. Check ready-made pie fillings, coatings, sauces and spices though, as these can be thickened with flour.

, You can eat butter, margarine, and oils, but avoid suet and check low-fat spreads.

, Check desserts every time. Meringue, jelly, and most ice creams and sorbets will be fine, but unless specifically labelled gluten-free, cheesecakes and pies will not be good for you.

, Nuts, raisins and seeds are all naturally gluten-free, but check any added coatings and check all packets of crisps (chips) and other savory snacks. You can be fooled by these items, especially when the recipes change. Check every label, due to contamination issues.

, Pure salt, pepper, herbs, and vinegar should be fine. Check spices and mustard powder, however, for added flour.


As for cooking and baking ingredients, yeast, bicarbonate of soda and cream of tartar are all good, but check baking powder for added flour.

, Of course, water is totally gluten-free and should make up the most of what you drink for health reasons. Here is a breakdown of what's okay and what's not for other drinks:


Soft drinks: coffee, tea, juices, cocoa, fizzy drinks and most squashes are fine. Check that they don’t contain barley or ""cloud,"" and don’t drink beverages from vending machines.
Pure fruit juice contains no gluten, just flavor and vitamins.
Be careful about ""smoothies."" These are sometimes just fruit juice and yogurt but sometimes have other ingredients, so be sure to check.
Probiotic drinks are a new trend. Check them, but they should be fine if you can handle dairy products.
Plain tea is gluten-free, as are any milk or sugar that you add, but be wary of drinks from vending machines, as there may be cross-contact with other products. Herbal or fruit teas and infusions are probably gluten-free.
Plain coffee is gluten-free, but be careful of flavorings and other additions (e.g. some chocolate toppings to go on cappuccinos, lattes, etc). Again, be careful about using vending machines.
Wine should be gluten-free whether still, fizzy, sweet or dry, although there are reports that some Australian wines are treated with hydrolyzed wheat gluten as part of the fining process. Again, the level of gluten is not detectable in the final product, and it is considered to be gluten-free.

, Talk with your dietician about maintain a healthy intake of essential vitamins, like iron, fiber, calcium, niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, and folate.These vitamins are often added to grain products in order to enrich them. Cutting grain-products out of your diet completely may put you at risk for vitamin deficiency.

, We've all done it. Accidentally eating gluten is just something that happens, although with time and patience, it becomes a much less frequent occurrence.


If you do accidentally eat gluten, you may experience stomach cramps, abdominal pain, and even diarrhea. This is not uncommon, and usually it's nothing to be worried about.
If you accidentally eat gluten and you seem to be experiencing no discomfort or symptoms, don't necessarily take that as a sign that you can begin eating gluten again. Gluten can still damage your small intestines, even if you aren't aware of the symptoms., Going gluten-free is a boon to many, many people. Still, it takes a while to get used to, and it doesn't happen overnight. Here are some small and big things that you'll need to get comfortable with as you live your new, gluten-free life.


It can get expensive. Gone are the days of getting $1 loaves of bread and $2 cupcakes. More like $8 loves of bread and $5 cupcakes.
It can be inconvenient. Because of the dearth of gluten-free food, and especially fast food, it's hard to grab food on the run. You'll definitely spend more time cooking up a storm in your kitchen, which is the plus to balance out this minus.
People will think you're high-maintenance, or an a fad diet. Most of your friends will be understanding, but some people who don't understand that you may have a disease will write you off. Don't worry. They aren't worth it. Go about your life as you please and kindly educate people that falling off the gluten wagon isn't exactly the same as falling off the diet wagon.

Reduce your consumption of fried foods.,
Reduce your consumption of processed foods.,
Switch to cooking oil without high omega 6 levels.,
Avoid oils high in linoleic acid.",How to Balance Omega 6 With Omega 31," Many foods, especially fast foods, are fried in vegetable oils that are very high in omega 6 fatty acids. You can cut out these high amounts of omega 6 altogether by avoiding foods such as fried chicken, French fries, and fry bread, among many others.Common omega 6 fatty acids are linoleic acid (LA) and gamma linoleic acid (GLA) and can be found in many vegetable oils.
Despite the high amount of omega 6 in vegetable oils, many restaurants continue to use them. Vegetable oils are stable at high temperatures, and they impart more flavor into food.;
, Processed foods are typically made with cheap vegetable oils high in omega 6 and low in omega 3. Eating too many processed foods results in an unhealthy increase of omega 6 fat intake.By reducing and replacing processed foods with whole foods and vegetables, you will decrease your consumption of omega 6 fatty acids.

, Olive oil is a good choice for cooking because it is very low in omega 6 fatty acids and saturated fat. Be sure to avoid using any partially hydrogenated oils because they tend to be high in trans fat.Some other oils that are low in omega 6 and saturated fats (and are thus good for cooking) are high oleic safflower oil, high oleic sunflower oil, and canola oil.

, Linoleic acid (LA) is high in omega 6 and low in omega 3. Frequent consumption of oils with linoleic acid will heighten the imbalance between omega 6 and omega 3 in your diet. Oils with LA include: peanut oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, regular sunflower oil, regular safflower oil and corn oil.In excess, these oils promote inflammation in the body.

There are very few cooking oils high in omega 3 fatty acids, and the oils that are high omega 3 fatty acids, such as flax oil, tend to break down too quickly for high-heat cooking.

Continue doing cardiovascular exercise on most days.,
Include strength training in your exercise routine.,
Start slower if you need to.,
Find something you enjoy.,
Add ""secret"" exercise into your life.",How to Fight Age‐Related Weight Gain2," Don't slow down on exercise as you age. You should be exercising about 150 minutes a week or 30 minutes most days.Try to do something that gets your heart pumping, as that will help you burn off calories and help keep your heart healthier.For example, you might try taking a dance aerobics class, going for a jog, or swimming some laps at a local pool. Even a fast-paced walk can get your heart pumping faster. You don't have to run a marathon.
Try to find something that you enjoy doing to increase the chances that you will stick with it.

, Strength training can increase your resting metabolic rate, which tends to decrease as you age.Along with your 150 minutes per week of cardio, the CDC recommends getting at least two strength training sessions every week that work all of your major muscle groups, including your legs, abdomen, back, hips, arms, shoulders, and chest.If you have never done strength training, then you might want to try working with a personal trainer. A personal trainer can develop a strength training program for you that will help you reach your goals.
You can include other types of exercise as well to build strength, balance, and flexibility, such as yoga.

, If you haven't been exercising, you may not want to jump into a 30-minute routine five to six days a week. Don't fear! Even exercising 10 minutes a day can have benefits. Start where you are and work up to more., Exercise doesn't have to be something you dread. With all the different types of exercises out there, you may just need to search around a bit to find what you enjoy. Once you hit on something you like, you'll be more willing to spend time doing it.For example, maybe you'd enjoy taking up ballroom dancing with your partner. Swimming is also a great option because it keeps you cool and doesn't put as much stress on your joints. It's also a good full-body workout.

, You don't just get exercise when you hit the gym. You can also increase the amount of physical activity you get in a day just by making different choices. For instance, you can take the stairs instead of the elevator.You can also park your car farther out in the parking lot when you go to the store.
Try taking your dog for short walks instead of letting it go out in the backyard.
Gardening can also be good exercise.

Get enough sleep.,
Change your attitude.,
Skip the cigarettes.,
Slow down on alcohol.,
Consider hormone replacement at menopause.",How to Fight Age‐Related Weight Gain3," You may think skimping on your sleep is okay once or twice a week, as long as you catch up on the weekends. However, when you don't get enough sleep, you're more likely to reach for unhealthy foods, plus you're likely to snack more overall. The extra calories can affect your weight.Generally, you should be getting somewhere from seven to nine hours of sleep every night.Try to set a routine for sleeping. Go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time every day. That trains your body to be sleepy when you go to bed.
Start getting ready an hour before bed. Turn off your electronics, as they can disrupt your sleep, and do your nighttime routine.

, You may have heard gaining weight over time is something you can't do anything about. However, if you take a defeatist attitude, you're more likely to gain weight over time.

, Alcohol can also make you age more quickly. Plus, it adds calories to your diet. You don't necessarily need to quit altogether, but you don't want to drink more than a drink or so a day. Less is better., If you're a woman, one thing that can lead to weight gain is the change in your hormones when you reach menopause. Hormone replacement therapy has been known to slow down weight gain for some women, so talk to your doctor if you think it's a good option for you.This may only be a temporary solution. Lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, may provide a long-term solution. Talk to your doctor to find out what is best for you.

Get moving first thing in the morning.,
Make your activity part of your morning routine.,
Start your day with cardio.",How to Follow a Morning Ritual to Lose Weight and Stay Slimmer2," Morning exercise has a lot of important benefits. It improves your sleep and gets your metabolism off and running. Plus, those who maintain morning exercise routines are way more likely to lose and keep off weight than those that don't. , Waking up groggy with a work day looming can make exercise one of the last things you want to do. It will take discipline but getting moving first thing can build a healthy habit. You'll want to exercise at least three times weekly to make it part of a routine.


Treat your workout like an obligation. By allowing time each morning for it, you'll be more likely to stick to it and incorporate it into your daily routine.
Bring a friend. Sometimes it can be hard to stay on track by yourself and a workout buddy brings accountability. If you want to cancel, it won't be just yourself you're letting down and you can provide motivation for one another.

, Whether you like speed-walking or jogging at a local track, adding this to your mornings three to four times a week is a great way to lose weight and start your day. If you're new to cardio, you might want to start with a combination of walking and jogging until you build up stamina. Start with continuous movement, a mix of running and walking, for 15 minutes per morning and work your way up.


If you have knee problems or running is difficult for you, walking is a great form of cardio on its own. You don’t need to run to get worthwhile exercise.
There is some debate whether cardio is better or worse on an empty stomach. It's probably better to eat first since too much exercise without fuel can have negative effects on your overall health. "

Hit the weights.",How to Follow a Morning Ritual to Lose Weight and Stay Slimmer3," Just because you are eating healthy does not mean you need eat bland food in the morning. Visit cooking websites and buy healthy cookbooks that give you a variety to your breakfast.


Restaurants can sometimes serve high-fat foods cooked in unhealthy oils. However, some breakfast places offer great healthy options. You can take the guesswork out of eating out by researching nutrition information online before you go. This can remove the hassle of having to cook your own meal and also make the experience a little more enjoyable if you're doing it with friends.

, If your routine becomes boring and something you dread, you may be less likely to stick with it. It's important to find morning activities that will jumpstart your metabolism but also that you like enough to make a long-term commitment. There are lots of options to start your day with that are outside traditional exercise.


Sports. Whether you do it alone or with friends, sports like basketball and racquetball are great cardio. The competition can be great to keep you on track and the unstructured movements are great for your joints and muscles. Make time before work where you meet friends for your sport of choice.
Yoga. Yoga may look like a lot of sitting and breathing, but it can be a great calorie burner. Thirty minutes of yoga can burn up to 180 calories. It's also great stretching for your muscles and a great way to mentally prepare for the day. Walk the dog. If you have a four-legged companion, you'll both benefit from a morning walk. This will get you out and moving and help keep your dog healthy in the process. Plus, those hopeful eyes of your dog waiting for a walk can be great alarm clocks to spring you from bed.

, Jogging or walking can be hard on the knees. If you have a nice area to bike, starting your morning with a ride can be a great start to the day. Start with a mile and build up your stamina from there.

, If you like traditional exercise, swinging by your local gym on the way to work can be a great way to get yourself invigorated for the day. Seeing the same people every morning can be a great incentive to wake up and make your way to the gym, too.


Elliptical machines and treadmills. Set the machine with a level you are comfortable with and move at your own pace. Most machines will tell you how long you have been using it and your calories burned, so that you can track your progress. If you are short on time, cycling through 30-60 intervals of high intensity then low intensity can be a great workout.
Stationary bike. This can help you burn calories and keep your legs toned without the wear and tear of treadmills or jogging. Make sure that you set the pedal resistance high enough to give you a great workout and keep continuous movement. If you're not used to this type of workout, start small with ten minutes and move up from there.

, Cardio and a proper diet are great, but turning muscle into fat is a great way to keep your body naturally burning calories. Even at rest, those with higher percentage of muscle than fat burn calories. Start small. It can be intimidating walking into a new gym, but every one is in the same boat of trying to improve their health. Don't try to do more weight than your body can handle because you're afraid of looking weak.
High repetitions, low weight. A great to keep your body toned and lean is to do repetitions of 20-25 per exercise set. This will get your heart rate up as well. To do this you'll need a light weight to complete the repetitions.

Balance omega 3 with omega 6 in your diet.,
Eat two portions of fish a week.,
Select grass-fed meat.,
Follow a Mediterranean diet.",How to Balance Omega 6 With Omega 32," In the typical western diet, the average ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 is 15:1, and can be as disproportionate as 25:1. This is a problem. The idea ratio is closer to 4:1 and an overabundance of omega 6 fatty acids causes excess inflammation in the body. Increasing omega 3 fatty acids has been shown to decrease risks of heart disease, excessive inflammation and arthritis. Both fatty acids are needed for cognitive function, immune response, reproductive health, metabolism and many other functions.

, Most types of fish are high in omega 3 acids and will help you achieve a healthy balance between omega 3 and omega 6. Seafood that is high in omega 3 fatty acids and low in mercury include salmon, herring, sardines, oysters, mackerel (not king mackerel), trout, and shellfish.If you’re planning to get the majority of your omega 3 from seafood other than fish, such as shellfish (mussels, oysters, lobster, etc.), you may need to eat more than two portions a week, as these items can be lower in omega 3. Check the nutrition label when purchasing food to check the omega 3 content.

, Most red meat is relatively low in omega 3 fats, because the animals have been fed primarily grain. However, grass-fed beef contains lower rates of omega 6 and more omega 3, making it a more balanced meat option. You’ll likely be able to find grass-fed, non-processed beef in the organic section of your local grocery store.White meats including chicken and pork are especially high in omega 6 fats. So, if you prefer these meats, make sure to avoid processed options and choose organic brands as these often contain less omega 6.

, This diet focuses on consuming more fish, whole grains, nuts, fruits and vegetables and decreasing red and processed meat, solid fats, and alcohol intake. Studies have shown the Mediterranean diet to have more balanced omega 6 to omega 3 ratio, lower risk of cardiovascular disease and lower total mortality rate.The Mediterranean diet is very similar to the USDA’s Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH).

Take an EPA and DHA supplement.,
Take a fish oil supplement.,
Look for a flax or chia seed supplement.",How to Balance Omega 6 With Omega 33," If you have reduced omega 6 consumption and cannot seem to increase omega 3 intake, it is advisable to take an EPA and DHA supplement. Common omega 3 fatty acids are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and can be found naturally in seafood.If you decide to add an EPA supplement to a diet, make sure not to exceed the daily recommended amount of EPA (often 250 milligrams).

, Fish oils are high in healthy omega 3 acids, and supplements with fish oil are a great way to boost your overall intake. If you have a choice between different types of fish oil, opt for a salmon oil, which is naturally fatty and rich in omega 3.Many fish oil supplements contain both EPA and DHA, and may consequently eliminate the need for you to take those supplements individually.

You should be able to find fish oil supplements at your local grocery store. If not, check a local health food or whole-food store.
Keep in mind that fish oils can have unpleasant side effects, such as a “fishy” aftertaste, bad breath, and fishy burping., Healthy omega 3 acids can be found in some plants and are most concentrated in flax and chia seeds. These are commonly sold as supplements. The specific acid that contains omega 3 in plants is alpha linoleic acid (ALA).You should be able to find either flax or chia seed supplements at your local health food store or a store specializing in vitamins and supplements.

However, because human bodies must convert ALA acids into either EPA or DHA (and do so somewhat inefficiently), it’s simpler just to purchase a fish-oil supplement in order to consume omega 3.

Read the food label.,
Avoid added sugars.,
Make 50% of your meals fruits and vegetables.,
Include low-fat dairy daily.",How to Avoid Simple Sugars1," In the US, it's mandatory for food manufacturers to list the amount of sugar and types of sugar in all foods that have a label.Read all food labels and ingredient lists so you're aware of exactly what's in your food.


Review the food label and look for ""sugar"". You'll find it listed underneath the label of ""Total Carbohydrates."" The amount listed is the amount of sugar in one serving of the food.
Search the ingredient list for other terms outside of ""sugar."" Look for: fructose, glucose, monosaccharides, lactose, maltose, dextrose and sucrose.Simple sugars may also be listed as raw sugar, brown sugar, beet sugar, cane sugar, confectioner’s (powdered) sugar, molasses, turbinado sugar, maple syrup, honey, sugar cane syrup, cane juice, invert sugar, malt syrup, agave syrup and high fructose corn syrup.;
, Added sugars are syrups or sugars that are added to foods during processing and are always considered a simple sugar.Added sugars are considered ""empty calories"" since they do not provide any helpful nutrition to your diet.


Candies, cakes, regular sodas, fruit juices, breakfast pastries, sweetened cereals and flavored coffees are all common items that are usually filled with added sugar.
Steer clear of the cookie, chip and candy aisle at the grocery store.
Take a peek at your pantry, refrigerator and freezer. Toss out most processed foods that contain simple and added sugars (like cookies, candy or regular sodas). Keeping one or two sweet treats to have in moderation is acceptable.
Note that although simple sugars are found in fruits and some dairy products, these simple sugars are far healthier than added sugars. Fruit and dairy products offer a variety of essential nutrients (like vitamins, minerals, fiber and protein) to your diet.

, Some fruits and vegetables contain small amounts of simple sugars. However, they also provide nutrients like vitamins, minerals and fiber that are essential for a healthy diet.Vegetables that contain some simple sugars include: carrots, sweet potatoes, peas and winter squash.Do not avoid these veggies, just balance them with a healthy serving of green vegetables.
Aim to consume whole fruit, not fruit juice. Juices are lacking fiber and are high in sugar and calories.
Also minimize your consumption of dried fruit. Many times companies add sugar to dried fruit (especially tart fruit like cranberries).
In addition, the amount of sugar is more concentrated in dried fruit since the water was removed during the dehydrating process.Stick to the appropriate portion size of dried fruit - about 1/4 cup. One serving of fruit juice is about 1 cup or less., Dairy foods like milk and yogurt also contain simple sugars in the form of lactose. However, these foods are also great sources of protein, calcium and Vitamin D and should be included in your diet each day.Aim for 2-3 servings of low-fat dairy products each day.These can include milk, yogurt or cheese.
Although dairy does contain natural simple sugars, be aware of dairy products that contain a significant source of added sugars. Items like chocolate milk or yogurt with added fruit typically contain more sugar than their plain counterparts.
Choose yogurt or cottage cheese without fruit or other flavorings. Add in fresh, whole fruit or a teaspoon of honey for more natural, healthy flavorings. You can always purchase low fat, plain Greek yogurt and sweeten it with your own raw honey, berries and nuts. The key is controlling the sugar you consume and choosing where that sugar comes from.

Read the nutritional labels.,
Check the ingredients for hydrogenated oils.,
Ask your server what oils are used.",How to Avoid Trans Fats1," A key part of healthy eating is to read the nutrition information for every food you buy. Look on the label for how much trans fat is in a product. Ideally, you should be eating a product with zero trans fat.You can find trans fat listed underneath fat and saturated fat.;
, Manufacturers now are required to list trans fat content on their labels. Look for the phrases ""partially hydrogenated,"" ""hydrogenated,"" or ""shortening."" These types of ingredients contain trans fat.If a product says 0 grams (0.0 oz) of trans fat, it might not be zero. Look for the word ""hydrogenated"" in the ingredients. This means the food contains trans fat. The FDA allows food manufacturers to list trans fat as 0 grams (0.0 oz) if it contains less than 0.5 grams (0.02 oz) of trans fat. Multiple servings of foods with hydrogenated oils, even if it says zero grams of trans fat, can negatively affect your health.

, When eating out, ask the server what oil is used to prepare your food. If possible, request a healthier oil. Another option is to skip the deep fried foods and opt instead for grilled, steamed, sauteed, or baked."

Avoid foods with tartrazine or Yellow #5.,
Cut out items containing diacetyl.,
Ditch foods containing nitrates or nitrites.,
Avoid foods with propyl paraben.,
Cut out all foods containing olestra.,
Don't purchase foods with ""proprietary"" blends of flavors or seasonings.,
List out additives you want to avoid.,
Read food packaging advertising.,
Review the ingredient list.,
Check for additives in foods at home.,
Make more foods from scratch.,
Order carefully at restaurants.,
Go for 100% organic items.,
Avoid processed meats.,
Choose minimally processed grains.",How to Avoid Harmful Food Additives," Tartrazine is commonly known as Yellow #5 (which its commonly listed as on the ingredient list). It's a coloring that's added to many different types of foods and has been associated with some adverse reactions (especially in children).Some studies have shown that Yellow #5 has been associated with behavior problems in children. It usually affects children with ADHD and a confirmed food allergy. Typically, they will show increased hyperactivity and difficulty paying attention.Yellow #5 is found in a wide variety of foods including Mountain Dew soda, yellow colored vitamins or medications, macaroni and cheese made with powdered cheese, yellow colored candies, and yellow colored cereals.;
, Unlike Yellow #5, diacetyl is a flavoring, not a color. It's used in a wide variety of processed foods and has been associated with a few adverse health effects.


Diacetyl is typically found in foods like microwave buttered popcorn, ""brown"" flavorings like butterscotch or maple, some yogurts, and cheeses.One side effect that has been linked with consumption of foods containing diacetyl is dementia and Alzheimer's disease.Studies have shown that consumption of this chemical can lead to plaque build up in the brain.In addition to dementia, people who breathe in a lot of diacetyl (like sniffing the popcorn they just popped) or those who work in factories that make food containing diacetyl have developed a serious respiratory illness (frequently named ""popcorn lung"")., Both nitrates and nitrites are a fairly common preservative found in many foods. Many studies have shown that both of these additives can cause a variety of health issues, especially when eaten in large quantities.


Both nitrates and nitrites act as preservatives and help foods from going rancid. They're typically found in foods like cheese, deli meats, bacon, ham, sausage, hot dogs, and other smoked or processed meats.If you have a diet high in processed meat, your intake of nitrates and nitrites will be significantly higher. Studies have shown that this increases your risk for cancer (especially esophageal cancer) and heart disease.The reasoning behind this may be that both nitrates and nitrites may have a carcinogenic factor to them which means they may support the growth of cancer cells., Propyl paraben is a preservative found in processed foods and helps to keep foods fresher. This particular preservative is widespread and found in a large quantity of processed foods.


Since propyl paraben is so widely used, it is difficult to list every food that it's found in. However, the most common foods include tortillas, breads, muffins, food dyes, and even cosmetics and shampoos.Consumption of propyl parabens has been associated with breast cancer. Studies have been controversial, but propyl parabens act similarly to estrogen in the body. Increased estrogen activity has been linked to breast cancer.Studies have also shown that consumption of propyl parabens has been associated with decreased sperm count and testosterone levels in men., You might recognize the name olestra as an additive. It was very popular when the low-fat and diet foods hit the market. It's a fat substitute and can cause some unpleasant side effects when consumed.


Olestra or Olean is typically found in low-fat diet foods. It's used to replace natural sources of fat in favor of a lower calorie and lower fat product. It's commonly found in foods like potato chips, cheese puffs, tortilla chips, crackers, popcorn, and other savory snack foods.One of the issues with olestra is that it interferes with vitamin and mineral absorption in the body. Specifically, it inhibits the absorption of Vitamins A, D, E and K.In addition, one of the most well-known side effects of consuming foods with olestra is the potential to have very loose stools, anal leakage, and general GI distress., Some foods may have some more complicated ingredients listed on their nutrition labels. Companies can call ""proprietary blends"" such as spice blends or flavor blends on the label without disclosing exactly what's included.A food label may say ""proprietary blend"" or may say ""natural flavors"" or ""artificial flavors"" and have no further explanation.Natural flavors that are added may not be any better than the artificial flavors. Some natural flavors still contain additives like the solvent propylene glycol or the preservative BHA.There haven't been any documented side effects or links to adverse health conditions from proprietary blends, but they're so vague that it's hard to note any connections to health.

, Everyone will have different reasons for avoiding certain food additives. It's important to know exactly what additives you want to avoid so you can be aware of what foods they're present in.


If you want to avoid certain additives from your diet, consider writing up a list of the ones you want to avoid. You can either write out a list on paper, type a list on your phone, or keep a mental list in your head of items you don't want to consume.
Also make a list of foods that typically contain these additives. If you're avoiding, for example, Yellow Number 5, note that this additive is typically found in sugary cereals and colored candies.
If you have a food allergy, sensitivity, or have had significant adverse reactions to food additives make sure to keep a list with you at all times. This will be helpful when you're shopping, but also if you're eating out and need to inform others of the additives you need to avoid.

, When avoiding any additives, ingredients, or foods, it's important to learn how to spot these items on food packaging. There are a variety of places on packaging that you'll be able to find ingredient information. First, review the ""front of pack"" labeling on food items.


""Front of pack"" labeling refers to all the advertising, ""call-outs"" and messaging that is found on the front of food packages.Some examples of ""front of pack"" labeling include ""all-natural"", ""good source of fiber"", or ""low-fat.""
Although the ""front of pack"" labels can help guide you towards a better product, it doesn't give you specific information on the types of ingredients contained in the food. You will need to do further research to find out exactly what you're eating.
The messages on the packaging don't always have a specific or legal definition by the FDA. For example, there's no legal definition of ""all natural."" However, if a product says ""low-sodium,"" it means there can be no more than 140 mg of sodium per serving., The ingredient list is a key part of the nutrition fact panel. If you're looking to avoid any types of additives, foods, or ingredients, you'll need to thoroughly review the ingredient list on the foods you purchase.


The ingredient list is generally underneath or next to the nutrition facts panel. It will list out every ingredient contained in the product.The ingredients mentioned are listed in order from highest quantity to the smallest quantity by weight.For example, if whole wheat flour is the first ingredient, this is the ingredient that is found in the largest amounts.
The ingredient list is key when avoiding additives. All additives, regardless of their purpose, are legally required to be disclosed in the ingredient list., Avoiding certain additives or food ingredients can be a difficult process. In addition to watching what you buy, you'll need to check the foods you already have in your house as well.


It may take some time, but spend a few hours looking at all the packaged items in your house. Review cereals, crackers, pastas, cookies, ice cream, bread, English muffins, canned soups, and frozen meals.
Look at the ""front of pack"" labeling and then the ingredient list as well. Make sure to set aside foods that contain any additives you want to avoid.
You can choose to throw away these foods (especially if they're already opened), give them to friends or family members, or donate unopened items to a food bank.
Also, make a note of these items. They may have been something you've bought regularly. Make sure you don't purchase these again and work on finding alternative options.

, If you want to avoid harmful food additives you may need to cook more foods at home and from scratch. This is not always the easiest way, but allows you to have full control over the ingredients in your foods.


When you cook at home, you get to choose the ingredients in your foods. You'll decide how much to use, know whether or not it's organic, and control how much fat or sugar you include.If you cook most foods from home you can avoid all of the harmful additives that you don't want to consume. You'll also have the confidence of knowing exactly what you're putting in your body.
Making foods from home will also help you control the overall nutrition, cost of your foods, and help with portion control.In addition, limit how much you eat out at restaurants. This is a common place where you may end up consuming harmful additives without knowing.

, When you do eat out, you should be careful about how you order. Try to visit restaurants that prepare their food fresh, instead of reheating frozen or premade foods. Small, local restaurants may be safer than large chains.

At chain restaurants, you may be able to check the ingredients of meals online before you go. This will let you check for additives.
Restaurants that use local ingredients are less likely to cook foods with preservatives or dangerous additives.
Ask your waiter and chef plenty of questions about the ingredients so that you know exactly what you are going to eat.

, Another way to help avoid and cut down on harmful food additives in your diet is by choosing 100% organic foods. This labeling can help you discern what foods have fewer additives.


If a food is labeled as 100% organic, it must comply with USDA standards and regulations. These include soil conditions, use of pesticides, animal raising standards and the use of additives.For processed foods specifically, the organic labeling law does not allow those foods to contain artificial preservatives, colors and flavors. In addition, 100% organic processed foods must contain all organic ingredients as well.If you want to continue enjoying some processed foods, consider purchasing an organic version. Still review the food label and ingredient list, but it should be much easier to find additive-free organic foods.

, One group of foods that are overly processed and contain many additives (including some of the harmful nitrates and nitrites) are processed meats. If you're looking avoid harmful additives, skip these types of protein.


Processed meats can include items like deli meat, bacon, sausage, canned meat, smoked meat, and hot dogs.
These foods, in addition to having some harmful additives, are also higher in calories, fat, and sodium. Eating these on a regular basis or in large quantities has been linked to colorectal cancer and heart disease.Instead of these processed items, choose leaner, less processed sources of protein. You can make your own deli meat by roasting chicken or turkey breasts in the oven and slicing them up for sandwiches. Bake fish, chicken, turkey, lean beef, or pork for meals instead of serving hot dogs or sausage. You can also try making your own breakfast sausage from scratch with lean ground pork.

, Another source of harmful additives are certain types of grains (especially breads). Instead of filling up on these types of foods, try making other healthier choices from the grain group.


Items like breads, tortillas and wraps, muffins, and waffles are known to be high in some harmful additives. Always review the ingredient list of these foods before purchasing.
However, there are some versions of these items that are either 100% organic or preservative-free. Many times, they are found in the freezer section of the grocery store. Store these preservative-free grains in the refrigerator to help lengthen their shelf life. This can prevent mold.
In addition, you can try making many of these foods from scratch at home. Consider baking your own bread, making waffles and muffins from scratch, or even making your own homemade tortillas.

Be careful with gluten.,
Watch out for soy products.,
Cut back on processed sugar.,
Consider avoiding dairy.,
Don't consume MSG.,
Eliminate artificial sweeteners.,
Avoid carrageenan.,
Understand the symptoms.,
Understand the cause.,
See your doctor.",How to Avoid Food Triggered Seizures," Gluten is a general term for the proteins found in wheat, rye, barley and a few other grains — it's what makes bread, pasta and cereals chewy.Allergic reactions to gluten and related intestinal problems seem to be on the rise during the last few decades, but gluten can also trigger seizures in some people due to its inflammatory nature. As such, try adopting a gluten-free diet for a few months or so and see if your seizures disappear.


Gluten has always been in grains, but different agricultural practices, hybridization and genetic modifications starting back in the 1970s changed some of its properties, which has changed our body's reaction to it.
Aside from the gluten content, grains are also rich in glutamate and aspartate, two very excitatory amino acids that impact the brain's electrical activity.
In addition to most bread, baked goods, pasta and cereal, gluten is also found in many canned soups, sauces, salad dressings, vegetarian products and even beer.;
, Soy is a legume and considered an important crop because it's a cheap source of plant protein. Soy products and additives have become very popular over the past few decades, and are commonly found in baby food and infant formulas. Unfortunately, soy is one of the most common food allergens among kids and able to trigger serious allergic reactions and potential seizures.If your child has seizures, consider removing soy products from their diet and see how they respond. It may be labeled as vegetable protein, textured vegetable protein or soy isolate — sometimes it is not even labelled.
Like most grains, soy is also very high in glutamine, and excitatory amino acid that affects brain chemistry.
Soy and related derivatives are found in soy sauce, tofu, edamame, baby formula, many baked goods, cereals, canned soups, salad dressings, processed meats, hot dogs, canned tuna, energy bars, low-fat peanut butter and most non-dairy alternatives (soy milk, ice cream, etc.).

, Although glucose (a simple type of sugar) is typically considered the main fuel source for the brain, too much of it is linked to promoting or triggering seizures in some people. Cutting back on sugar can control seizures through reducing any unpredictable and abnormal bursts of electrical activity in the brain, according to scientists.This is particularly important for epileptics, but also people who have a ""sweet tooth"" that suffer from seizures.


A low sugar, high-fat diet (called a ketogenic diet) is beneficial for anyone who experience seizures because it forces brain neurons to stop relying on glucose for fuel and use ketone bodies (from fat) instead.
Natural sugars directly from fresh fruit and veggies are not really the culprit. Instead, cut back on heavily processed sugars such as high-fructose corn syrup, baking sugar and table sugar.
Candy, chocolate, ice cream, frozen desserts, most baked goods, many breakfast cereals, specialty coffees, soda pop and many sweetened beverages are loaded with processed sugars.

, Dairy products are other types of problematic foods and drinks that create a lot of allergic reactions, as well as some seizures, in children and adults. Not only are there a variety of hormones and sometimes contaminants in cow's milk that negatively impact the brain, but dairy is also high in glutamine. Many generations ago, dairy offered much more nutritional and health benefits than negatives, although the same can't be said in modern times.


Switching to dairy-free diet might be the healthiest choice for some people, especially if they are allergic, lactose intolerant or experience seizures.
Dairy products, such as ice cream and yogurts, are often mixed with lots of processed sugar, which can be a ""double whammy"" for triggering seizures.
Cow-based cheeses that appear to be the worst for triggering seizures and other negative reactions include Parmesan, cheddar, Swiss, Monterey Jack and mozzarella.
For epileptics and others with seizures, goat-based dairy products seem to be a very good alternative to cow-based ones, certainly much more so than soy alternatives.

, Many food additives, such as MSG, are considered to be ""excitotoxins"" because they stimulate nerve cells to rapidly fire and burn out, which can trigger a seizure in the brain.MSG is widely used in the food industry and restaurants as a flavor enhancer — it intensifies the meaty, savory flavor of food. Avoiding MSG can be difficult because so many food products sold in grocery stores and used in restaurants contain it.


MSG is often listed on food labels as ""flavoring,"" because the manufacturers know that MSG has developed a bad reputation.
Keep in mind that fresh, natural foods shouldn't and often don't require flavor enhancement, so preparing your own meals at home with fresh ingredients is the best way to avoid MSG.
MSG is particularly excitatory to neurons because it's made from the amino acid glutamate.

, A number of artificial sweeteners, particularly aspartame (NutraSweet, Equal, diet soda), display very strong excitotoxic activity once they're in your body, causing excessive nerve cell firing and increasing the risk of epileptic attacks and other types of seizures.This isn't surprising as aspartame is made from aspartate, a very excitatory amino acid, which tends to irritate the nervous system in large amounts or in certain forms.


Aspartame also contains phenylalanine, which is toxic to neurons and also linked to neurological damage and seizure activity.Aspartame is one of most widely consumed excitotoxic food additives in the world.
Other sweeteners that may also cause negative effects to the brain and increase the risk of seizures include Splenda and saccharin.
Artificial sweeteners are very widespread and typically found in products labelled as ""sugar-free"" and ""low calorie.""

, Another common food additive to avoid if you're experiencing seizures is carrageenan, because it can cause blood sugar disturbance, intestinal irritation and inflammation in the body.Carrageenan is derived from red seaweed and often added to drinks to keep their ingredients from separating — it's in many nutritional shakes, dairy products and dairy alternatives, such as soy milk.Carrageenan is also commonly found in soups, broths, yogurts, chocolate and ice cream to give them thicker consistency (as a stabilizer) and to make low-fat versions taste fuller.
Carrageenan has no nutritional value and is often within products listed as ""organic.""
Scan your food labels. Carrageenan must legally appear on food labels, so check them closely and avoid foods (even organic varieties) that contain it.

, A seizure is the symptoms or changes in behavior that occur after an episode of abnormal electrical activity in your brain.Seizures can range from mild, involving only staring spells, to severe and don't necessarily involve convulsions (body shaking), tonic-clonic seizures. Common signs of a seizure include: black outs, drooling or frothing, rapid eye movements, grunting, loss of bladder / bowel control, sudden mood changes, collapsing, teeth clenching, muscles spasms and jerking limbs.


Symptoms of a seizure may stop after a few seconds or minutes, or sometimes go on for up to about 15 minutes.
You may get warning signs before having a seizure, such as tasting a bitter or metallic flavor, smelling the scent of burning rubber, seeing flashing lights or wavy lines, and feeling anxious or nauseous., Most seizures are not an indication of epilepsy, which is a neurological disorder characterized by disrupted nerve cell activity in the brain.Instead, seizures can be triggered by a wide variety of environmental factors, including food allergies and toxic reactions to numerous food additives (as noted above).


Finding the trigger can be very difficult, but necessary if you don't want your child or yourself to be on powerful anti-seizure medication for many years.
Seizures are common in childhood, but usually fade away during adolescence. Infections, high fevers, head injuries, and negative reactions to medication are common causes of childhood seizures. Usually, in children it depends on how high and how fast the fever develops. The higher the fever forms and the faster the temperature rises, the more at risk the child is to have a fever associated seizure. You do not need to be put on seizure medication after one episode of a seizure.
Severe migraine headaches commonly mimic mild seizures.
Sometimes, no cause can be found for seizures, in which case they are called idiopathic (of unknown origin) seizures.

, Make an appointment with your doctor immediately if you or a family member shows any sign of having a seizure. Although epilepsy is a serious condition, it's not nearly as life threatening as some other causes of seizures, such as a brain tumor, stroke, brain infection (meningitis) or serious head injury.Your doctor will run a variety of tests to diagnose the condition so appropriate treatment can be given.


Testing will likely include: blood tests, CT scan or MRI of the head, EEG of the brain (to see it's electrical patterns) and maybe a spinal tap for fluid to rule out meningitis.
Allergies to food and toxic reactions to chemical in foods are typically not diagnosed in a hospital setting, particularly in the emergency department.
As such, you'll likely need a referral to an allergy or seizure specialist who has experience diagnosing environmental causes of seizures.

Cancer caution: research shows that fructose increases a certain enzyme that made sugar more available ""to promote cancer cell growth"".Slash sugar and instead consider occasionally using a very small amount of fruit juice or fruit, real maple, raw (not just brown colored) cane sugar/or honey/molasses -- for only 'slightly-sweet' foods.

Hot dogs, wieners, bologna, spiced luncheon, etc. Muzzle your front-loading food packer device (oral cavity) from stocking up high levels of nitrates, nitrites, 50% fat and gobs of sodium/salt. If you crave hot-dogs or such, too often to avoid them -- then seek light, ""nitrite-free, or organic"" hot-dogs.
Instead eat Italian sausage that should be ""fresh sausage"", so although they are fatty, they should not be laden with chemicals! Italian sausages can be split-open to cook out some fats -- or look for the sausage packed fresh, not in skins.

Deep-fried foods. Kick out the trans-fatty, artery clogging heart-endangering deep cooking oils, stop ""fats"". You lose all the benefit of fish by frying them (to say nothing about fatty cottage/or french fries. Frying fish completely destroys the healing power of fish. A study showed that opposing effects:Don't deep fry fish: Raises Risk by 48 percent -- by eating ""more than 1 serving of fried fish per week""!

Instead bake or broil: Lowers Risk by 30 percent -- with over 5 servings of baked or broiled fish per week.



Flame broiled fast food chicken. Usually containing over 1,200 mg of sodium per serving, makes much more than anyone should ever eat in one meal -- instead cook (broiled/baked) at home.Avoid cancer, mutations, toxicity. Meat cooked at very high temperature including much smoke from fats of grilling, roasting, frying and, also, smoked fish have high levels of certain aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that have been shown to ""promote cancer, damage genes, and cause child developmental toxicity"".White flour. Turning to sugar quickly, it spike your blood sugar -- instead choose whole grain (severely limit any breads).

Sugar (sugary foods/drinks). Of course, that spikes your blood sugar -- instead sweeten your coffee or tea with ribose or Stevia.Strictly limit alcohol. Wine, beer and liquor are ""hidden carb/sugar/fat sources"". Alcohol can change to either sugar or fat!




Veal. Full of newborn calf's hormones, it’s one of the most inflammatory foods you could eat(!) -- and:
""inflammation is at the root of heart disease""-- instead choose fish and skinless chicken, very lean or pricey ""range-fed meats"".


Dehydrated, packaged soups, dip mixes and seasonings. Avoid all the ones loaded with sodium (are there any others?).Instead, season with zesty, salt free herb blends such as Mrs. Dash! -- or store brand/generic


Sherbet. It spikes sugar, but many people choose the sherbet over ice cream thinking it’s healthier:Instead, enjoy the ice cream since it contains fat which slows down your insulin response, (consider no sugar added ice cream/frozen yogurt).



,


Eat 4 or 5 tiny fairly-balanced meals. Eating little portions several times each day, being more satisfied, then use less carbs, sugary, salty, fried, or charred foods.

, One example of heart-healthy eating plan includes 45 to 50% slow-burning, low-glycemic index carbs; 30 percent healthy fats; and 20-25 percent protein—all of which help to reduce inflammation.Fight off developing Type 2 Diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, strokes, heart problems -- a ""variety"" of health issues and cancers. Variety is not always the spice of life...


Our bodies are attacked in various amounts even as we sleep. The attackers are in the air and on surfaces as household cleaning products, synthetic fabrics, carpet, fragrances, and pesticides that do emit chemicals, dangerous particles of compounds that seep and sift in, dragging us downward. For one thing, they lower the efficiency of our mitochondria (the energy-producing ""generators"" inside our cells). Then, at the very least, noxious chemicals create mild discomfort, and on to fatigue, headaches, digestive disturbances and avoidable moodiness. Eventually, toxins become the center for inflammation, many degenerative ailments and diseases."

Avoid foods that contain refined carbohydrates.,
Skip meals that are high in fat.,
Be wary of foods high in tryptophan.,
Save bananas and cherries for nighttime.,
Be mindful of what you drink.,
Avoid overly large meals.,
Stick to a structured meal plan.,
Eat a high-protein meal.,
Add in a source of complex carbohydrates.,
Aim for an overall well-balanced diet.,
Drink adequate fluids.,
Get up and move.,
Get adequate sleep.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Avoid Foods That Make You Drowsy," One big group of foods that is commonly linked to post-meal sleepiness is refined carbohydrates. These foods should be avoided or eaten in small quantities to avoid that afternoon sleepy feeling.


Refined carbohydrates refer to a wide variety of items. All are overly processed, low in fiber, low in nutrients and higher in calories.They're typically made from sugar or white flour.
They include foods like: candy, cookies, cakes/pies, snack cakes, pretzels, crackers, white bread, white rice, white pasta, sugary breakfast cereals and muffins.
Refined carbs are digested rapidly and are quickly absorbed into the blood stream and raise blood sugar levels. This causes a rise in insulin, one of the hormones responsible for a steady blood sugar level. The rise in insulin pulls the sugar out of the blood, and this can result in low blood sugar, which is what you feel as the ""crash."";
, Another group of foods that has been linked to increased sleepiness and lethargy during the day are high fat and greasy foods. Try to minimize these at meals during the day to avoid an afternoon slump.


Studies have shown that when you consume higher levels of fat during the day, you're more likely to fall asleep or be sleepy during the day as well.One of the proposed reasons for this is that fat is digested more slowly and releases different hormones that increase the feeling of sleepiness.
Try to avoid foods like: fried foods, fast foods, fatty cuts of meat and rich or high-fat desserts or beverages.

, You might be familiar with tryptophan and sleep — it's what makes you sleepy after eating your Thanksgiving turkey every year. This sleep-causing amino acid is found in other foods, so minimize these during the day to help you stay more alert.Tryptophan is an amino acid found in a variety of foods. When it's circulating in your body, it eventually gets changed into serotonin which helps you calm down and feel relaxed.Outside of turkey, there are other foods that contain this amino acid. Be wary of items like: spinach, soy, eggs, cheese, tofu, and fish.
You don't need to avoid foods that contain tryptophan completely, but have smaller servings of these items at your daytime meals.

, Although there are many groups of foods that can cause drowsiness, there are also some more specific foods that have been linked to sleepiness as well.


Both bananas and cherries have been shown to increase feelings of afternoon fatigue and drowsiness. Choose other fruit to have during the day to avoid this effect.Cherries have been shown to affect melatonin levels which is an important hormone in the regulation of your sleep patterns.
Bananas contain minerals that have been shown to relax your muscles.
Stick to other fruits instead, like apples, berries or oranges. In addition, stick to the appropriate 1/2 cup serving of fruit.All fruit does contain simple sugars, and if eaten in large amounts can spike your blood sugar.

, It's not only foods that will cause you to get sleepy during the day. Many drinks and their ingredients can also cause you to feel a little drowsy during the day.


Avoid energy drinks and shots. Although you may think these beverages would help curb afternoon sleepiness, no studies have shown that these drinks are effective. Many in fact show they have a very short-term effect (if at all) and then cause a big crash after.Do not drink alcoholic beverages. These drinks should be avoided during the day. Alcohol is a depressant and makes you feel very tired and sleepy. Note that if you do fall asleep after drinking, your sleep isn't sound or restful after alcohol consumption.
Sweetened beverages should also be avoided. They're also a source of refined carbohydrates and can spike your blood sugar leaving you feeling sleepy afterwards.

, In addition to the types of foods you eat during the day, the size of your meals can also play a part in how you feel. Larger meals, compared to small meals, may contribute to increased feelings of drowsiness, as they signal your body to slow down and focus on digesting.Studies have shown that large meals (where you'd feel full or very full) are linked to increased feelings of sleepiness during the day. This effect was increased even more so when you had a large meal of refined carbohydrates or fatty foods.
If you feel like your meal size is contributing to your energy levels during the day, consider measuring out smaller portions and meals instead.
For example, instead of three bigger meals during the day, go with four to six smaller meals instead. This can help keep portions small and provide your body will small bursts of energy during the day.
Small meals should be portion controlled. Your total meal should be around 1 – 1 1/2 cups total per meal.

, There are several things you can change in your diet to help keep you more awake and alert during the day. One of the most important things is to make sure you follow a structured meal plan everyday.


When trying to avoid afternoon fatigue, one of the first things you should make sure you're doing is eating regularly. Regular meals gives your body a steady fuel supply, avoiding the spikes in blood sugar and then the crash. Studies have shown this helps improve concentration and alertness.Most people need to eat at least three meals per day; however, if you want to stick to smaller portions or feel better with more meals, try four to six meals daily instead.
Avoid skipping meals — especially breakfast. Making a meal plan can help you stick to a more structured pattern and feel confident of what you're going to eat for each of your meals.

, Although poultry does contain tryptophan, higher intakes of protein (especially from other protein sources besides poultry) can have a stimulant like effect on your body.For your morning and afternoon meals, always include at least one or two servings of lean protein. Measure 3 – 4 oz of protein per serving.Choose leaner cuts of protein to avoid a high fat content. You can try lean beef, pork, low-fat dairy, eggs, beans and nuts.
Protein helps slow your digestion down, keeping you more satisfied and preventing spikes in your blood sugar.

, The best combination for morning and afternoon meals is protein and a complex carb. This combination is not only satisfying, but helps provide energy and prevent fatigue.Complex carbohydrates, unlike refined carbohydrates, have much more fiber, vitamins and minerals. In addition, the source of carbohydrates in these foods is natural compared to added sugars or processed flours found in refined carbs.Although complex carbohydrates do increase your blood sugar, they do so slowly. this is because their ""complex nature"" makes them digest much more slowly in your GI system.
Include at least one serving of a complex carbohydrate like: beans, lentils, peas, 100% whole grains and vegetables.
In addition, serve yourself some lean protein along with this carbohydrate source. Together they'll keep you awake and feeling energetic during the day.

, Although there are specific foods to stay away from and foods to eat more of, it's important to follow an overall well-balanced diet to fight drowsiness. It's generally the combination of nutritious foods that provides your body with the biggest benefit.A balanced diet is one where you eat something from every food group each day. That means having a source of dairy, protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
In addition, you need to eat these foods in the appropriate serving sizes. This means measuring out 3 – 4 oz of protein, 1/2 cup of fruit, 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of leafy green or 1 oz or a 1/2 cup of grains.Also choose a wide variety of foods. Instead of having one or two types of items from within each group, choose several different items. For example, if you love fruit, don't always grab an apple. Choose a variety of berries, oranges, melons or peaches during the week.

, Another sneaky reason you may be feeling a little more sleepy in the afternoon is due to your fluid intake. If you're not getting in enough, this might be causing your afternoon fog.


Studies have shown that even mild dehydration can cause afternoon fatigue. In addition, these studies showed that those who were mildly dehydrated had a depressed mood, lower concentration and increased frequency of headaches.To avoid becoming dehydrated throughout the day, aim for at least 64 oz (2 liters) or about eight glasses of fluid daily; however, depending on your body and activity level you may need upwards of 13 glasses daily.
Stick to clear, hydrating fluids. Try water, sparkling water, flavored water and decaf coffee or tea.

, In addition to eating the right types of foods in the right amounts, there are other lifestyle behaviors that you can incorporate to avoid fatigue and drowsiness.


Studies have shown that a short burst of activity after a meal (or when you're already feeling sleepy) can help beat the afternoon slump.Plan a mid-morning and mid afternoon walk or activity session. Move around for about 10 – 15 minutes.
This activity doesn't have to be high intensity or done for a long period of time. Even just a few stretches in your office will help wake you up; however, if you can get outside, the fresh air and sunlight can help you feel a little more invigorated.
Also aim to meet minimum physical activity guidelines. Doing 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week can also provide you with more energy., Not surprisingly, if you don't get enough sleep at night, you're going to feel more tired during the day. No food can improve this sluggishness.Health professionals recommend that you aim for about seven to nine hours of sleep each night.
When you don't get enough sleep, especially on a regular basis, you will experience an overall decrease in: concentration, ability to use higher level cognitive thinking skills, decreased ability to focus, and increased fluctuations in your mood.

, If you feel that you're doing everything right — eating well, staying active and sleeping enough — but are still fatigued, talk to your doctor.


If you're feeling any sort of abnormal symptom, it's a good idea to make an appointment with your physician. You'll need to discuss what's been going on and see if you need any tests done for further evaluation.
If you're feeling chronically fatigued, talk to your doctor about how often you're feeling this way, how long it lasts and what (if anything) makes your fatigue worse or better.

Bake with unsweetened applesauce, bananas, figs or dates.,
Cook with honey, agave syrup or maple syrup instead of white sugar.,
Make homemade frozen sorbet.",How to Avoid Simple Sugars2," When preparing baked goods at home, like muffins or cakes, try swapping out the sugar for a similar amount of unsweetened applesauce or a smashed ripened banana.


Using fruit will cut down on the amount of simple sugar in the recipe, plus provide you with extra fiber, vitamins and minerals that are found in the fruit.
When using bananas or unsweetened applesauce in place of sugar, cut down on the liquid in the recipe. It'll help ensure the batter or dough isn't too wet. When making any substitutions in baked goods, the texture, color or flavor may change from the original recipe.

, Some recipes require sweetener and limit you on what substitutions you can make. More natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup are sweeter than refined sugar allowing you to use less.Homemade barbecue sauce, ketchup or salad dressings are examples of sauces that would be equally tasty with honey or maple syrup.
Sweeteners like honey, maple syrup and agave syrup are less processed compared to white or brown sugar.

, Instead of buying ice cream or sorbet from the store, make it at home. Blend no-sugar-added frozen fruit in a blender or food processor to make a sorbet-like result.


There are even some kitchen tools that will turn frozen bananas and other fruit into ""soft-serve"" like ice cream treats.
Frozen fruit based desserts will also have fiber, vitamins and minerals from the fruit making for a healthful dessert.

Read the menu and food descriptions carefully.,
Limit condiments.,
Don't order a soda.,
Skip the alcohol.,
Split desserts.",How to Avoid Simple Sugars3," Understanding exactly what's in your meal can help you determine which options have more or less simple sugars.


Key foods to look out for include: items made with sweet and sour sauce, BBQ sauce, ketchup or salad dressings, baked beans, sweet potato fries, marinara sauce, salsa, and other condiments/spreads. Don't forget about more obvious sources of simple sugars as well. Items like desserts, pancakes/waffles, muffins, white bread with jelly and granola typically have a significant amount of added sugars included in the cooking or preparation process.
Don't hesitate to ask the waiter or chef for more specific information regarding meals or ingredients.

, These items may have a significant amount of simple sugars and can be avoided or limited when you serve them yourself.


Ask for items like dressings, sauces, ketchup, syrups or spreads to be served on the side.
Ask for plain olive oil and vinegar for salad dressings instead of creamy-based or vinaigrette style dressings.
Jams and jellies, whipped cream and coffee flavorings, and spreads like apple butter can be high in simple sugars.

, Regular sodas can have over 39 g of sugar - and that's for a small!Stick to water and other sugar free beverages.


If you decide to have a soft drink, opt for diet or refuse any offered refills.
After the first drink, switch to water, unsweetened tea, or plain unsweetened coffee.

, Beware of certain alcoholic drinks including mixed drinks, wine and beer. Even though they do not taste sweet, they still contain a significant amount of simple sugars.Specialty cocktails and mixed drinks can sabotage any attempt to control simple sugar intake, as they often require simple syrup (sugar water), flavored syrups, soft drinks or juice mixers, and even sugared rims.
To minimize sugar opt for an alcoholic drink mixed with water or unflavored seltzer instead or go for a low-carb/low-calorie beer.

, Ordering the occasional dessert or sweet indulgence is perfectly OK. However, sharing a dessert with others can help reduce your intake of simple sugars.

If no one is willing to split a dessert with you, ask for half of it to be boxed ahead of time.
Order a child's or ""petite"" dessert if available. This smaller portion will help limit the amount of simple sugars you consume.
Try ordering fruit instead. Although it still contains some simple sugars, you'll be getting the benefit of fiber, vitamins and minerals.

Avoid prepackaged baked goods.,
Refrain from buying prepackaged snacks.,
Cut out fried foods.,
Eliminate non-dairy creamer and margarine.,
Avoid fast food.,
Cut out frozen and creamy beverages.,
Reduce your intake of jerky.",How to Avoid Trans Fats2," Most baked goods that you buy already baked, prepackaged, or in ready to make mixes contain trans fat. This includes crusts and frosting. Read the label to make sure, but cutting out processed baked goods is one of the best ways to significantly reduce your trans fat.Baked goods with trans fat include cookies, cakes, pies, donuts, muffins, croissants, breads, and biscuits. You should also be careful with canned biscuits, canned cinnamon rolls, and frozen pizza crusts.
Many people think making their own baked goods is healthier, but many commercial cake and muffin mixes contain trans fat. Make sure to check the label or for products that state they have no trans fat or hydrogenated oils.

, Many snack foods that you can buy in the store contain trans fat. Many are cooked or fried in hydrogenated oils or shortening or use trans fat to help maintain flavor. Choose brands with better ingredients.Potato chips, corn chips, tortilla chips, crackers, pudding cups, and popcorn are snacks that contain trans fat. Many frozen snacks, like pizza rolls or mozzarella sticks, also contain trans fat.

, Deep fried foods often contain trans fat. This includes foods that are deep fried and then frozen, or fried foods that you buy in restaurants. Instead, choose baked or grilled foods.French fries, fried chicken and other meats, fried vegetables, and fried baked goods all commonly contain trans fat.

, While dairy products like milk and butter don’t contain trans fat, many dairy replacement foods do. Nondairy coffee creamers often contain partially hydrogenated oils. Stick margarines and some soft margarines also contain those ingredients., Fast food staples commonly contain trans fat. French fries and onion rings are usually fried in hydrogenated oils. Fried fish and chicken used in sandwiches, chicken tenders, or fish sticks also are usually contain trans fat., Baked goods and donuts aren’t the only things you get in restaurants that contain trans fat. Milkshakes, creamy coffees, hot chocolates, and ice cream-based drinks can contain high amounts of trans fat., Jerky and other meat-based snacks may contain protein, but they also can contain multiple grams of trans fat. Try to cut out processed meat snacks, which can also contain unhealthy amounts of sodium and other additives."

Eat tropical oils sparingly.,
Be cautious with frozen meals.,
Limit your intake of ice cream.,
Lower the amount of red meat you eat.",How to Avoid Trans Fats3," Granola bars, breakfast bars, and cereals are generally thought of as healthy, but they can be hiding trans fat. Some may also may state they are fat free, but contain hydrogenated oils.Prepackaged oatmeal can also contain trans fat.
Read the label carefully and make sure you’re buying granola bars with good ingredients.

, Many peanut butters contain hydrogenated oils, along with high amounts of sugar, sodium, and saturated fat. Read the labels on peanut butter jars and choose natural brands that don't contain trans fat., Many candies, especially those that are not made with chocolate, have trans fat. Fruit-flavored candies, gummies, candies with chewy textures, and candy coatings often contain partially hydrogenated oils.Many candies filled with cream contain trans fat.

, Companies are trying to phase out trans fat, so they are using other oils in place of them. Tropical oils, like coconut, palm kernel, and palm oils, are popular substitutes. While they don’t contain trans fat, they do contain high amounts of saturated fats. Limit the amount of foods that you eat with these oils. Instead, try olive, peanut, and canola oils.Read labels and try to choose foods that don’t contain these oils.

, Many frozen meals are healthy, but many contain trans fat, even if they are from a healthy, weight-friendly brand. Meats may be fried in hydrogenated oils, breadings or sauces may also contain the unhealthy oils or shortening. Trans fat is also added to help them last longer.Frozen pizza also generally contains trans fat in the crust.
Read the label carefully to make sure they do not contain these ingredients.

, Dairy products naturally contain trace amounts of trans fat due to their natural fat content. This type of trans fat isn’t believed to be as dangerous, but ice cream and other dairy products still have high amounts of calories and fat, so you should limit how much you eat., Beef also naturally contains trans fat. Eating burgers, ground beef, beef hot dogs, and steaks places trans fat into your diet. To help avoid trans fat, eat less red meat than other types of meats."

Eat more whole grains.,
Consume more vegetables.,
Try eating more fish and other seafood.,
Drink more water and tea.",How to Attain a Longer Lifespan on the Japanese Diet1," Japanese people consume large amounts of grain-based dishes, largely centered on rice or noodles made from whole grains. According to the Japanese government, you should try to eat five to seven servings a day. These foods should be the staple of your diet.One serving equals one slice of bread or ½ cup of cooked rice or noodles.
Among Japan's centenarian populations, whole grains are a main dish with every meal.;
, Just beneath grains on the Japanese dietary guidelines are vegetables, which are nearly as common as grains in Japanese cuisine. According to the Japanese government, you should eat five to six servings of vegetables a day. Common vegetables are sweet potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and cabbage.A serving is 1 cup of leafy greens or ½ cup of any other vegetable.
The indigenous sweet potatoes and cucumbers of Okinawa are high in vitamins and minerals shown to lower the chances or cancer or diabetes.Seaweed is also thought to be particularly good for maintaining brain health and promoting longevity., Fish and other seafood are a staple protein in the Japanese diet. Japanese health officials recommend eating three to five servings of meat, fish, egg and soy dishes a day.Fish, squid, and octopus, which are consumed in large quantities by Japanese people, have been shown to improve heart and brain health.A serving of meats is 2 to 3 ounces (57 to 85 gm) of cooked lean meat, fish or poultry.
The centenarians of Okinawa on average eat three servings of fish, squid or octopus a day. They also consume small amounts of pork.Because of its high protein level, soy foods are included in the protein group and should be consumed at the same levels as meats. Soy products include tofu and fermented soy, such as such as miso, tempeh, soy sauce., In order to promote health and longevity, it is important to drink enough water. It is recommended that the average person drink roughly a half a gallon (2 liters) of water a day.In addition to regular water consumption, Japanese people drink large amounts of green tea, which is considered to help digestion and promote brain health."

Check the labels of processed foods.,
Check the labels of “diet” products.,
Be careful if a product is labeled ""sugar-free"".,
Watch out for sugar substitutes.",How to Avoid Aspartame1," On the back of your food products, read the ingredients or “Inactive Ingredients” section. It is a small section underneath the “Nutrition Facts” section. If you see either the word “aspartame” or “phenylalanine” then the product contains aspartame. Some products even have a warning that indicates people with phenylketonuria (PKU) should avoid the product.


Products like diet soda and gum usually have a warning about phenylketonuria. However, you should check for this warning on all of the processed foods you consume if you have PKU.;
, Check the labels of products that specifically say they are “diet,"" for example, diet soda. Diet products often contain aspartame, however not all of them do. Ensure by checking for aspartame or phenylalanine in the ingredients section.


Try looking for products that use Splenda or stevia as sweeteners instead. For example, Diet Pepsi has aspartame, but Pepsi One uses Splenda as a sweetener. Splenda is a no-calorie sweetener, also referred to as sucralose., Before buying sugar-free products like yogurt, hot chocolate mixes, flavored water powders, gum, or candy, check the label to see if the product contains aspartame. Not all of these products contain aspartame, so be sure to check the labels.Yogurts that are most likely to contain aspartame are processed yogurts that are sugar or fat free, as well as drinkable yogurts. Some yogurt brands that contain aspartame include Dannon Activia, Mueller ""Light,"" and Weight Watchers. Instead, opt for yogurt that is unsweetened, sweetened with sugar, or sweetened with sugar substitutes besides aspartame.
Drink powders can be sweetened with aspartame, but not all of them are. For example, Crystal Light is sweetened with aspartame, but Crystal Light Pure is sweetened with stevia.Many types of gum and candy, particularly gum and candies that are labeled “sugar-free,” use aspartame as a sweetener. For example, hard candy, breath mints, and candy chews can contain aspartame. Gum products that tend to have aspartame are Orbit and Wrigley’s Extra., Sugar substitutes are used to sweeten products instead of regular table sugar. Sugar substitutes can be artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols, novel sweeteners, and natural sweeteners as well. Here’s a guide to understanding each sugar substitute and the common brands associated with them:Artificial sweeteners are synthetic sugar substitutes, which are many times sweeter than real sugar. Artificial sweeteners include: acesulfame potassium (Sunett and Sweet One), aspartame (Equal and Nutrasweet), neotame, saccharin (Sugar Twin and Sweet N’ Low), sucralose (Splenda), and advantamed.
Sugar alcohols are manufactured carbohydrates that occur naturally in vegetables and fruits. Despite its name, sugar alcohols do not contain alcohol. They are also not as sweet as regular sugar and contain fewer calories than regular sugar. Sugar alcohols include: erythritol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, isomalt, lactitol, maltitol, mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol. Be careful about products that contain maltitol. Maltitol has been associated with a variety of digestive disturbances like abdominal discomfort, gas, bloating, and diarrhea.Novel sweeteners are usually combinations of different kinds of sweeteners and are hard to fit into one category. Some examples of novel sweeteners are stevia extracts (Pure Via and Truvia), tagatose (Naturlose), and trehalose (found naturally in honey and mushrooms).
Natural sweeteners are promoted as healthy alternatives to regular sugar and sugar substitutes, but are still processed sweeteners. Examples of natural sweeteners are agave nectar, date sugar, fruit juice concentrate, honey, maple syrup, and molasses.

Know what to look for.,
Check the label.,
Don’t be fooled by misleading terminology.,
Take action to make labels easier to read.",How to Avoid Artificial Sweeteners1," Artificial sweeteners are substances that sweeten drinks, baked goods, and other foodstuffs, but contain no nutritional or caloric value. These sweeteners include sucralose (marketed commercially as Splenda), saccharin (marketed commercially as Sweet ‘N Low), Stevia (marketed commercially as Sun Crystals and Truvia), Aspartame (marketed commercially as NutraSweet and Equal), Acesulfame K (marketed commercially as Sunett and Sweet One), monk fruit (available commercially as Nectresse), neotame, and cyclamates.Artificial sweeteners are also referred to as non-nutritive sweeteners, noncaloric sweeteners, and sugar substitutes.;
, Prepared foods have a nutrition label on them where you can find a list of ingredients that went into their manufacture. Before buying foods that might contain artificial sweeteners, read the ingredients label and look for artificial sweeteners.If you see an artificial sweetener listed on the label, do not buy or consume it.
Foods that are commonly made with artificial sweeteners include diet soda, sugar-free yogurt, sugar-free jams, powdered drink mixes, puddings, and baked goods., Many artificial sweeteners are advertised as “natural” in order to trick consumers into believing they are healthier alternatives to regular sweeteners or other artificial sweeteners. Stevia and agave, for instance, are processed and refined, but marketed as “natural.”, Government agencies are responsible for regulating how food is labeled. If you believe it is too difficult to determine which foods have artificial sweeteners, or how much of a given sweetener is in an artificially-sweetened food, you could petition your representatives in Congress to change the labeling so that they are easier to understand.A full list of U.S. senators is available at http://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/ Identify yours from the list and contact them directly with your message asking for clearer labeling on artificially-sweetened goods.
A database of U.S. representatives is available at http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/. Identify yours and contact them directly with your message asking for clearer labeling on artificially-sweetened goods.
For instance, you could call or write an email with phrasing like, “Hello. My name is . I am a concerned citizen residing in . I would like clearer labeling on artificially-sweetened foods so that I and others who wish to avoid them can do so. I urge you to take action on this important consumer issue.” Provide your name again, as well as an email address or phone number where you can be reached so the politician in questions can get back to you.

Incorporate soy products.,
Eat grains.,
Add legumes.,
Cook with oils.,
Eliminate acid causing foods.",How to Alkalize Your Diet1," Though there’s not a daily recommended serving of alkaline foods, try to make 70-80% of your daily foods alkaline. This can help you balance the levels in your body each day.;
, Vegetables are one of the best ways to include alkaline foods to your diet. Eat the vegetables such as:


Beets, radishes, and beet greens
Leafy greens, like kale, lettuce, spinach, turnip greens, collards, Swiss chard, mustard greens, and arugula
Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, carrots, and zucchini
Celery, cucumber, onions, peas, green beans, and peppers
Asparagus, brussel sprouts, and artichokes
Barley grass, wheatgrass, and alfalfa
Cilantro, basil, garlic, and ginger, Fruits, like vegetables, are alkaline food. Any fruit is good, like avocados, apples, bananas, berries, cantaloupe, grapes, lemon, oranges, figs,peaches, pears, tomatoes, and watermelon.


Raisins are one of the most alkaline producing foods., Nuts and nut milks are good alkaline foods. Try almonds, chestnuts, and hazelnuts, or flax seeds, sunflower seeds, chia seeds, and pumpkin seeds.You can also drink nut milks, such as almond milk., Soy is another great way to eat alkaline foods. Eat tofu, soy flour, or soy milk.You can also eat dried soy beans as a snack.

, Try to eat gluten and yeast free grains and bread on an alkaline diet.This includes brown or wild rice, buckwheat, millet, spelt, and kamut flour.


Amaranth and quinoa are also great alkaline foods., Legumes, which include beans such as white, navy, red, lima, and mung beans, are alkaline foods. Lentils are also great.Add them to salads, soups, or as side dishes every day.

, Some oils are better that others, while some are acid forming. Use coconut oil, flax seed oil, sesame oil, borage oil, olive oil, and avocado oil.Don’t cook with saturated fats or butter., There are certain foods that encourage acid production in your body. Acidic foods include meat, poultry, fish, dairy, eggs, and alcohol. You should also stay away from refined sugar and processed foods.White meat and seafood are better choices for your pH.

Although Japanese people have a high-sodium diet, they do not consume processed foods, which tend to be extremely high in sodium. Because Japanese people eat fewer processed foods, they ingest less salt this way and can enjoy it in other forms.U.S. health officials recommend that you should avoid eating more than 2,300 milligrams of salt a day.In Nagano Japan, residents have considerably cut back on their use of salt, resulting in a decrease of heart-related illness and longer life expectancies., One noticeable feature of the Japanese diet is the limited amount of red meat eaten. Traditionally, Japanese people have eaten very small amounts of red meat, which tends to be associated with colorectal cancer.As Japanese people have adopted a more Western style diet, including eating large quantities of red meat, they have noticed an increase in colorectal cancer., Japanese people traditionally eat or drink very few dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt).Japanese health officials recommend that people consume less than two servings of dairy a day.A serving of dairy is roughly 1/2 cup of milk, 3/4 ounces (21 gm) of natural cheese or one ounces (28 gm) of processed cheese.
The introduction of a Western style diet, and the consumption of larger amounts of dairy, have led to an increase in cardiovascular disease in Japan.Be very careful that you do not miss out on necessary nutrients like calcium when cutting out dairy. Japanese people traditionally get calcium from eating small fish with bones (not something typically done in a Western diet). They also get calcium from soy products and vegetables.You may want to take up these practices or talk to your doctor about taking a calcium supplement to ensure you meet your daily needs.

, Japanese cuisine tends to avoid the use of processed sugar. Japanese desserts tend to emphasize fruits and sweet flavors are created using pounded rice (mochi), sweet bean paste, mashed sweet potatoes and chestnuts. Limiting sugar intake can prevent the development of diabetes later in life.Japanese health officials advise generally limiting sweet and sugary foods."

Enjoy your food.,
Establish regular eating times.,
Eat a balanced meal.,
Incorporate locally sourced foods.",How to Attain a Longer Lifespan on the Japanese Diet3," Japanese cuisine is known for its artful displays and colorful detailing. The time and care put into preparing Japanese dishes can lead to mindfulness about the food and the way it is cooked. If you enjoy your food, you will likely approach it with a healthy mindset, preventing you from overeating or emotionally eating.Take some cooking classes in order to build some pride in your cooking.
Studies have shown that connections between social customs and food can also be a deciding factor in establishing healthy eating habits., It is important to avoid skipping meals or eating late in the evening. These things can lead to unhealthy eating habits and weight gain. In order to avoid this, set scheduled eating times and stick to them. The easiest way to do this is to establish three main eating times (breakfast, lunch and dinner), accompanied by an afternoon snack if needed., You should try to cook meals that incorporate the major food groups. This will ensure that you are getting all of the necessary vitamins and minerals that you need. It will also help you avoid overeating and eating too much sugar, salt or saturated fat.If you are following the Japanese dietary guidelines, a meal could include one to two servings of grains, one to two servings of vegetables, one serving of meat, and a half serving of dairy., Many of the centenarians in Japan eat foods that are grown or caught locally. On Okinawa, the diet consists largely of foods found on the island or in the surrounding waters. Local foods are less likely to be processed and contain less sodium and other preservatives.This correlation between locally sourced food and longevity is common in the world’s “blue zones,” or places where people live noticeably longer lives."
"
Avoid overeating.,
Stay physically active.,
Avoid retiring or start a second job.,
Track how much you eat.",How to Attain a Longer Lifespan on the Japanese Diet4," Japanese people are traditionally fastidious about not overeating. In fact, they have a saying “hara hachi bu,” which roughly translates as “eat until you are 80% full.” Because our bodies do not immediately recognize when we are full, people have a tendency to overeat. To remedy this, eat your meals slowly and take a 15 – 20 minute break in the middle of the meal. This will ensure that you become properly full and avoid overeating.Try eating without distractions — turn off the tv, computer, tablet, phone, etc. and concentrate on your meal. Try eating with someone and having a conversation to slow the pace of your eating.

, Being physically active has been shown to dramatically increase your chances of living a longer life. The centenarians of Okinawa, Japan live extremely active lives. They tend their gardens well into old age and walk everywhere. If you want to live longer, stay active.U.S. health officials recommend that adults get 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate exercise or 1 hour and 15 minutes of vigorous activity a week., Japanese people tend to avoid retiring and work well into old age.This may help them live longer since there is some correlation between retiring early and dying. It is important to maintain a sense of purpose as you get older, and retirement can leave people feeling listless and depressed.If remaining in your current job is not an option, consider starting a second job.

, Japanese officials recommend that you should track what you eat. In fact, many health experts recommend tracking and cataloguing what you are eating in order to maintain a healthy diet. This will help you know how healthy the foods are that you are eating and keep you from overeating.Consider using food journal or a tracking application like Fitbit.

Buy whole fruits and vegetables.,
Choose healthy sweeteners.,
Make your own beverages.,
Buy organic food products.",How to Avoid Aspartame2," Whole fruits and vegetables have no additives. By having your house stocked with these kinds of foods, you can avoid falling back on snacks or food that contain aspartame. Fruits are also naturally sweet and are a great way to satisfy your sugar cravings. Great fruits for snacking are strawberries, peaches, bananas, plums, apples, and berries, like blueberries.

, Sweeten your beverages and food with healthy sweeteners like raw honey, stevia, pure maple syrup, or coconut sugar.Stevia is a plant grown naturally in Brazil and Paraguay. Stevia is almost 300 times sweeter than table sugar, so recipes require much less of it., Bottled or canned tea often contains aspartame. Avoid them by brewing your own tea and adding your own sweeteners, like sugar or honey.


You can also make your own flavored water.

, Try replacing some food products with foods that are organic. For example, you can try buying organic yogurt in order to avoid yogurt products that contain aspartame. Alternatively, you can buy frozen meals that are organic to cut down on preservatives, additives, and artificial sweeteners.

"
"
Talk to your doctor.,
Read nutrition books.,
Read medical journals.",How to Avoid Aspartame3," Your doctor will be able to help you put together a food regimen that is both nourishing and healthy. Your doctor can advise you on ways to avoid foods and products that contain high amounts of sugar. This will help you reduce your sugar cravings, and the desire to consume products that are high in sugar and most likely high in aspartame.

, Buy or check out books from your local library that will educate you on aspartame and its harmful effects. You can also buy cookbooks with recipes that will help you cut down on unhealthy foods and habits. Look into topics like “strategies for healthy eating” or “how to avoid unhealthy eating.” You can find books online, at your local bookstore, or at your local library.

, Medical journals, like American Society for Nutrition, provide access to actual case studies on aspartame. Read these articles and educate yourself on the effects of aspartame. Then you can decide for yourself if aspartame is something you want to avoid, as well as how to avoid it.

Think twice about using artificial sweeteners if you're pregnant.,
Use caution if you have a metabolic illness.,
Keep your consumption within the acceptable daily intake(ADI) limit.,
Contact a health authority if you experience a negative reaction to high-intensity sweeteners.",How to Avoid Artificial Sweeteners2," Information regarding the effects of artificial sweeteners on pregnant women is still limited. While many artificial sweeteners have been listed as safe for use in moderation, others should be avoided for the health of your baby.Saccharin (the main ingredient of Sweet ‘N Low) has been found to remain in fetal tissue after consumption. Cyclamate, another artificial sweetener, is banned in the U.S. due to insufficient information about its safety for pregnant women.
Rebaudioside A (stevia), acesulfame potassium (used in Sunett), aspartame (used in Equal and NutraSweet), and sucralose (used in Splenda) are considered generally safe in low amounts during pregnancy.

, Individuals with certain conditions – including phenylketonuria (PKU), liver disease, or high levels of phenylalanine (an amino acid) in their blood – should not use certain artificial sweeteners. Aspartame, especially, is off-limits for people with metabolic illnesses or disorders.If you have PKU or another metabolic disorder, talk to your doctor to determine if it is safe for you to consume artificial sweeteners.

, The Food and Drug Administration has developed levels of acceptable intake amounts for most artificial sweeteners. The limits are set at about 100 times less than the amount that could cause negative health outcomes. To determine the amount, you’ll need to know your body weight in kilograms and the amount of artificial sweetener (in milligrams) in the product you’re interested in consuming.Divide your weight in pounds by 2.2 to find your weight in kilograms.


For instance, the ADI level for aspartame is 50 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day. If you weigh 60 kilograms, you would simply multiply 50 milligrams by 60 (your weight in kilograms), yielding a sum of 3,000 milligrams of aspartame per day.
The ADI limits can be seen at http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm397725.htm#SummaryTable.
Check the nutrition label to find the amount of artificial sweetener in the food product you’re interested in consuming.

, If you believe you are experiencing a negative health outcome because of artificial sweetener consumption, contact your doctor immediately and stop using the artificial sweetener. In addition, contact the FDA and report your situation. The FDA can be reached:by email at CAERS@cfsan.fda.gov
by phone at 240-402-2405

Use a real sweetener instead.,
Try sugar alcohols (polyols).,
Skip sweets altogether.,
Maintain a healthy weight.",How to Avoid Artificial Sweeteners3," Another easy way to avoid artificial sweeteners is to use their non-artificial (nutritive) counterparts. Nutritive sweeteners like sucrose, dextrose, honey, corn sugar, maltose, and fructose are among the most common nutritive sweeteners.Keep your sugar intake below 100 calories or 6 teaspoons per day if you are a woman, or under 150 calories or 9 teaspoons if you are a man.Nutritive sweeteners should only be consumed in small amounts. The USDA recommends people of all ages to meet no more than 10% of their daily caloric needs with added sugars.For instance, if your soda provides 300 calories but you only eat 1,500 calories per day, you’ve consumed twice your recommended sugar limit.

, Sugar alcohols (aka polyols) are not ethanol alcohol and come from plants, but are less sweet. Common sugar alcohols are Xylitol, Sorbitol, Mannitol, Maltitol, Isomalt, Lactitol, and Erythritol.


Too many sugar alcohols can cause a laxative effect.
Many people are able to tolerate more Xylitol than other sugar alcohols. Xylitol also decreases your risk for cavities.

, The choice to consume artificial sweeteners is often posed as a choice between sugar (which has lots of empty calories and can lead to increased weight) and artificial sweeteners. However, there is a third option, which is to avoid consuming sweetened jams (or opt for low sugar jams), candies, and other sweet products altogether.Alternately, you could be more judicious in your use of sweeteners – both real and artificial – by cutting back on the amount of sweetened foods you eat. For instance, don’t eat dessert after dinner, but have your coffee with a cube of added sugar in the morning.
Instead of having desserts with added sugar, try having some sliced fruit like bananas, blueberries, and strawberries.
Instead of drinking sweetened drinks, try water infused with cucumber or orange. Just slice a whole cucumber or orange up, then drop the pieces into your water pitcher. Refrigerate for about three hours.

, One of the primary reasons people consume artificial sweeteners is because they are trying to lose weight. Artificial sweeteners have no calories, and are therefore a useful alternative for people who have a sweet tooth but still want to reduce their weight. The best way to avoid this situation is to maintain a healthy weight.Eat a balanced diet of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. A small amount of your calories (roughly 20% of your daily caloric intake) should come from lean protein like nuts, tofu, or beans.
Exercise regularly. Adults should get at least 2.5 hours each week of moderate-intensity exercise. Find everyday ways to stay active. For instance, ride your bike or walk to work, school, and shopping centers. Walk up the stairs instead of taking an escalator.

Fill your plate with veggies.,
Reconsider eating out.,
Clean with natural products.,
Ingest baking soda.",How to Alkalize Your Diet2," One of the best ways to promote an alkaline diet is to pile your plate with vegetables instead of meat or starches. If you do this, you don’t leave room for acidic foods., Instead of going through the drive-thru, fix food at home. Meals from restaurants are generally full of processed foods. Fixing your food at home is the healthier and more alkaline-friendly option., Many commercially produced products contain high levels of acid. This includes household cleaning products and bath products.


Instead of these, make natural household cleaning products like diluted apple cider vinegar., Mix ¼ teaspoon of baking soda into a glass of water and drink it to calm indigestion.Baking soda is an alkaline product, so ingesting it will raise the pH of your stomach contents.


Do not take baking soda within 2 hours of other medications, since it can affect how they are absorbed.
Don't overdo it, since your stomach needs to be acidic to digest food.

"
"
Understand your body’s pH.,
Know the importance of alkaline foods.,
Recognize the benefits of the diet.",How to Alkalize Your Diet3," pH refers to the concentration of hydrogen ions in the body. The pH of the blood is slightly alkaline, usually between 7.37 and 7.43.Because of the processed foods you eat, your bodies can get too acidic.


The body closely controls the pH of the blood. If the pH of the blood changes, serious consequences can result, such as heart arrhythmias, lung conditions, blood sugar control problems, coma, seizures, stupor, and death.Food can affect the pH of your urine and the contents of your breath, but not the pH of your blood. Some who promote the alkaline diet often claim that this diet protects your bones from acid, but acid in your diet does not affect bones., It is a fact that overall alkaline foods are better for your health than acidic foods. Although reason and science doesn’t support an alkaline diet, eating alkaline foods is good for you., Though foods may not significantly change the pH of your blood and there’s no evidence for any significant medical changes, the alkaline diet can help you become healthier and promote weight loss.Since the diet is rich in fruits and vegetables and low in animal protein, some early evidence has shown eating alkaline foods can help prevent kidney stones, strengthen muscles and bones, boost heart and brain function, reduce lower back pain, and lower risk for type 2 diabetes."

Consult your doctor before beginning an IF diet.,
Choose an eating schedule that you can maintain.,
Choose and maintain your schedule in your daily life on roughly 2,000 calories for men -- or 1500 for women.,
Moderately decrease your daily calorie consumption.,
Do not dramatically alter your diet.,
Ease into your IF diet.,
Eat your last non-fasting meal.,
Fast during the hours in which you’re sleeping.,
Keep your body well hydrated.,
Set a weight-loss goal.,
Get lean and build muscle mass while fasting.,
Tailor your exercise style to meet your desired body outcome.",How to Adopt an Intermittent Fasting Diet," Talk to your doctor, and explain that you’re considering an IF diet. Ask about the pros and cons of the diet, and be sure to inform your doctor of any pre-existing medical conditions.The IF diet can have a dramatic effect on your daily metabolism. Do not fast without consulting with your doctor if you are pregnant or are unwell.
Caution: Type 1 diabetics on an IF diet would have difficulty regulating and maintaining healthful insulin levels, due to the deliberately infrequent food consumption.;
, When implementing this diet, you’ll go without food for repeated periods of time (typically on the order of fasting 16 to 20 hours per 24 hour day) or as tough as 23 hours before you get to eat a full meal(s) during the remaining 1 hour or 4 to 8 hours in your day. Intermittent fasting is often a way to lose weight, and is also a good way to regulate and schedule your food intake.It’s important to form and stick with a daily fasting schedule, such as easing yourself into the diet by only eating two meals a day. Set a daily time to eat your last meal in the eating window., Snack seldom/a few times on 20 to 30, or fewer, calories (a few carrot-/celery-sticks, or a quarter apple, 3 cherries/grapes/raisins, 2 small crackers, or 1 ounce of chicken/fish, or such) until your fast ends. Other than hours, most IF schedules are essentially equivalent. Several viable methods to choose from include:



One meal window: So, you might fast for 23 hours daily, and select a 1 hour daily window (e.g. from 6:00 to 7:00 pm) to prepare and eat healthily.

Two meal window: Eat two healthy meals daily, such one at 12 noon and the other at 7:00 pm. Then fast for 17 hours after the second meal, sleeping and not eating ""breakfast"" until you fasting period ends.

Skip days: Do not eat at all on Mondays and Thursdays, and eat healthily on the other 5 days. So, the last meal of your eating window could fall on Sunday night, at 8 pm for instance. This is known as the 5:2 diet: 5 days on which you eat an 2 on which you fast., If you normally eat 2,000 or 3,000 calories per day, then you can cut the calories only a little during brief meal times.Try not to exceed 1,500 or 2,000 calories a day. To meet this goal, tailor your diet to include healthy carbs, avoid white bread and white noodles, but have some complex carbs and some fats.

You’ll need to consume all of your daily calories during your one or two narrow meal times.
You may find that the calorie reduction is easy to achieve, since you simply won’t have as much time to consume calories during a week.

, When on an IF diet, there’s no need to cut out any specific food groups (e.g. carbs or fats). As long as you eat a healthy, balanced diet, and don’t exceed roughly 2,000 calories per day, you can eat the same types of food that you did before beginning the diet. The IF diet changes your eating schedule, not the types of foods that you eat.A well balanced diet includes only small amounts of sodium-heavy processed foods and added sugars. Focus on healthy proteins (meats, including poultry and fish), fruits and vegetables, and moderate amounts of daily carbohydrates.

, If you’re not used to fasting, the IF diet may come as a shock to your appetites, hunger and bodily system. You can ease into the diet by lengthening your times of fasting between meals, or start by taking one day off from eating one week. This will benefit your body by allowing your system to detox and allowing you to reduce uncomfortable symptoms (which can include headache, low blood pressure, and fatigue, or irritability).At the beginning of your IF diet, you can also allow yourself to have light snacks during the fasting windows. One snack of a hundred calories of protein and fat (nuts, cheese, etc.) will not impact the effectiveness of beginning and carrying out your fast. Then go to a few very light snacks.
As part of this process, gradually alter your diet to decrease your consumption of processed foods, including processed meat, dairy, or soda.

, Avoid the temptation to load up on junk food, sugar, and processed items in your last meal before fasting. Eat fresh vegetables and fruits, and make sure to eat plenty of proteins so that your energy level stays high.For example, a last meal could include a cooked chicken breast, a piece of garlic bread, and a salad including romaine lettuce, tomato, sliced onion, and a vinaigrette dressing.


Some people binge a little starting this strategy, though this means that you will spend more time digesting your food and less time in the “fasting adapted phase” of your food-abstinence period.
Eat a full meal before you begin fasting. If you fill up on only sugar-heavy or carbohydrate-heavy foods, before your fast, you’ll become hungry again quickly.
Eat plenty of protein and fats when you have a scheduled meal. Going too low on carbs and fat can be hard to maintain, as you’ll feel unsatisfied and constantly hungry when fasting.

, This will help keep your mind off of your growling stomach when you’re in the middle of a long fast. Make sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep every night, with at least a few hours of fasting on either side.Then, while you’re awake, you won’t feel food-deprived because you know you will get to eat a big meal soon.


The first/main meal after your fast will be the reward for the fasting period. You will be hungry after fasting, so eat a full meal.

, Although you’ll be fasting for the majority of the hours in a day on an IF diet, this does not mean that you should stop drinking. In fact, it’s crucial that you stay hydrated while fasting, in order to keep your body working well. Drink water, herbal tea, and other no-calorie drinks.Staying hydrated will also stave off hunger pains, as the liquids will take up room in your stomach.

, The IF diet can effectively help you lose weight by reducing your daily caloric intake and allowing your body to burn off fat reserves. Reducing the amount of time that you spend eating will cause your body to shed excessive body fat by raising your metabolism. Intermittent fasting may also reduce the amount of inflammation found in body tissue.Keeping motivated to achieve a personal goal through fasting will give you added mental strength to continue fasting, should you need it.By restricting the amount of time that you spend eating, you may be able to reduce excessive weight gain.You may be able to extend your lifetime expectancy by burning off body fat., An IF diet gives you a good opportunity to build muscle. Schedule a work out for just before your first meal (or, if you’re eating two meals a day, work out between meals). Your body will be able to use the calories most effectively at this point, so plan to consume about 60% of your daily calories right after working out.To keep yourself healthy and increase muscle mass, don’t cut your calories to below 10 calories per pound of body weight.


For example, a 180 pound man would need at least 1,800 calories per day to get lean, not by starving, while training moderately. If you cut too many calories, you’ll decrease your ability to stay healthy and build muscle tone.

, The type of exercise you perform while on an IF diet will depend on the outcome you want. If you’re simply trying to lose weight, focus on aerobics and cardio-based workouts.If you’re trying to add some muscle mass and bulk up, you’ll need focus on anaerobic exercises, such as weight training.If you’re trying to lose weight, focus on aerobics or cardio exercises in long sessions.
If you’d like a more muscled body, focus on short bursts of anaerobic exercise. Anaerobic means working out in short bursts, without raising your heart rate dramatically. It is based on short times of doing resistance or weight exercise, not long sessions of aerobics or cardio.

Network.",How to Become a Production Assistant," A college education is not a prerequisite to work as a production assistant, but many recent graduates with degrees in broadcast journalism, communications, and film compete for PA jobs. These degrees are less relevant than actual work experience, but they can help you get your foot in the door.The most relevant Bachelor’s degrees are broadcast journalism, communications, and film. However, a college degree is not required for the field and even a relevant degree might do little to advance your prospects.;
, Shorter training programs, known as ""boot camps,"" teach skills important for a PA in a condescended period of time. These are more closely tailored to the specific demands of a PA than college programs and can look great on a resume. These typically cost approximately $200 for a two-day course.


These programs are concentrated in areas with a thriving media industry, like Atlanta, New York, and Los Angeles., The best way to get into the industry is to get experience working in it. Unfortunately, that means you often need to work as an unpaid intern for several months. Try running errands on a local independent film production crew or at a local television station's production department.


Some cable systems will have local origination programming on which they will welcome a volunteer production assistant. They may have an informal (and free) training program, as well.

, As a production assistant, you should be willing to work long hours in return for the experience. You might need to work 12-hour days mostly standing up. You will often be required to perform menial tasks, like picking up coffee, and will be judged on how well you perform even the smallest task.Though the job is grueling it doesn’t pay well, usually no more than minimum wage, and sometimes less. To keep yourself motivated you should think about the long-term career opportunities that can develop from a PA job., A production assistant works with people in all roles of production, including the director, assistant director, producer, lighting director, camera operators, talent and extras. You will often be required to perform tasks like answering the phone. That means that you need to be able to express ideas clearly both through written and spoken English.Taking college courses in the humanities will often help you develop your writing skills.
Working in sales or services industries can be a good way to develop your oral communication skills.

, One of your principal responsibilities as a PA will be editing video. Each station will use a different type of non-linear editor and will usually be willing to train you in the one that they use. However, you should at least be able to demonstrate that you have some experience editing video.


Programs that channels use include: Avid, Quantel, Final Cut Pro, and Sony.

, Production assistants are not generally required to operate the camera, but production assistants can be asked to perform almost any function at the studio when the need arises. Knowing how to operate the camera can give you an advantage. Furthermore, successfully operating the camera when needed can be a ticket to a better position in the future.Studying film in college is a good way to learn about operating the camera. Alternatively, some organizations offer short courses in filmmaking that can help you develop your skills with the camera.

, You will need to become familiar with the roles of a typical production crew. Some colleges offering programs in production have free course material available online.


Be fluent in the use of a radio (walkie talkie) and surveillance mic equipment.
Examples of relevant terminology include terms like: “cut,” “dolly,” “framing,” “story board,” and “wipe.”, As a production assistant you will be expected to know something about the content that you report on. If you want to be in sports, you will need to know about sports. If you want to work in news, you will be expected to understand politics. Figure out what field you are interested in and start doing research.


No one is, or should be, a production assistant forever. It pays too poorly to be anything other than a stepping stone to a better career. Thus, you should know what positions you want to move on to and begin preparing yourself for the expectations.
If you can, speak to someone in the field about what the expectations and career trajectories are.

, You should keep these on you at all times, because you never know when you will meet someone who will be able to recommend you for your first job in your career in production. Be sure that your networking materials include your cell phone number or a current phone number. Your resume should speak to how you possess the aforementioned skills, including communication, camera operation, work ethic, attention to detail, and video editing.

, You will need to demonstrate that you can edit video to get a job as a production assistant. Keep a reel of video that you have edited to share with potential employers. Use your time in college or in a production boot camp to develop such a reel with professional input.If you can, try to have reel ready that it is pertinent to the position you are applying for. Though if you don’t have relevant material it should be fine, because it will still show that you have the basic skills necessary to edit film.

, Contact production coordinators, producers, or assistant directors either by telephone or in person. Give them your resume and make a pitch for why you are qualified for the job. If you know anyone in the business, see if they can put in a good word for you.


Leave your resume and card and follow up soon after the first contact. You should follow up periodically thereafter.

, You can’t live forever on a PA job. The point of the position is to get experience behind the scenes, to learn the intricacies of production, meet leading figures in the field, and learn from their insights. Whether you are still looking for a PA job or have just gotten one, you should work hard to meet important people in the field.Interacting with people on social media can be a good way to introduce yourself to people in the field.
Look for local events that will likely attract people interested in media.
Never stop looking to meet new people. Talk to people at yoga or the bar. Engage in clubs and activities that expand your social network."

Showcase yourself on social media.",How to Become a Photojournalist," First, learn what photojournalism is, what it involves, and what successful photojournalism looks like. Photojournalists get out in the world and take pictures of developing stories, events, and people. To be a photojournalist, you must be knowledgeable about photography and have a good eye for capturing moments. Some famous photojournalists to look into are Philip Jones Griffiths for his portrayal of the Vietnam War, Dorothea Lange for her covering of the Great Depression, and Margaret Bourke-White for her portrayal of WWII.A few modern photojournalists to look into are Lynsey Addario, Tim Hetherington, and Corey Arnold.;
, It is important to learn about and excel at photography. You can learn about photography by studying it on your own, with educational books and articles, online, with YouTube and other free classes, or by signing up for photography classes at your local college. You don’t have to have an expensive, fancy camera at first, though you will need it eventually. Anything that can capture a picture, even a smartphone, is okay to start practicing photography with. Practice everyday.Take walks around your town or attend events where you can practice photographing people and stories.

, Eventually, you will need all of the necessary equipment to become a photojournalist. You don’t need to purchase the equipment until you have learned a bit about photojournalism and photography and are sure that this is the career that you want to pursue. The type of equipment you will need to invest in are a quality digital camera, a computer, and photo editing software (like Photoshop).All of this equipment can cost thousands of dollars. Plan ahead of time and save up before purchasing equipment.
You can look into renting cameras and laptops if you can’t purchase them right now.
If you are in school, see if your school loans out equipment and allows you to download software for free.

, Learn how to scrutinize and criticize images from your camera. At this point, you should know a little bit about photography. After you take pictures, look at them and see which ones work and which ones don’t. Ask yourself why some pictures are successful while others aren’t. It could be the composition, lighting, and subject that are right or wrong. This is very important to be a photojournalist and you must know how to do this.Ask other photographers and/or photojournalists to give you feedback on your photos. If you don’t know any personally, upload your photos to internet photos and ask for feedback. Watermark your photos so that they don’t get stolen, though.

, Once you have taken enough pictures, begin building a portfolio. You should be taking around 500-1000 photos a week. A portfolio should comprise of your very best work. Try to put together a portfolio with a range of subject matter, compositions, and coloring. Create a digital portfolio that can be accessed online and a print portfolio that can be carried with you.A few free online portfolio sites are Behance, Coroflot, and DROPR.
The portfolio should have pictures of anything you think the boss/manager would like to see (e.g.; children playing, car traffic, cookouts, etc.)

, A ceremonial education is often required for a good photojournalism position, and even if not, a degree strengthens your resume. An education can help you grow as a photojournalist, learn to problem solve, and learn to take criticism. Once you have built up a portfolio, apply to a college for a photojournalism degree.Your photos will speak for themselves. A degree is not always necessary if you take outstanding photos.
If you can’t go to a two or four year university, consider taking some courses at a community college.

, If you go to school, make connections with every photojournalist you meet. Get involved with school’s newspaper, and offer to take pictures for any newsletters, websites, or yearbooks. After you have left school, do your best to connect with photojournalists. Research and attend meet-ups in your area. Reach out to photojournalists that you find inspiring.Just as it is with many careers, photojournalism is sometimes about who you know. Making lasting connections can only benefit you.

, Internships are the best way to gain experience and build your resume. It’s far more likely that you will be able to land a job if you’ve had an internship. If you’re in school, ask professors for recommendations and advice about where to apply. Look up internships on the internet and apply to as many as possible.Keep in mind that most internships pay little to nothing and are very competitive, especially for larger magazines and newspapers.

, Choosing to be a freelancer is more and more common, especially with the rise of social media. A freelancer signs contracts to either do one job for a company, or work for a company for a specified amount of time or projects. Photography itself, especially as an independent art form, is primarily freelance. Learn how to market yourself and make connections. A solid network foundation will attract more work.It is helpful to learn about business if you are considering freelance work. You can look up information online about it, or take a class at your local community college.

, Eventually, aim to work at a magazine or newspaper (if you don’t want to stick with freelance). A secure job with a magazine or newspaper is a photojournalist’s dream. Consider the type of work you do before applying to jobs. Is your work better-suited for a magazine like National Geographic, or would it be better for a newspaper like The New York Times? It may take a lot of applications to secure a job, but don’t give up.If you don’t have luck getting a job with a bigger newspaper of magazines, start small by applying to local magazines and newspapers for positions.

, Go to as many events as possible. Takes walks or transportation systems around cities. Notice the life and moments that happen. Meet people, talk to them, and ask questions. Get used to being outside of your home for long hours.Ask people for permission if you plan to use a photograph you’ve taken of them.

, It is also helpful to fit. Being a photojournalist is very tough and rough work. It is not only just taking pictures. You have to be on your feet and you have to be able to support big equipment, as you have to move around a lot in different locations.

, Take notes about what you see out in the world. When taking pictures, document the time, place, people, feeling, and area. It is important to know when and where the photo was taken, as well as knowing what was happening. You can use that information to give to writers, or to make up your own captions.Writing captions is an important part of journalism. Practice writing them along with your photography.

, Instead of looking for photos that look cool or pretty, focus on the people. Focus on their stories. Photojournalism isn’t just about the art form of photography--it’s about capturing a story. Train yourself to notice when the right moment to take a picture that will capture the story is. Focus on capturing an angle to the story that is unique.Sometimes, you may have to take photos of people in difficult situations. Decide on your moral code when it comes to taking pictures at difficult moments.

, It is important to create a website for yourself, especially in today’s society. Some websites allow you to make a free website, but it is better to eventually buy your own domain name. Domain names aren’t all that expensive, especially if you catch the provider during a sale. On the website, provide an “about me,” portfolio, and information about how to get in contact with you.Some webs hosting companies that you can make your own website on are Squarespace, Wix, and GoDaddy.

, Displaying your work on social media is absolutely necessary. Never shield your work like a piece of fine art--it prevents you from business. You should, however, protect your work with watermarks and copyrighting. Join social media platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter. LinkedIn is another helpful website to join, as it aims to connect professionals.


Consistently upload your work to social media sites. Make posts a few times a day.
Follow other photojournalists in hopes of them following you back.

Perform other requirements.",How to Become a Museum Docent," Is it an art museum, a science museum or a natural history museum? Take a moment to reflect, as choosing the right location will enable you to enjoy yourself more and perform better as a docent.


Consider your interests. Did you grow up playing with dinosaurs? Choosing a natural history museum with dinosaur bones will allow you to reconnect with your passion and share your enthusiasm with guests.Consider your studies, too. This can be helpful in learning more about your selected field - or you can choose to explore an entirely new interest. It is volunteer work, so it is an opportunity beyond the confines of school and work.Ask yourself why you want to be a docent in the first place. If it’s to practice speaking or volunteering, it may not matter so much what you choose. Research local museums and you may find an opportunity with people or in a place that you love, no matter how big or small.;
, Every museum has different requirements for its program. Take note of when training classes are offered and if they have any vacancies.


You likely associate museums with large cities, but so does everyone else. To get started, you may wish to search locally.
Information on docent programs can often be found online, but you can also visit in person or call to signal your interest to the coordinator., Once you’ve read the basics, call the program’s coordinator. Not only will this serve as a personal and memorable introduction, but this person can provide more details and guidance.


Despite this being volunteer work, many museums have sizeable requests, including commitment periods of a year or more. Make sure you understand what you’re getting into before you begin., Even though this is volunteer work, the museum stakes its reputation on docents who interact with the public. Knowledge will help you impress an interviewer.


For art, for instance, knowing about the piece's medium, era, influences, and effects prompt more of a discussion with patrons than merely listing off the artist and the subject.To find details of the subject matter, do some online reading or spend time at the museum. Take tours, read plaques, and listen to the docents.
Ask questions about the museum’s history, too. What is its mission? Staff can help you with this, but you’ll likely find it on the museum’s website.
If this is an area of particular interest, you can even consider classes at a local college. Check for guest lecturers, displays, discussion groups, or anything that will allow you to discuss your interest.

, Museums at a minimum require docents to lead tours, while some may wish you to prepare exhibits, facilitate activities, or even represent them in the outside world. If an interview is necessary, have your speaking skills sharp.The interviewee will be interested in your ability to speak to large groups. Remember that you’ll have to speak in a way that everyone can hear, often while moving through an open area.
Come to the interview with questions. This often leaves a good impression because it displays your interest while simultaneously allowing you to fill in the gaps in your knowledge.Display appropriate body language. Sit or stand tall, make eye contact, and smile. Again, you are representing the museum and no guest or interviewer will appreciate someone who appears slouched and unfriendly.

, This will give you a chance to not only witness first-hand the tasks you’ll have to perform, but pick up useful tips and museum information from an experienced docent.


Tune your ears to the most essential exhibits. Others may come and go by the time you begin, but the ones the museum keeps have meaning to that location and often unique stories.
Note the way the docents hold themselves. Can you hear them from the back? Are they friendly and informative? You’ll find clues that you can use to refine your own behavior.
A docent has to compact much information into a simple answer while still encouraging questioning. Don’t be afraid to ask whatever you would like to know about the museum or the work, but still observe the tricks they use to speak effectively.If possible, lead a trial tour with an experienced docent. They can offer you constructive criticism as well as note-taking strategies to refine your speeches to the most essential information.

, It isn’t enough to know the subject material; a docent must also know about the museum, its policies, and how to interact with guests and staff. This portion of the training may be as trying as the actual education.


Training begins with insight to the museum and its mission. This, along with gallery sessions, will familiarize you with the museum and allow you to answer questions that go beyond the exhibits.
Lessons on touring techniques will be offered, and oral presentations may be mandatory. Use these to familiarize yourself with the verbalization you’ll need to succeed.
Some programs include study groups and docent trips to other museums. Interacting with guests is important, but you must also know how to talk to your fellow docents.Understand the museum's policies as well. Many museums do not allow food, beverages, or photography. If a display is cordoned off and touching not permitted, you will be responsible for enforcing this., All museums have different programs, many quite extensive. They exist to ensure you are well-prepared and by the end, your diligence and attentiveness will have an effect on your capability to educate.


The Arizona-Sonoma Desert Museum, for instance, requires a minimum two-year commitment, 144 hours a year, classes, training, and workshops. Even if you have no experience, you’ll get a chance to learn from the museum staff.Some programs also require seminars, written, and oral tests. It’s a significant time investment, but this school-like atmosphere is designed to ensure you understand the subject material of the museum., Recite it in a mirror, around exhibits, and with friends asking questions. Public speaking can be difficult, but practice and familiarity can help you grow comfortable., It can be intimidating to be responsible for a group of visitors in a large space. Remember your preparation; figure out ways to stay calm. This is a learning experience for you too, so don’t sweat the mistakes.Engage your group in conversation to get comfortable. Make eye contact. Do not speak too quickly and pause between sentences.
Remember that you represent the museum, even as a volunteer, so treat every guest with patience and respect.Move at a reasonable pace, stopping to ensure everyone is with you before continuing onto the next topic. Never speak as you lead the group; it is difficult for people behind you to hear.
Consider the tour to be a conversation, and that silence is necessary from time to time for you to collect your thoughts and others to digest your knowledge. Ask your group if they have any questions at the end of the tour.

, Different museums have different requirements, but many ask for certain shift lengths and hours over a commitment period. Keep aware of the museum's tour schedule.


The Museum of Modern Art in New York City, for instance, asks for three hour shifts once per week or twice per month on weekend.Museums require long-term commitments, which you’d have come across in research and training. Remember to keep up with it!

, Art galleries, for instance, may change their exhibits every two to three months, so you’ll have to repeat previous steps to make sure you have appropriate information to give!Some museums also include regular training sessions, which will keep you informed of any changes and teach you more of what you need to be able to provide guests.

, While the main task of a docent is to lead tours, many museums will provide other opportunities. This can be anything from preparing exhibits to visiting classrooms.


You may have to research on the job. An art museum gaining a new piece will have you find out the background material and prepare it for public consumption.As a representative of the museum, you may be asked to visit the community. Your work is to educate the public and interest them in what the museum offers, so this can include presenting at a community center or school.
Whether it be informative play for children or adult education, those activities you see at the museum don’t run themselves. You’ll be asked to oversee some of them.Docents may also be asked to perform greetings, answer phones, or other clerical tasks. This is why a wide base of knowledge and social skills are valuable. You'll be expected to balance working with guests and working with information.

Write another movie.",How to Become a Movie Writer," Write everyday. Even if some days result in nothing useable, you'll make writing habitual. Keep yourself accountable by joining writing groups. Write Pomodoro style to break your writing sessions into smaller chunks with breaks. Write for 25 minutes. Take a five-minute break. Write for another 25 minutes.;
, Direct your writing to constructing characters and story lines. Writing is not completely about typing on to a blank page. It's about teaching an audience about a character and making an audience relate to that character. Stories have a beginning, middle, and end. Learn to construct each of these acts to the best of your ability.

, All movies use a standard format when writing a screenplay. Using it shows future employers that you know what's expected of you. To learn the basics of the standard screenplay format, you could:


Check out the free resources at the New York Film Academy (NYFA.edu).Look for software that helps you to master the formula. Some examples are Celtx, Trelby, and WriterDuet.

, Look through industry magazines to see the top recommendations. Borrow the books from your local library or buy them from booksellers. Keep in mind that some books are genre-specific. Some general recommendations are:Save the Cat by Blake Snyder.

The Art of Dramatic Writing by Lajos Egri.

Screenplay by Syd Field.

, Taking a class or two will help you to sharpen your skills. Even if you've already mastered the standard format, you’ll get to focus heavily on making your script as good as it can be.If you have the ability, take class at a film school. There, you'll be able to create screenplays with the help of professional writers.

, Undergraduate programs will teach you about important screenwriting elements like acting and cinematography. Graduate programs offer more intensive study. They’ll also pair you with professionals whose guidance can give you an edge in the industry.If you can afford it or can find the funding, apply to top film schools. Some of the best in the United States are:


The University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Theatre, Film, and TelevisionThe University of Southern California (USC) School of Cinematic ArtsThe New York University (NYU) Tisch School of the ArtsThe New York Film Academy, If you’re taking classes or pursuing a degree, your professors will provide feedback in your graded work. If you’re not in school, your best option is to get a manager, who will work with you as you write your script. Satisfy every suggestion your professor or manager gives you. It will help you develop as a writer and improve your chances of success.

, This will allow you to see how the written word translates into a complete script. Start with movies you're familiar with. As you improve your skills and decide which genre (such as dramas, comedies, or documentaries) you want to focus on, buy screenplays that fit that genre. You can find screenplays by:Searching eBay or your favorite search engine using the key word “screenplay.”
Visiting specialty bookstores.

, Scripts are different from novels and academic writing. Watching movies will help you learn how screenwriters manage the pace of the film and deal with techniques such as intonation. Expose yourself to a variety of genres and a variety of producers to pick up on subtle and obvious differences., Look for contests that offer yearly fellowships. Good contests will also offer finalists meetings with professionals who can help them get recognition. Check out websites like The AFW.com and GoodInARoom.com for lists of the top contests to enter each year.

, You don't have to live in New York or Los Angeles to enter film festivals. Cities around the world host them. Make a spreadsheet of festivals that accept your genre. Order festivals by entry deadlines. Before you enter, read the instructions carefully. Some festivals only consider films that aren't under consideration at other locations., If you enjoy writing screenplays for super hero movies, try your hand at something different. Write a historical adventure or a short film. This will show producers that you're flexible. It will also keep you employed audiences get tired of certain genres.

, New screenwriters should get a manager before seeking out an agent. Managers help develop scripts. Some even serve as producers. They're always seeking new talent and will offer you tips for success that you won't find with an agent. Outside New York or Los Angeles, you can find managers through internet searches and industry magazines. Some top management companies include 3 Arts Entertainment, The Gotham Group, and Untitled Entertainment., Agents help you sell your films. If you live in the New York or Los Angeles area, finding an agent is as simple as opening the Yellow Pages. If you live outside these areas, you can find agents at film festivals, pitchfests, or seminars in your area. You could also talk to your manager for recommendations.Search screenwriting magazines or industry blogs to find out when these events are happening.

, Even if you're not a social butterfly, you can't rely solely on your agent or manager to get your script noticed. If you live outside Los Angeles or New York, search for networking events online. For example, Scriptmag.com has a page dedicated to physical and online meet-ups. Seek out producers, and perfect your pitch.Prepare to answer questions like:


“What makes your plot different from everything else on the market?”“What’s your projected budget for this movie?”“What is it about your screenplay that’ll make it a box office hit?”“In your opinion, who makes up the ideal cast for this movie?”, Ask them how they have coped with and recovered from rejection. Whether you find their advice useful or not, simply talking to others who have been there can help to relieve the sting. During your discussion, jot down any major points that might be helpful later on.

, Ask the original producer why they rejected your film. Work on improving the areas that held your film back. Get feedback from your manager and peers in the field. Once you're confident with the new and improved script, try your luck with other producers.

, One script isn't enough. It often takes several scripts for writers to get their big break.After you write a few screenplays, you can send each one to a different producer. This will increase your chances of success.

Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and plant products.,
Eat legumes and beans for protein.,
Drink soy or almond milk, rather than dairy.,
Consider drinking alkalized water.,
Enjoy a wide variety of other alkaline-forming foods.,
Avoid acid-forming foods whenever possible.,
Consider following the balanced 80/20 rule.,
Don't fall for diet scams.",How to Alkalize Your Body1," The core of any alkaline diet is a strong emphasis on fruits and vegetables, rather than meat, dairy, eggs, and carbohydrates. As a general rule, plant products like fruits and vegetables usually break down into alkalines, whereas the other foods mentioned usually break down into acids. Thus, emphasizing vegetables in your diet is a sure-fire way to start increasing your alkaline intake.



Alkaline fruits and vegetables include: Apples, broccoli, asparagus, bananas, artichoke, beetroot, kale, grapes, spinach, cantaloupe, cauliflower, and many more.For a complete list, see an alkaline diet resource (like, for example, Acidalkalinediet.net);
, As noted above, the alkaline diet forbids many traditional sources of protein, like meat, eggs, and dairy. Protein is an essential nutrient that's vital for a huge range of bodily processes, which means that it's extra-important to get a good amount of vegetable protein on an alkaline diet. Luckily, beans and legumes provide ample protein (and, as a bonus, are less acid-forming than meat, eggs, and so on.)


Don't be tempted to skimp on protein altogether — protein is an essential nutrient that's used in a wide variety of vital processes, like building healthy bones, fueling growth, facilitating muscle function, and maintaining a healthy weight.

, Since normal dairy is off-limits for its acid-producing properties, non-dairy alternatives should be substituted. In addition to lacking the acid-forming property of traditional dairy products, soy and almond milk can be quite nutritious in their own right, as they both lack the cholesterol and calories found in cow's milk., While drinking plenty of plain, unsweetened, ordinary water is something that's frequently recommended by health experts, alkaline diet practitioners often go as to recommend water that's been treated to give it alkaline properties. While there is some limited evidence that alkalized water can possibly help limit bone loss, this property isn't certain or even particularly well-understood.However, alkalized water won't hurt you, so if you're interested in going the extra mile, it may be a worthwhile investment.

, The recommendations above represent just a few of the choices someone on an alkaline diet has. In addition to the foods recommended above, foods frequently included in alkaline diets are:Nuts and seeds: Almonds, chestnuts, pine nuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds.

Certain non-meat protein sources: Tofu, soy, millet, tempeh, whey protein.

Certain spices and seasonings: Sea salt, chili pepper, curry, mustard, ginger, cinnamon, stevia.

Certain unsweetened dried fruits: Dates, raisins, figs.

, Though meat, dairy, and eggs may be the things that many people miss most after starting an alkaline diet, they're not the only things to avoid. In addition to meat, dairy, and eggs, other foods that alkaline diets frequently recommend avoiding are:



Grains and grain products: Pasta, rice, bread, cereals, crackers, spelt, etc.

Processed foods: Sugary/greasy snack foods, soft drinks, pre-packaged meals, most desserts, jams and jellies, etc.

Select fruits and vegetables: Artificially-sweetened juices, blueberries, dry coconut, pickled olives, plums, prunes.

, An alkaline diet doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing proposition. Some amounts of acid-producing foods are allowed — even encouraged, if they make it easier to stick to your diet. One moderate tactic is to practice the ""80/20"" rule — try to make 80% of the foods you eat fit your plan for an alkaline diet, but let the remaining 20% be ""forbidden"" foods.


There's no ""right"" way to do this, so feel free to make a plan that's easy for you. For instance, you might try planning your meals so that about 20% of your calories from each come from non-alkaline foods. Alternatively, you might try simply adhering to the diet perfectly most of the time while giving yourself a ""break"" from the diet every fifth meal.

, Be wary of any alkaline diet resource that argues that the only way to follow the diet properly is to buy specially-formulated (usually expensive) foods. These are, almost without exception, scams. A simple look at the list of ingredients above should be enough to reveal that it's possible to get all of the foods you need to follow an alkaline diet at your normal grocery store, so waste your money on dubious alternatives.

Determine your health goals and needs.,
Talk to your doctor about supplements for any specific conditions.,
Speak to a naturopath and a dietitian.,
Confirm the manufacturer has independent testing and received a seal of approval.,
Look for natural and non-synthetic supplements.,
Check the ingredients list on the supplement.,
Note the components of the supplement.,
Look at the strength level of the supplement.,
Compare prices between different manufacturers.,
Avoid supplements that seem over hyped or too good to be true.,
Select a powder, capsule, tablet, or liquid form of the supplement.,
Follow the recommended dosage on the label of the supplement.,
Store the supplements according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.,
Combine supplements with a healthy diet and a healthy lifestyle.,
Schedule a follow up appointment with your doctor.",How to Assess the Usefulness of Nutritional Supplements," Before you start taking nutritional supplements, it is important that you consider how supplements will help you achieve your health goals and needs. Taking supplements to target a specific health need, such as an iron deficiency, will ensure the supplements are being taken consciously and on a need by need basis. The supplement is likely to be more effective if it is for a specific issue, rather than a broad or general issue. You may ask yourself several questions about taking nutritional supplements, including:What am I trying to accomplish for my health? For example, maybe you are trying to increase your vitamin D levels because you are experiencing low energy, depression, and fatigue.
How will this supplement improve my health or my condition? For example, you may reason that taking vitamin D supplements will increase your vitamin D levels, thereby giving you more energy and making you feel less depressed.
How will it help prevent or treat a specific condition or issue? For example, you may take vitamin D supplements to increase your vitamin D levels. But vitamin D supplements won't work as treatment for an iron deficiency, for example. An iron deficiency would likely require a different supplement.;
, It is also important that you discuss taking nutritional supplements with your doctor before taking them. Your doctor should give you the specific names of any medical conditions you may have and recommend supplements that would work best for your conditions, or which supplements might aggravate your condition. You can also talk to your pharmacist about any recommended supplements for your condition. Ask your doctor several questions about the recommended supplements, including:How will these supplements improve my health? How long before I notice any benefits from the supplements?
How much research has been done on this supplement and is it safe to use?
What are the side effects of the supplements?
Will the supplements interfere with any other medications I am taking?
Can I take this supplement if I am pregnant or nursing?

, A naturopath is a physician who is trained in the use of botanical medicine and supplements. A registered dietitian is an expert in the use of food and nutrition to promote health.Both of these health experts can advise you on supplements you should take based on your condition. They can also help you determine if there is enough clinical evidence to support the use of a certain supplement.


You should ask the naturopath and the dietitian similar questions based on the questions you asked your doctor. Getting a well rounded and well informed take on supplements based on your health will increase the likelihood that the supplements are useful and effective for you.

, Because supplements are not regulated by the FDA, reputable supplement manufacturers will have independent labs test their supplements to ensure the supplements contain the ingredients stated on the label. The independent labs will then give the supplements their seals of approval.Supplements with a “USP Verified” label have been inspected by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, which is the main, most trustworthy organization involved in certifying supplements.


Other companies that perform this testing include Consumer Labs, the Natural Products Association (NPA), and LabDoor.
You can also look on the manufacturer’s website to check that they have the seals of approval. Call the manufacturer for more information on their quality controls. Reputable manufacturers will have consumer information readily available and independent verification that the ingredients stated on the label are in fact in the supplement.

It is extremely important you look for supplements that have been verified by an outside company; otherwise, there is no way of knowing whether or not the supplement is free of harmful ingredients and contains what it advertises.

, Natural, non-synthetic supplements are derived from whole foods and natural ingredients. Many professionals believe that these forms of supplements have greater benefits because our bodies can better process and use them.However, supplements made with natural, non-synthetic ingredients can be very expensive so you may need to budget for them or select supplements you can afford. This may mean going for natural, non-synthetic versions for some of your supplements, or as many supplements as your budget allows.
Again, if the supplement is unverified by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention or similar reputable company, there is no way to be sure non-synthetic supplements are truly non-synthetic.

, Reading the ingredients list on the supplements is key to choosing effective supplements for your health needs. Note if the supplement contains mostly natural products that are safe to consume and has only one to four listed ingredients.Remember that if the supplement has not been tested by an outside company, you cannot trust that the ingredient list is accurate.
Avoid supplements that have a very long list of ingredients. Unless the supplement is a multi-vitamin or multi-mineral, you should look for supplements with less than four ingredients.
You should also avoid supplements that contain additives or preservatives, such as added sugar or added coloring. Consumer Reports lists the following 15 ingredients to always avoid in supplements:aconite, caffeine powder, chaparral, coltsfoot, comfrey, germander, greater celandine, green tea extract powder, kava, lobelia, methylsynephrine, pennyroyal oil, red yeast rice, usnic acid, and yohimbe. These ingredients may have different names as well (usnic acid, for instance, is also called beard moss, tree moss, usnea).

, Some forms of supplements are better absorbed than others. Mineral supplements come in two parts: mineral and non-mineral. Depending on what the mineral is linked to will impact how your body absorbs it.


For example, calcium citrate is absorbed better than calcium carbonate; however, if you take it with a meal they are absorbed the same.Another example is magnesium. Your body will absorb magnesium citrate better than magnesium oxide.It is best to talk to your doctor, dietitian, or pharmacist about which form will be best for you.
Once again, if the supplement has not been tested and verified by an outside company, then there is no way to know if this information is accurate.

, You should also check the label for information about the amount of “elemental” minerals in the supplement. This will help you determine if the supplement contains full doses of the mineral or vitamin, or if it is mixed with other ingredients.


For example, if the label reads “10 mg of elemental Magnesium”, this means you are getting 10 mg of Magnesium for every dose. But if the label reads “10 mg of Magnesium citrate”, this means the actual amount of Magnesium is less than 10 mg, as the 10mg refers to the entire supplement and not just the Magnesium content.
This is another area where verification is important — it is impossible to know if an unverified supplement actually contains the dosage promised on the package.

, A more expensive supplement does not always guarantee it will be of a higher quality. As well, a cheaper supplement does not mean it will be of a lesser quality. Try to invest in a supplement that contains quality ingredients, as they will be more effective in the long term.Compare prices between several different suppliers. Focus on supplements that have a higher quality and look at how their quality levels match their price. You may end up paying more for a quality supplement but this could also mean you get better results from the supplement.

, There are many supplements on the market and it can be difficult to identify supplements that are too good to be true. But you should avoid any supplements that claim to cure anything and everything. There is no one mineral or vitamin that can solve all your health issues. You should be wary of supplements that promise fast results and the solution to all your health problems.The only instances a single supplement can cure a disorder if you have a deficiency of a particular substance, such as taking iron supplements to treat your iron-deficiency. More often than not, you may need to take several supplements to address your health needs.
It can also take time for supplements to work effectively, usually more than days or weeks. If the supplement’s promises seem too good to be true, they likely do not have much merit or value.

, Supplements can come in several different forms. Some supplements are better absorbed in liquid form, such as vitamin B, and other supplements are better absorbed in capsule form, such as vitamin D. Talk to your doctor about the best form of the supplement for you, based on your health needs.You may prefer a certain form based on comfort or accessibility. For example, if you do not like swallowing capsules or tablets, you may go for the liquid form of the supplements.
Depending on which supplements you are taking, you may want to start with the powder form of the supplement. This will make it easier to adjust the dosage based on your current health needs.

, There should be recommended dosage levels listed on the label of the supplement. The recommended dosage is usually appropriate for most people. You can double check your required dosage with your doctor, pharmacist, naturopath, or dietitian to ensure you are taking the correct amount of the supplement.Remember that you can experience adverse effects from taking too many supplements so you should avoid taking more than the recommended dosage. The mindset of “if one is good, two must be better” can actually do more harm than good.
If you take too much of your iron supplement, for example, you may develop negative side effects like constipation. Taking too many fat-soluable vitamins like vitamin D, E, and A can lead to high toxicity levels in your body. This can then lead to serious health issues and may cause issues such as calcium deposits in your organs, blurred vision, nausea, or other organ damage., To get the most benefits from the supplements, you should store them properly. The instructions for storing the supplements should be listed on the label. For example, some supplements do better if they are kept away from light and are stored in a cool, dark place. Others should be kept refrigerated.You should also check the expiry date of the supplements. Never consume supplements that have expired as they can lead to negative side effects and health issues., Supplements are only one element of improving your health. Often, they work better if you also maintain a healthy diet and maintain a healthy, active lifestyle. Exercise and a healthy diet, combined with carefully chosen supplements, can lead to better health overall., To get a good indicator of how useful and effective the supplements are, you should set a follow up appointment with your doctor. See your doctor several months after you have started taking the supplements to determine how your health has improved. You should also take into account the positive effects of maintaining a healthy diet and an active lifestyle, in addition to taking the supplements.Your doctor should be able to help you determine if the supplements are effective. They may also adjust your dosage if the supplements are not working or suggest a different type of supplement for your health issues.

Limit alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, and drug use.",How to Alkalize Your Body2," Alkaline diet resources frequently claim that stress is either a cause or an effect of bodily acid levels that are too high.The exact connection between stresses and acidity hasn't been confirmed by science. However, what is definitively known is that a low-stress lifestyle is a healthy one. Reducing stress is associated with lower rates of major health problems, like heart disease, so it's a good idea regardless of what diet you're on.Keeping stress low can be a lifelong challenge. Though everyone's needs are different, here are just a few solutions doctors often prescribe for stress:Getting plenty of exercise
Slowing down and taking deep breaths
Talking to friends and family when you're stressed
Spending time outdoors
Laughing
Meditation

, Getting plenty of exercise is a vital part of staying healthy for virtually everyone. However, if you've ever had sore muscles after a few hours at the gym, you'll know that intense exercise can lead to a painful buildup of lactic acid in the muscles. To lessen this acid buildup, make an effort to give yourself time to recover after you push your body hard. Your body needs time to break down this acid and rebuild damaged tissue — if it doesn't get it, you may be left with painful cramps.


If you've got an intense fitness routine, try working different muscle groups on alternate days to ensure that each group gets a chance to rest. For example, if you work out your upper body on Monday, spend Tuesday working on your lower body.

, Alkaline diets will often recommend against using any sort of mind-or-body-altering substance with the claim that they are acidifying. In fact, at least for caffeine, this claim is doubtful.However, it's still a wise piece of advice — these sorts of substances have a range of negative health effects that are well-publicized.


Even caffeine, by far the least harmful of these substances, can occasionally cause long-term health issues, especially if you're already predisposed to certain health disorders like heart disease, high blood pressure, anxiety, and more."

Understand that the human body's pH level can't be adjusted.,
Don't believe claims that alkalines are disease cures.,
Understand the danger of alkalosis.",How to Alkalize Your Body3," Claims that an alkaline diet and lifestyle will make your body more alkaline are false. In fact, the body has multiple complex mechanisms for keeping the pH level of its blood in a relatively narrow range between 7.35 and 7.45.While other fluids (like urine and the contents of the stomach) can have different pH levels, these are not by themselves a sign of your overall health.


Note that a blood pH level outside of this narrow range can cause dangerous conditions called acidosis (if the pH gets too low) and alkalosis (if the pH gets too high). It's generally impossible for healthy people to get either of these conditions simply through diet and lifestyle changes.

, Some sources unfortunately claim that an alkaline diet offers protection against serious health problems like cancer. There is no scientific grounding for these claims. If you have a major health problem, do not prioritize an alkaline diet over proper medical care.


The basis for claims that alkaline diets help cure cancer are a few studies that show that certain cancer cells can grow faster in acidic solutions. However, these studies were performed in test tubes — not in human bodies. In fact, the differences between the conditions in a test tube and those in the human body are so great that it can't be said with certainty that an alkaline diet wouldn't be harmful in a real-world situation.

, As noted above, a harmful condition called alkalosis occurs when the pH of the blood is too high. This is almost always a cause of disease, organ damage, altitude sickness, or poisoning.Because alkalosis is so dangerous, it's important to never attempt to artificially raise your blood pH level directly (via injection, drinking a strong alkaline solution, etc.) This mistake can be deadly.


Symptoms of alkalosis include nausea, confusion, headache, muscle spasms, light-headedness, and numbness in the face or limbs."

Acquire an in-depth knowledge of medical terminology and other fundamental aspects of medical writing such as pharmacology and research and statistics.,
Enhance your knowledge by reading reports on the Food and Drug Administration website or in online medical journals.,
Hone your writing skills.,
Research the available job opportunities.,
Decide whether you want to be a freelancer or a full time employee.,
Apply for a position as a medical writer.,
Choose an area of expertise.",How to Become a Medical Writer," The best way to do this is to enroll in classes at a university, either one that is local to you or an online university.;
, Pay attention to structure, tone, notes, and use of terminology.

,


Again, this is best done by following university courses in writing. Though it is helpful to get a degree in English, you can also complete certificate courses at various universities that enable you to learn the structures of different kinds of texts.
You can also buy writing books to enhance your understanding of grammar, syntax, and vocabulary, amongst other things.
Joining a writing group may offer a good way of getting feedback on your work and helping you build a portfolio.
Practice medical writing. Even before you get your first professional assignment, you need to practice medical writing. Research other texts, such as entries in medical journals, and try to emulate them. If at all possible, ask a professional writer to critique your work.

, Though there are many medical writers who seek full time employment with a single enterprise or institute, there are also many freelance medical writers who work on an assignment basis. On job sites, you can research the average salary for an entry-level medical writer. You can also join discussions on freelance writers' discussion boards to find out the average compensation per assignment.

, Both have their advantages and disadvantages. For a beginning medical writer, the freelance market can be extremely challenging when it comes to finding clients, though it will allow you plenty of freedom in terms of time management. As a full employee, you'll enjoy all of the benefits of a regular job, but you'll also need to commit all of your working hours to the position.

, Again, online job boards such as Monster and company websites will list job openings that you can reply to with your cover letter, resume, and some samples of your work. For freelance work, it's a good idea to look on freelance job boards such as Craigslist, Elance, and Guru.


If you can't find a regular position right away, apply for an internship as a medical writer. An internship will help in terms of making contacts and learning all of the practical aspects of medical writing under the guidance of an editor.

, You can become an expert at pharmaceutical writing, educational medical writing, or medical reports, amongst other things. Becoming an expert in a particular area will enhance your skills and make you more marketable, as your knowledge and skills will surpass that of many competitors who remain generalists in their field.

Choose an area of graphic design.,
Acquire the tools.,
Purchase textbooks.,
Take a course in graphic design.,
Get involved with the design community.,
Further your education.",How to Become a Graphic Designer1," Before you can call yourself a graphic designer, you have to make some decisions. For example, are you interested in advertising, web development, multimedia (ex. the TV industry), print design, or animation? These can all be considered different forms of graphic design. Narrow your focus on an area that appeals to you.


While graphic design is fundamentally the same whether in print or online, there are also key differences in resolutions, color space, and other variables that are specific to the medium you want to focus on. Though you can certainly do both, it's best to focus on one to begin with.;
, The industry standard applications for graphic design are Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. (If you plan to go all-out, the full Adobe Creative Suite includes Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Illustrator, Premiere, Photoshop, InDesign and After Effects.) While both applications are designed to be easy to use from the start, they are very feature rich and will require a great deal of focused effort to master them.


These programs aren’t cheap. To get started, play around with free alternatives like Gimp, Scribus, Inkscape, and Pixlr, all of which will help you learn the ropes until you’re willing and able to drop big bucks on the real thing.

, Focus on books that teach design fundamentals, then study as though you were taking a college course. Instead of working for a grade, however, your reward will be a career that you love.

, It's not just to become an expert in programs like Photoshop and Illustrator, but to learn how to use these valuable tools in conjunction with developing a marketable design sense.

, Practicing at home is a great, safe way to learn the ropes, but eventually, you need to put yourself out there so you can get feedback. Though it may be painful at first, keep your ego in check and take the tips seriously; the payoff will be enormous. Additionally, it’s important to see what other people are doing so that you’re exposed to more than just one or two styles.


As with any business, networking is important in graphic design, especially if you intend to freelance. Make friends, keep in touch, be willing to learn, and you might just get work out of it.

, Really interested in graphic design? Consider getting a degree. Academic settings can be inspiring and networking with others in your field is always a good thing. On top of that, many people won’t hire a graphic designer without seeing some proof that they’ve been properly trained. Consider these options:


If you want a degree that will lend you credibility but don’t have much time or money, get an associate’s. This is typically a two-year degree and can be acquired at a community college or trade school. The emphasis will be more on computer skills than art theory, but it’s a good place to start.
If you want a degree with some weight to it, get a bachelor’s. This is typically a four-year degree that can be acquired at a college or university. In addition to learning all the necessary computer skills, you will also be trained in art and design.

Not 100% sure that graphic design will be your career path? Get a bachelor’s of arts degree, not a bachelor’s of fine arts. Though both are great for this type of work, a B.A. is less focused than a B.F.A., covers more general education, and makes it easier for you to change to a wildly different major should you choose to pursue something else.


If you already have a B.A. or B.S., do post-baccalaureate work in graphic design. These courses may even earn you a certificate, credential, or second bachelor’s degree.
If you’re dead-set on being a graphic designer, get a graduate degree. If you haven’t done so already, you will first have to get a bachelor’s degree. Consider minoring or getting a second major in a business-related field if you’re also interested in freelancing.

Try sushi rolls with nori.,
Purchase a miso soup package.,
Enjoy pudding with agar.",How to Add Sea Vegetables to Your Diet1," Nori, a seaweed species often found as an edible sheet, is one of the most common sea vegetables and is found in most sushi rolls. If you are just beginning to incorporate sea vegetables into your diet, fresh sushi is a great way to start. The flavor of the nori is masked by the rice, fish, soy, and wasabi.

You can try making your own sushi rolls or purchase them pre-made from a grocery store or Japanese restaurant.;
, Specialty grocery stores will often sell pre-mixed miso soup packages that contain sea vegetables. If you have never tried sea vegetables before, this is a great way to start. This will allow you to learn the flavor without having to cook with them from scratch.Look in the international aisle of your grocery store or visit a specialty store, such as Whole Foods.

, Many people do not realize this, but a lot of instant puddings and jellos contain agar, a gelatin like sea vegetable. Agar is actually a combination of sea vegetables and is an excellent substitution for animal or chemical based gelatins. This ingredient can be found in strips or powders in most health food stores, and is often used to firm up jellies and puddings."

Get in the habit of carrying a camera and a voice recorder with you so that you have them when you unexpectedly need them.",How to Be a Reporter," To be a good reporter, you will need to read, write, speak and listen. You will need to be able to ask good questions.;
, Notice how events are depicted. Notice what makes a good story and what doesn't. What would you like to see done better? What seems to be empty sensationalism?

, Practice noting and writing about what happens around you.

, Be sure to cover both sides of any contentious issue.

, Don't make assumptions (they can often be wrong), and don't make things up. Reporters are supposed to seek and report facts. Lying, making up stories or quotes, or even accidentally misquoting someone can only damage your credibility (an absolutely essential quality in a reporter).


When someone tells you something that you find important to the story, whether it's allegedly factual or simply an opinion, go ahead and quote that person. Then if what they told you turns out to be wrong or inaccurate, it will be their credibility--not yours--that suffers.

, As a reporter, your job is to report the facts so others can form their own opinions. Make sure you are recording the factual details of any news story and tell those facts without including your personal viewpoint. Once you start giving your opinion, it becomes editorializing, not news reporting.

, You could focus on print journalism, broadcast news, or even online news coverage. You can focus at first on one medium and then branch out as you become more experienced. The print news industry is an excellent place to start. That's where many successful reporters began their careers.

, Build details from there, beginning with the most important information and working toward the least important. By including the most important information first, you will allow your editor to trim the end of the story if it runs too long.

, Chances are good that others will find them interesting, too. You can report on ""hard"" news stories which involve current events of interest to a wide audience, or you can report on softer ""feature"" stories which might involve more light-hearted events and be of more casual interest.

, If it is relevant today but won't be as interesting next week, next month or next year, you should report it as news.
Recent changes in government policy or personnel
A plane crash or other tragedy
Any other topic that is dramatic or alarming

, A feature story may be as interesting weeks or months from now as it is today

, Often, local news is not accorded the professional reportage that national or regional stories receive, even though local news may be of huge interest to the audience. The city council makes decisions every day that affect everyone in town!

, Did a new city park just open? Is a local club kicking off its summer fundraiser? Be there and publish an account of the event for those who didn't attend.

, Go to events, conduct your own research, then write the stories and forward them to local media outlets. If an article is well written, and the story isn't already covered, you may get published.

, If you have good information, and the other writer does,too, your stories might be combined under a shared ""byline"" (authorship).

, If you submit a human-interest piece to a media outlet, they may decide to save your work and use it later to fill space on a ""slow"" news day.

, These media will usually be happy to hire a good reporter. Even if they don't pay well, or if you have to start as a volunteer, it's a good way to get your foot in the door.

, That's a good way to learn to report news and feature stories.

, This might give you access to news events and venues that the public doesn't have.

, Then be prepared to turn them over to your employer if he/she wants to fact-check your information before publishing it.

, Get old copies of magazines of all different styles from secondhand stores and read through the different writing styles. Make notes on style techniques, quirks and interesting angles.

, Through the previous step you should be able to determine your favorite type of publication (art, fashion, trade, etc.)

,, You can gather this information from the masthead or in some instances, through researching online.

, Most editors are going to want to see clips or sample pieces. Since you are starting from scratch, you will need to create up to three brilliant articles that you don't intend ever having published. These will serve simply as a reference of what you are capable of.

, Using the information you've gathered from mastheads, mail or email editors with your details. Be sure to address them directly by name to show that you are familiar with their publication.

Look for a job.,
Do your homework.,
Familiarize yourself with the equipment.,
Prepare a shift.,
Prepare in advance.,
Develop your presence.,
Improve your delivery.,
Increase your knowledge.",How to Be a Radio Announcer," When you’ve found a station that you would like to work for, you need to send in your CV, application letter and a tape showing your on-air skills (personality pieces, interviews, news reading and weather, etc). It may help if you have some knowledge in the industry and have had previous work experience. If you have done so, put onto tape everything you’ve done that you think may sell yourself to the radio station/manager. If you haven't, put together a tape yourself using a stereo and microphone, recording yourself reading news and weather, and other things that are entertaining.;
, Before you actually get a shift on radio, you need to know about the station. This includes what music they play, their target audience, their programming, the station history and their audience. This is important because you need to know that what you're going to talk about on air is going to interest them. For example, if you are planning on working for a station that has an audience of ages 30+, you wouldn’t talk in modern slang (Sup, yo!) or talk about the latest Xbox game you're currently hooked on, and vice versa.

, It's very important that you know how to use the equipment that will be used during shifts. These include the phone system, computer system, main control board, audio editing programs, announcer desk, and what knowing the broadcasting system the station uses.

, Preparing a shift takes time. Here are a few things you need to know:


Songs played - You need to know what songs are going to be played during your shift, and when they are going to be played.
Artists - Find information on some of the artists you will be playing. Prepare artist news, shows, new albums etc.
Current Affairs - It's a good thing to mention what's happening, including local events and local, national or international news.
Entertainment - This can include things such as this day in history, celebrity news (remembering your audience), and things that simply occur in day to day living that we can relate to.

, Preparing a shift right before you're due to go on isn't the best experience. You need time to practice what you're going to say before you go on. If you don't have time to practice, this can lead to slipping up and making mistakes (see ""Warnings"" below).

, Practicing before you go on can give you more confidence, and less mistakes. For best results, practice what you're going to say thoroughly, then write short sentences and improvise around them. When you read directly what you've written it can often sound unnatural (like you're reading a story book). Talk like you you would to someone you know (your mother or your best mate).

, Try tongue-twisters and sentences that need a lot of intonation. By trying some of the following phrases, and slowly increasing speed, you get your mouth prepped and in working order before going on the air. It decreases the chances of you fluffing up by pronouncing things wrong, or spoonerisms. Try these phrases:


""There's a peacock on the car park.""
""Red lorry, yellow lorry"".
""The teeth, the tongue, the tip of the lips"".
""She sells seashells by the seashore"".

, Always make sure that you have enough information regarding anything that happens in the world, and in your community. This is very essential because a microphone can drain all your backup information.

Do what you love.,
Read graphic design books.,
Study the pros.,
Research fonts.,
Develop a unique style.,
Gather interesting designs.,
Don’t throw any of your work away.,
Redesign other people’s work.,
Create a portfolio.",How to Become a Graphic Designer2," If you are compelled by ornate designs with florid script and bright colors, focus on that. If you love that style, focus on developing that design sense. If your passion is for the clean, well-balanced line, with simple color schemes and powerful graphics, make it your own.

, They can be really helpful and will speed up the process of your education.

, Hunt down and devour the designs featured in newspapers, magazines, the Internet, and anywhere else you spot graphic design (hint: it will be everywhere you look).


Don't limit yourself to what is traditionally considered ""graphic design,"" but expand into other areas as well, such as industrial designers like Joey Roth or Makota Makita & Hiroshi Tsuzaki; or architects such as Santiago Calatrava or Frank Gehry. Draw inspiration to foster your own creativity.
Don't just look in the likely places. Check out wine stores, for example: label design is a key part of the industry. Also check out fashion websites, book stores, music labels, even product design packaging.

, People who get into typography are a whole other breed. They agonize over book print, street signs, and movie credits. They have serious opinions about serifs. They mock your Comic Sans. A good graphic designer should understand the importance of typeface, leading, kerning, and everything else that goes with creating effective text.

, You want people, when they see your designs, to recognize and know that it is your work. The more they know, the quicker things will work for you.

, Whether it’s a t-shirt, a pamphlet, a food label, a postcard, or a poster, collect anything and everything that excites and inspires you. Study them, note what you like and don’t like, and tuck them away so that you can use them as references whenever you feel stuck on a project.

, Even if you hate something, swallow that lump in your throat and save it. When you feel strong enough, look back over your old work with a fresh eye. What worked? What didn’t? How much has your style grown? You might even be inspired to redo some of your older projects and turn them into masterpieces.

, See a terrible design somewhere? Take a photo or save a copy and rework it for fun. See a fantastic design? Even better! Challenge yourself to add something that the original artist missed. Just as the aspiring music student studies the masters, and learns what they did, by working within other people’s designs will you be able to truly understand what does or doesn’t make it tick and why.

, In addition to needing one if you ever want to get real work, putting together a portfolio challenges you to make critical judgments of your own work. Which pieces are your best and why? Which ones don’t make the cut? Is there a theme – and if so, can you play it up in the portfolio? If you want to work digitally, showcase your portfolio on a website.

Use sea vegetables to make soup stocks.,
Cook sea palm pasta.,
Try dulse chips.,
Make a salad with sea vegetables.",How to Add Sea Vegetables to Your Diet2," In order to incorporate sea vegetables into soup stock, simply add dulse, wakame, kelp, or kombu to the stock. For example, add a three to five inch (7-12 cm) strip of sea vegetable for every quart (liter) of water. Sea vegetables make an excellent substitute for table salt and will give your soup a nice salty flavor.
Try to make your own miso soup.
Dulse is a red, leafy sea plant rich in fiber. Wakame is an edible seaweed that is known for its subtle sweetness. Kombu is a form of kelp popular in Japanese and Korean dishes. All of these can be found online, or at heath food stores and specialty Asian food markets., Sea vegetables are primarily used in side dishes or as a form of seasoning. However, there are a few recipes available that use sea vegetables as the main ingredient. For example, try making a sea vegetable pasta by replacing fettuccine noodles with sea palm.Soak the sea palm in water for approximately 20 minutes before cooking.
Then, steam the sea palm for 15 to 20 minutes.
Top with your favorite sauce and enjoy!

, Dulse is a red seaweed that is most often shredded and dried and sprinkled in soups; however, you can also eat dulse on its own. For example, try baking dulse in the oven sprinkled with olive oil to create dulse chips. These can then be eaten as a healthy snack., Wakame is often served in Japanese cuisine as a part of salads. For example, you can mix wakame with sesame oil and place it on a bed of lettuce for a simple salad with excellent flavor and texture."

One excellent way to begin eating sea vegetables is by creating a simple table seasoning and then sprinkling it on your favorite dishes for added flavor.For example, combine 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of kelp flakes, with ½ teaspoon of garlic powder, and ¼ teaspoon of white pepper.
Place in a salt shaker.

, The next time you make popcorn try flavoring it with powdered kelp. This will give the popcorn a salty taste, but will come with the added vitamin and mineral benefits associated with sea vegetables. Season the popcorn to your preferred taste.You can purchase kelp in flake or powdered form from most health food stores.

, Add sea vegetables, in the form of dulse flakes to your guacamole recipe. This is an excellent way to incorporate sea vegetables into your diet without being overwhelmed by the strong flavor.For example, blend together 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of dulse flakes, with 1 mashed avocado, 3 diced scallions, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of lemon juice, and ⅛ of a teaspoon of cayenne.

Join the National Cartoonists Society.",How to Be a Cartoonist," Do you find yourself doodling in your notebook at school? Would you rather draw a picture of an idea than write a paragraph describing it? Have your teachers, friends and family members praised your artistic abilities? Have they asked you to make posters, flyers or other artistic works? If so, this might be a sign you are a natural fit to become a cartoonist.Most cartoonist positions do not require a formal education. A rich portfolio of work can be just as important -- if not more so -- than a degree. But a college education can help you connect to other cartoonists in your field, give you valuable professional experience through internships, and an opportunity to learn the latest technologies used by cartoonists.College or art school will also give you the opportunity to study valuable skills you might need in running your own business, how to write for a comic strip in creative writing courses, and how to develop additional skills in related fields like animation or multimedia design, and journalism.;
, Most art schools have their own requirements for compiling and submitting a portfolio, but they generally have to include 10-20 pieces of your best work (they can be unpublished). While you might be most interested in showing your cartoons, you should also include a broad range of work with multiple mediums, like paint, pastels,and photography.Keep your work in a binder with plastic sleeves protecting the work. The portfolio should be clean and easy to view.

, In high school, don't just keep your art locked up in your journals or notebooks. Instead, take as many art electives as you can and start building up a portfolio that you can use to apply to college.Draw for your high school newspaper or magazine to get a sense of whether you like working for a publication. You will get into the practice of meeting deadlines and collaborating with an editor to create your cartoons.
Contact your local city's newspaper to see if they need any freelance cartoon or illustration work.
Maintain good grades and test scores. While you might think that an excellent academic record is not necessary to become an artist, it can be a major asset in furthering your career goals. The best art colleges and programs are very competitive; good grades will show your committee that you have the dedication and work ethic required to complete a large-scale art project.It is also worth it to study for your SAT/ACT. While some art schools only require these scores on an optional basis, they can help you earn scholarships and fellowships to fund your education.You can find study resources through the College Board's web site, including practice tests and sample questions. Do not study for the test overnight -- give yourself months to prepare. You can practice using a study guide book (often available in your local public library), by attending a prep course offered by companies like Kaplan or Pearson, or working with a private tutor.

, You might consider going to a university with an acclaimed school or art major within it, or you could also consider an art college to study.


Prestigious programs include the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Yale University, the University of California -- Los Angeles and the California Institute of the Arts.Write an artist's statement. Many art colleges require an artist's statement in your application. This is similar to a personal statement, except you use it to clearly express your perspective on your art and creative process. Why do you create the art that you do? What are your objectives as an artist?Keep in mind that the artist's statement shouldn't explain to the reader how to interpret your work. Rather, use the statement to give your perspective on your art, why you believe it is important and valuable work, and how you go about creating your pieces.
Prepare for an interview. Many art schools and programs admit students after interviewing them. Think of this as an opportunity to stand out to your committee and to give yourself a competitive edge over other candidates. Bring your artist's statement and your portfolio with you to the interview.You will most likely be asked questions about your philosophy as an artist and what you hope to accomplish by studying in the program. Memorize responses to these questions so you can answer them very honestly and naturally in your interview.

, While you may know that becoming a cartoonist is your ultimate goal, consider specializing in broad areas, like Multimedia art and animation. Multi-media artists make a median salary of $61, 370 a year and often have more stable, full time work than freelance cartoonists.Multimedia art will give you valuable skills in computer programming and how to create graphics using different design software. You will get to build your storyboarding skills as your learn to create visuals for video games, films and other media., While your coursework will add significantly to your portfolio, continue to seek out freelance opportunities with other clients while you are in college. Look to your local newspapers or magazines to see if you can do any temporary projects with them.Consider focusing on a specialization in cartoons. Do you want to write political cartoons, comic books or graphic novels? Do you want to draw animated cartoons for film and television? Try your hand at each of these categories to see which one you enjoy the most.
Your college newspaper or art review will also be great sources to publish your work. Consider applying to join the editorial team on these publications.
Apply for art prizes and competitions. These might be hosted by your school's art department, your local arts alliance or by a larger institution, like the National Endowment for the Arts. Gaining accolades while you are in college will help strengthen the worth of your portfolio., A cartoonist is often not just tasked with creating a drawing using pencil and paper. Often you will be required to learn other skills, especially if you want to illustrate for comic books or comic strips. Look into taking classes that specialize in some of the following skills or professional roles:Pencil work
Colorist
Designing letter work for comic books
Ink work

, Although you will produce many cartoons for class projects, you should also look into getting an internship with a reputable company in your field. This experience can be a launching point for your career in that field. Some excellent companies include:DC Comics
Marvel Comics
Dark Horse Comics
Walt Disney Imagineering
Fisher-Price

Critique yourself.",How to Be a Film Critic," It’s hard to make it as a big-time film critic. Many critics work hard for years before earning any money at all. Moreover, many critics write film reviews as a hobby, simply because they love film. Film criticism takes a lot of time and effort, and a steady income is not guaranteed, so passion is key.A passion for film criticism will show through in your work.;
, If you want to critique films, you need to know what makes a quality film. Look for critically acclaimed films across all the different genres, and watch them. Consider classic films, indie films, foreign films, short films, animated films, comedies, and dramas.Be sure to watch as many “classic films” as you can--film critics often reference these. Search “classic films” online to find a number of lists.Purchasing a subscription to a streaming service like Netflix is a great way to get access to a wide variety of films.

, Reading the work of established film critics will help you gain a better understanding of film critic writing and film as an art form. Find a few critics who you really like, and follow their work.Form your own opinions about a given film, then read a critic’s review to see how your opinions compare with theirs.Take note of your favorite critics’ writing style and tone, and examine how they present their ideas. How do humor and context factor in to the critique?, A good understanding of filmmaking and video editing is important to being a good film critic. Making a few short films of your own, whether they are 5 minutes long or an hour long, can help inform your interpretation of others’ films., The majority of film critics are journalists who end up specializing in film writing. If you are in college, consider majoring or minoring in journalism. Otherwise, you can take a journalism class at your local community college or online.You don’t need to study journalism to become a film critic, but it’s helpful if you want to make a career out of film criticism., Try taking some film classes at your school, online, or at your local community college. Majoring or minoring in film can be helpful if you are looking to be a professional film critic., The two major routes to becoming a film critic are through the field of journalism, and through film blogging. Film critics often start film critique blogs for pleasure. A blog can be a stepping stone to a career in film criticism. Your blog will allow you to practice your writing skills and create a portfolio of your work.Don’t be shy when it comes to expressing your opinion on your blog. Your content should be high quality, but also honest and genuine., If film criticism is a hobby, you might be happy publishing your work on your film blog alone. However, if you are trying to become a professional film critic, you should send your work to newspapers, magazines, and online publications to try your hand at getting published.While jobs with print media are becoming more scarce, digital media offers a wide range of new opportunities.
Getting published is difficult, so don’t give up! It may take years of practice, so keep blogging, reading the work of other film critics, and studying film.

, After you have built up a portfolio with your blog and maybe even gotten a few pieces published, you can start applying for jobs as a film critic. You might be interested in freelance work, in which a business or individual hires you for a particular project. You can also apply for jobs at movie review websites and other digital and print publications.There are many freelance job sites online. Take some time to look at the listings to see if a project interests you.
This will probably be a side job, at least initially. Many positions are part time, and likely won’t pay enough to be your only source of income.

, There are different forms of film criticism. The most common form is the review, which acts as a recommendation or warning for people who haven’t yet seen the film. These are a few hundred words and focus on evaluating the film--saying whether it is excellent, good, mediocre, or poor.An academic article is more formal than a review, and much longer. It is less focused on opinion, and assumes the reader has seen the film.
A critical essay is less formal and more opinionated than an academic article, but more formal than a review.
Don’t feel pressured to choose a particular form of criticism and stick to it. Many film critics write in all three forms, or blend different forms!

, A film critic should not merely describe the plot, scenes, music, and style of the film they are studying, but also be able to analyze these elements. To analyze a film, think about how different elements work together and the effect they produce.For example, you might observe that a director uses a lot of dark colors in his film. Through analysis, you might conclude that this use of color mirrors the dark emotions of the main character.
Critical essays and academic articles focus on description and analysis, while reviews usually do not.

, A critic should be able to interpret a film, or determine its meaning. Think about the claims a film is making. What message is the director trying to convey? Different critics may have different interpretations of the same film.A film critic might interpret the film Snow White as a commentary on the pitfalls of vanity.
Critical essays and academic articles offer interpretations, whereas reviews sometimes do, but often don't.

, Evaluation is the most important aspect of a movie review. When you evaluate a film, you make a judgment about its quality. Is it an excellent film, a mediocre film, or a bad film? Base your evaluation on your understanding of film as an art form.A critic might offer the evaluation that Snow White is one of the best animated films of its time.
Reviews focus heavily on evaluation, while critical essays and academic articles place less emphasis on evaluation.

, You may like a film, but as a critic, recognize that it is not a high quality film. In the same way, you may not enjoy a film, but acknowledge it is well made. When writing as a critic, it’s important to make judgments about film quality rather than relying on your own tastes.You should base your judgments on general criteria for excellence. These include originality, good acting, technical skill, an engaging plot, and emotional intensity. Reading the work of other critics and watching high quality films will give you a better idea of what makes an excellent film.
It’s fine to let your tastes show through in movie reviews--many critics do. Celebrity critics are often famous for displaying their preferences. Just make sure you are looking at the film with a critical eye, too.

, Writing is at the heart of film criticism, because writing is how a film critic conveys their ideas. Make sure you have a sound understanding of organization, grammar, and style.Reading great works of literature, as well as the works of your favorite film critics, is an important step in learning to write well.Formal training in writing is not necessary, but it can help. Many employers, particularly those in mainstream media, look for film critics with a background in journalism or communication. Consider taking writing classes at your school, univeristy, or local community college., Every film critic should offer a unique perspective on cinema that guides their work. This perspective should extend beyond individual films, and instead focus on how film as a whole relates to art, society, or politics.Some critics believe that film can offer guiding wisdom to help people live better lives. Others believe that every film element has a significant symbolic value. To develop your own guiding philosophy, think about what film means to you as an art form and how it relates to life.

, Be honest in your critiques of films. Don’t bash a film just for dramatic effect. At the same time, don’t be afraid to speak out against a film that other critics have praised., People read film critiques for the ideas and opinions they contain, not for artistic writing style. While your pieces should be well written, avoid using flowery language or technical jargon, which can detract from clarity., While you’ll be constantly offering critiques of others’ work, you should always remain critical of your own. Try to find the weaknesses in your arguments, and address them. A finished critical piece should be the product of multiple drafts."

Do your research!,
Choose your part of the publishing or entertainment industry to try to get your work published (or discovered): whether to write non-fiction: journalist, technical writer, biographer, science, social and philosophical -- or fiction: including stories, books.,
Become a proficient writer with marketable ideas.,
Don't be overwhelmed; so break up your product: Write in chapters, units, verses, stories, episodes or acts to make it doable.

,
Be patient when you write or try to get ""discovered""; not all of the plan, map, outline or plot will come at once.,
Make the best use of your capabilities and sources.,
Copyright your work: See a copyright attorney.,
Search for a publisher or publishing service online using Yahoo or Google to choose one to use.,
Market your product!",How to Be a Professional Writer," See what's hot to read and what's not so hot. You must find (or create) a need or strongly felt desire to read your words, thoughts and mental pictures... Knowing what others will find interesting will make your writing better and help you to create ""demand"" for more! You would probably need to specialize in one kind of work and an area of real interest or knowledge. Once you've established the basics of your purpose for writing, then read good works of your genre (kind of written work) that have won awards, for inspiration and to learn as much as you can about what you should include in your work to create a product that is in demand, and you will ""supply"" the market with your skills.



Search online for some good suggestions on writing and publishing!;
, But, of course poetry, song lyrics, plays and movie scripts can be of either fact or fantasy.


Consider getting training and criticism of your skills in writing: Take college English, creative writing or continuing education classes, if you feel in need of help that instructors and teachers might offer. Practice writing, and get knowledgeable people to read it, asking for and accepting constructive suggestions and seek ""literary criticism"": it is not personal criticism. Don't be hurt or argue. Listen, smile, be agreeable and express appreciation. Maybe the criticizer is not up to speed about some market that you think is your niche; so, grin and bear it, if you are aiming at a specialty.

, Improve your skills, develop techniques, choose your type of literature and produce your best product by doing many tricky and creative tasks:


Plan or outline your work: Whether it is a short or long work you need to have a purpose and a framework -- such as a setting and plot for a play, episodic story or book. Make profiles of some characters that will be in your story or biography, etc.; gradually create their different ""roles"".
Choose a definite audience (kids, ""tweens"", teens, young adults, adults, or mature citizens/seniors). Start writing what they will want to read!
Make sure every new sentence is worth the ink, linked together with what came before and after it so that they all form a ""page-turner"", a flowing work of language-art. There shouldn't be any useless (off topic) sentence in your works! Make sure to quickly get to your point and reflect some bits of needed details little by little.
Use dialogue effectively, if there are any characters: Let the characters do your dirty work (so you won't need much narration, and can avoid the sort of storyteller/narrating character who explains everything). Characters can explain lunatic-/brilliant-philosophies or introduce complex tales or drop bits of foreshadowing -- create conflict, argue and make mistakes that will need to be resolved: They can discuss their ideas among themselves. Talk with other characters and about the setting, using their dialogue to tell a large amount of pertinent information.

Begin to build each character's ""part"" and reflect on their likes and dislikes, their strengths and weaknesses in passing, not all at once.


Use enough information for your topic and your kind of audience, such as for: building suspense, inspiration, forming logic, offering self-help, the characters, romance or present your humor. Otherwise, if you don't give needed detail or give too much, readers will be disappointed, minds will wander, quickly getting bored, and will not continue to pursue a ""miss-mesh"".
Give hints, imply ideas, but leave some details to the readers imagination until more depth is needed.
Do not put too much details in at one time, or make them too perfect as stereotypical types of characters (unless this is a cartoon, or soap opera)! Some detail may be hints or color-in a mental picture; but some are just details of a setting of events, place and time period, if they matter or just are part of the texture and flavor of your work.
Use note cards, an index with page numbers, a detailed table of contents or ""bubble map"" (with kite strings between parts) to find where you put some event or thought, to change or add a new idea.

,, It may take a few weeks, months, maybe a year to put flesh on the skeleton of the body of your creative efforts! Just know that once you've sown the words, you can eventually reap a wonderful harvest, if you tend to your sentences, paragraphs/verses, leading correctly to the climax or other goal -- then self-publish at your expense -- or seek a publisher!

, There should be no signs of halfhearted writing in your product. Everything should flow and have an impact on the reader. Edit your material, and don't be afraid to change some things to make it even better! A good idea when rewriting a chapter or a large section is to keep a copy of the old one, in case you find that the original writing is better than the new. Edit as many times as you need to, but not any more than that! Check for any spelling errors and grammatical mistakes. If you have too many mistakes in your work, readers may grow frustrated and throw the ""nonsense"" down!


When you're sure your creation is ready, be sure to make citations of sources and acknowledgements in a foreword, if you had any help or sources! You need to give credit to those who gave you or tended to your idea and not take all the glory for yourself (avoid plagiarism -- copyright violations)!

, One common law copyright is established by mailing a work to yourself, which may or may not be a good idea. Copyright is a property right, created by the laws of a country that grant the creator of an original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution, usually for a limited number of years (which may be able to be renewed), with the intention of enabling the creator (e.g. the photographer of a photograph or the author of a book) to receive compensation for their intellectual effort. Copyright is called an intellectual-property right (as patents, trademarks and trade secrets are also), of any expressible form of an idea or information that is substantive and discrete., Make sure it's one that you like and trust. See whether there are any reviews about the publishing service you like, and read what people say. If the majority seems to give it a good rating, it may be a service you want to try! If not, keep looking for options of how to get published:


Seek a traditional big publisher. Write a great book, and query agents and publishers until you find one who is willing to publish it for you.
Narrow your scope to small specialty publishers. If you have a niche (special interest), look for a publisher who only prints books about that topic. Small publishers need works to fit their category: romance, childrens, historical, car and hot rod, cycles, computer topics, horror, mystery and such.
Self-publish -- pay a publishing service or copy shop to reproduce copies and bind your book, or go to a self-service copy shop and do-it-yourself. There are several variations of this technique which all boil down to pay for your own printing, binding and marketing out your pocket:

Publish an electronic book (eBook) -- Create it on your computer and putting it on a CD for distribution and/or online. Purchasers pay to download the file(s) as a ""read only"" computer file. You may publish and market your book online or on Kindle!
Publish on Demand (POD) -- Pay a publisher to set up your keystrokes/computer files, to be kept and copied off (like an ebook being put onto paper) for a fee, readying it to print the first copy (cost depending on size, and complexity of what is entailed). Once received, it is transferred to a paginated form on an automated system, which may also bind it, one or more copies at a time. ""On demand,"" means printing one when someone orders it. If you want occasional copies yourself, you simply order and pay for them as any book purchaser must do, but you receive a percentage or set dollar royalty on orders.Vanity publish -- Create a bound book with cover art and your name on it, making only a few books to give away to family, colleagues, customers, friends and client prospects (and, perhaps, a few more to sell).



, Make a marketing plan. It's a good idea to join a writers' group, or to hire an agent or an experienced writing or publishing marketer to help you with this part. And you can, of course, submit your works to various publishing companies to try to find one that will publish it and pay you.

Test your soil.,
Make any corrections needed to your soil.,
Take climate into consideration.,
Visit a local farmer's market.,
Plant your crops.",How to Farm Organically1," Your soil may need to be adjusted if it is not healthy enough to support crops. You should not simply place plants in the soil and hope for the best. Always get your soil tested before starting your own organic farm. Chemicals from other places may have seeped into your soil, and it may not have the right balance of nutrients to support plant life.A home testing kit will only give you a list of numbers related to your soil. Instead, you should send your soil to a local agricultural extension office. The office will both test your soil and send you back a breakdown of the state of your soil, and what the numbers on your sheet mean in terms of planting crops.
The agricultural extension office will also offer suggestions on how to treat your soil. When sending in your soil, make sure to specify that you're going organic. This way, the suggestions you get will omit chemical treatments that go against the organic lifestyle.
For best results, get your soil tested in the fall. While you can use a home testing kit, this is not recommended unless you have extensive experience farming.;
, Once you know the state of your soil, you may have your work cut out for you. If you're lucky, your soil will only need a minimal amount of work before you begin farming. However, you may have to put in a lot of time and money to create quality soil before you start your organic farm.Poor soil drainage may be the most difficult and costly problem to correct. You will have to use a system call subsurface drainage to get the soil where it needs to be, which can cost between $1,250 to $2,500 per year. You will also have to pay for labor, unless you know how to install a subsurface system yourself.
In some cases, you can begin farming and the soil will adjust with time. It can take, however, about 10 years to get the soil where it needs to be. Methods like crop rotation, fertilization with manure, and on-farm composting can all restore nutrients to your soil. While this method takes awhile, it is the cheapest. It will only cost you one to two cents a year.
Read over the paperwork you got from your agricultural extension office closely for suggestions. You can decide whether to do a major overhaul of your soil, or to take mild methods to improve its quality, based on the current state of your soil type.

, You will not be able to grow any type of plant you want on your farm. The climate in your area affects which plants can be grown organically. You will have to choose plants that fare well in your area's climate. Plants that require a different climate may only grow with the use of chemicals and pesticides.If you live in a cooler area, it may be difficult to grow certain plants. Tomatoes and tender fruit, for example, are best grown in a warmer area. Spring grains and crucifer crops may do better in a cold area.
You should also take winter into consideration. The survival of perennial fruit plants, as well as winter cereal and forage crops, depends on the severity of your area's winters.
You should always read up on any crops you choose and know which temperatures are too warm or too cold for them to thrive. Select plants that could reasonably survive given your area's climate.

, Most farmers here will practice organic techniques to grow their crops. Therefore, crops sold here are likely to thrive naturally in your area. This will give you a sense of which crops to plant, and also introduce you to local farmers. You can make connections you can use later when you need assistance and advice.You can look online to find local farmer's markets in your area, or ask at a local food co-op. See which days the markets are operating, and make a point of visiting the farmer's markets on these days.
See what kind of fruit, vegetables, flowers, and other plants are being sold. Ask farmers if they grow organically. Ask them about the type of soil they have on their farms.
Try to network with some local farmers. Ask for phone numbers and email addresses. If you need advice along the way, you can reach out to a local farmer with experience growing organic produce. Later, when you're ready to sell your crops for profit, you will have a working relationship with the local market.

, For organic farms, crops should be grown in wide beds. This extra space between rows helps naturally repel fungal attacks as it increases air circulation. You want to make sure you do not walk on your crops so, if possible, have raised beds on your farm.Group your plants by type. All the tomatoes should be grown in one place, for example, and all the snow peas should be grown in another.
Raised beds are portions of soil raised slightly off the ground. If you are able to raise soil in your area, do so, as this will reduce some traffic on your plants. Plant your seeds with ample space in between, as this will allow crops to thrive. For specific instructions on how much space, you will have to look at a Farmer's Almanac or similar publication for instructions on the precise seeds you're planting.
While wide, raised beds generally work for organic crops, the precise means of planting your crops does depend on the type you chose. Always research your crops prior to planting, and reach out to other organic farmers for advice.

You’ll probably have the most luck with agriculturalists—those who raise livestock of some kind—but if that doesn’t work, ask the produce farmers as well.


There are a few good resources for finding local farmer’s markets, but the USDA’s stands out. It gives locations, contacts, and forms of payment. You can search at https://www.ams.usda.gov/local-food-directories/farmersmarkets.
Another good source, albeit more haphazardly organized, is Local Harvest, a nationwide eat local organization. Their directory is available from the homepage, just enter in your location at the top of the page. Access it at http://www.localharvest.org/.;
, While there is no comprehensive list of dairy farms, there are a couple partial lists available to the public. Since a search of these directories requires the least effort on the part of the searcher, these are the places you should start.The most comprehensive listing of dairy farms online is at http://dairy-farms.regionaldirectory.us/. While this directory is far from complete, it’s a good place to start. From the landing page, simply click on your state and find the farm closest to you. There are also links to cheese makers, stores, and miscellaneous dairy manufacturers.
Another directory you can search is the Eat Wild directory, located at http://www.eatwild.com/products/index.html. There’s a US map in the middle of the page. Just click on your state and it will take you to a listing of agriculturalists in your state.

, With the recent growth of the farm-to-table and eat local movements, the departments of agriculture in many states have taken it upon themselves to collect the names of all types of farmers and agriculturalists who sell directly to the public. Simply conduct an internet search for the department of agriculture in your state and check for any “buy local” initiatives.There’s no guarantee it will work, but you can always call the department of agriculture and ask them specifically if they have any lists of dairy farmers operating in the state.

, There are many regional associations of dairy farmers, but most of them are geared toward farmers rather than the general public. That’s not always the case, so it is worth looking into.One regional association that connects dairy farmers with the public is Must be the Milk, which covers the New England area. You can find their website at http://www.mustbethemilk.com/.

Check your machinery approximately one month before you plan to start haying.,
Cut your hay when the leaves have developed fully and the seed heads have not fully developed.,
Wait until you have at least three days of dry weather to cut your hay.,
Cut your pasture with a sickle mower, sickle haybine or rotary disk mower.,
Start tedding the hay the day within a day of cutting.,
Turn the hay one to three times over the next three days.,
Test the hay frequently to see what its internal moisture content is.,
Rake the hay together in large windrows.,
Consider a small square baler if you have a small operation.,
Use square bales if you keep goats and sheep.,
Pick small square bales if you want to market your hay to small livestock operations.,
Opt for large circular bales if you have a large farming and ranching operation.,
Choose circular bales if you must store the hay outside.,
Go for large circular bales only if you are able to cure the hay correctly.,
Position your baler pick-up tines approximately one inch (2.5 cm) above the ground.,
Operate your baler at a consistent and moderate speed.,
Check your baler after you do one to two bales.,
Leave the bales in the field to be picked up later or load them as you bale.,
Store your hay under a roof if possible.,
Try to elevate your hay on a platform instead of placing it directly on the ground.,
Cover your hay in a bale sleeve or plastic wrap to reduce loss further.,
Cover your haystacks with tarps to decrease matter loss by up to 15 percent.","How to Cut, Bale, and Store Hay"," Delays in harvest due to broken parts or inadequate equipment can result in a late harvest or improperly dried hay.


If there are legumes, such as alfalfa and clover, in your hay field, you may need to harvest slightly earlier, when they are at 10 to 20 percent of full flower.;
, This is the point when the hay will offer the best nutrition for your animals.Cutting the hay too early will result in lower yields.
Cutting the hay too late will result in lower nutritive content, because the plant has begun focusing on seed production., It takes this amount of time to cure dry hay for baling and rain interrupts this process. There is usually a two-week window in which hay is in the perfect stage for cutting., Generally the size of your land determines which of these pieces of equipment you will need, in order of smallest to largest machinery and investment.

, A hay tedder is a tractor attachment or piece of machinery that aerates the hay. It spreads it out so light and heat can dry the hay out.


A tedder and rake is often the same piece of equipment.

, Turning the hay with your tedder or rake will cause some quality loss, because the seeds and grass will fall through the hay onto the pasture. Only turn it according to what is necessary to cure it in your climate.


If it rains, you may need to turn the hay an additional time to ensure it is dry before storing.

, It should be brittle and crisp, but not too easy to shatter in your hand. Baling the hay too early can result in spoilage, mold and even spontaneous combustion in your stacked bales.


For an easy test, twist several stalks of mown grass, place it in a dry box with several tsp. of alt. Shake the container for one minute and if the salt remains dry, it is ready to bale.For a scientific approach, purchase an electronic moisture tester at your local farm supply store or from a catalog. It should be below 22 percent moisture, usually baled at 15 to 18 percent moisture content.
Hay that is too dry will result in extra breakage and lower quality of hay in bales.

, Most balers need a wider windrow than the traditional mower can offer. You will get the densest bale with the highest quality hay by ensuring the windrow is sufficiently large for your baler.

, In this case, you may be able to store the small bales inside a barn to preserve it.

, They can sometimes be pickier than cows or horses and consume the hay slowly.

, You may be able to sell bales to horse owners, pet shops or people with small herds of cattle.

, The baling of hay can be mechanized with a large baler, saving you time. These balers require a significant amount of investment in equipment.


Large circular bales will also reduce the time it takes to feed. They are larger than square bales, so you will need to roll out a smaller number of them to feed your livestock.

, You can cover the hay with tarps, wrap it partially while you bale or arrange it in a stack so that water can pour off the top to avoid spoilage.

, Round bales are denser and more likely to combust if baled when wet.

, You will eliminate wear on your baler and pick up less dirt.

, You will have less pickup loss if the tines float at the same level and the hay lifts and flows into the bale chamber.


You may need to drive more quickly with a round baler to reduce chamber loss.

, You want to check for width, density and chamber/pickup loss. Adjust the settings as needed to improve the quality of the bale., Large round bales require larger machinery to lift and stack them.

, It reduces the matter loss to two to ten percent.

, Elevating the hay can reduce matter loss by up to 15 percent.

, This may be even more important if you live in a wet climate.

, Some of the water may pour off the top and get trapped in the earth below, resulting in matter loss at the bottom."

Start a compost heap.,
Water your plants regularly.,
Weed your garden.,
Keep your garden diverse.,
Use natural means of discouraging pests.",How to Farm Organically2," This will provide natural fertilizer to your plants, lessening your need for chemical varieties. You can have a compost heap outside, or maintain a compost heap in a container somewhere in your kitchen.You can either gather compost in a small pile, or keep it contained in a bin or pen. You will need nitrogen or carbon rich organic waste, which can come from your own kitchen, as well as water, soil, and air.
Add layers of carbon, which is composed of brown material (such as garden trimmings and leaves) with nitrogen (which is waste that is green in color, such as old leafy greens from the kitchen). After adding a few layers, top off your pile with a 4 to 6 inch layer of soil. In about 2 months, your compost should be ready to use as fertilizer.

, How much you water your plants does depend on the type of plant. As with other practices, consult a Farmer's Almanac or similar publication. However, there are a few general guidelines you can follow when it comes to watering your plants.It's best to water in the morning. It tends to be cooler and less windy in the morning, giving the water the best chance to reach your plants.
Water your plants at the roots. Watering at the greenery can cause damage.
Younger plants may need to be watered a few times a week. Once plants are established, they may only need weekly watering. However, make sure to look into your plant's type before making a decision regarding watering.

, As you will not be relying on chemicals to reduce weeds in your garden, it will take a lot of work on your part to keep weeds at bay. You will have to manually weed your garden regularly to make sure your organic crops thrive.To weed, you will have to go into your garden yourself and pull up any weeds at the roots. You may have to use tools, like a spade, and you should also wear gloves. If you can't bend over yourself, think about hiring neighborhood kids to assist you with the gardening.
Mulch, straw, and wood chips can be scattered around the base of plants to reduce the growth of weeds. Straw is the cheapest option, but does not last long. Wood chips are expensive, but may need replacing less frequently than other options. Avoid using lawn clippings on plants that do not require a lot of nutrients, as they're high in nitrogen. Lettuce and squash would benefit from lawn clippings.

, This is a good way to naturally keep away pests. Growing a variety of plants keeps pests away as it limits the amount of one type of plant offered to pests. If you're able to, grow a great variety of plants in your garden. This will also provide you with greater options for customers when you begin to sell your produce and plants.Remember to choose plants that will thrive given your climate and soil type.
If you need inspiration about what plants to use, visit a local farmer's market again. You can ask local farmers for recommendations on crops you should add to your garden.

, Chemical pesticides are generally not used, or at least not used heavily, on organic farms. Explore natural options to deflect pests as you maintain your organic garden.Leave a small source of water in your garden as this will attract natural predators for pests. A garden that contains frogs, birds, toads, and lizards can help ward off pests.
Consider placing nets and row covers over your plants to keep pests out.
Look into naturally occurring bacteria, horticultural oils, insecticidal soaps, and sprays made from garlic and hot peppers.
Check to make sure your plants are getting enough light, nutrients, and moisture. Healthy plants are more able to fight off pests.

Try enrolling in a training program prior to starting your farm.,
Look into the benefits of certification.,
Learn the process of becoming certified.,
Look into alternative labels.",How to Farm Organically3," Colleges and universities may offer courses on organic farming. If you plan to farm for a profit, formal training can be a major asset. You also may find a local organic farm that offers training to farmers who are just getting started. As organic farming has a certain science behind it, training is a good idea if you're serious about starting your own organic farm.You want to make sure you're able to grow a large amount of crops so you can sell them for profit. Training will teach you how to best assure your crops grow, and also tips about harvesting and packaging your crops for sale.
Training is also an excelling networking opportunity. You will meet other aspiring farmers who can help you find a market for your crops. Many of your teachers may already farm professionally, and may have connections for you down the road.

, Certification programs will evaluate your farm and provide you with paperwork certifying your farm meets the standards of organic farming. Certification programs can be beneficial to your farm for a variety of reasons.If you end up selling your products, you can use the USDA organic seal if your farm is certified as organic. This will give legitimacy to your products and make health conscious consumers feel safe buying from you. This seal is usually required if you're selling food labeled as organic.
If you only give your consumers your word, they may be nervous about purchasing your crops. Certification shows you put the work in to make sure your crops are grown according to proper guidelines.

, The process varies based on which program you're working with. You can get certified using a private, foreign, or state entity. Usually, you have to prove your farm meet United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) standards for organic farming practices.There is usually an application process in which you will have to provide a detailed account of how you grow your crops. An agent will review your application and accept it if he feels your farm meets the correct standards. Usually, there is also an on site inspection.
There are often fees associated with getting certified, which can be costly. Fees vary greatly between organizations, so choose an organization within your price range to get certified.

, Many consumers and farmers disagree with the USDA standards for organic. Some farmers also do not have the time and money for certification. A program called Certified Naturally Grown provides easier certification for small scale farms. If it's difficult and costly for you to meet USDA requirements, consider certification via a grassroots program like this.


If you live in a smaller area, you can also try to be simply be upfront with consumers about your practices. A tiny farmer's market may operate more on word of mouth than official certification.

Buy from the farmer directly.,
Check into home delivery.,
Take a tour of the dairy.,
Ask your grocer to stock the farmer’s products.,
Talk to local restaurateurs.,
Raise awareness of the benefits of eating local.",How to Find and Support Local Dairy Farms2," The most direct way of supporting a dairy farmer’s endeavors is to simply purchase their milk regularly. That might seem obvious, but regular customers have a greater impact than sporadic customers.


You can also join a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) co-op. When you join a CSA, you pay a fee for a season, and fresh, locally harvested agricultural products are delivered to you or reserved for you. As long as you can find a CSA that includes a dairy farmer’s produce, it can be a great way to save a little time when you purchase., It won't be available in all areas, but if you can find a milk delivery service in your area, it's another great way to become a regular supporter of your local dairy farmer.Contact the dairy directly to find out about their home delivery. While there are a few services that deliver from multiple dairies, like Farm to Home Milk of Asheville, NC, most delivery services are run by the dairies themselves.

, Many dairy farmers actually open their facilities for tours to the public, especially school classes. Taking a tour helps give the farmer a secondary income stream while exposing visitors to a world they often don’t get to see.The best way to find out if a particular farm offers tours is to ask them directly, although some of the larger dairy farms list information about tours on their websites.

, Once you’ve established a relationship with the farmer, a great way to support him or her is by sending more and more business their way. Since the vast majority of milk is sold in grocery stores, convincing a grocer to stock the farmer’s products is a great way to help boost the farmer’s income.


While you might not have any luck getting the Walmart down the street to stock a local farmer’s milk, local and regional grocers are often surprisingly willing to stock products individual customers ask to be stocked.

, If you've got a good relationship with some local restaurant owners, talk to them about the superior quality of local dairy products. Good ingredients mean good food, which is something that any restaurant owner should appreciate.

, Purchasing goods locally carries with it a number of benefits. Money spent at local merchants (including farmers) stays within your local community, the products sold have a smaller carbon footprint, which is better for the environment, and local produce and animal products are inherently more fresh than an alternative shipped in from afar.Most of the larger metropolitan areas actually have established eat local organizations. You can get educational materials and infographics from them, as well as learning about even more local products for sale in your area.

Talk to your realtor.,
Make an offer.,
Enter into a contract.,
Hire an inspector.,
Close escrow.",How to Buy a Farm1," Your budget should reflect the cost of the land, realtor fees, zoning or construction permits, mortgage payments, and the operational costs for your farm. The cost of land will depend on the land’s location and whether it has any structures on the property. A plot of land with a newly built barn will be more expensive than a same size plot with no barn or an older barn.In the United States, farmland is an average of $3,020 per acre. However, this figure varies depending on your region. For example, farmland in the Mountain region is $1,100 acre and in the Corn Belt it is $8,000.Talk to an experienced farmer in the area to learn more about the costs associated with operating a farm. Go to your country’s Department of Agriculture website and see what resources they have available to help you budget.;
, Most people will need to secure a loan to help them finance a farm. There are a number of leasing companies that offer agricultural financing to help you buy a farm and operate it. You should talk to your bank to see if they offer financing for land purchases and for their recommendations for agricultural financing.


In the United States, the USDA Farm Service Agency can help you get a loan, especially if you have low credit or a low income.Pre qualifying for financing can help to speed up the process of actually buying the property.

, Now, if you have retained a realtor, you will need to contact your representative. The guidelines for submitting offers will differ based on your area, but in general you will submit an offer to your realtor who will then forward that offer to the seller’s representative. The seller will either accept, reject, or make a counteroffer.

, Along with your real estate agent or lawyer, you can now submit a bid. If your bid is accepted by the seller, you can go through the escrow process and become the official owner of your new farm.


You should try to gather information about recent farm sales in the area to make sure you are getting a fair price for the property., Make sure that your offer is contingent upon you being able to secure a final mortgage (if necessary), that the property and any structures pass inspection, and a guarantee that you can do a final walk through inspection 24 hours before closing.


You may need to make a good-faith deposit with the seller. This is usually 1% to 10% of the purchase price and goes into an escrow account. If the deal falls through, you get this money back.You will need to make a down payment on the property. The size of the down payment will vary, but it is typically 10-20% of the property’s appraised value.

, Since your offer is contingent upon the property passing inspection, you will need to hire an inspector who will make sure any structures on the property are up to code.


If the property does not pass inspection, you will need to decide whether you want to spend more money to renovate the structures so they meet code regulations, or to walk away from this property.
If the property passes inspection and you are satisfied with the results, you can move to close the escrow process.

, The escrow closing process varies by state and country, but generally you will need to complete paperwork that both you and the seller will sign.Once the paperwork is signed, the escrow officer will draw up a new deed to the property, you will receive the title to the property, and you will pay your down payment.

Take all precautions.,
Know the local regulations with respect to burning off.,
Clear all the land of flammable material.,
Prepare clean fuel breaks around the area to be burned.,
Check the weather forecast.,
Have sufficient people to participate in and manage the burning off.,
Ensure that you have the right equipment to douse the fire.,
Follow a plan, not the fire's will.,
Know how to use fire rather than have it use you.,
Stop lighting the fire if the wind changes its speed.,
Keep checking the burned out area for days after.",How to Do Burning Off Safely (Rural and Semi Rural Properties)," There is no such thing as bad luck when a burning off gets out of control; it's just bad management.;
, Some will permit it only during the non-fire season, some will permit it during fire season with strict rules, and others may not permit it at all.


Obtain a burning-off permit from your local municipality or council if required.
Read all the suggestions, instructions, and requirements accompanying the permit.

, This includes the area outside of the intended area to be burned.

, This should be at least four metres wide.

, Use an official source, or better yet, call the local meteorological station to confirm local conditions.


Avoid starting burning off too early in the day; the day's conditions won't be certain at that early hour.

, The permit you obtain will specify the amount of people required for the are you're seeking to burn off. If you don't need to get a permit, make sure there are still enough people to control the fire.

, There should be a large amount of water available at all times, near the burning off. Use portable tanks with portable pumps and ensure that these follow the burning off, wherever you're headed.


Use tanks of the back of utility trucks (utes), four/all wheel drives, or fire fighting/farm trucks.
Use knapsack/backpack water holders as well.

, Before burning off, have a strict plan in place that accounts for every person's movement, the areas to be burned, and the responses should things get out of hand.


Strip burning enables you to control the direction and rate of burning to match the wind, fuel and strength of the team.

, There are some basics to bear in mind when burning off:


Light the fire on the leeward side (down wind) first. Burning into the wind slows the fire's ability and gives you greater control.
Burn downhill if possible. Uphill burning is dangerous, whatever the weather conditions.
Maintain a completely blackened fire edge of about 20 meters (65.6 ft) into the burned area.

, Increase in wind speed is cause for fast reaction. Put out the fire as quickly as possible.

, Smoldering coals and roots, stumps and other underground burning can reignite without warning for many days after burning off.

Make certain you are comfortable working alone and as part of a team.,
Find out if your state requires licensure for agricultural or crop scientists.,
Improve career opportunities by pursuing certification through the American Society of Agronomy and Soil Science Society of America.,
Stay current in technological advances in agriculture science.",How to Become an Agricultural Scientist," Each state in the U.S. has one.


Programs differ between colleges and universities and not all provide the same specialties.;
,


Food scientists use science to improve food processing, preservation and storage. Food chemistry and food engineering are typical of the courses taken by food scientists.
Plant scientists are also known as crop scientists or agronomists. They increase the productivity and nutritive value of crops to meet human needs. This requires an understanding of plant physiology and pathology.
Soil scientists are similar to crop scientists and study many similar things, although there is a greater emphasis on chemistry. Soil scientists focus on the study of soils related to the growth of crops and plants.
Animal scientists focus on the agricultural uses of animals as food items, such as meat, milk, eggs and poultry.

,


Agricultural scientists may also earn a bachelor's degree in biology or chemistry.
Not specializing in one of the four agricultural science areas is acceptable with an undergraduate degree and may provide more career options.
Plan on taking a good foundation in the sciences--biology, chemistry, and physics--in addition to agricultural science courses.
Mathematics, communications, and economics are also important in an undergraduate degree.

, A large number of agricultural scientists are involved in research and development, which most often requires a graduate degree and specialization. A crop scientist involved in research and development will most likely have a graduate degree.


Research jobs at universities tend to require graduate degrees.
Teaching at the university level requires a Ph.D. in agricultural science.

,


Basic research investigates agricultural processes.
Applied research uses research in agricultural processes to discover ways to improve products.

,


Oral and written communication skills are important for the agricultural or food scientist.

, If so, find out what the requirements are.


Licensing generally involves a bachelor's degree in specific disciplines, working under a licensed agricultural scientist for a specified length of time and passing an exam.
Licensing may also require a certain number of continuing education hours each year.

, Certification, like licensure, often requires a combination of education and experience before passing an exam. Available certifications are:


Certified Crop Adviser (CCA).
Certified Professional Agronomist (CPAG).
Certified Professional Soil Scientist/Classifier (CPSS/CPSC).

, Many new jobs depend on new technology, such as:


Biotechnology: manipulating genetic material to improve plants, crops and biofuel production.
Nanotechnology: used for testing agricultural products for contamination.

Determine how much land you need.,
Decide on an area.,
Find available properties.,
Contact a realtor.,
Assess the land’s potential.,
Check local zoning laws.,
Determine whether you have access to utilities.,
Have the land surveyed.,
Ask questions.",How to Buy a Farm2," The amount of land you need will help you to eliminate potential farms and to focus your search. If you are planning to make a career out of farming, you will need more land than someone who wants to have a lifestyle farm. Once you know how much land you need you can limit your search to properties that match your needs.Lifestyle farmers, where you are growing crops for your own pleasure, can have as large or small farm as they want.
Sustenance farmers will need 1 to 5 acres of land.
Career farmers will need anywhere from 500 acres if you want to sell hay to 5 acres to grow vegetables.

, Now that you have a good idea of the type and size of farm you want to purchase, you can begin to look at available properties. You may already live in a rural area that is close to farmland, or you may be in an urban area where you will need to relocate in order to farm.


For lifestyle or subsistence farmers, you or another family member may need to be within a certain area so you can commute to another job.
You will need to be close to a market where you can sell your products if you intend to be a career farmer.
Narrow your search to a certain area, but realize that you may have to expand your search if there are not available farm properties in that area.

, You should keep a list of the addresses and list prices of properties that you are interested in. It is important to keep this information organized so you can narrow your search when you find properties that you like.


Drive around the area and look for “For Sale” or “For Sale by Owner” signs.
Search online for local listings for farms.
Speak with farmers that you know to see if they know of anyone who is looking to sell their property.
Look at land auctions and foreclosures.

, Look for a realtor that specializes in country or rural properties. A realtor can help to streamline the process and take some of pressure off of you. A realtor will typically receive 5-7% of the final purchase price as a fee so they have a vested interest in getting you a good deal.


A realtor can also help you identify properties that meet your needs.
You will also need to contact the realtors that represent the properties in an area that you are interested in whenever you are ready to make a bid.
You can also act as your own real estate agent, though this will require more time and research on your part.

, A thriving farm begins with good soil. If the soil on the property is poor, it will be very difficult to grow anything or to feed livestock. You will need to assess the soil quality, the topography of the land, and the fertility of the land.


Fertility goes hand in hand with the soil quality. If the land has been used as a farm for generations, the soil may not have as many nutrients as an un-farmed plot of land would. However, if the land has been diversified, meaning that the previous owners have been rotating crops, the soil may still be good for farming.
Take a small sample of the soil and smell and feel it. Heavy clay is difficult to grow in, sandy soil offers good drainage but might not hold water for crops, and dark and loamy soil is ideal for any type of farming.The topography of the land is also important. It is difficult to grow crops on sloping and steep hills but would be alright for grazing animals. If the land is filled with trees, it will be expensive to clear cut the area.

, Before you draw up an offer, you need to check the local zoning laws to see whether you can farm or build a farmhouse on the land. You will need to contact the state or county to get a copy of the zoning codes to see whether you can build and develop a farm on the land.The realtor should be familiar with zoning laws, but you should do this due diligence and not make assumptions about your realtor’s knowledge., This is especially true if the plot of land that you are considering buying has not already been used as a farm. Farm work requires access to water, sewer, electricity, and heat. You will probably want access to Internet or cable, especially if you are considering living on the property.


You will need to contact local utility companies to see if this plot is within their service area. If it is not, it can be very costly to have utilities installed., A piece of land might look perfect, but there can be significant issues lying below the surface. It is important to hire a surveyor to come and evaluate the land. You will need to have the following assessed: soil type, water tables, drainage, and slope or gradient of the land. These factors can determine whether the land is suitable for farming.

, Before you make an offer on a piece of land, you need to make sure you have all the information that you need. You should consult with your lawyer or real estate agent about any contingencies attached to your bid, whether you will get the mineral or water rights to the land, and if there are any protective covenants on the land.If you intend to build a home, barn, or other structure on the property you will need to speak with the town’s Building and Planning Departments to see if there are limitations on construction. For instance, some areas put a restriction on the size or number of rooms allowed in a building.

Set your goals for the farm.,
Gain farming experience.,
Consider leasing a farm.,
Be realistic.",How to Buy a Farm3," Whether you want to become a subsistence farmer, have animals, or grow crops for commercial sale, your goals will help to shape what type of property you buy. The farmland that you buy should fit your goals and your budget.Define whether you are looking for a farm that is for your lifestyle, subsistence, or career.

, If you have never worked on a farm before, or are unfamiliar with farming operations, you will need to gain experience prior to starting your own farm.Find a farming apprenticeship or volunteer on a farm near you. Hands on experience is the best way to determine whether you’re ready to start your own farm. Ask local farmers if they would be willing to offer you an apprenticeship.Talk to local farmers who either grow the same crops or raise the same animals that you are interested in. Ask them about their costs, how they budget, and how long it took for them to make a profit.

, You may be able to lease a farm if you prefer leasing over buying it outright. A lease allows you more flexibility and can save you money if you did want to move properties in the future.Leasing can be a good option if you do not have farming experience since it allows you to start farming and learning without fully committing to purchasing an entire farm.It may be easier to secure financing for a farm lease rather than for a land purchase.

, Farming is hard work and is not right for everyone. It can be very expensive to establish and maintain a farm, let alone to turn a profit.Farming isn’t just a career change; it’s a lifestyle change. Starting a farm can be a rewarding and fulfilling process, but it will also be challenging.
Your budget and location may limit the size of your farm. You may not be able to grow or raise exactly what you want due to climate, soil type and fertility, or cost. You will most likely need to make adjustments to your original plans along the way.

Reapply annually.",How to Become an Organic Farmer," Grow crops without the use of synthetic substances or genetic modification. Raise dairy herds and livestock with 100% organic feed, supplements, and medications. Expect a lengthy transition period from non-organic to organic farming before being able to market yourself as “certified organic.”Non-GMO crops must be grown on land that hasn’t been treated with synthetic chemicals, fertilizers, or pesticides for three full years before they can be considered organic.
Dairy herds can be switched from non-organic to organic after a year-long transition that is supervised by a certifying agent.
Poultry must be raised exclusively by organic means from their second day after hatching onward.
The mothers of livestock must be treated only by organic means no later than the last trimester of pregnancy for the newborn to be considered organic.;
, Learn the ins and outs of organic farming by applying for a farmhand position on a certified organic farm. Condition yourself to the long hours and heavy labor demanded by this profession. Grow acquainted with the techniques used in organic farming. Familiarize yourself with the farm’s calendar year in terms of planting, harvesting, and how best to utilize the time in between.In lieu of working on an actual farm, working for a nursery or landscaping company can also teach you similar core concepts.
Apprenticeships and internships can be found through the National Center for Appropriate Technology’s ATTRA program., Apply to colleges or universities that offer associate or bachelor’s degrees in organic agriculture. Focus on such subjects as crop production, economics, farm marketing, food science, and soil management. Also join extracurricular clubs devoted to organic farming in order to gain as much firsthand experience as possible outside of the classroom.California State University-Chico, Berea College, Dickinson College and University of Massachusetts-Amherst are among the top schools with certified organic farms.Earning a degree is not a requirement for becoming an organic farmer. However, the education gained in the process will better prepare you for the challenges ahead.

, If you are unable to attend a two- or four-year program for a full degree, attend auxiliary programs designed specifically for farmers. Learn how to identify and utilize resources. Study how to build business plans, manage finances, and handle long-term investments.Such courses are available in person, online, or in a combination of the two.
When researching online schools, make sure that the course content pertains to your climate and region.

, To certify your farm as organic, you will have to submit an Organic System Plan (OSP) to a certifying agent. Before you do, visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website to download the application itself.Go to ams.usda.gov and search for the “OSP Template.”Review the document to know the precise information required by certifying agents. Improve your chances of being approved in a timely fashion by including all information from the start.


ATTRA’s “Organic Systems Plans: Market Farming and Greenhouses” is a valued companion-piece that explains the application in detail.
Repeat this step for each additional country that you intend to sell to. The United Nations have recommended guidelines for organic certification, but practices may still vary from country to country., One important element of the application process is providing a list of substances used to treat soil and plants over the last three years.If you have recently purchased your land or are in the process of doing so, be sure to ask the previous owners for this information. Factor this into your OSP’s timeline.


If the previous owners used substances that are not approved for organic certification, expect a longer wait before you can become certified yourself.

, Your specific plan will vary from others depending on your crop, livestock, the size of your farm, and other factors. In general, it should include all the practices you intend to use to farm your land.Detail the following areas:The exact procedures to be enacted, and how often.
The substances that you will use at all levels of production.
How you plan to supervise production to confirm that your OSP is enacted.
Any methods used to prevent nearby non-organic farming from affecting your organic production.

, Visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website (ams.usda.gov) to find agents that have been accredited by the USDA’s National Organic Program. Search by name, state, or country. Decide on an agent based on each one’s fees and proximity.Have them look over your OSP so you can make any necessary changes before you set it in motion., Alert your certifying agent if you have to alter your OSP to address unexpected issues after you put it into practice. Always use written forms of communication, such as letters and emails, to create a physical record. Save all correspondence, especially confirmation of your changes, in case proof of such is required later on.Keep in mind that your OSP is legally binding. Hang on to all relevant paperwork to protect yourself.

, Assess your OSP’s success. Based on your OSP’s timeline, arrange with your agent for them or a third party to visit your farm. Have them investigate your operation thoroughly. Expect them to take samples of your soil and products, including tissue samples of livestock.For crops, expect inspectors to focus on: the condition of your fields and soil; the health of your crops; weed- and pest-control; irrigation; storage facilities; equipment.
For livestock, inspectors will look for: the quality, rations, and purchase history of animal feed; the animals' quality of life, including living situations, medical care, and overall health.

, Receive your certification if you pass your inspection.If not, make whatever changes are recommended by the agent. Arrange for a second inspection according to the presented timeline.

, Maintain your organic certification by applying for recertification on a yearly basis. Arrange with your agent for follow-up inspections. Prove that your farm is still operating according to regulations."

Get some practice first to learn what farm life is like and see if you are physically able to do it.,
Start farming on a small scale in your current location.,
Research the farming industry thoroughly.,
Look for grants and financing for prospective farmers.,
Visit farms in your area and talk to experienced farmers.,
Take some classes.,
Decide what type of farm you want to run.,
Think about where to locate your farm.,
Figure out your budget.,
Be realistic and accept the changes that life on a farm will bring.",How to Become a Farmer at Fifty," Look for a job on a local farm or volunteer at a farm or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) site. Another idea is to take a ""farm vacation"" where you can stay at a farm and participate in the daily operations.;
, This will help you ease into the farming life and give you some experience. Market your goods and make a little extra income or give what you grow to friends and family.

, Find out what crops are in demand and learn about government regulations.

, The government has programs to subsidize or help with farm financing.

, Most farms are family businesses that passed from one generation to the next, so current farmers have a wealth of information about local markets and conditions and can shed some light on how to become a farmer at 50.

, Look for courses in horticulture and agriculture. Business classes in accounting and management are also helpful.

, This should include a combination of factors including what crops or livestock you plan to sell, how much of investment is required for land and machinery, and any previous farming experience you may have.

, A successful working farm takes 50 acres or more of land. Unless you already have land, buying an existing farm is one option. You could also buy land and build up the farm and outbuildings gradually. Either option takes a large investment.

, Besides land, you'll also need to pay for livestock, equipment, outbuildings and hired help.

, Most likely, you'll have to move to a rural area, away from current friends, family and activities. You will probably have to give up some modern conveniences, and it won't be as easy to drive to the local convenience store or fast food restaurant. Be sure you are comfortable with these changes before committing time and money to farming.

"
"
Start off by drafting up a plan.,
Make an extensive estimate of the cost of your farm.,
Look at your financial situation before you get too far down the path you have chosen.,
Plan on either working off the farm at a day job, or saving enough money to fund your cost of living until you begin to turn a profit on your farm.,
Familiarize yourself with the land and the surrounding climate.,
Study the topographical features of the land.,
Dig a small pit and get some soil samples around the farm.,
Vegetation.,
Talk to other farmers as well as the owner that is selling the land (if you are buying a farm rather than inheriting one from your parents or grandparents) for information on the kinds of crops and plants that they grew there, when it was seeded, when they were sprayed and when the crop was harvested.,
Go to a local agricultural (or county extension) office located in your county, state or province to look at the different reports on the different climatic conditions that have happened over the years for the area you will be farming in.,
Do some research on climate history of your area.,
If the farm you are buying doesn't have the proper buildings on it already, planning and building may be required to make the farm you are taking over into one you have in mind.,
Know what crops are best for you to sow, and what fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides to use on that crop.,
Be responsible in choosing the animals you purchase.,
Be prepared for the unexpected.",How to Start a Farm," Have a business plan, an operational plan and a strategic down on paper before you buy or start a farm.


Note where you are, where you want to be, and how you want to get there. Additional personal and business goals and objectives, and financial and market goals and objectives are also important to note. 
Reviewed and write down your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, (also called a SWOT analysis) of both yourself and the operation you want to get started in, as well as the farm you have in mind to purchase or start up from scratch.;
, You will need to figure the cost of the land, equipment, and necessary improvements that must be faced before beginning your farm operation. There isn't a set price for land, or a fixed amount of land required to begin a farming operation, so you will need to look carefully at those prices in the location you have chosen. Equipment can be very expensive, but you may have an option to buy it with dealer financing or by purchasing used equipment.

, Farming requires an investment each year to maintain operations. Some costs are up front, like buying or renting the land, buying equipment, and funds to sustain you until you have sold crops/livestock. Other costs that are going to be faced each year are:


Fuel and maintenance for equipment. You will most likely be buying diesel fuel for combines and tractors, hydraulic oil, engine oil, and other items to keep your machinery running.
Seeds and fertilizer are necessary to produce a crop, and you will need to invest in these every year you plant and harvest your crops.
Chemicals to protect your crops from insects, diseases, and invasive plants/weeds.
Utility bills. You will almost certainly use some electrical power for water pumps and for maintenance equipment like an air compressor and other power tools beyond what you will need for your living quarters and day to day life.

, Farming doesn't pay you a weekly salary, your payday comes when you sell the product of your farm, and often that isn't until the end of your growing season.

,  The land is the foundation of how, where, and what you farm. The climate also dictates what you can raise and how it will affect you and your operation.

, Hilly terrain is more suited for livestock raising than crop production, whereas gently rolling or almost flat is suited for crops.

, Soil samples that can be sent in to a lab can tell you the type of soil (silt, sand, or clay, or a combination of any two or three), and quality (organic matter, organic carbon content, nutrient details , salinity and pH levels). A soil pit or even data done on previous surveying of soil types can tell you depth of soil horizons and especially for crop growers, the depth of the first horizon which where most of the root biomass will be as well as the nutrient content.


Soil is incredibly important for crop production, because if results come back that it's not up to par, or if some research on data that had been done previously shows that it's not good for crop production, then you may have to look elsewhere for better land or find something that will do better on it.

, For crop production surrounding vegetation that is growing wild in other pastures or along roadsides is unimportant because you aren't going to be wanting to raise livestock, just produce crop for sale of your own choice. However, surrounding farms will tell you what they can grow in their fields, and thus will show you what you can consider growing as well. Some areas aren't as suited for growing corn as others, and orchards or a tree farm may be a better option to consider if you'd rather have a lot of trees on your land.


For livestock raising, though, surrounding vegetation is important especially if you want to have pastures with a multitude of plant species and not just a few that you want seeded in. So have a look at the native or volunteer plants that are growing wild in and around the farm, from the outskirts of the fields to ditches and even what looks like could be growing in the neighbour's field. Some of those plants can be weeds that will need to be watched.
Any plant that grows in a crop field (or even pasture) can be considered a ""weed."" You will need to be prepared to know what weeds grow in the area you want to start a farm so you are better prepared to know how to deal with them.

,


If the land was only used for pasture and hay, have a forage analysis done along with the soil test, especially with collecting hay for livestock.

, 


Note that a lot of this information may be on line, but if you cannot find what you're looking for you may need to see someone to get more information on the environmental conditions of your area

Only do this if you are not familiar with the location and before or after you have talked to the seller and some of the neighbours.



, Climate is one of the most important factors that affect a farming operation, because it influences when things need to be done before a certain change in a season will hit and disable a possibility or hope of doing what you wanted to on your farm.


Average precipitation levels and times when precipitation is most likely to come throughout the year is of most importance. Other climatic data you may want to look into is storm frequency and types, flooding and drought history and frequencies, growing and frost-free days, seasonal changes (rainy versus dry season or spring, summer, autumn and winter season), length of days, etc.
Even if you're starting a farm in an area you are already familiar with, sometimes re-familiarizing yourself with this information can be helpful for the kind of farming operation you want to get started in.

, But sometimes many buildings may just need to be repaired if they are in need of it, and others may have to be taken down because they are decrepit and too old to be of any use to you.


If you are doing crop, orchard, fruit or vegetable farming, make sure you have all the necessary machinery that is built to seed, care for and harvest the crops you are willing to sow and grow. Things like tractors are very important. 
On the other hand, if you are buying a farm that raises livestock and you continue to raise livestock on there, buildings may also need to be looked at, as well as fences, handling facilities, water sources and facilities, and feeding facilities.  Chances are you may want to change the layout of the current fencing areas, put in new fences, renovate pastures and/or create more wildlife habitat that has been degraded over the years due to mismanagement.

,  Be prepared to be flexible and to learn as you go.  As for livestock, now is a good time to purchase your animals.  Make sure you start with good animals and not someone's crappy culls. Carry through with what you've been planning for and built up to now, as this will most likely what will make your business click. 

, If you are getting a breeding herd, only one intact male per several females is optimum. For instance, a bull is able to easily service up to 50 cows or heifers at one time. A boar can be used to service 20 sows, and one ram or buck for 20 to 25 females. If you are starting with only a handful of cows, do not purchase one bull per cow! This also goes for all other breeding livestock. It is best to choose to artificially inseminate the only 2 or 3 cows you buy or to lease a bull to service them. This also goes for pigs, sheep, goats, chickens, ducks, geese, horses, and other animals.

, Always review your business plan and make changes as needed as new ideas, new thoughts and new issues come up.

Decide what type baler you want.,
Hook the baler up to your tractor.,
Install the string or net wrap in the appropriate compartment.,
Perform maintenance checks before beginning to bale.,
Drop the pick-up wheels from each side of the baler and make sure that they are barely touching the ground.,
Turn your PTO on with the throttle all the way back (at idle or turtle).,
Drive forward, keeping your speed down between 20 or 40 km/h (12 or 25 mph).,
Bale away.,
Let the baler get full enough.,
Put the strings on.,
Empty bale from the baler.,
Test the bale for moisture.,
Rev up the engine, turn the belts back on again and continue baling your second bale.",How to Bale Hay in the Round," Such companies that make balers include Vermeer, John Deere, Case IH, New Holland, etc. The type of baler you need depends on how large and heavy you want your bales to be, and also whether you want a soft-core bale or hard-core bale. Hard-core balers take less fuel and power to run than a soft-core baler. Also make sure that the baler is such that your tractor can handle the amount of horsepower (HP) it takes to run it.


Remember to purchase the computer to go inside the cab also to tell you when your bales are full, and when to tie.;
, You will need to connect the hitch first, then the PTO and then the hydraulic hoses. Also connect the electrical components from the cab of your tractor to the baler.


Make sure your tractor is turned off or out of gear (in Neutral) before hooking up the PTO shaft. Also make sure the hydraulic hoses are hooked up to the right compartment so that you have control of to the right shift sticks on the tractor.

, Make sure you thread the start of the string or net wrap to the appropriate area so the machine can take it and wrap the bale with it without trouble.

, Make sure that your belts are tight and chains and grease fittings greased. Only 4 pumps of grease for each fitting is necessary. Your baler will last longer if you check it and grease it before baling.

, However, if the grass is somewhat damp you want the wheels as low as they can go.

, Stop right before you get to the initial swath. Slowly turn up the throttle. The more you rev up the throttle to the engine, the faster the reel will spin and the more hay you can pick up as you drive along.

, You want to straddle the swath between the tires, so that you are pretty much on top of the swath with your tires on either side of the swath. Remember to go at a slower speed for thicker or wetter swaths, but also don't go so fast that you are getting too reckless with your machinery. Take your time, but keeping so that you are going at the right speed in time with the speed you have the pick-up reel at.

, Keep your on eye on the pick-up reel and belts from your viewpoint of the tractor for any signs of any mishaps. You will get plugged up: it's not a matter of if, but when, no matter how slow you're going or how dry the hay is. Also keep an eye on the computer to see how full the baler is getting, and what's in front if you to keep the tractor in a straight line.


If you get plugged up, STOP, and back up a little to allow room for the reel to work without interfering with the swath There's a switch on your the computer that allows the pick-up reel to reverse to help spit out the hay that has plugged up the baler. Use this, reversing a half to full revolution at a time, then going back forward again, until the plug is cleared.

If this doesn't work, use a thick, stout and long stick (around 5 feet in length and 2 inches in diameter) to push the gummed-up fodder into the baler. You will need to keep the baler in-gear to allow the reel to put the fodder into the baler, but not at so high a gear that it is very dangerous for you.

If neither the reversing reel or stick method works, shut down the baler, and tractor and attempt to manually pull out the hay yourself. If you so choose, you can either unplug the baler right in the hayfield, or drive up to the corrals where your livestock will be able to visit so you can take the fodder you pulled out of the baler and throw it over the fence to them. Use your judgement to determine whether the amount you pulled out is enough to help unplug the baler. If it has, great! If not, best to keep working at it.

Once you've unplugged the reel, get in the tractor, back up just a little bit, rev up the engine, and SLOWLY move the pick-up to the pile of hay, letting the reel pick up a little at a time. Never ever rush getting through a large pile of hay, as you will get more plug-ups doing that than being overly cautious.






Once you're through, then you can continue baling.

, Once the signal on your on-board computer starts going that your baler is getting full, you can choose to keep going for another few minutes or so until you can clearly see the baler is getting quite full. Ideally you should have your bales as tightly baled up as possible to prevent less moisture from getting in the bales when stored outside.

, When you are sure that the baler is full enough, stop the tractor, but keep the baler running via PTO and hydraulic hoses. Turn the switch on that's found on the computer to put the strings on the bale. Allow for four to five revolutions to completely tie the bale. Two to three revolutions is enough for putting net on. Switch off the switch that lets the string run, and this should cut the string from the string box on the baler.

, Turn the switch that opens the back of the baler. Then turn on the belts and drive forward a few feet, letting the bale out. Turn off the belts, drive forward a few more feet so you have enough room to shut the back door of the baler. Turn the switch on the computer to shut the baler.

, Putting turning off the baler and putting the tractor out of gear (neutral), get out with the soil tester and get a reading from the middle of the bale to see what the moisture content is. Ideal moisture content should be around 20%.


You will need to test moisture content every three to four bales, or when you get baling swaths that are a bit thicker than the others.

, Repeat Steps 6 to 11, performing Step 12 every few bales, or as often as necessary.

You have to be part entrepreneur, part small business owner, part scientist, and part manual laborer. Even if you do everything right, farming is unpredictable: natural disasters such as floods or drought can wipe out crops, pests can decimate your harvest, and the price of crops can vary dramatically.


Farming often requires a far greater time investment even than a full-time 9-to-5 job. Unless you want only a very tiny farm or large garden as a hobby, farming will have to become your life.;
, Ask yourself some questions about what you want your life to look like. What goals do you have for yourself? Are they concrete, such as a certain annual income or time with your family? Are they more abstract, such as a certain quality of life or a feeling of satisfaction?


Consider what you are willing to sacrifice and what you are not. What do you need to achieve your goals, and what are you willing to do to achieve them?

, Farming can offer you a life of independence and connection to your land, but it is also a huge responsibility. Knowing how you’re likely to respond to situations that may arise will help you decide if farming is right for you.


Are you comfortable being solely responsible for a large operation? The success of many small farms hinges entirely on their owner(s). As a farmer, you’re in charge of all the day-to-day operations as well as long-term planning. You will have to make many decisions where the fate of your farm may hang in the balance.
Are you able to accept uncertainty and variability in your life? A farmer’s life is full of uncertainty, and the possibility for failure is high. Even good years may see you operating at a break-even level and no more. Due to the hardships of farming, the number of farmers in America is expected to decline by 19% between 2012 and 2022.Are you a creative problem-solver? Farming throws many problems your way, and having the imagination to think of creative solutions will be vital to your farm.
Are you a patient person? Farming has a very steep learning curve and you will undoubtedly make many mistakes when you first start out. It can also take a long time, even years, until your farm is fully successful, so you will need to be able to work toward long-term prospects.

, Be honest with yourself here. What are you good at? What are your weak spots?


Are you good at accounting and bookkeeping? In order to keep your farm operating, you must be able to calculate risk margins, record sales and purchases, and track profits.
Are you capable of heavy labor? Farming can be backbreaking manual labor, even with modern equipment like tractors. You will need to be fairly fit and in good health to be a farmer.
Do you have enough money to invest in farming? Starting a small farm requires a lot of initial capital. You have to buy materials and equipment. You also have to buy land, or face unfavorable land lease relationships where you have little control over your farm.Are you a fast learner? You will need to absorb a lot of information and keep up to date on many trends and techniques if you’re to succeed in farming.
Do you have significant health problems? Health insurance can be quite expensive if you’re self-employed. If you have chronic health problems or require many expensive prescription medicines, farming may not offer you enough reliability in your health care.

, Small-scale farming is a notoriously poor-earning business, and 91% of all small farms require outside income (either through other employment or through government and foundation grants) to stay afloat. If things like saving for retirement or sending your children to college are goals of yours, farming may not be for you.The median farm income was -$1,453 in 2012. That means the average small farm in America lost almost $1500 a year.

, In order to make the decision about whether to become a farmer, you’ll want to collect as much information as possible about what the process requires,


Farm Aid is a nonprofit organization that provides information and resources about farming. They have a resource center devoted entirely to beginning farms.
The National Young Farmers Coalition provides information and resources geared specifically for beginning farmers.The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program, a branch of the USDA, has a project called Start2Farm that offers a vast amount of information on beginning a farm, finding funding, and locating services., If you live near a college or university, you probably have access to their cooperative extension office. These offices are there to serve the needs of local small business owners and agricultural producers. They provide many resources on farming and agriculture, and often offer classes and seminars too., Nothing beats talking with real-life farmers about their lives and experiences. If you have a local farmers’ market, get to know the farmers who sell their goods there. Ask them about what they love about their work, and what they hate.


If you have farms in your area, call or email them to see if you can meet with them. While farmers are usually very busy, they are also usually very passionate about their work, and they will probably be happy to talk to you.
You can also visit online message boards to ask questions and learn from farmers. It’s definitely preferable to talk with people in person, though.

, If you are serious about becoming a farmer, volunteering on a farm is a good way to learn if the lifestyle is really for you before you have to make a major financial investment. Organizations such as World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms link organic farms with volunteer opportunities (for a small fee), and many local farms also offer volunteer programs., Many of these programs will offer you room and board as well as a small stipend in exchange for your labor.Experts recommend that you spend three to four years “apprenticing” if you’re really serious about starting your own farm., It can be overwhelming to think about what types of crops your farm will grow, but there are ways to narrow this decision down. The majority of agricultural crops grown in the United States are grain crops, such as corn, soybeans, and wheat.If you live in an area with a demand for it, organic vegetable production can also be a good choice, as it is one of the fastest-growing sectors in American farming.There are many resources that can help you decide what crops are best for you and your area.


The New England Small Farm Institute provides a wealth of links to help you conduct research on crop planning.The National Agriculture Library is also a good place to start for information on regional crops.Contacting your state or province department of agriculture will help you determine specific information for crop planning in your area.

, Most beginning farmers cannot afford to buy their own land, at least at first. In addition, 80% of America's farmland is controlled by owners who are not farmers. Most expert sources recommend that beginning farmers ""start soft,"" by managing someone else's farm, leasing farmland (from private owners or from land trusts), or take over an existing (and hopefully, profitable) farm from someone else.Word of mouth is still one of the most powerful sources for information about finding farmland. Cultivate your network of farming connections and do your research.
Sources such as the ""Farm Link Program Directory"", ""Farm On"", and the ""Farmland Information Center""may help you find farms to take over or farms that need managers.

, You may need to relocate in order to find affordable, plentiful farmland. You may fantasize about a farm in the Hudson Valley or the Bay Area, but keep in mind that such areas are also highly desirable to others and thus nearly prohibitively expensive. Look for farmland in an area that is populated enough to buy your products, but not so heavily populated that farmland is out of your price range.



Modern Farmer recommends areas such as Lincoln, Nebraska; Des Moines, Iowa; Boise, Idaho; Mobile, Alabama; and Grand Junction, Colorado as potential locations. They are close to populated areas, but not so prestigious that you won't be able to afford land., There are many loan and grant programs available for beginning farmers, including federally backed loans from the USDA. Many of these vary by your state, so do research by beginning at an online resource such as FarmAid or Start2Farm.


The ""Farm Service Agency Beginning Farmer Loan Program"", National Council of State Agricultural Finance Programs, Farm Credit Services of America, and the American Farmland Trustare all good places to begin your funding search.

, One way to control your initial startup costs and limit your risk of failure is to start small and develop your farm gradually. You don't need a bunch of fancy, expensive equipment to begin farming. Your principal focuses should be your soil and your product., While experimentation is great, when you're first starting out, start by cultivating what you have experience with. If you apprenticed on a berry farm, grow berries. If you trained on a pig farm, raise pigs. You can diversify later if you choose, but beginning with some expertise and experience in your area will be invaluable as you get your farm up and running.

, Your network of personal and community connections will be your single biggest way to promote your farm products, but fortunately, you can also take advantage of other marketing options too. Place coupons in the local paper, create ""pick-your-own"" events, even cold-call restaurants in your area to see if they want to purchase your locally grown goods.


Market yourself heavily on Facebook and Twitter. Post pictures of your beautiful farm and gorgeous crops on Flickr and Instagram. Create an inspirational Pinterest board. While these social media tactics may not seem related to tilling the earth with your hands, they are very useful ways to get your farm into the public consciousness. As an added bonus, they're almost always free!, These are usually organizations that connect people living in the area who want to buy locally grown produce with the farmers who produce it. Most often, people will buy ""boxes"" at a subscription rate, and you will deliver whatever fresh produce you're growing at that time. In addition to providing sales, this can be an excellent way to spread word-of-mouth about your farm., While this route may seem like ""selling out"" to you, many city dwellers are eager to learn more about farming and get their hands (just a little bit) dirty. Consider promoting farm tours and gardening classes. You could even advertise as a wedding venue. Maximizing every revenue stream you can think of will help you stay afloat even if your crops don't do well one year.


Wedding budgets are usually great news for farmers, as plenty of brides and wedding planners are willing to spend big to have their wedding in a picturesque rural locale. Prices for simply using your farm as the wedding venue can run into the thousands of dollars, which could be a significant chunk of your annual income.

, Knowing how to grow crops and raise livestock is only the first step. Even once you’ve learned the basics, continue to do research on new techniques and opportunities, and always try to learn from other farmers. Don’t get complacent about your farming.


Rely on those who have the experience and real-life knowledge of farming and raising/growing livestock/crops to get the information and knowledge you need.
You will also have to learn from your mistakes and learn from the mistakes of others. There's a saying that is common among airplane and fighter pilots that is easily applicable to farmers: ""Learn from the mistakes of others, because you won't live long enough to make them all yourself.""

, A strong connection to your community is crucial for running a successful farm. Developing a good relationship with your community means you’re also developing a support network.


You can't market your product or sell your livestock or crops if you can't or don't know how to communicate, network or talk with other people in your community. Make friends, acquaintances and business partners with the various people involved in agriculture, be they farm equipment mechanics, local butchers, local sale barn personnel, potential buyers, other local farmers, or various other tradesmen and -women.

, Most farmers are not rich, and they don’t have lots of money to spend on various ""toys"" and luxuries that others may be accustomed to. However, farming offers you the opportunity to think creatively and resourcefully, to be your own boss, and to feel proud when you’ve put in a long, hard day of work. Many farmers say that they love the sense of independence they get from farming and couldn’t imagine another life.Don’t believe that you have to have all the latest equipment to be a farmer. Thinking they have to spend money on a bunch of unnecessary stuff is an often mistake for brand-new farmers. Ask established, experienced farmers for advice.
Don't be afraid, though, to expand your assets to improve your farm. There's a fine line between working with what you have and having to spend money to get what you need (not simply want) for your farm.

, You will find you have to be a welder, a mechanic, an electrician, a chemist, a plumber, a construction builder, an accountant, a veterinarian, an entrepreneur, a marketer, and even an economist. Make sure you know which hats to put on given the situations that require them.


If you don’t have all of these skills, find someone who will teach you! This is where your community engagement will come in handy.

, As a farmer, your success depends not only on your own hard work and skills but also on the land, the animals, and the forces of nature that you interact with. Love your farm for what it is, and don’t try to turn it into something it isn’t. Cultivating a deep appreciation for the whole ecosystem of your farm will give you a far deeper understanding of it.


Where you live will dictate what kind of severe weather to expect and whether or not you can raise certain livestock with success or failure.
Respect your farm’s equipment too. Farm machines aren’t toys, and you shouldn’t treat them as such. Understand that they are powerful machines that could easily maim or kill if not handled correctly, and follow safety procedures at all times.

, As a farmer you are growing food for other people who cannot grow food for themselves due to time, living spaces, or life choices. You, unlike many other people, get to experience rural life at its fullest: the highs, the lows, and the hard work that goes along with it. In America, only 2% of the population are actively farming. In Canada, a mere 5% of the population follow under this category. As such, be proud of the fact that you are a part of the minority that get to provide food for others.

Determine the weight of your vehicle.,
Apply for a US DOT number.,
Get farm-certified.,
Fill out intrastate tax forms.,
Obtain special permits.",How to Apply for an Agricultural Transportation Permit1," The weight of your vehicle will determine what types of permits and licenses you need to operate an intrastate carrier. The state and federal departments of transportation will rely on gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) and/or the combined license weight (CLW) when making a weight determination. Your GVWR is a value specified by the manufacturer of your vehicle as the loaded weight of a single vehicle. Your CLW is either the declared gross weight of the vehicle for registration purposes or the highest actual gross weight of the vehicle when operated during your current registration.


If your vehicle is less than 10,001 pounds GVWR, no special permits are needed.
If your vehicle is between 10,001 and 26,000 pounds GVWR, you need a US Department of Transportation (DOT) number unless you are farm certified.
If your vehicle is over 26,000 pounds CLW, you need a US DOT number and specified intrastate tax licenses. If you are farm certified, you only need the US DOT number.;
, A US DOT number is issued by the US DOT and acts as a unique identifier for commercial vehicles weighing over 10,001 pounds GVWR. If you are only traveling within a specific state, that state's DOT will be responsible for issuing the US DOT number. You can register for a US DOT number online by visiting the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration website.If you are having trouble with the online application, call your local motor carrier transportation division for help.


Once you obtain your US DOT number, display it on your vehicle before operating., Most states offer a farm certification process allowing you to obtain farm license plates for your vehicle. By obtaining farm certification, you can benefit from lower registration fees, exemptions from weight-mile taxes, exemptions from certain insurance requirements, exemptions from some safety requirements, exemptions from pollution control equipment and emissions testing, and lower International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) fees.


In Oregon, for example, you will fill out a farm certification application asking for your personal information (including your US DOT number), the total number of acres you farm, the vehicles you want farm-certified, and the types and quantities of agricultural products and livestock you produce.If your application for farm certification is accepted, you will receive farm plates to put on your vehicle. If there is a delay in approval, your local DMV will issue you a temporary farm permit., If your vehicle exceeds certain weight allowances you might be required to meet intrastate fuel tax requirements. If this is the case you should obtain the required license application and submit it to your local motor carrier division. For example, in Kentucky, you can fill out a Kentucky Trucking Application in order to request a Kentucky Intrastate Fuel Tax license. The application will require you to provide personal as well as any business information you have. In addition, you will be required to list every vehicle identification number (VIN) for every vehicle you want licensed.Once you have your license for intrastate fuel taxes, you will need to file quarterly tax returns, which require you to reveal your gas usage for the licensed vehicles., Some states require you to get special permits if you are hauling specific agricultural commodities. Check with your state's DOT to determine if you need any special use permits. For example, in Minnesota, some transporters will need to obtain special permits for hauling baled materials (e.g., hay) and livestock."

Look for a job.",How to Be a CNA in North Carolina," Technically, in North Carolina, you are not required to complete a training course. You are however, strongly encouraged to complete a state-approved 75 hour training course in order to prepare for the required state exam. State approved classes are offered at community colleges, health care facilities, and though private companies. Find a state-approved course near you and enroll.


75 hour courses are often divided over 12 weeks, meeting 6.25 hours per week.
16 of these 75 hours will be hands-on training.;
, One appeal of becoming a CNA in North Carolina is that it does not require a GED or High School diploma to enroll. Enrollment procedures will include instead a criminal background check, a health exam, and verification of your identity. You must be at least 17 years old with a valid ID. You may also be asked to take a drug test., In order to enroll in the course, you will need to provide up-to-date immunization records. This is crucial, as you will be working in a medical setting, and providing proof of your immunizations is required by law.


To train or work as a CNA in North Carolina, you must be vaccinated for varicella, Hepatitis B, TDaP, and two-step PPD., In North Carolina, the average cost of tuition for such a course is $400. This is significantly lower than CNA tuition in other states. Some schools may have financial aid or student loan options to help offset this cost., The most essential (and expensive) material you will need is the book required for the course. Purchase this book, borrow it from a friend, or find it at a local library. You will also need: a pencil, a highlighter, a notebook, scrubs in your size, a wristwatch with a second hand, and white closed-toed shoes.

, Your instructor will schedule a time for you to have your ID badge made. Part of your training will include “clinicals,” or hands-on training in a medical setting. You must obtain an ID badge before you can begin working on clinicals.

, CNA courses in North Carolina are typically 12 weeks long. This means that a great deal of information and training is packed into just a few months of study. In order for to you to pass this class, you will need to make it your top priority for these 12 weeks.


Courses in North Carolina are 75 hours in total, with 16 of those hours comprised of ""hand-on"" learning. So a typical course meets for 6.25 hours per week, spread over 12 weeks.
Many courses are offered at night or on weekends. Some meet twice a week, and others three times a week.
Online courses are not offered, as much of this training will be hands on.

, The ""instruction"" portion of your course will be divided across three main areas of study: physical care activities, psychosocial care skills, and the role of a nurse aide. It will be crucial for you to study your materials at home, pay attention in class, and ask questions about anything you do not understand.The physical care skills section will be the most extensive, covering the activities of daily living (hygiene, dressing and grooming, nutrition and hydration, and so on), basic nursing skills (infection control, emergency situations, therapeutic procedures, and data collection and reporting), and restorative skills (prevention and self care/independence).
The psychosocial care skills section will cover both emotional and mental health needs, as well as spiritual and cultural needs.
The section of the role of the nurse aide will explore communication, client rights, legal and ethical behavior, and becoming a member of the care team.

, As you cover material through the lecture portion of the class, and through your reading at home, you will be assigned quizzes and tests. Stay on top of your assigned reading, review what you’ve covered in class, and be sure to spend some quality time preparing for each test.

, Clinicals are done in a nursing home, an assisted living facility, or in a hospital., After finishing lectures, and clinicals, there is one more test to be taken in class. This is your final exam in the course. It will will test your knowledge and skills, and prepare you for the state certification exam.

, Locate a CNA testing facility in your area and sign up for the state exam. You will have the option of choosing a “written and skills” version of the test, or an “oral and skills” version.Written exam is only available in English. It consists of 70 multiple choice questions.
Oral exam is available in English or Spanish. The Oral Examination consists of sixty multiple-choice questions and ten multiple-choice reading comprehension questions provided on an MP3 player.
At the Skills Evaluation you will be asked to perform five randomly selected nurse aide skills. You will be given thirty minutes to complete the five skills.

, The written and/or oral component of the exam will cover the information you learned through the ""instruction"" portion of your CNA course. The skills section will focus on what you learned through your clinicals, or hands-on training.The written/oral portion of the test will cover physical care skills (activities of daily living, basic nursing skills, and restorative skills), psychosocial care skills, and the role of the nurse aide.
The skills you may be asked to perform include: proper hand-washing, recording a measurement (such as blood pressure, radial pulse, respirations, urine output, or weight); applying a knee-high elastic stocking; assisting with use of bedpan; transferring to wheelchair using transfer belt; or providing passive range of motion (PROM) for shoulder, ankle, or knee.

, Regardless of which version you select (written and skills, or oral and skills), the fee for the test is $101. You must pay this fee at the time of registration.If you should need to take the either the written or orals tests again, the fee is $24.
If you need to retake the skills portion, however, the fee is $77.

, You will need to arrive at the testing facility with all required materials thirty minutes before the start time for your exam. You must bring: two forms of ID, two number 2 pencils, a watch with a second hand, scrubs, and your white nurses shoes., Once you have passed the North Carolina exam, you are able to work as a CNA. You will be placed on the North Carolina CNA registry 1-5 business days after passing your state exam. Then, you can use any number of job-search tools (including Indeed, Monster, or even Craiglist) to find an employer who is hiring. You may also want to contact long-term care facilities in your area directly. Health care is a constantly growing field, and you should have no trouble finding work as a CNA.

Get a warm hat.,
Cover your ears and neck.,
Get tight, waterproof gloves with grippers.,
Wear silk underwear – not the lingerie kind!,
Invest in a pair of knee-high farm boots and wear them with warm socks.,
Tuck in your shirt, and anything else that can be tucked.,
Keep moving.,
Wear dark colors.,
Breathe through your nose.,
Eat your heart out.,
Stay warm!

",How to Stay Warm when Working on the Farm," It feels colder if you don't cover your head because the head and facial area is more sensitive to temperature changes than the rest of the body.The first thing you should do is find a snug, thick hat.;
, Thick earmuffs aren't a good idea, not only because they make it especially difficult to listen, but also because they attract the attention of curious and hungry goats and horses. Wear a headband under your hat or, better yet, buy a choker or neck warmer that wraps around your neck and can be lifted to cover your ears as well. This is much better than a scarf, the longer parts of which can get caught on fences or in farm machinery.

, Big, bulky ski gloves might keep your hands warm, but if you end up taking them off every 15 minutes so that you can open or close gates, or hook a lead on a halter, or cut string, then the gloves are practically useless. Instead, get gloves made of something like neoprene, which is what slick scuba diving suits are made of. Even if they aren't as warm, if you can keep them on continuously, you're much better off. If your hands do get cold, the best way to warm them is to rotate your arms one at a time as fast and hard as you can. You will immediately feel the blood warming your fingers.


If you can find the little packets of disposable hand warmers often sold in dollar stores, stock up on them.Add these to your coat pockets each time you go out and use these when your hands need warming up quickly. Just be sure to replace them after each use, as they only last for the time that they're activated.







, Silk underpants and undershirts make an excellent base layer. Wear long underwear. After you put those on, throw on a t-shirt and jeans, then a sweatshirt, then your coat. Alternatively, invest in coveralls. Farmers and many others who work outside always have coveralls.


Fine merino wool thermals are another good buy. The technology for using wool in underwear has improved massively in recent years, so they're not itchy unless you're hyper-sensitive.

, They might be expensive, but they'll be comfortable and warm. Consider getting rubber boots that will keep your feet dry, as opposed to boots with laces (bits of snow get lodged in the laces and melt into the boot, even if the company claims it's waterproof). Likewise, they'll be much easier to clean – you just rinse them off at the end of the day and leave the mud at work. Finally, wearing boots that reach up to your knees will add another layer of warmth to your legs. An added bonus is that many farm boots have steel toes which will protect your feet in case something falls on them.

, Cold drafts are thieves of body heat and soon leave you feeling very uncomfortable. When you go to lift something, and you expose even a tiny bit of your mid-section to the elements, you're just asking for chills. So, tuck your shirt into your pants, your pants into your boots, and your sleeves into your gloves.

, The first fifteen minutes will kill, but once you're up and about, you'll start generating body heat as long as you stay active. Avoid the temptation to stand around; jog in place if you have to. Also, stay outside. Believe it or not, the shock of repeatedly moving from a warm, heated indoor environment to the cold outdoors is worse than if you just stay outside. That's not to say that you shouldn't come inside for lunch, or bathroom breaks; but don't think that stepping inside for just 10 minutes will actually help things.

, They absorb the sun's heat much better (and they won't stain as easily).

, When cold air travels into your body through your nostrils, your body warms it up before it reaches your lungs. But when you breathe through your mouth, it's like sticking an icicle in your chest.

, Your body burns a lot of calories trying to stay warm (in addition to supporting your physical activity). Eat warm, healthy meals and drink warm beverages.

Determine the weight of your vehicle.,
Get a US DOT number.,
Register under the UCR program.,
Obtain an IFTA license.,
Obtain IRP licenses.,
Determine if your truck is subject to safety regulations.,
Meet the minimum safety regulations.",How to Apply for an Agricultural Transportation Permit2," If you are transporting agricultural commodities between states, you will need to meet certain requirements above and beyond those of intrastate carriers. While some requirements will overlap, other requirements are specific to carriers operating in multiple states. The types of permits and licenses you need will depend in part on the weight of your vehicle.


If your vehicle is less than 10,001 pounds GVWR, no special permits are needed.
If your vehicle is between 10,001 and 26,000 pounds GVWR, you need a US DOT number even if you are farm certified. In addition, you will need to register under the Unified Carrier Registration (UCR) program.
If your vehicle is over 26,000 pounds CLW, you need a US DOT number, an International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) license, UCR registration, and an International Registration Plan (IRP) license. Farm-certified vehicles only need a US DOT number, UCR registration, and maybe an IFTA license., If a US DOT number is required for your interstate carrier, go online and apply through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.If you have questions or need help, contact the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and not your local or state DOT., The UCR program is meant to register and collect fees from carriers engaged in interstate travel.You will apply with your home state. For example, in Indiana, you can apply online using their UCR Portal.In general, your state will ask for the following information in your UCR application:Your personal information (including your US DOT number).
The number of vehicles you are registering.
How much money you owe, which is usually around $76 for one or two vehicles.

, IFTA helps you report motor fuel taxes when you travel in more than one state. IFTA is not a separate tax or fee. If you are required to obtain an IFTA license, you will do so through your state's tax department. For example, in Ohio, you can download and mail in an IFTA application, which will ask for the following information:Your personal information, which will include your US DOT number.
Whether you have IFTA licenses from other states.
Whether you will be travelling outside of your home state.
How many decals you are requesting.

, The IRP is a registration agreement between every state providing you a way to pay apportionable fees based on the total distance traveled in all jurisdictions. You will register with your home state's motor carrier division. When you register, you will receive an IRP license plate that will allow you to travel outside your home state.


The fees you will have to pay will be apportioned depending on the percentage of actual distance the fleet (not individual vehicles) traveled in each state., If you are traveling between states, federal law may require you and your vehicle to meet certain safety regulations. The safety regulations you may need to abide by are found in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). The types of safety regulations you are required to abide by will depend on whether or not you have a ""covered farm vehicle"" as defined in MAP-21. If it is not a covered farm vehicle, you will most likely have to meet all the safety standards. If you have a covered farm vehicle, you may or may not be exempt from certain standards. Check with your state's motor carrier division for more information., If you are required to comply with MAP-21 safety regulations, be sure you know which ones apply to you. Depending on your situation, you may be required to meet one or more of the following safety standards:Minimum insurance requirements
A verification that all of your truck parts and accessories are in good working order (e.g., lights, brakes, windshields, tires, exhaust, bumpers, seat belts, and steering)
Carry various inspection, repair, and maintenance records
An annual truck safety check
Drug and alcohol testing
Driving hour requirements and log requirements
Trailer markings (e.g., reflectors)
Load securement

Check for reciprocity agreements.,
Obtain fuel tax trip permits.,
Meet every other state's registration requirements.",How to Apply for an Agricultural Transportation Permit3," Some states have reciprocity agreements with other, neighboring states, that waive registration requirements so long as certain criteria are met. If you are traveling in a small number of states, check with those states to get an idea of what agreements are in place. For example, Oregon has an agreement with Washington and Idaho agreeing to waive registration fees so long as the Oregon vehicle is operating within 50 miles of the Oregon border., If you do not travel to other states states often, you may not have an IFTA license. If you do not have an IFTA license but you need to travel to other states, you might be able to get a temporary fuel tax trip permits. These temporary permits can be obtained at various on-site locations. For example, in California, you can obtain temporary permits at specific truck stops. In Nevada, you have to call the Nevada Motor Carrier Division in order to obtain the correct permits. In Idaho, you can get a permit at various truck stops and ports of entry., If your state does not have reciprocity with the state you are traveling to, you will need to comply with that state's requirements. Call the motor carrier division of every state you are traveling to to get more information. If you are going to travel to these states often, you may have to comply with federal interstate permitting and licensing requirements.

Check weight and length limits.,
Complete the required application.,
Submit the application.",How to Apply for an Agricultural Transportation Permit4," If you are operating heavy farm machinery (e.g., tractors), which are called implements of husbandry, you may need to acquire permits to drive them on public roads. This is particularly important in farming communities during harvest time. If the weight of your vehicle exceeds certain state limits, you will be required to get a permit in order to operate that vehicle on public roads. You can find these limits by calling your local DOT office., If you are required to complete an application, the application can usually be found online by visiting your state's DOT website. Your DOT may even have sample applications you can look at to get a better idea of how to fill it out. Once you obtain a blank application, you will need to fill it out by providing the following information:Your identity and the routes you will be taking with your implements of husbandry. You can either write out your routes or attach a map.
Identify the type of permit you need.
Provide details about your vehicle.
Provide information about the frequency of your trips.

, Once your application is complete, you will submit it to your local DOT office. Most offices will respond to your application within three weeks. If you are approved, you will receive a permit that is automatically renewed each year. If the roadways change in a single year, you may need to reapply. In addition, if your vehicle changes, you may need to reapply as well."

Be sure to stay home from school, work or any public venues immediately if and when you feel unwell in any way.",How to Avoid Getting Chickenpox if Someone in Your Household Comes Down with It," You might be able to save yourself from getting the chickenpox if you get the vaccine immediately when you realize your sibling, roommate, etc is sick.Go to your doctor and tell him/her your situation.  (S)he will also give you valuable advice on avoiding the virus and staying healthy, and if you do get it, (s)he will be able to recommend home and prescribed remedies for you.  Even if you do develop the chickenpox after getting the shot, it will probably be a more mild illness than if you did not get the shot., This is a step not guaranteed to work, as chickenpox is extremely contagious.  By the time your sibling shows his/her first spots, there's a strong likelihood that you have already caught it and are already in the early stage of the incubation period.  However, chickenpox has a total contagious period of one week: two days before the spots begin, and five days into the spots.Therefore, two days of exposure will yield a lesser likelihood of catching chickenpox than one week of exposure.  The best way to isolate yourself would be to vacate the house right away when the sibling comes down with chickenpox, and stay away throughout the stage the infected sibling has spots.  You could find yourself a friend, aunt, uncle or grandparent who has already had the chickenpox.  It is best that the person you move in with has already had the chickenpox or has been immunized just in case it happens that you do come down with it.

, You can help cleanse your body of the chickenpox virus, and reduce the likelihood of it infecting you by drinking a lot of fluid, even if you are currently not showing any symptoms.  If there is any virus in your body (which by the time your sibling came down with it, there would be) drinking water, or better yet orange juice or other drinks rich in vitamins, will help to wash the virus out.  You can also start taking echinacea or vitamin C daily, as this builds up the immune system's strength.  Exercise helps to keep viruses at bay too.

, Be sure to ask whoever is looking after the sick person to disinfect the house.  This includes doorknobs, counters, cups, glasses, cutlery, countertops, bedding, clothing and any material the infected person will have come in contact with.  


Even if you have vacated the house, this is still an important step, because even if you do manage to avoid getting chickenpox by vacating the house, you might get infected when you move back in after your sibling is better if there are live viruses remaining in your house.

, This does not just mean watch for spots, but rather watch for any symptoms at all.  Most cases of chickenpox do not yield the starting of spots as the first symptom.  

,

If you develop a fever, headache, fatigue, runny nose, sore throat, or (most obviously) the beginning of spots, stay home immediately.
If you do come down with the chickenpox, it is also a good idea to inform anyone you came into contact with within two to three days before you starting getting sick, as you might have passed the virus on to them.

Increase your intake of vitamin C. Since viruses enter the body when the immune system is weak, you should take steps to strengthen your immune system so that the body does not become vulnerable.,
Eat probiotic yogurt.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat more mushrooms.,
Eat foods rich in carotenoids.,
Consume more garlic.,
Drink aloe vera juice.,
Drink black tea.,
Drink apple-cider vinegar.,
Understand the importance of good hygiene in preventing infection.,
Learn the correct hand-washing technique.,
Know when it is important to wash your hands.,
Clean your house thoroughly.,
Avoid drinking contaminated water.,
Use chemical disinfectants.,
Decontaminate water with a portable filtration device.,
Avoid eating street foods.,
Ensure proper waste management.,
Increase your self-awareness.,
Understand what causes stomach flu.,
Know which viruses can trigger gastroenteritis.,
Recognize the symptoms of stomach flu.,
Understand the risk factors for stomach flu.,
Be aware of how the virus is transmitted from person to person.",How to Avoid a Stomach Virus After Being Exposed," One easy way to do this is to increase your intake of vitamin C.


Vitamin c is available in tablet, capsule, effervescent and syrup form. You should take 500 mg of vitamin C every day to boost your immune system and protect the body against immune system deficiencies.
Vitamin C can also come from other foods and beverages such as cantaloupe, orange juice, broccoli, red cabbage, green pepper, red pepper, kiwi and tomato juice.;
, Studies have shown that eating probiotic yogurt can help to prevent the recurrence of stomach flu. Having a cup of yogurt a day can keep your stomach healthy.


Yogurt contains good bacteria known as probiotics. These good bacteria combat bad bacteria in the stomach. Yogurt also helps to repopulate the good bacteria in the stomach.
Yogurt is produced by adding bacteria cultures to milk. When this is done it transforms the milk’s sugar into lactic acid.

, Another way to strengthen the immune system is by drinking sufficient amounts of water.


It is recommended that a person drinks at least 8 glasses of water every day, as water helps to cleanse and hydrate the body which is good for the immune system.
These 8 glasses of water should not include other liquids such as coffee, soda, alcohol or tea.

, Mushrooms are also known to strengthen the immune system, as mushrooms increase the number of white blood cells in the body. These white blood cells fight against the microbes that cause infection.


There are many different types of mushrooms that can be used. Shitake, maitake and reishi are among the most popular mushroom types that have a positive effect on the immune system.
Eating at least ¼ ounce to 1 ounce of mushrooms a day can strengthen the immune system. You can prepare the mushrooms by adding them to a pasta sauce or sautéing them in oil.

, Carotenoids (which are a derivative of vitamin A) enhance the activity of immune system’s cell and improve cell-to-cell communication to easily identify foreign bodies. They also induce apoptosis (also known as cell suicide) in these foreign bodies.


Foods rich in carotenoids are carrots, sweet potatoes, tomato, pumpkin, cantaloupe, apricots, spinach and broccoli.
The recommended daily intake of vitamin A should be: 0.9 milligrams daily for men and 0.7 milligrams daily for women.

, Garlic has the ability to stimulate the body’s immune system by stimulating the activity of white blood cells called macrophages which engulf foreign bodies, such as virus cells associated with the stomach flu. For immune-boosting effects, eat a clove of garlic every 4 hours.

, Aloe vera contains certain chemicals that can boost the function of the immune system.


The substance lectin in aloe vera stimulates the production of macrophages – the cells responsible for fighting foreign bodies by ingesting them. This can help eradicate the stomach virus inside the body.
Aloe vera is available in the form of juice which you can drink. 50 ml of aloe vera juice per day is recommended.

, Studies have also shown that drinking of 3 tp 5 cups of black tea a day over a two week period can help the body fight off any virus in the blood.


L-theanine is a component in green and black tea which is known to boost the immune system.
For the tea to be more effective, bob the tea bags up and down while brewing.

, Apple cider vinegar works by changing the pH in the intestinal tract into an alkaline environment. This is effective because intestinal viruses do not thrive in an alkaline environment, they prefer an acidic state.


Mix two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar into a glass of water and drink daily.

, Hygiene is of utmost importance when it comes to staying healthy. This does not only apply to stomach flu but also other diseases. Hygiene is the body's best defense from illness.


The most important precaution you can take against illness and contamination is hand washing, as your hands are the most likely body parts to come in contact with a norovirus infected surface.

, Washing your hands using the correct technique is essential in killing any microbes that may be present. In order for the hand-washing to be effective, you must use the following technique:


First wet your hands and apply an anti-microbial soap. Rub your palms together. Continue to rub the palms then rub the back of each hand. Then, rub between the fingers on each hand and the fingers themselves. Finally, clean your wrists.
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. If you cannot estimate the time you are rubbing your hands, sing the Happy Birthday song twice. Then rinse your hands starting from the tips of the fingers to the wrists. Pat hands dry with a clean cloth.

, You should wash your hands:


Before and after preparing food, before eating food, before and after taking care of a sick person, before and after touching any type of wound, after touching any dirty surface or things, after sneezing, coughing or blowing your nose and after touching pets.
If hand washing cannot be done, using hand sanitizer is the next best option. Place a generous amount of sanitizer in your hands and rub your hands together to evenly distribute the gel over all surfaces of your hands.

, Different parts of your house along with the cleaning equipment you use in everyday living often contain unseen microorganisms, which could lead to stomach virus. To clean the house, the following must be done:



Cloths and sponges. As much as possible, use disposable cloths or paper towels. Reusable cloth or sponges should be disinfected in a bleach solution after use. Soak cloths and sponges in a bucket of bleach solutions for at least 15 minutes, then rinse thoroughly.

Mops and buckets. These are considered two of the dirtiest tools used in homes as they always come in contact with the floor. Use two buckets when mopping. One for the detergent and one for rinsing. To disinfect a mop: Remove the mop’s head if detachable. Add ¼ cup of antimicrobial solution in a pail of water and mix well. Soak the mop’s head for at least 5 minutes. Rinse thoroughly, then leave to dry.

Floors: Floors are the dirtiest part of the house because they are stepped on everyday. Use a mop soaked in an antimicrobial solution (¼ cup of antimicrobial solution mixed with a pail of water) to clean the floor. Make sure the floor is always dry as microorganisms thrive in damp conditions.

Sinks and lavatories: Always flush the toilet after each use and use antibacterial or antimicrobial disinfectants ((¼ cup of antimicrobial solution mixed with a bucket of water) to clean both sinks and toilets at least every other day.

, It is vital to check if the source of water is clean and not contaminated by harmful microorganisms. Contaminated water is one of the ways in which a stomach virus can be transmitted.


There are several ways to decontaminate water, the easiest of which is boiling. Water should be brought to a boiling point for at least 15 minutes before removing it from the heat. This ensures that microorganisms in the water are killed.
Alternatively, if you find yourself in a location where you are unsure about water safety, you could stick to drinking bottled water. However, the seal on each bottle must be checked for any signs of tampering to ensure water safety.

, Substances like chlorine and iodine are dissolved in water to kill microorganisms. These chemical disinfectants work by breaking the chemical bonds in the molecules of bacteria and viruses.


This causes the entire molecule to fall apart or to change shape, which in turn causes a microorganism to die. To disinfect water, the following must be done:
Add 2 drops of chlorine in 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of water. Stir the mixture well for at least 2 minutes. Wait for 30 minutes before using it.
However, this method does not give 100 percent efficiency, thus filtering or boiling should still be utilized.

, These type of devices contain a pore size of less than 0.5 microns to filter viruses and bacteria. They work by trapping microorganisms in the filter so that the water passing through it is safe to drink.


Portable filtration devices should be used in combination with either the boiling method or chemical disinfectant. To use portable filtration devices, the following must be done:
Fit your water filter onto the faucet. Most water filters are made according to universal measurements so that they can fit almost all faucets. Press firmly to ensure that it is tightly sealed. Open the faucet and let it flow for at least 5 minutes to remove any carbon dust.
Portable filtration devices should be changed every month to ensure that the water is properly filtered. Microorganisms accumulate in the filter as time passes by, that’s why it must be changed monthly

, You will never know how these foods are prepared and if they are safe enough to eat. They may contain harmful microorganisms such as those which cause stomach virus, especially if they are prepared using dirty hands and contaminated food ingredients.

, Spoiled foods must be properly disposed and trash cans should be kept sealed at all times to avoid attracting pests like rodents and cockroaches. Garbage also can be a place for microorganism to thrive in.

, Always be updated with the latest news. A good understanding of current events can aid you make wise decisions regarding travelling or doing recreational activities in different places or countries.


For example, if there is an outbreak of stomach virus or gastroenteritis in a certain place and you plan on going there, then it would be best to cancel your plan for your own safety.

, Most cases of gastroenteritis are linked with the invasion of infectious agents like bacteria and viruses. Bacterial or viral infection causes diarrhea and other symptoms by triggering the inflammation of gastrointestinal tissue.


These agents tend to elevate the amount of fluid in the intestine and colon by altering the normal function of the gastrointestinal tract in absorbing water and by speeding up the motility of ingested food items which leads to diarrhea.
It can also damage the intestinal cells either directly or indirectly through its secreted toxins.

, Many kinds of viruses can trigger gastroenteritis but the most frequent types are the following:


Norovirus (Norwalk-like virus). This is the most common type of virus that affects school age children. It may trigger epidemics in hospitals and cruise ships.
Rotavirus. This is the usual cause of severe gastroenteritis among children but can also affect adults who made contact with those children carrying the virus. It may also infect those individuals living in nursing homes.
Astrovirus. This causes gastroenteritis, predominantly diarrhea in children under 5 years old and has been reported in adults.
Enteric adenovirus. This also causes gastroenteritis aside from respiratory infections.

, Signs and symptoms associated with gastroenteritis commonly appear within 4 to 48 hours following exposure to infectious agents or contact with contaminated food or water supply. Symptoms may include:


Abdominal pain.
Chills, sweating and clammy skin.
Diarrhea.
Fever.
Joint stiffness or muscle pain.
Nausea and vomiting.
Poor feeding or loss of appetite.
Weight loss.

, The prevalence of gastroenteritis is globally-high as it is almost impossible to avoid exposure with any of the identified causes of the disease throughout your entire life. However, some individuals are more vulnerable to gastroenteritis, for example:



Individuals who are immunosuppressed. It may involve infants, children, adults and elderly as they may have underdeveloped or weakened immune system which puts them at greater risk of acquiring the disease. They also have the tendency to become dehydrated easily as compared to those with healthy and strong immune system.

Individuals taking antibiotics. This drug can weaken the function of normal gastrointestinal microbes which makes it easier for the invasion of certain bacteria and viruses like Clostridium difficile that can cause disease.

Individuals with poor hygiene. Proper maintenance of the body such as correct techniques in handwashing can help in preventing certain types of diseases like gastroenteritis.

Individuals exposed to uncontaminated foods and drinks. Eating under cooked or unwashed food items or drinking from contaminated water sources such as rivers or streams could potentially put an individual at higher risk of developing gastroenteritis.

, Gastroenteritis can be transmitted through the following methods:



Direct contact. An individual who touches a contaminated item such as feces and in turn touches another individual could directly transfer the viral or bacterial agents causing gastroenteritis.

Indirect contact. An individual carrying the bacterial or viral agent touches a certain object and another individual touches the same object previously handled by the carrier and then suddenly places his/her already contaminated hands into their mouth could indirectly transfer the infection.

Contaminated foods and drinks. These items could potentially harbor the causative agents of gastroenteritis and if ingested accidentally could lead to the outbreak of the disease.

Enroll in a dual-degree program.,
Complete a PharmD program after undergrad.,
Apply to a pharmacy school outside of the U.S.",How to Apply to Pharmacy School1," If you have not started or have only recently begun your undergraduate education, consider pursuing a combined degree. This will allow you to earn your bachelors of science and doctor of pharmacy degree together, usually in six years of study. There are other dual-degree programs that incorporate a different bachelor’s or graduate level degree with a PharmD degree.While a PhD. or other graduate degree can enhance your knowledge and hireability, you must complete a PharmD program to be able to work as a pharmacist in the U.S.;
, This is the most common route to a PharmD degree, as most students are not sure they want to pursue the degree until part way through their undergraduate education. If you want to go straight into a PharmD degree program after undergrad, begin researching programs and preparing to apply during your Junior year.

, If you live outside of the U.S., look to see if your country has a national pharmacist organization, which will likely have information on PharmD programs near you.Be aware that accredited PharmD programs outside of the U.S. are rare. Further, those that do exist also tend to have especially competitive admissions.


While some accredited advanced degree programs outside of the U.S. have less stringent admission criteria, this is not the case for PharmD degrees.
Always ensure a program you’re interested in is accredited by the ACPE, the only organization that can formally accredit an institution as a provider of continuing pharmacy education."

Prepare your ears for touch.,
Check for sensitive areas.",How to Apply Reflexology to the Ears1," It's great to go into the situation with a reflexology chart. If you forget any of the pressure points on the ears, you can quickly consult your chart. If possible, bring a reflexology chart into the room where you'll be doing ear reflexology.If you don't have an ear reflexology chart, you can print one from the internet.;
, You should do reflexology in a quiet room where you will not be disturbed. Find a comfortable chair or couch. Sit upright in a comfortable position to do ear reflexology., Start with the lobes. Gently press your lobes between your index finger and thumb. Pull them down gently as you press them. Do only a gentle tug. Stop pulling if you feel pain., You do not want to perform reflexology on any sore areas of your ears. Trace your fingers along your ears. Notice any sore or sensitive areas, or any scratches or abrasions. Leave these areas alone while doing reflexology. Reflexology should reduce, not increase, pain and discomfort."

Learn the fundamentals of reflexology.,
Understand reflexology zones.,
Consider making an appointment with a reflexologist.,
Practice applying pressure to reflex points.,
Get in a comfortable position.,
Relieve tension in your neck and head.,
Help your chest relax.,
Relieve stomach tension.,
Loosen your limbs.,
Help yourself sleep.,
Have a partner help you.,
Get rid of a headache.,
Deal with general aches and pains.",How to Do Reflexology," Reflexology is based on the premise that the nerves in your feet, hands and ears each correspond with other parts of your body. Applying pressure to certain reflex areas can relieve symptoms in other parts of the body.Engaging a nerve in your big toe, for example, could reduce tension in your head and relieve a headache.Applying pressure to your heel could aid in digestion. Reflexology has even been used to aid in treatment for serious conditions like cancer, diabetes and heart disease.Research has shown that reflexology has four primary effects:


It can impact specific organs, such as by increasing blood flow to the kidneys.
It can bring about an amelioration of specific symptoms by helping organs function properly.
It can create a relaxation effect and reduce anxiety.
It can relieve pain throughout the body.;
, Reflexology is based on the idea that the body can be divided into zones.Picture your body divided into a system of longitudinal and transverse zones. Imagine five zones on each side of your body, starting at the tip of each toe, and running up the length of your body to the top of your head. The transverse zones (similar to lines of latitude) divide the areas of your feet into zones that correspond to your head and neck, your chest, abdomen and your pelvis area. Engaging the tip of a particular zone by applying pressure to a place on the foot activates the body's healing power for that entire zone. This concept is also referred to as zone therapy.


When you perform reflexology, it's necessary to learn where the reflexes are on the feet that correspond to every limb, organ and gland of your body. When you apply pressure to these specific points, you stimulate the corresponding limb, organ or gland.
In this way you can use reflexology to stimulate your body's healing power. When your body is experiencing stress, your energy reserves get depleted and you are less able to fight infections or combat pain. But when your body is in a deeply relaxed state induced by reflexology, your body’s natural healing power is activated.

, Meeting with a person who has been certified in the art of reflexology is a good way to introduce yourself to the practice. He or she will be able to show you the finger ""walking"" techniques used to apply pressure to specific points on the hands, feet and ears to relieve stress and pain in other parts of the body.Before making an appointment, be sure to check the person's credentials and verify that he or she is a certified reflexologist. Some natural health practitioners practice reflexology without having studied the art in depth.
If you're interested in becoming a reflexologist, consult the website of the American Reflexology Certification Board to find a list of programs that offer certification in reflexology.

, When you identify which zone you want to engage, find the correct reflex spots on your foot by looking on a chart or consulting with a reflexologist. Apply gentle pressure to the area. The pressure you apply to these spots will stimulate your body to create endorphins that interrupt the pain cycle and relieve stress.


Reflexology feels similar to getting a foot massage. The pressure you apply should feel firm, but not painful. Use your fingers and thumbs to gently work the area for several minutes.
To prepare yourself for a reflexology session, simply try to relax. Reflexology is often considered a holistic healing practice, but there's no special mental preparation you have to go through to make it effective., Remove your shoes and socks and sit cross-legged on a bed or a yoga mat. Try to relax your body in an effort to prepare yourself to begin the healing process. You may either perform your own reflexology treatment or work with a partner who can apply pressure in the spots that are more difficult to reach.

, Relieve neck tension by applying pressure to the joints or ""necks"" of your 8 little toes. If you are experiencing tension in one area of your neck, you will feel tension or a slight discomfort in one of your corresponding toes. Your entire head is represented in your two big toes, so apply pressure to them to relieve headache tension.


Use your fingers to apply steady, firm pressure to the backs of your toes, one at a time.
Continue until you feel the tension in your neck begin to dissolve and the pressure leave your head.

, Stress often manifests in the form of a chest that feels tight. You may feel like you're having trouble taking a good, deep breath. Apply pressure to the balls of your feet to alleviate chest discomfort. This area contains the reflexes to your lungs, airways, heart, thymus gland, chest and shoulders.

, If you tend to feel stress in your stomach, which many might describe as having ""the jitters,"" press the reflex points on your instep (the non-weight bearing area on the bottom of your foot) to relieve discomfort to your abdominal organs. This is the area you would want to work on if you are feeling ""gut-wrenching"" emotions, or if you wake up with a feeling of heaviness in the pit of your stomach.

, If your legs, arms and shoulders feel tight with stress, use reflexology to loosen up. Discharge tension in your arms and legs by applying pressure to the reflex points on the outer edges of your feet.

, Try applying pressure to a combination of all of the reflex points to relieve insomnia. Stress is often the main cause behind insomnia, and if worries, fears and tension tend to keep you up at night, you can relieve your insomnia using the same reflex points you would use to relieve tension and stress:


Apply pressure to the backs of your toes to ease pressure in your neck and head.
Apply pressure to the balls of your feet to help you breathe more easily.
Apply pressure to your instep to help your stomach calm down.
Apply pressure to the outer edges of your feet to loosen tight muscles.

, When you're dealing with pain, it can be helpful to work with a a partner rather than performing reflexology techniques on your own. That way you can try to completely relax your body to allow healing to begin. Remove constricting clothing and lie down on a bed or another comfortable surface before beginning the session.


Dim the lights to create a more peaceful environment with as few irritating stimulants as possible.
It can help to play soothing music, light some candles, or use massage oil to make the experience feel as calming and healing as possible.

, Reflexology is great for relieving simple headaches. Relieve tension and sinus headaches by applying pressure on the reflex points for the head and neck, which are located on your toes. All of your toes have points that correlate to your head, face and brain.


Apply pressure to the entire surface of each of your toes if you are suffering from a migraine headache. Press your thumb into each toe and repeat the process at least ten times for each toe. This method is especially effective if your migraine has been triggered by sinusitis.
If you have chronic or unexplained head pain, seek medical advice to find out if your headaches are being triggered by other medical conditions.

, An overall reflexology session can relieve general aches and pains. Most reflex points should be pressed for about 10 seconds at a time. Take your time and press all the reflex points on each one of your feet. Use light pressure and pay attention to any spot that feels sore or painful. When you experience discomfort in a reflex point, the corresponding organ or limb is out of balance.


Treat all the reflex points on each foot, to evaluate all your areas of imbalance.
Once you’ve worked on each of your feet, return to any painful points and work your sore points gently until you no longer feel the soreness or discomfort.

Focus on your back and shoulders.,
Deal with joint pain.,
Address your organs.,
Help with your sinus and throat.,
Deal with digestion.,
Focus on the head and heart.",How to Apply Reflexology to the Ears2," If your back and shoulders are bothering you, massage your ears on the pressure points that target these areas. The pressure points are found on the top of your ear, near its tip. Massage the tips of your ears to address back and shoulder issues.You can massage your ears for anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour. For a very sore back and shoulders, focus on these pressure points longer. If your back and shoulders are not a major problem, only linger near your ear tips for a few minutes.

, If you have joint pain, the pressure point for this is found in the upper middle part of the ear. To address joint pain, gently massage this area. Apply pressure to this area for only a few minutes to see a potential change.For best results, apply pressure once a day.

, For severe internal pain, you should always talk to a doctor. However, if pain persists after medical treatment, reflexology may help you ease some of that pain. The pressure point for organ pain is where the bridge of your ear meets the outside of the ear. Massage this area for a few minutes., For sinus and throat problems, focus on the pressure point in the lower-inner portion of the ear. Apply gentle pressure here. For some, this helps clear out sinuses and allow easier breathing.Any chronic sinus or throat problems should be addressed by a doctor.

, Digestive issues can be aided by applying pressure to the point just above the earlobe. Spend a few minutes gently massaging this area.For best results, massage this area as digestive discomfort occurs.

, The earlobe is closely associated with the head and heart. Pressure headaches may be helped by massaging the earlobes.If you have very intense headaches or chest pains, see a doctor.

Understand reflexology is not a cure.",How to Apply Reflexology to the Ears3," Not everyone should do reflexology. If you have any of the following health conditions, refrain from reflexology:Deep vein thrombosis
Thrombophlebitis
Cellulite on your feet or your hands
An infection
A high temperature
A high-risk pregnancy
Two weeks after a stroke

, Reflexology is not a medical science. While some people find it effectively helps manage aches and pains, you should not rely on it to treat chronic conditions. Any type of ache or pain that does not go away on its own should be evaluated by a medical professional., If you have a chronic condition, remember reflexology will not cure it. Something like chronic sinus issues, for example, will continue to be an issue even when using reflexology. Think of reflexology as a means to ease symptoms rather than cure a medical ailment."

Know thyself.,
Check yourself before you wreck yourself.,
Think before you drink.,
Respect it, don't neglect it and have a game plan.",How to Avoid Being a Loose Unit when Drunk," Admittedly this is not as easy as it sounds. Socrates considered 'knowing thyself' a life-long pursuit that takes years of self-reflection. For practical reasons, all you need to do here is to survey your drinking history to establish rough boundaries between levels of inebriation. This will set the standard to apply in the second step.;
, Very simple. Know your alcoholic tolerance and drink accordingly at the appropriate rate and adapted quantity. This is linked to knowing thyself.

, There are three things to keep in mind when thinking in the context of drinking: time, place, and occasion.



Time: Note the time of day it is. Morning is rarely the time to drink - unless it is carrying over from the night before in the very early hours (00:00-04:00). Lunch should be kept light in terms of alcohol so you can do things in the daytime.

Place: This mainly comes down to safety - where can you get safely drunk?

Occasion: Getting inappropriately drunk, say, at meet-and-greets or family gatherings needs to be avoided.

, Map out a rough timeline of how you will begin and end the occasion at which you are drinking. Obviously you need to be flexible, but having a general idea of how you are going to control your drinking will avoid impulsive and spontaneous behaviour that pushes you over the edge and into the danger zone.

Get the support you need.",How to Become a Surrogate Mother," There are not established legal requirements for being a surrogate, but most agencies have their own guidelines. In general, a woman must be between 21 and 45 years old, be in good physical health, have a stable family life, and have had a previous pregnancy that did not result in any complications in order to be considered a good candidate.;
, Before you become pregnant, you should see your doctor to make sure that you are healthy enough. Your doctor may perform a physical exam, perform blood tests, and ask you about your personal and family history.If you have any chronic medical conditions or a history that cause you to develop complications during pregnancy, your doctor will talk to you about the risks involved and what you can do to reduce them.
If you are on birth control, be sure to ask your doctor how long you need to stop the medication before you try to become pregnant.
You may need to get vaccinated for certain diseases that could be dangerous to an unborn child, including chickenpox and rubella.
You should also consider getting tested for sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV and chlamydia. These diseases can be harmful to an unborn baby, and may also result in pregnancy complications or fertility issues. If you are working with a surrogacy agency, these tests will likely be required.
The intended parents may also be required to undergo certain screenings, including tests for diseases that may be transmitted to you or to the child during pregnancy, as well as psychological and genetic screenings.

, If you are using a surrogacy agency, you will be required to undergo a psychological evaluation to ensure that you do not have any underlying desire to keep the child. Even if you aren't required to talk to someone about these issues, it is a good idea to do so for your own emotional well-being.It is very important that you understand how difficult it might be for you to part with a child that you carried for nine months. Surrogacy is a controversial issue because some people do not believe that a surrogate mother can truly give informed consent to give the baby up before it is born.

, In order to provide the most benefit to the unborn child, you should start taking prenatal vitamins that contain folic acid before you start trying to get pregnant. Folic acid is most important to a fetus during the first few weeks of development, so if you wait until you know you are pregnant to start taking the supplements, you may have already missed the most crucial window., There are two different kinds of surrogacy: traditional surrogacy (also known as partial surrogacy or straight surrogacy), and gestational surrogacy (also known as full surrogacy or host surrogacy).With traditional surrogacy, the surrogate mother is artificially inseminated using sperm donated by the intended father, or in some cases by a sperm donor. The surrogate mother's own egg is fertilized, so she is the child's biological mother. This can create lots of legal complications because in some areas, the surrogate mother may be able to claim guardianship of the child based on the genetic link.With gestational surrogacy, the surrogate mother undergoes a procedure called in vitro fertilization (IVF), during which an embryo that was created in a lab, using eggs and sperm either from the intended parents or from donors, is implanted in her uterus. With gestational surrogacy, the surrogate mother is not genetically related to the baby.
You can become a gestational surrogate for a close family member. You cannot become a traditional surrogate if the intended father is a close relative of yours because this increases the risk that the child will have a genetic disorder.

, The laws regarding surrogacy are extremely complicated in the United States. Because there is no federal law regarding surrogacy, each state has its own laws. In some states it is illegal to enter into any kind of surrogacy agreement, and you may even go to jail for doing so. In other states, it is perfectly legal to enter into a surrogacy agreement and to be compensated for doing so.

Many states allow contracts for gestational surrogacy, but not for traditional surrogacy, due to the potential for custody battles.
If you live in a state that does not recognize surrogacy agreements as legal, you may end up being legally responsible for supporting the child, especially if the child was conceived using traditional surrogacy methods.
The laws in some states also require that the intended parents undergo formal adoption proceedings after the child is born. In other states, legal guardianship can be established before the birth of the child.

, If you choose to use a surrogacy agency, the agency will take care of matching you with a couple who wants a child. If you want to become a surrogate mother to help someone you already know have a child, you do not need to use an agency.It is also possible to arrange for a surrogacy agreement with a couple you don't know by answering or placing an ad, but keep in mind that agencies screen all potential candidates, and you will not have this protection if you do not use one.
You will need to fill out an application and undergo certain medical tests in order to be accepted by a surrogacy agency. In some cases, the agency may have specific requirements for surrogate mothers beyond a clean bill of health.
Whether you use an agency or not, it is very important that you trust the intended parents. You will have a great deal of contact with them during your pregnancy, so it is important that they be supportive and reliable.
Make sure you look into the agency's background before signing any agreements. Not all agencies are reputable.

, Because of all of the potential legal issues involved with surrogacy, it is extremely important to have good legal representation throughout the entire process. Your lawyer should draft a comprehensive contract that outlines the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved. This should be done before you undergo any medical procedures.Make sure your contract addresses important issues such as the amount of compensation the surrogate mother will receive, who will be responsible for paying medical bills, who will have custody of the child in the event that something happens to the intended parents during the pregnancy, what will happen if the surrogate mother gives birth to twins or triplets, what will happen if one party wants to terminate the pregnancy, and what will happen in the event of a miscarriage. Your lawyer should advise you of any other issues that need to be addressed in the contract.
You should have your own lawyer, not the same one who represents the intended parents.
If you work with a surrogacy agency, they may take care of the contract for you. It is still a good idea to have your own lawyer look it over before you sign it, just to make sure that you are fully protected.

, Once you have undergone all of the necessary medical screenings and finalized your surrogacy contract, you will need to undergo a procedure, either artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization, to become pregnant. Both of these procedures involve the insertion of a thin catheter into the surrogate mother's uterus, and are typically performed at fertility clinics. After the procedure, you will be required to undergo tests to confirm if you are pregnant.


Intrauterine insemination is the most effective type of artificial insemination because the sperm is inserted directly into the uterus. This procedure is very quick and should not cause any pain.You may be given a mild sedative for IVF. You shouldn't feel any pain, but it may be slightly uncomfortable.You may be required to take hormonal supplements prior to the procedure in order to increase the likelihood that you will successfully become pregnant., The surrogacy contract will likely include clauses regarding your obligations to maintain a healthy pregnancy. Make sure to attend all of your required doctor's appointments and follow your doctor's recommendations for living a healthy lifestyle.


It is also very important to maintain a good, open relationship with the intended parents. They will likely want to be very involved throughout your pregnancy.

, If you find that it is more difficult being a surrogate mother than you expected, don't be afraid to talk about your feelings. Many surrogate mothers deal with complex emotions during their pregnancies, so you are not alone.Confide in your spouse or partner, if you have one.
Attend support groups for surrogate mothers or seek out help online. These women will understand exactly what you are going through.
See a counselor if necessary. Some surrogate mothers may need to seek professional help in order to cope with the psychological difficulties involved in carrying someone else's child.

, Beyond having a breadth of knowledge in medicine (and being someone who does not get squeamish easily!), a nurse must also be skilled in other areas. In this sense, nursing is like any other profession in that there are specific individual qualities that make the job easier and a more natural fit for some people. It's important to determine whether your personality and abilities can accommodate the various responsibilities and tasks that come with being a nurse. Key qualities include:Interpersonal and communication skills: Being a nurse requires working with people every day—doctors, other nurses, technicians, patients, caregivers, and others. To communicate information clearly and do their jobs effectively, nurses need strong interpersonal skills, patience, and the ability to break down complex information into something that is accessible for ordinary people (i.e., non-specialists).

Compassion: Caring and empathy are valuable when taking care of individuals who are sick or injured. Remember that patients may be scared or in pain and need to be comforted, reassured, and motivated to fight through their illnesses.

Critical thinking: Registered nurses must be able to assess changes in the health status of their patients and make a quick referrals.

Detail-oriented and organized: Nurses often work with multiple patients and healthcare professional at a time and so they need to be able to keep track of what has been done and what needs to be done. In addition, attention to detail is key; medication needs to be given on time and emergency protocols must be followed to the letter.

Stamina: Nurses are often required to perform physical tasks, such as lifting patients, and also work long shifts of between eight and 12 hours, which may include night shifts.

, Admission into a school of nursing requires a high school diploma or, alternately, passing the General Education Development (GED) test.If you want to be a nurse, pay attention to your performance, skill, and interest in courses like biology, physiology, and chemistry throughout high school. The knowledge from these courses will be important in your post-secondary education.


A good foundational knowledge and understanding of how the human body works is necessary in the field of nursing and begins already in high school.
Don't get discouraged if these subjects don't come easily to you. Consider hiring a private tutor to help you in your math and science courses in order to improve and develop effective study and learning strategies.

, There are three ways to become a registered nurse. Whatever path you choose, the coursework involved will include physiology, biology, chemistry, nutrition, and anatomy.Bachelor's degree in nursing (BSN). This level of education is like a bachelor’s program in all other fields. It is awarded by a college or university and usually takes four years to complete. Classes will include community health, pharmacology, health assessment, microbiology, chemistry, human development and clinical practice. In addition, bachelor's programs usually include more training in social sciences than other nursing programs. You may take courses in sociology, communications, leadership, and critical thinking.Associate's degree in nursing (ADN). This is the most common way to obtain a registered nursing license and involves a two-year program at a community or junior college. Many students transition to BSN programs after having completed an ADN and holding an entry-level nursing position. In these cases, nurses are able get further education using an employer's tuition assistance program; they're also able to work and earn an income while getting the next level of education.Diploma from an accredited nursing program. You can also be eligible for licensure by completing a vocational nursing program. These accredited programs are often associated with a hospital and vary in length, though they are typically up to three years long. In this program, classroom learning, clinical practice, and on-the-job training are combined. This education path is on the decline since hospitals have placed a limit on the number of diploma graduates they can hire due to recommendations by the National Advisory Council on Nursing Education., The national accreditation agency for nursing schools is the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. This agency ensures the quality and integrity of bachelor, graduate, and residency programs in nursing. Accreditation is voluntary but ensures that colleges and schools providing nursing education are operating at the same professional level and educating future nurses in a manner which ensures that they can provide effective and standardized care., Registered nurses must have a nursing license. Take the National Council Licensure Examination — Registered Nurse (NCLEX-RN) once you have graduated from your accredited program and thus have completed the appropriate education requirements. This test is the nationally recognized licensing exam for registered nurses.Prerequisites to and fees for the exam may differ between states. Check with the requirements for your state, or for the state you plan on practicing in.
Note the following requirements in order to sit the licensure examination:

Application for the examination must include a U.S. social security number.
Individuals must be accompanied by a recent passport-style photograph.
Application must identify the school from which the applicant graduated. Transcripts must be forwarded to prove that the individual met all educational requirements.



, There are more than two million nurses in the United States, making the position the largest in the healthcare field. There are a variety of settings in which a nurse can work, including hospitals, physician's offices, elderly care homes, prisons, college campuses and schools.


Newly certified nurses should consider working in a specialty unit, as the patients in these facilities are more homogeneous. Examples of specialty units include orthopedic and pediatrics units.Nurses with a bachelor's degree have better employment prospects than those who do not; they are recognized as having capabilities from their curriculum that prepare them for management, case management and leadership roles.

, There are a variety of fields for nurses to practice, including pediatrics, adults, OB/GYN, geriatrics, community health, occupational health, rehabilitation, surgery, neonatal, intensive care, and emergency. You will likely have already started thinking about this during your RN educational training. Each RN program gives their nursing students clinical rotations through which they gain experience in these various areas of the hospital and community.


Nursing students may have a full semester in a particular clinical rotation, such as pediatrics, adult or community health. They will also experience several hours in an intensive care unit, emergency room and neonatal unit. Not all schools will give nurses rotations through a physical rehabilitation unit for patients following strokes or spinal cord injuries. Most schools will expect that nurses get experience with geriatric care while caring for adults.
Once you know what field of nursing you'd like to work in, you can apply for jobs in that field.

, Even after completing the required education and certification, nurses should continue to read medical journals, be aware of the policies of the healthcare organization they work for, and take additional courses in medicine. Scientific and medical knowledge and technologies are constantly changing and evolving and so staying up-to-date is key to providing effective healthcare.

, The term advanced practice registered nurse is an umbrella term used for nurses who have achieved at least a master’s degree in nursing (MSN). The academic program to become an advanced practice nurse is one to two academic years, depending upon the specialty, school, and your previous work experience. There are four main advanced practice settings in which nurses can practice under this APRN umbrella:Clinical Nurse Specialist. These nurses typically work in hospitals, clinics and nursing homes. They handle a wide variety of physical and mental health problems and may work within the fields of research, education and administration.

Nurse Practitioner. These advanced practice nurses may work in clinics, and nursing homes, hospitals or private offices. They see a wide range of primary and preventative health patients. In most states, nurse practitioners can prescribe medication, diagnose illness, and treat minor injuries.

Certified Nurse Midwife. These nurses provide gynecological and low risk obstetrics care in hospitals, homes and birthing centers.

Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist. This is the oldest of the advanced practice nursing specialists. Each year certified registered nurse anesthetists provide more than 65% of the anesthetics given to patients in hospitals and outpatient settings.

, Some nurses move into management positions, which are increasingly requiring a graduate degree in nursing. Other nurses move into the business aspects of healthcare, while still others opt to work outside the healthcare setting directly by becoming instructors in colleges and universities.All in all, the nursing field is varied and offers a huge number of opportunities for individuals interested in health and wellness.

Prioritize your education.,
Complete your general education courses.,
Master foundational science and nursing courses.,
Learn about patient centered and person-focused care.,
Take advantage of professional development opportunities.,
Pass nurse licensure and certification examinations.",How to Achieve Goals As a Nursing Student2," It is important that nursing school is a top priority in your life. Nursing programs are intensive and you will need to prioritize class and study time over non-essential activities.


Try making a list of priorities like school, family, friends, exercise, etc. If nursing school isn’t within the top few priorities on your list, you may need to do some rearranging in order to achieve your goals as a nursing student.

, For many nursing programs, you will be required to complete general education courses like English before entering the program. At other schools, you will complete these courses while you are a student in the program. Prioritize these courses as they will help you learn how to communicate effectively, understand diverse human behaviors and experiences, and think critically., As a nursing student you will take courses that are foundational to the field of nursing. Courses in anatomy and physiology, pharmacology, health assessment and promotion, and informatics are part of most nursing programs. Mastering this curriculum is crucial to your success as nurse.Try studying in one hour blocks. Study for the first 50 minutes and then take a 10 minute break before beginning the next study block.
Find a study buddy or study group. Your fellow students likely come from a wide variety of backgrounds, and can be a great source of support., Patient-centered revolves around the patient and centers on assessment and treatment of the patient’s problems and disease processes. Person-focused care is based on accumulated knowledge of the patient, helping nurses and doctors assess the patient’s medical needs over time and within context of other needs the patient might have., You should begin building your nursing resume with clinicals, internships, and professional experience as soon as possible. These experiences will help you land a job once you finish school, and help you further develop your understanding of nursing and healthcare.


For example, if you want to work as an emergency room RN and the local hospital announces an internship, apply for it!
If you set a goal of learning how to effectively communicate with diverse patient populations, attend a local conference on the subject.

, Once you have passed all the clinical and curriculum requirements for your program and graduated with your nursing degree, you will need to begin study for upcoming exams. Nurses are required to pass licensure exams, which vary depending on your nursing education level. These exams include the NCLEX-RN and NCLEX-PN.Talk to your nursing professors about how you can utilize the nursing curriculum from your program to study for licensure and certification exams.
Consider taking a NCLEX preparation course to help you achieve the passing standard for the exam.

"
"
Make your health a priority.,
Take time for self-care.,
Stay connected.",How to Achieve Goals As a Nursing Student3," It’s important to make sure that you are getting enough exercise, eating properly, and tending to any preexisting medical conditions while you are in nursing school. Maintaining your health will help your performance in school and avoid burnout.


Set aside time on the weekend to prepare healthy snacks and/or meals for the upcoming week.
Set aside time for a walk several times a week.
Set up an appointment with a mental health professional if you’re feeling overwhelmed. They can help you manage the stress and anxiety that often comes with being a nursing student.

, Nursing school is tough and it’s easy to forget to take care of yourself while you’re overloaded with homework and life’s responsibilities. Set aside time each week for an activity that recharges you, a practice that helps you relax, or habits that help you maintain your health and energy levels.


Soak in a long, hot bath after a long day at school.
Make your Saturday morning yoga class a priority.
Invest in supportive, comfortable shoes. As a nursing student you will be on your feet for many hours at a time.

, It’s important that you maintain connections with family and friends while studying to become a nurse. They will be an important source of support. Spending time with the important people in your life will help you stay focused and ultimately achieve your goals as a nursing student."

The US Department of Health and Human Services has a graph depicting a timeline of changes. View it at http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/timeline/index.html.;
, The following are important changes.


Children can get coverage under their parents’ healthcare plan until the age of 26. Previously, healthcare coverage stopped at age 23.
Women cannot be charged more money for a healthcare premium than men. Before 2010, most females had higher rates than males.
The private insurance company must cover preventative appointments and some medications. A plan must include a single preventative wellness visit per year and certain necessary inoculations. The company must pay for the services, so that they are not charged to the insured’s deductible.
There are restrictions on denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions and raising healthcare premiums more than 10 percent.

, If you have never been insured as an adult, you should know what to expect when you look through plans in the health insurance marketplace.


Your plan will be paid for using a “premium.” This is a monthly payment that keeps your insurance active. A premium will go up depending upon the number of people who are covered under the plan.
Most health insurance companies provide several ways to pay for the premium. You can send a check, have an automatic withdrawal of funds from your account or pay for multiple months at a time.
In addition to the premium, each plan has a deductible. This is the amount of money that the insured person or family must pay before the health insurance company covers all or a higher percentage of all medical costs. For example, the deductible may be $3,000 for the year. Once you have incurred and paid for $3,000, your health insurance company takes on more financial responsibility.
The deductible resets each year on January 1, 2013.
A health insurance company may require you to use in-network providers. #*The percentage of the cost to you may change if you decide to use out-of-network doctors or facilities. The company should provide a list of in-network providers to you. Some plans have more freedom than others, so you can see whether your current doctor is considered in-network before you enroll.
Pay attention to the list of services that are covered with your plan. Hospitalization, dental, vision, specialists, addiction treatment, physical therapy and many other types of treatment should be considered, based on the percentage the health insurance company will cover.
These are just a few of the things to consider when choosing a plan. For instance, a plan with a higher deductible that has 100 percent coverage after the deductible is met may be a better financial decision if you foresee surgeries in your future.

, Before the Affordable Care Act, private individuals had to individually apply to each health insurance company to compare rates and coverage.


The application process used to include rigorous medical questions and interviews by each company.
The insurance marketplace simplifies the process. Now, you will fill out a single application that will be submitted to all participating health insurance companies.
You will be given different plans, premiums and deductibles so that you can choose the best and most affordable coverage in your area.

, You will use this website to find your state’s marketplace. Approximately 26 states will have their marketplaces run through the federal government.


Other states opted to create state-run insurance marketplaces.
7 states were given innovation grants for setting up state-specific exchanges.

,,


If your state is running their own exchange, you will be redirected to your state’s website.
If your state is using healthcare.gov to administer their exchange, you can sign up for an account through this site.

, An account does not mean that you are required to use the exchange to find your healthcare plan.

,


Call your local hospital to inquire about informational meetings. Many hospitals are giving informational talks about the exchange between September 2013 and March of 2014.

Go to a meeting before October 1, 2013, if possible. This is when the open enrollment period will start. You have until March 2014 to join the exchange.
If you cannot find an informational meeting in your area, call the national hotline at 1-800-318-2596.

, People are being hired to meet with people and help them apply to the exchange.


You can find a navigator at your local hospital, state exchange website or through the national hotline.
If you feel like you need help filling out an application, this is the best option.

,,, You can fill it out yourself or get help from a Navigator.


You will need to disclose information about yourself and your health history.

, Wait several days or weeks to hear your options from each company.

,


Consider each of the people who will be insured in your plan.
Ask your friends and family who are insured if they will give recommendations of health insurance companies they use.

, You must enroll by March 1, 2014 in order to become insured this year.


Depending upon income levels, age and more, you may be eligible for Medicare, Medicaid or subsidized child healthcare. Sign up for these plans if you qualify, as they may be available at little to no cost.
People who choose not to be insured may face consequences. They may not receive tax credits to offset costs.
The Affordable Care Act states that each individual must be insured, and those who opt not to be insured will no longer receive free healthcare. If you cannot afford an insurance plan, you should inquire about qualifying for Medicaid or other subsidized plans.

Manage stress more effectively.",How to Stop Your Stomach from Growling," Water aids in digestion by helping break down food so your body can absorb nutrients more efficiently, and can also soften stools to help prevent constipation. Swap out sodas, coffee, juices, and energy drinks for water, and consult with your healthcare provider to determine how much water you should be drinking daily based on your health and activity level., Eating too quickly and failing to chew food thoroughly can cause you to swallow too much air, which can lead to gas and indigestion. Schedule time in your day to sit down and eat instead of eating quickly on the go to improve your digestive health.

, Skipping meals or not eating enough when you’re hungry can lead to a growling stomach, which often signifies your body needs nourishment in the form of food. Avoid skipping meals, and consume healthy snacks in between meals such as nuts, fruits, and vegetables that can help improve digestion.

, Coffee is highly acidic and will increase your stomach’s acidity level. An excessive amount of coffee can lead to a growling stomach -- especially when your stomach is empty. Limit your coffee intake as much as possible, and switch to drinking green, white, or black teas. Tea contains caffeine, as well as compounds and antioxidants that are more soothing for your stomach and digestive system than coffee., Most fruits and vegetables are high in water content, and contain vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can naturally help improve digestion and lower the risk for a growling stomach. Make a conscious effort to eat more fruits and vegetables throughout the day, and lower your intake of boxed and packaged processed foods that contain sugar, preservatives, and additives.

, Candies, pastries, sodas, fruit drinks, alcoholic beverages, and other food and drink high in sugar, fat, and artificial sweeteners can lead to gas and indigestion because they slow down the digestion process. Avoid eating these foods as much as possible, or consume them in moderation to improve your digestive health.

, Certain high-fiber foods can increase the risk for gas because they force your digestive system to work harder and longer at breaking down these foods; however, most high-fiber foods are good for your health and shouldn’t be avoided completely. Examples of gas-inducing, high-fiber foods are beans, cabbage, broccoli, onions, asparagus, whole grains, apples, pears, and peaches. If you plan on sitting in a quiet classroom or attending an important meeting, avoid eating these foods immediately beforehand to prevent your stomach from growling., Smoking and using straws are activities that can cause you to swallow too much air, which can result in gas and a growling stomach. Quit smoking as soon as possible to improve your digestive and overall health, and drink beverages straight from the cup without using a straw.

, Exercising regularly encourages healthy bowel movements by keeping food moving through your digestive system, which can help prevent your stomach from growling. Engage in moderate-intensity aerobic activity on most days of the week, and do strength-training exercises two or three days per week to improve your digestion and overall health., Feelings of stress, anxiety, and nervousness can cause your stomach to growl and negatively impact your digestive health. Start practicing yoga or deep breathing, or engage in other activities that help you relax in times of stress, such as listening to soothing music, taking a warm bath, or reading a book.

Think about what will work best for you. If you’re not sure how much soda you want to cut out, use a calorie counter to figure out how much you are consuming. You will probably discover that you’re taking in hundreds of empty calories in the form of soda., For some, it's about the sugary taste. For others, it's the caffeine rush. It's important to know what you are getting from soda so that you can figure out an alternative to help move you away from soda., If it's caffeine you like, coffee and tea are going to be better choices than soda. Investigate different coffee drinks (both hot and cold) and teas. There are many options beyond black coffee and black tea. You might want to tryIced tea
Flavored black tea
Cold brew coffee

, For many people, the sweetness and carbonation of soda are what make it most appealing. There are many alternatives that can help satisfy your craving. There are even water bottles and pitchers that you can fill with herbs or fruits to make your own infused waters.Flavored and/or infused water
Carbonated water
Sparkling juice

, By drinking a glass of water before you drink soda, you’re not thirsty by the time you get to the soda. This will help slow down your soda consumption., Replace one of your daily 8 oz servings of soda with water. That way you hydrate and get fewer calories. Do that for one week and then decrease your intake again.Continue to lower the amount of soda that you drink until you have given it up completely.

, Hopefully you’ve found some drink that’s not soda that can be your daily drink -- coffee, tea, flavored water. Try to replace one of your servings of soda with your new drink and one serving of soda replaced by water. Do this for a week., Find out a combination that works for you -- water, some soda, some of your new drink -- and keep drinking less and less soda. This process might take a few weeks, or even a month. By doing it slowly, you’re allowing your body to get used to the lower levels of soda it’s taking in.

, Now that you have water and some other beverage to hydrate you and satisfy some of what soda gave you, hopefully you will be able to stop drinking soda. It might be difficult at first, but by working up to it slowly, your body has gotten used to progressively lower levels of soda., Just because soda is no longer as central to your diet doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy it occasionally. One serving of soda a week may be an acceptable amount.

, Don’t let yourself fall back into bad habits because you’re tired or wanting a sugar fix. If you are tempted by the vending machine at work, bring your own beverages. Keep water as your main beverage -- don’t let yourself be sucked into craving your new beverage choice (coffee, tea, flavored water)., Even though you’re not drinking soda, you can consume or do other things that can satisfy your cravings that are healthier. When you start to crave soda, do something enjoyable that can take the place of the soda craving. In addition to the drinks mentioned earlier, some options might be:


Chewing gum
Taking a walk
Playing a game on video or smartphone
Texting with a friend for support

, Write down your reasons and keep them somewhere that you can look at regularly, such as on your refrigerator or on your phone lock-screen. When you feel a craving come on, look at your list and think about how you'll feel afterward.

Remind yourself of the ways that soda can impact your health. Sugary sodas increase the risk for obesity, type II diabetes, osteoporosis, kidney stones, and heart disease.Sugary drinks are bad for your teeth.
Soda is also expensive.

, Large quantities of soda typically keep you highly caffeinated. Even though the levels of caffeine in coffee are higher, if you have a serious soda habit you’re probably drinking a lot of caffeine. Think carefully about how you’re going to deal with the reduced caffeine. You’re going to feel more tired and less alert than usual, and this could last weeks as your body adjusts., Serious caffeine withdrawal will typically involve a headache. Your body has been so used to the elevated levels of caffeine, it’s going to take your body a while to adjust back to functioning normally without the high levels of caffeine. Try using over-the-counter headache remedies containing acetaminophen, which does not contain caffeine., Even though it’s not caffeine, drinking water can help keep you full of (healthier) liquids. It can also help combat the caffeine headaches and get your body used to water as your drink of choice, rather than soda.

, Chances are, without caffeine you are going to feel much sleepier than usual. Go to bed earlier to get more sleep. Nap when you can. These extended periods of sleep can help you get through the withdrawal and alleviate the headaches."

Focus on having a healthy body and weight.,
Adopt an eating schedule.,
Eat three meals and three snacks every day.,
Create a healthy eating environment.,
Make a food contract.",How to Stop Purging After Meals1," Understand that purging will not help you healthfully lose weight. This is very important to understand. What you are actually doing is making yourself dehydrated, which can lead to feeling like you have an ‘empty’ stomach. Being dehydrated can lead to more binge eating and cravings. This means that you might not be really losing the weight that you think you’re losing by throwing up your meals.


Purging can cause major dental issues because the bile that comes up when you vomit can literally eat away your teeth.Purging can also result in salivary glands swelling up noticeably, damage or bleeding in the esophagus, and even cancer.Purging does not help you lose weight as much as you think it does because it does not remove all of the calories you ate.In fact, purging can actually lead to weight gain due to overeating and believing that you have ""a way out"" if you eat too much food.
If you excessively exercise on top of purging, you should be aware that your body needs more calories to compensate for those that it burns when you exercise. Because of this, you’ll feel a stronger urge to binge eat, rather than just eat normally.;
, Making a plan about the type and amount of food you want to eat at every meal will help to keep you on a regular eating schedule that will not make you feel like you have to purge. This can also help reduce your impulse to binge and purge because you are sticking to a plan instead of thinking about what to do in the moment. Put the schedule on the fridge or near your dining room table so that you can remind yourself that you are only eating what you have written out, rather than binging.Know that you can healthily lose weight through exercise and lowering your overall calories intake. However, this does not mean you have to starve yourself. Weight loss is gradual and should not be done quickly as this is unhealthy for your body.
If you feel comfortable, ask your family or housemates to help you stay on track by also being aware of your food schedule and helping you stick to it.

, It will help if you create a timetable and select times to eat your three meals and three snacks. While this might sound scary because it sounds like eating more throughout the day could make you gain weight, this is just not true. Eating small items six times a day actually boosts your metabolism and helps you lose weight.An example meal schedule based on a 2,000 calorie diet would be:

8:00AM: Wake up.
9:00AM: Breakfast. (approx. 500 calories)
11:00AM: Mid-morning snack. (approx. 150 calories)
1:00PM: Lunch. (approx. 500 calories)
3:30PM: Mid-afternoon snack. (approx. 200 calories)
6:00PM: Dinner. (approx. 500 calories)
8:00PM: Nighttime snack. (approx. 150 calories)
11:30PM: Bed.


Choose low-calorie foods that you will feel good about eating when you first try to stop binging and purging.
Give yourself time to eat and chew slowly; doing this will help you to recognize when you feel full and can stop eating.

, Your environment (before, during, and after you eat) is integral to successfully reducing your purging pattern.For example, being around loved ones after you eat a meal can help keep you from visiting the bathroom to purge.If you can, ensure that you are not around individuals who binge and purge or have eating disorders while you eat. This can trigger you and enable you to think that it is a good choice to purge.
Do something with a loved one, like going for a walk after a meal, watching a movie, or just sitting around chatting. Let your loved ones distract you from the desire to purge.Other ideas for what you can do after meals include: taking your dog for a walk, calling up a friend until the urge to go to the bathroom passes, or playing a game with family members or friends.

, Make a contract with your family or mental health professional that will help you to break out of the binge-purge cycle. Having this contract, and the support of your family, will help you to gain control of your urges and feelings of guilt.


Work together to decide what reward you should get when you follow your eating schedule, and also come up with what you will do if you go off your schedule or purge.
For example, if you stay on your schedule for a week, your reward could be the money to buy those shoes you’ve had your eyes on. If you break your schedule or purge, then you could ask your family to take away your phone for a day. Do this only if it works for you and doesn't lead to secretive behavior (where you hide or conceal your purging in order to reduce negative consequences).

Plan for slip-ups.",How to Stop Overeating," If you start using smaller plates when you’re eating at home, you may be able to control your portions and prevent yourself from overeating.Usually salad plates or appetizer plates are smaller than typical dinner sized plates and can prevent you from eating large portions of foods.
Some studies have even show that using certain color plates can help your be satisfied with less foods. Go for blue colored plates to help you eat less at each meal.;
, Place the food on your plate and walk away from the serving bowls. When bowls and serving platters are on the table, individuals are likely to eat more than if they pre-serve themselves and then sit down. Keeping them off the dinner table will help you resist the temptation to scoop additional helpings onto your plate.


Keep all food in the kitchen instead of bring the extras to the table with you.
Another good option is to put the food away prior to sitting down at the table. Even when you go back to the kitchen to put dishes away, there is no food to nibble on while you clean up.

, To make sure you’re sticking to the exact portion size recommended for you, it may be helpful to measure your food before serving it or eating it.


Each person requires slightly different portion sizes of each food and quantity of servings throughout the day. In general, stick to the following portion sizes for the food groups: 3 – 4 oz of protein, ½ cup or 1 oz of grains, 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of leafy greensand ½ cup of fruit or 1 small piece.
Adults typically need to eat protein at each meal or snack. Include 1 – 2 servings of fruit each day and 3 – 4 servings of vegetables. Grains should be included one or twice a day, but not necessarily at each meal.
Food scales may be preferable to use as you don’t have to squish all your food into a measuring cup.
You may also want to consider measuring plates, bowls, serving utensils and reusable containers to see how much they hold. If you’re packing meals, you’ll know in advance how much you’re eating.

, When you’re out to eat it can be difficult to eat small portions or stick with a single item.


Restaurants offer the temptation of appetizers, larger entrees and dessert courses. Not only do you have to deal with larger portion sizes, you may be tempted with multiple courses.Consider ordering an appetizer for your entrée. These are generally smaller, but big enough to satisfy you for dinner.
Be mindful of the complimentary bread, chips or crackers that are served. These are easy to overeat when you’re hungry and waiting for your meal to arrive. Consider asking your server to skip these or only bring a small serving.
Speak to the server about the portion size before you order. If it is a large meal that could feed two people, ask them to bring half of the meal to you and put the other half in a to-go container.

, Many commercialized diets and weight loss programs promise rapid weight loss in a short period of time. These diets may leave you hungry, feeling deprived and can lead to overeating or binge eating behavior.In general, losing weight too quickly is not safe. The recommended amount of weight to safely lose is 1 – 2 pounds per week.These diets usually restrict entire food groups, limit meals or strictly limit calories. This may set you up for overeating in the long-term.
Stick to well-balanced and nutritious diets if you’re trying to lose weight. These can help you feel less hungry and more satisfied while losing weight at the same time.

, Whether you’re trying to lose weight or just have a hectic and busy schedule, skipping meals can leave you overly hungry and more at risk for overeating.It’s typically recommended to to eat at least three meals daily. You may also need one or two snacks, depending on your schedule.You may also prefer to eat four to six small meals instead of the more traditional three meals a day.

, If you are eating out of habit and not because of hunger, you could be overeating and giving your body much more than it actually needs.


Learn to identify what true physical hunger means to you. Many people eat for a large variety of other reasons, so it’ll be helpful for you to figure out what hunger is.
Typical sensations of physical hunger include: hunger pangs, an empty pit feeling, slight nausea or lightheadedness, irritability or an empty feeling.
If you’re not feeling these things, you may be eating for another reason (like boredom or stress). Try to avoid eating or snacking and wait until you experience true hunger to eat.

, In addition to eating only when you’re truly hungry, your body provides another tool to help you stop overeating. This is called satisfaction or satiation.


When you’re satisfied or feel sated, that’s your body’s way of telling your brain you’ve had enough food for now — it’s enough to power your body for the next few hours.
There’s a range of satisfaction ranging from sated to overly full or sick. If you overeat, you most likely eat until you’re full or overly full.
Instead, aim to stop eating when you’re only satisfied. This is when you’re not longer hungry, you have a sensation of food in your stomach, but feel no stretching or discomfort in your stomach.Most people just instinctively eat what is in front of them, regardless of whether or not they are still hungry. Listen to your body’s cues to know when a better time to stop eating comes.

, If you eat too fast you are much more likely to overeat compared to if you ate a meal more slowly.It takes close to 20 minutes for the stomach to send the signal to the brain that it is satisfied. This is why eating slowly can help prevent overeating.
Set a timer or keep track of the time while you eat. This can help you pace yourself throughout your meal.
Try putting your fork down or taking a sip of water in between each bite to help you extend the length of your meal.
Decrease distractions while you eat as well. Pay attention to what is going on around you and if you find that you are distracted by bright colours or lights, loud noises, music or lots of people, you will have to pay closer attention to your eating habits to prevent yourself from overeating., To help cut down on excess calories if you do slip up and overeat is to try to make half of your plate a fruit or a vegetable.


Fruits and vegetables are low calorie foods that don’t do much harm if you overeat them.
If you find you are still hungry after eating and you must have seconds, skip the other foods and have only more veggies.

, Water is essential for the proper functioning of your body each day. However, it’s also a great tool to help you decrease how much you eat.


Aim for eight to 13 glasses of water or other hydrating clear liquids each day. This can help you tame your hunger and keep you hydrated throughout the day.In addition to just drinking enough water throughout the day, try to drink one to two glasses right before a meal or snack. This can help you fill up your stomach with a no calorie liquid and make you feel physically full.

, Many times, people make the mistake of rewarding themselves with an indulgent treat for sticking to a healthy eating plan for a designated amount of time. Using foods as a reward for eating healthy is counterproductive to the task at hand.


Instead, allow yourself to indulge in special treats every so often for no reason at all. This will help you keep healthy eating in perspective and recognize indulgences as just that.
If you do want to reward yourself for meeting a goal or for a special occasion find other activities or items that are rewarding to you. For example, you could: buy a new shirt or new outfit, treat yourself to a spa day or a special round of golf or even a new electronic toy you’ve been eyeing.

, Sometimes overeating is due to emotional eating. Overeating can be an eating disorder, and it is crucial that you seek medical help if you think you have a condition that goes beyond little splurges now and then. Working with a mental health specialist that focuses in this area can help you overcome this disorder.Ask your primary care doctor or research online for a local therapist that specializes in eating disorders or emotional eating. They will be greatly equipped to help you deal with emotional eating or overeating issues.
Talk to them about what you think is your biggest or toughest problem to deal with, when you notice it and how you’ve attempted to deal with it in the past.
Remember, even if you’re seeing a specialist, it may take some time and practice before you can eat normal sized portions on a regular basis.

, Starting a journal can be a great tool to help you decrease any issues you have with emotional eating or overeating.Start journaling daily or just a few days a week. Write down your thoughts or just a few ideas either in an online journal or using a notebook and pen.
You can write about what you eat, how much you eat or why you think you overate. Many times it takes a few days or weeks to find patterns in your eating patterns.
It might also be a good idea to jot down a few notes on how you’re feeling or how hungry you are right before eating. This act of sitting down with your journal may force you to focus and be present with your meal.
List your trigger foods in your journal. By understanding what your triggers are, you can avoid those situations that might cause temptations and make it difficult for you to stay on track. For example, if going to the movies automatically prompts you to reach for a pack of candy and a large soft drink, skip the theatre and rent a movie instead.

, If a food craving hits or you're upset and craving food, try to distract yourself before your indulge in your favorite food.


Many times food cravings or the desire to eat is very spontaneous and fleeting. If you just give yourself a few minutes the craving may go away or become much easier to handle.Aim to start with 10 minutes. Go outside for a quick walk, go read a book or do a household chore for a few minutes. Then revisit your cravings.
Come up with a list of ideas of other activities you can do instead of eat. This will help you feel and be more prepared when an emotional food craving hits you.

, No matter what goal you have or what changes you’re trying to make in your life, know that everyone slips up and makes mistake.


Don’t let a slip up (or two) make you feel depressed and upset with yourself. Making mistakes is normal and a part of a great learning process.
If you’ve slipped up, don’t give up. Use the next meal or snack time to get back on track. Don’t let yourself get into the mindset that your whole day is ruined or you should give up just due to one mistake.Try journaling about your slip ups or talk to your therapist if you have one.

Stop thinking in terms of restriction.,
Reduce stress in your life.",How to Train Your Body to Crave Healthy Food," If you dislike the taste of healthy fruits and vegetables, do not try to jump into healthy eating all at once. Gradual changes over time are key to eventually developing a taste for the right things. When you first start going for fruits and vegetables, make use of dips and dressings.You can, for example, dip fruits in healthy yogurts or yogurt-based fruit dips. You can try dipping vegetables in low-fat dressings.
You can also use dips like peanut butter and other nut butters, which are a good source of protein, as well as dips like hummus.;
, It's okay to sweeten vegetables slightly as you're easing into eating them. A minor amount of sugar is okay when you're using it to transition into healthy eating. Try dipping broccoli and cauliflower into a sugar/water mixture. This will sweeten the vegetables slightly, making them easier to eat if you're not used to the taste.Your mixture should contain no more than 20% sugar. Saturating your foods with too much sugar will not help your taste buds adjust.

, You can actually trick your brain into wanting to eat something. People are more likely to go for a food that looks presentable. Use your nicest plates and place your food in a decorative manner on the plate. For example, separate your meats, fruits, and vegetables and add some kind of garnish, like parsley.Colorful plates may look more attractive, and it's recommended you have at least seven different colors of food on your plate. Try incorporating as many colors as possible when assembling your fruits and vegetables.

, The way something smells can have a big impact on whether or not it feels appealing to eat. Your tastebuds cannot always separate from your sense of smell, so if something smells foul you may not like the taste. Cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli and Brussels sprouts, tend to give off a strong odor that puts people off. Steam or roast these vegetables to release the scent and then eat them outside of the kitchen.You can also try pairing bad smelling foods with strong scents you like. If you love the smell of bacon, which can be overpowering, add chopped broccoli to your morning bacon and eggs.

, Browse through your spice rack or take a look at the spices at the grocery store — there is an enormous variety of spices and herbs you can experiment with to enhance the flavors of healthy foods. Try sprinkling basil or oregano over broccoli, or add thyme to roasted carrots. Keep spices like ginger, oregano, red pepper flakes, and thyme on hand to add flavor and aroma to healthy foods., Sometimes people dislike foods due to their texture. Things that have more texture are more difficult to eat, which may put you off. Try serving your fruits and vegetables in a smoothie or adding nuts to a salad to give it more of a crunch., Eating when you're hungry changes how you think and feel about food. If you're prone to mindless eating, you may be snacking out of boredom. This can result in binging on foods you don't really need while ignoring healthier options. Wait until your body feels hungry and keep your kitchen stocked with healthy options.If you're very hungry, and all you have is fruits and vegetables, you'll reach for the carrot sticks even if they're not your favorite. Being hungry in the presence of healthy food encourages you to eat it.

, People tend to eat less of food they paid a high price for. Whether it's accurate or not, people are biased to assume a more expensive food is of higher quality. Try tricking your brain into craving health food by paying a little extra for it. For example, get your shopping done at Whole Foods rather than your regular supermarket., Cutting out sweets cold turkey is likely to backfire. Humans are hardwired to crave sugar, so dropping sugar too quickly can cause intense cravings. Most unhealthy sugary products are too high in sugar to be appealing once you lose your taste for them, so work on replacing sugary foods over time.For example, if you're a soda drinker, try switching to flavored seltzer water. Replace one can of soda a day with one can of seltzer and gradually increase the amount.
Instead of cookies and cakes, go for mildly sweetened breads.
Replace candy with things like dried fruits and raisins.

, Eating too fast can leave you craving more food, which may result in indulging in an unhealthy late night snack after a good dinner. Try to be mindful when you're eating. Turn off the television and eat at the table.Chew slowly and pay attention to the texture and taste of your food.
Set your fork down between bites.
If you slow down the pace of your eating, you may get full faster. This will cut back on unhealthy food cravings.

, If you have junk food in the kitchen, you're more likely to eat it. Healthy eating long term is what will train your brain to crave healthy foods, so commit to keeping junk food out of reach. If you don't have gummy worms to snack on, you're more likely to reach for the sliced apples instead.If you like small treats now and again, keep unhealthy snacks high up in cabinets so they're harder to reach. You can also freeze things like chocolate and baked goods, so you have to wait for them to thaw before eating them. When foods are not in reach, you're less likely to mindlessly snack on them.

, Going out sometimes leads to eating bad foods. If you're still working on creating a taste for health food, try to stay away from get-togethers that involve eating.You can have a running excuse about certain nights. For example, try joining a spin class Friday nights so you'll be able to skip out on bowling night, where you normally eat fries and drink beer.
You can also suggest social outings that do not involve food. For example, everyone can go hiking together.

, How you think about food affects your eating habits. If you're constantly thinking things like, ""I don't deserve that,"" or, ""I can't have that,"" you're creating more stress for yourself. This can lead to stress-eating. Instead, think, ""I can eat whatever I want, but I'm choosing to avoid unhealthy foods."", Stress can be a major cause of pour eating habits. If you're prone to stress-related eating, take measures to reduce stress. Take up hobbies that calm you down. Set aside 30 minutes each day to relax. Start up a workout routine that helps you unwind."

Every day, you should:Love yourself for who you are.
Respect yourself for what you have achieved so far in life.
Remind yourself of what your goals are and what you are capable of achieving in the future. Perhaps make a list of your goals for 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year from now. Look at these goals each day and make sure you are working toward them.

, Consider your strengths, talents, achievements, contributions, and accomplishments. These are things that should define you—not your body type or image. You can also think about the things in life that you are grateful for, be it a loving best friend, a great job, or the amazing family that supports you.Make a list of all of your strengths and accomplishments and put it somewhere where you can see it every day.
Make a list of the things you are grateful for. These things can help to remind you of how good your life really is.
Participate in activities relating to your strengths. For example, if you are a good writer, you can cultivate this strength by continuing to practice writing articles, stories, or even in a journal.

, It can really help to write your emotions and thoughts down, especially when you are trying to overcome the purging cycle. Write down all of the things that make you want to purge, as well as all of the reasons why you want to stop purging. Along with these things you should write down:


Your thoughts about the anxieties or feelings of guilt that make you want to purge.
Moments of strength when you overcame the desire to purge. You can reread these moments of success to give you strength in times of relapse.
Your goals. When you lose sight of them, you can revisit your journal entries and remind yourself of what you are working towards.

, Working to overcome this condition by yourself can be lonesome and frustrating. Because of this, it’s important to create a support system for yourself. Lack of social support is also a significant risk factor in developing issues with eating such as purging. Therefore, it is crucial to make sure you have a strong sense that you are socially supported. The best way to do this is by talking to family members or friends about what you are going through and asking them to help you. They can help you stick to your eating schedule and will help distract you after meals.

, Aside from your family and friends, it can also help to go to community support groups where you can meet and talk to people going through the same thing as you. Support groups can: give you an opportunity to listen to stories about what people like you are going through, help you find motivation through other people’s successes, and offer an opportunity to get valuable directions, insights, guidance, and advice from people who know what it is like and will not judge you for it.


Your therapist can help point you in the direction of a local support group, or you can do your own research online to find a group near you.
Consider trying a 12 step program for eating disorders and see if you like it.There are even Eating Disorders Anonymous (EDA) websites and groups., Reading about others people’s success with overcoming the desire to purge can help motivate you to break your own cycle. Learn how they stopped purging and try some of their techniques. Understand that everyone is different, so you will have to adopt the techniques that work best for you, but the way to do that is to try things that other people have found helpful.


Go to a bookstore and purchase a book on success stories about overcoming the binge-purge cycle.
Look up interviews with people who have overcome bulimia online.

Keep yourself occupied with things that you love.,
Become a volunteer.,
Get plenty of exercise.,
Practice yoga and meditation.,
Consider getting a pet.",How to Stop Purging After Meals3," When you are focusing on things that you love, you will have less time to focus on the desire to purge. It is especially important to keep yourself distracted after you have eaten a meal.Some other things that you can focus on include:


Reading a book or watching a movie.
Pursuing your favorite hobby. If you don’t have a hobby, find one that is tailored to your interests.

Do mental games like crosswords, sudoku, and puzzles.
Put your heart into learning something new, be it a skill or a subject like chemistry.

, Volunteering is a great way to focus on constructive things, rather than on your desire to purge. It is also an opportunity to see the lives of others and put your own in perspective. What you learn while volunteering might help you to analyze the reasons why you purge, and may help you overcome them. Places to volunteer include:


At a local women’s shelter.
At a food service, like a soup kitchen, that serves the homeless and poor. Seeing people grateful to eat food can be therapeutic.
At an orphanage.
At an animal shelter.

, When you exercise, chemicals like serotonin get released in your brain, lifting your mood and making you feel great about yourself. Exercising is also good because, when done in moderation rather than excessively, it can help you stop purging if you purge to lose weight. Exercising regularly keeps you fresh, energetic, and active. In turn, these things can make you feel more confident and happier.You should try to exercise for at least 30 minutes for four to five days out of the week. This can be accomplished through walking, running, swimming, biking, hiking, rock climbing—you name it.
Avoid exercising excessively. Some signs you may be exercising too much include if you engage in strenuous exercise daily or multiple times a day, or if you exercise upwards of 15 hours per week., Behaviors such as purging are usually a result of a pile up of feelings, emotions and mental energies that are seeking an outlet. Yoga and meditation can ensure the smooth release of these mental energies, feelings and emotions in such a manner that you can combat the negativity in your life and give them an outlet in a constructive manner. Yoga and meditation can help your mind to regain its composure and overcome the desire to think negatively and purge.Both practices can help you to see the beauty that lies within you.


When practicing yoga, you focus your entire being on your breath and the movement of your body. There are poses (which are called asanas) that can be tailored to those suffering from an eating disorder.These poses help you to sow the seeds of inner strength and explore your potential. One example of a pose is Goddess Pose, which is your legs bent, knees turned out, and arms up., You purge for psychological reasons, not because your body needs to do so. These psychological reasons can include anxiety, guilt, stress, and depression.When you have a pet to look after and care for, these feelings are often relieved because you are putting your energy towards loving and caring for another being. Pets are capable of altering our emotions and behaviors—the unconditional love of a pet is a powerful thing. Pets can also serve as a great distraction from the negative thoughts that lead to purging.If you can’t get a pet, you could consider volunteering at a humane society where you can play with the animals that also want love and affection.

Explore options for help.,
Talk to a therapist.,
Seek the help of more than one professional.,
Consider medication.",How to Stop Purging After Meals4," Understand that self-help alone may not be enough to overcome the desire to purge. Professional help, in combination with the other methods listed here, is the most beneficial way to overcome this condition. A professional can help you to create a plan tailored to your specific needs.Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective therapy modality for reducing purging behaviors.CBT is about changing your thoughts in order to change your feelings (anxiety, guilty, worry, depression) and behaviors (purging).

, A therapist can help you understand that purging is not the solution to resolve weight problems nor the right coping mechanism to deal with issues such as anxiety, depression, frustration, anger, hopelessness and low self-esteem. Therapists are typically non-judgmental and safe individuals to confide in regarding your purging behaviors.


You can look up a therapist that specializes in eating disorders online, or you can talk to a family member or trusted doctor who can help you to find someone that will fit your needs best.

, Your treatment does not necessarily need to consist of only one therapist. Many people who experience an eating disorder actually work with multiple professionals to help create a meal schedule and plan of action that works. These professionals can include:


Physicians, counselors, psychiatrists, psychologists/therapists, and nutritionists (dietitians).

, There are different medications, including antidepressants, that have been shown to reduce symptoms of binging and purging.However, medication is typically not enough to treat purging behaviors. The best treatment is usually a combination of medication and therapy.Consult with your medical doctor to get a referral to a psychiatrist in your area. Or, you can contact your insurance company or conduct an online search for low-cost mental health clinics in your area.
While, medical doctors (MDs, general practitioners) can typically prescribe medications for mental health concerns, psychiatrists are specifically trained in mental health disorders and specialize in these types of medications.

Avocado is a heart healthy-vegetables and this recipe will give you a serving of vegetables, making it a great alternative.Melt 1/2 cup of dark or semi sweet chocolate chips in the microwave for 30-60 seconds. Stir until they are all melted and smooth.
Scrape down the melted chocolate into a bowl of a food processor. Then add: four ripe avocados (chopped), 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1/2 cup of honey (more or less to your tastes), 1/2 cup of cocoa powder, a pinch of salt and 1/3 cup of low-fat milk.
Process the ingredients until they become smooth and creamy. Taste your mousse and adjust with seasonings if needed.
Spoon the avocado mousse equally between four small bowls. Refrigerate for at least three hours or overnight. Serve with a garnish of fresh fruit or mint leaves.
If you are preparing this for a child under 12 months, do not add honey. Spores that may be found in honey puts infants at risk for infant botulism, a serious and potentially fatal illness.;
, Instead of making a more traditional dessert — like pie — try making an easy and quick butternut squash pudding.Roast an entire butternut squash in the oven. Allow the squash to cool, then scoop out the contents and puree until it reaches a smooth and creamy consistency. You can also use 100% pure canned butternut squash if you'd like.
In the bowl of a food processor, combine 3/4 cup of your butternut squash puree with 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of maple syrup, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1 tsp of cinnamon, a pinch of salt and 1/4 cup of low-fat milk.
Scrape down the sides of the processor bowl and blend again. Then taste your pudding. Adjust for seasonings as needed. Refrigerate your pudding for at least two hours before serving.

, Although you'll be able to see the bright pink color in this sorbet, it's sure to excite anyone. It's naturally sweet and easy to make.Drain two 16 oz cans of canned beets in water. Chop beets roughly so they can be pureed in a food processor.
In the bowl of a food processor, combine the chopped beats, 1/3 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of apple juice and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of lemon juice. Puree the mixture until it becomes smooth and creamy in consistency.
Chill the beet sorbet for an hour in the refrigerator. Then, place the sorbet mixture in an ice cream machine and freeze per the manufacturers directions. Keep sorbet frozen until ready to serve.

, Make a higher fiber, higher protein version of brownies by adding black beans. They'll be totally concealed by the dark color of the brownies but not affect the delicious chocolate flavor.To start, preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease an 8""x8"" baking dish with butter or cooking spray.
In the bowl of a food processor blender, combine the following ingredients: three eggs, 1 can of black beans (rinsed and drained), 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup of cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) agave a pinch of salt, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of instant coffee powder. Blend until completely smooth and combined.
Pour brownie batter into the greased baking dish. Sprinkle over 1/2 cup of chocolate chips evenly over the top.
Bake about 30 minutes or until the sides of the brownies began to pull away from the sides of the baking dish. Allow to cool for 10 – 15 minutes before slicing and eating.
You can add 1/3 cup quick-cooking oats to this recipe for some additional fiber.

, If you're running out of ideas for dessert recipes, think about some of the classic dessert recipes that already feature vegetables. You can make these and have everyone enjoy a serving of vegetables. Try:



Pumpkin or sweet potato pie

Morning glory muffins (which generally contain shredded carrots)
Zucchini bread
Carrot cake
Rhubarb pie

, Although sneaking vegetables into a dessert is a great trick, not all vegetables are ""dessert-friendly."" Veggies that have a strong flavor or bitter flavor can be more difficult to hide.Go for naturally sweet vegetables like:


Butternut or acorn squash
Pumpkin
Beets
Carrots
Sweet potatoes
Zucchini
Beans
Avocado

, In addition to choosing a naturally sweet vegetable, also avoid vegetables that have a strong or bitter flavor. You may notice that you can still taste the vegetable even in a dessert recipe. Typically, you might want to avoid vegetables like:


Spicy and bitter dark greens like mustard greens, collard greens, arugula or dandelion greens
Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts
Asparagus
Onions and garlic
Eggplant
Radishes

, Beans are a unique and nutritious plant that is high in fiber, protein, and minerals.Their creamy consistency make them easy to sneak into desserts without anyone knowing the wiser.


Beans work great in desserts because they can be pureed or mashed into a creamy and smooth consistency. In addition, beans don't have a very strong flavor or a tough or crunchy texture that would make them noticeable in a dessert recipe. You can use white or black beans in recipes according to what the final product is.
Beans work well in recipes like cakes, brownies, and cookies. Once blended into a cake or quick bread batter, you'd never know they were there.

, You can make many more recipes with an avocado outside of guacamole. This creamy vegetable is full of healthy fats which makes it a great addition to many dessert recipes.


Avocado is a very nutrient-dense vegetable. It's known for being very high in many heart-healthy fats. It's also high in Vitamins E, C, K and the antioxidants lutein and beta carotene.It is also high in calories, however, so keep in mind it will make your dessert more nutritious, but not necessarily low-calorie.
Like beans, avocados can be pureed into a smooth and creamy dessert ingredient. Their healthy fats make them very rich and almost decadent which helps make any dessert feel a little more indulgent.
Avocados can be added to many desserts; however, their green color might show, so you may want to pick recipes that are chocolate based or are dark colored after they're baked or cooked. You can add avocados to homemade puddings, mousses and ice cream (especially chocolate) and they can even be added to baked goods like chocolate or red velvet cupcakes.

, Naturally sweet winter squashes (like butternut squash and pumpkin) are commonly found in desserts — especially in the fall and winter. Their sweet flavor pairs well with many dessert recipes and sweet spice mixes.


Winter squashes are known as very nutrient-dense vegetables. Their bright orange color signifies they are exceedingly high in Vitamin A. In addition, they're high in fiber, Vitamin C and beta carotene.Winter squashes need to be boiled or roasted and then pureed or mashed in order to be used in recipes; however, using 100% canned pumpkin or butternut squash works as well. They have a smooth and creamy consistency which works well in baked goods and as the filling of pies.
You can use winter squashes to make traditional pies (like pumpkin pie) but they can also be used to make puddings, muffins or quick breads.

, You may not think that summer squash like zucchini or yellow squash would work well in desserts, but both of these summer vegetables have very little flavor and can be shredded into a variety of desserts.


Neither zucchini and yellow squash are overly nutrient-dense; however, they're low in calories and contain a moderate amount of fiber and Vitamin C.If you want to use either zucchini or yellow squash, make sure to shred them finely and squeeze out any liquid before using.
They're great used in quick breads, muffins or cakes. You may want to consider peeling them to avoid seeing any flecks of green or yellow in your foods; however, adding chocolate to these dishes can hide any colors (like chocolate zucchini bread).

, Some common root vegetables serve well in desserts too. Foods like beets, carrots and sweet potatoes are naturally very, very sweet. They can be cooked and pureed and added to a variety of desserts.


Bright pink beets are full of vitamins and minerals. Beets are particularly high in some minerals like iron, zinc, copper and selenium.Both carrots and sweet potatoes are also quite nutrient dense. Both of these orange vegetables are high in beta carotene, Vitamin A, potassium, folate and Vitamin E.For any of these vegetables, they'll need to be boiled or roasted and then pureed in order to be used in desserts.
Beets in particular are great in brownies, chocolate or red velvet cupcakes, and even sorbet. Carrots are great in muffins and quick breads, while sweet potatoes can be used to make pie, quick breads or muffins.

, If you're trying to sneak in vegetables to an overly picky eater, you want to choose dessert recipes that will completely hide your veggie of choice. Even seeing a little fleck of green or orange can throw you or a child off. Go for recipes like:


Brownies or blondies
Quick breads and muffins
Puddings and mousses
Ice cream and sorbets
Pies and cakes

, To make recipes a little more nutritious and lower in fat, you can use pureed vegetables in place of the butter or oil in many recipes. This helps boost the nutrition and helps you meet your daily vegetable needs.


Many recipes that use pureed vegetables use the same ratio requirements that are recommended when using applesauce in recipes. It's a 1:1 ratio pureed vegetable to oil.For example, if your recipe calls for 1/4 cup of oil, you'll want to replace that with 1/4 cup of a pureed vegetable (like pumpkin).
Although this type of substitution does help improve the nutrition of a dessert, it will change the texture and flavor slightly. It's recommended to let baked goods sit to cool for a minimum of 10 – 15 minutes to prevent crumbling when they're sliced or cut.

, You might find it a little easier and more convenient to use pre-made vegetable purees. Try using canned vegetable purees or even pick up a few jars of baby food.


Many vegetable dessert recipes call for just a small amount of pureed vegetables. For example, a recipe may only call for 2/3 of a cup of pureed butternut squash. Compared to an entire butternut squash, this is just a small amount and you'll have a lot of leftovers.
To help you cut down on unnecessary leftovers, try using canned pureed vegetables. You can generally find items like sweet potatoes, pumpkin and butternut squash in canned form. Make sure you buy 100% pure canned vegetables — not a mix that has added ingredients.
You may also want to consider getting baby food as well. These come in even smaller amounts which can be helpful. In addition, you can find a huge range of options — anything from pureed peas, carrots to butternut squash.

, If you don't have an overly picky eater in the house, you might want to consider using shredded vegetables; however, these can contain a lot of liquid which you'll need to be careful of when you're cooking.


Vegetables that can be shredded and used in many dessert recipes — especially baked goods — include: zucchini, summer squash, carrots and beets.
These can be a great source of extra nutrition in baked goods, but also add a little moisture to your dessert items.
Some vegetables, like zucchini, need to be drained so you don't add too much extra liquid to your recipe. This is especially important for baked goods. Most recipes suggest squeezing fresh shredded vegetables in a clean dish towel until all the water is squeezed out.

,


You can be sure that a healthy weight loss plan will include fish. So you are bound to have similar meals from time to time. Try to vary the kind of fish, maybe test out different ones. You may find that you don’t like salmon but enjoy sole, or vise versa. Once at the fish counter, be sure to ask them questions. Find out the best way to cook specific fish and ask for small pieces of 2 or 3 different fish, cook them all at the same time and figure out which you prefer. The next time you go, tell them about your favorite and they will suggest other similar ones. And now that you’ve made a new friend, the clerk will always give you tips when he sees you.

, Vary it, between dark and light meat, maybe try different cuts of turkey like cutlets, tenderloin or even roast a whole turkey breast. Use rotisserie chicken when pressed with time, it’s flavorful and handy for quick dinners.

, Ask your fiends or order something different when eating out. While food shopping, ask the clerk or better yet, ask a customer who is picking up a vegetable you don’t know. I often have people ask me about all these different produce I have in my basket. People will gladly tell you about the taste and best ways to prepare produce. Or be adventurous, buy a vegetable you don’t know, make sure to get its name and once home search the internet for more information and how to prepare it. This may be an interesting project if you have kids, let them chose the “mystery vegetable”.

, A lot of people have difficulty drinking plain water and rely on diet drinks that may not be healthy and can become expensive on top of producing a lot of waste products. Get a home water filter of some kind and flavor it. Look for natural essences at the grocery store, like mango, mint, orange and if you want to be super cool add food coloring too.

, As a general rule, if you enjoy the smell of a food, you will enjoy its taste. If you see fresh planted herbs at the store, smell it or pick a leaf if you can. Better yet, if you are lucky enough to have a spice store near by, go in and ask questions and ask to smell or even taste. These people are experts and they will love giving you a “tour” with tips. You can have a little research project - search the internet for herbs and spices’ health benefits. Like this you can expand your kitchen repertoire while improving your health.

Look up the specific meat association’s websites like BeefWhatsForDinner for the best cuts to use depending on the cooking methods. These websites are overflowing with great information.

, So what it’s not five stars, you tried, you’ll tweak it and make it better every time you do it. Haven’t you seen all those food 911 type shows on the Food Channel? Besides wanting Tyler Florence in their home for a day, you can see that people are trying to improve their cooking skills. And if your family asks what it is, just make up a funny name so every one gets into the game. Go on, play with your food. It’s fun, delicious and you may find yourself enjoying it. If you decide to go on a weight loss diet, then you have to do your due diligence and see which weight loss program is right for you.

Go to your doctor.,
Set realistic goals.,
Assign yourself a rewards.,
Plan for lifestyle changes.",How to Set Weight Loss Goals1," Working with your doctor you can find out exactly how much weight you should be aiming to lose. In addition, your doctor will review any medications or current health conditions you have and determine the safety of weight loss for you.


Your doctor can also help you determine whether you're physically capable of strenuous exercises and workouts.
He may also be able to give you some basic tips on calorie counting and decide what will work best for you.;
, Whenever you're starting any weight loss program (commercial or your own), it's important to start by setting realistic goals for yourself. This will help you determine what type of diet, the length and whether or not you'll need to include physical activity. Goals that are too large or lofty usually lead to discouragement and may cause you to give up.


In general, it's not recommended to lose more than about one to two pounds per week.This is considered safe, realistic, and sustainable weight loss.
Diets that promise faster or more weight loss may not be safe and are generally not sustainable for long periods of time. Focus on smaller, more attainable goals.
If you have a lot of weight to lose, you may want to set multiple goals for yourself. You can have one long-term goal and a few little goals prior to it. For example: Lose 30 pounds in six months as a long-term goal. Short term goals may include: Lose five pounds in two weeks, 10 pounds in four to five weeks, etc.
Buy or make your own calendar to track your goals. Circle the day you plan to start and end your weight loss program. This way, you'll have a specific deadline to meet which will give you a path to follow.
You can also denote what days you're going to exercise by marking it on your calendar as well.
Post your calendar in a spot where you'll always see it and don't forget to do what it says. If it says you have to do cardio, do it.

, Setting up exciting rewards may help you stay motivated throughout your weight loss program. Ensure that these rewards are specific, special things you save for when these milestones are achieved.


Set up smaller rewards for when you meet your smaller, more interim goals. Have a larger, more gratifying reward for when you meet your larger, long-term goals.
It's generally not recommended to have rewards that are food related — like going out to dinner or having a dessert. Try to pick non-food related rewards like: a manicure, new shoes or a new outfit, a massage, a round of golf at your favorite course, or a new book.

, Whenever you're trying to lose weight, it's typically recommended to ditch the fad diets and instead make long-lasting lifestyle changes.


Small changes to your diet and lifestyle over a longer period of time has been shown to be easier to maintain. You don't want to make big changes quickly for weight loss. You're less likely to keep them up in the long-term.When you're designing your diet, don't go too extreme or follow a program that you know isn't realistic for you. You want to create a diet, eating pattern, or lifestyle that you can follow long-term.

Set your daily calorie limit.,
Measure portions.,
Choose a higher protein or moderate protein diet.,
Go for either a low-carb or moderate-carb diet.,
Emphasize fruits and vegetables in your meals.,
Drink hydrating fluids daily.,
Include regular physical activity.,
Consider commercial or supervised diets.",How to Set Weight Loss Goals2," Regardless of what weight loss plan you follow, you'll inevitably need to cut out calories to lose weight. Decide what total calorie intake you should be eating each day to help you safely lose one to two pounds per week.


In general, you'll need to cut out, burn off or do a combination of cutting out and burning 500–750 calories each day to result in that one to two pound weight loss.You can start by calculating how many calories you typically eat on a ""non-dieting"" day. Use a food journal app or online calculators to help you figure out this total. Subtract 500–750 calories from this number to get an idea of what your total daily intake should be.
There are also some online calculators or apps that can figure out about how many calories you should eat daily for weight loss based on your age, gender, weight, and activity level.

, To help you maintain a lower calorie diet, it will be helpful to stick to appropriate portion sizes for your meals and snacks. Serving yourself or consuming portions that are too large may slow your weight loss.


Invest in a food scale or a set of measuring cups to help you stay on track. Measure each meal and snack to make sure you're on target.
Make life easier by finding tupperware, bowls, dishes and cups at home that are a certain portion size. For example, packing your lunch in a tupperware container that is one cup in size.
Appropriate serving sizes for most foods are as follows: Protein: three to four oz, Fruit: 1/2 cup chopped or one small piece, Vegetables: one cup or two cups leafy greens, and Grains: one oz or 1/2 cup.

, Depending on what you choose, you'll need to decide whether you're doing a higher protein diet or moderate protein diet. This is the key to creating a plan that you can stick to without being hungry.


Some studies have shown that higher protein diets help you lose weight a little faster and help keep it off long-term.Eating a source of lean protein at each meal and snack is great for any weight loss plan. You may need to eat more than one serving at each meal if you're following a higher protein diet.
If you typically feel hungry when you've dieted in the past, consider following a higher protein diet. Increased amounts of protein have been shown to help you stay satisfied longer throughout the day., Diets generally fall into either low-carb or moderate-carb groups. Both have their advantages; choose what will work best for your lifestyle.


Low-carb diets have been shown to produce quicker weight loss initially compared to a moderate-carb diet.However, in the long-term, both low- and moderate-carbohydrate diets showed very similar weight loss overall.
Low-carb diets are more restrictive. If this is easy for you to follow and you do not miss carbohydrates, following a low-carb diet might be appropriate for you.
Some people crave carbs or feel they do better with weight loss when they include a moderate amount of carbohydrates each day. Again, choose what works best for you.
If you're going to limit carbohydrates, restrict your choices from the grain group first (bread, rice, pasta, crackers, etc). Most of the nutrients from this food group can be consumed from other foods. You may also choose to limit starchy vegetables (legumes, potatoes, winter squash, and peas) if you're following a low-carb diet., There are a variety of diet styles to choose from. However, most will emphasize that you eat several servings of fruits and vegetables each day.


Both fruits and vegetables are low-calorie and very nutrient-dense. They contain a large variety of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and a good amount of fiber.
Stick to one to two servings of fruit daily at a maximum. If you're choosing to follow a lower carb diet, you may choose to eat less.Aim for about five servings of vegetables each day. Again, if you're following a lower carb diet, you may choose to focus on non-starchy vegetables instead of higher carb vegetables (like potatoes, peas, or carrots).

, One very important component to all weight loss plans is adequate consumption of water and other hydrating fluids. This will help support general health, but may also help manage your appetite.


A good rule of thumb to begin with is to drink eight glass of water daily. However, you may need up to 13 glasses daily. This will depend on your gender, weight, and physical activity level.Consider purchasing a water bottle to help keep track of your total fluids throughout the day.

, If you're interested in losing weight, you may also want to consider including regular physical activity into your week. Keep in mind that changing your diet and also starting an exercise regimen all at once can be daunting. Try changing one thing at a time.


Studies have shown that regular activity will help support weight loss and long-term weight maintenance.It's recommended to include 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week and two days of about 20 minutes of strength training each week.If you haven't been participating in regular physical activity, start slowly. Work up to the recommended amounts of time over a few weeks or months.

, If you don't want to come up with a diet plan by yourself, you may choose to follow a commercially available or supervised diet program. Or you may choose to base your own diet off of one of these:


Try low-carb/high-protein diets. Some commercial programs focus on very low-carb and high-protein eating patterns. These may result in quicker weight loss, but are typically hard to follow long-term due to their overly restrictive nature.
Consider low-fat diets. This particular eating pattern focuses on limiting the fat content of your diet. Specifically, most low-fat diets limit trans and saturated fat but also give you limits for heart healthy fats.Follow a Mediterranean-style diet. The Mediterranean diet is an eating pattern that focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and smaller amounts of animal protein (like beef or poultry). This diet has been shown to be a healthy option for those with cardiac health problems.Look into medical weight loss programs. Medically supervised diets are facilitated by doctors and dietitians. They may have you follow a restricted meal plan or use high-protein, low-calorie meal replacements for a short period of time. In addition, they may also use prescription medications and/or vitamin injections and supplements to help suppress appetite and increase energy.

Start a food journal.,
Reevaluate your plan each month.,
Build a support group.",How to Set Weight Loss Goals3," Keeping a journal can be a great component of your weight loss program. It can provide you with the ability to track a variety of factors that may be able to keep you on track long-term.


Studies show that people who track their food are more likely to stick to their diets and maintain their weight loss long-term.So no matter what diet you end up following, track your food for the best chance of success.
You can also track your progress as well. Keep a weekly log of your weight and total weight loss.
Also consider making notes about what's working and what's not working about your diet. When the time comes to reevaluate your diet plan, review your notes and make any necessary changes.

, Whether you follow a commercial diet or your own plan, it's important to reevaluate your progress regularly. This will help you determine if your plan is appropriately working for you.


Consider your weight loss. Weigh yourself weekly and then tally up how much you've lost over the entire month. If you're doing well, you may choose to continue with your current plan. If you haven't lost much weight, you might need to take a look at your food diary or calorie levels and adjust as needed.
Also consider how easy your plan has been to follow. Have you been physically satisfied with your meals? Are you feeling hungry throughout the day? Are you having a lot of cravings? Make changes to your dietary intake as needed.

, Find a support group while you're trying to lose weight and when you're trying to maintain your weight loss and healthy lifestyle. Having a support group may help you keep your weight off long-term.


Many studies show that those people who relied on a support group of either friends, family members or other dieters, were more successful and were able to keep their weight off long-term.Talk to your friends, family members or coworkers about your new diet. Ask if they'd be willing to join you.
You can also find support groups online or find ones that meet in person.

Don’t buy junk food.,
Stock the fridge with healthy alternatives.,
Prepare three solid meals a day for him.,
Eat at home more often.,
Walk after dinner.,
Join a fitness class together.,
Go salsa dancing.,
Turn the TV off.,
Stop smoking.,
Cut back on the alcohol.,
Be a teacher.",How to Put Your Husband on a Diet Without Him Knowing It," In addition to having limited nutritional value, junk food often contains too much fat and too many calories, sodium, and sugar.If you’re not the primary grocery shopper, you may want to consider temporarily taking over the responsibility. It’s important to get your husband into healthy eating habits by steering him away from junk food. Doing so, begins at the grocery store with the choices you make. If you’re not buying it and bringing it into the home, then your husband won’t have junk food readily available!


If there’s already junk food in the home, consider bringing it into work or hiding it until your husband can manage his portions better. Don’t forget to raid your freezer for things such as ice cream and frozen pizzas.
Remember that beverages can be junk food as well. Soda or other beverages high in sugar shouldn’t be brought into the home.
Your first few trips to the grocery store might take a bit longer than usual, as you should familiarize yourself with ingredients before adding items to your cart.;
, Inevitably, your husband will notice that the junk food is gone. You’ll want to have some healthy snacking options available to him instead. Replacing junk food with healthier alternatives that still satisfy your taste buds is key to making the switch.If your husband likes the crunch of chips, try purchasing apples or snap peas. Maybe he has a sweet tooth and tends to snack on ice cream. Replace it with frozen yogurt. Think of what it is he likes about junk food and try to consider that when you’re buying alternative snacks.
Frozen grapes, baby carrots and plain almonds are quick and easy snacks to stock up on. The more readily available the snack is, the better. If you buy fresh fruit, cut it up and place it in a bowl in the fridge.
Get creative with meal substitutions. For example, if your husband enjoys mashed potatoes, try substituting them with mashed cauliflower. Pork and beef can be substituted for turkey products and scrambled eggs can become scrambled egg whites.

, While you may not be in the habit of doing so, making meals for your husband is extremely important. By preparing a healthy breakfast, packing his lunch and putting dinner on the table when he gets home, you’re helping to improve his diet. This will prevent him from making unhealthy choices throughout the day, such as eating fast food or stopping for a donut on the way to work.


If making lunch for your husband doesn’t fit into your busy schedule, consider giving him leftovers. It’s easy to throw last night’s dinner into a container, along with a few pieces of fruit and a handful of almonds. This will provide him with the nourishment he needs throughout the day.
For breakfast, try having yogurt or oatmeal on hand. Cereal that isn’t high in sugar is fine as well. You don’t necessarily need to make your husband breakfast, unless you notice that he is skipping your healthy alternatives, in favor of a trip to the bakery. If that happens, try making him a smoothie to go or have a homemade yogurt parfait ready to eat in the fridge.

, People who cook at home tend to consume fewer calories, carbohydrates, sugar and fat than those who rarely or never cook.While you can find healthy options at most restaurants, nothing beats a home cooked meal. Save your money and the calories and choose to dine in more often!


Portion control is an important aspect of eating at home. Preparing meals at home not only encourages portion control, but is helpful in combatting overeating,as restaurants typically serve large portions and multiple sides.
Try coming up with a meal plan at the beginning of the week and shop accordingly. If you’re pressed for time, having a plan in place for the week will help make dinner preparation a breeze.
If you need recipe ideas, try searching on websites such as Pinterest.

, Start small in introducing your husband to exercise by asking him to take a walk with you. Walking after dinner can do wonders for your health.It will also give you both the chance to talk and unwind after a busy day.


Try going for a short walk at first and work your way up to longer walks.
You don’t have to power walk in order to enjoy the benefits of an after dinner stroll.

, Though he may not be inclined to do yoga or Zumba, find a fitness class that the two of you can do together. It might even be an activity such as tennis that finally gets him excited about exercising. One piece of advice is to have him think back to something he loved as a kid and to try it again.Choose activities your husband enjoyed when he was younger and try to incorporate that into your fitness plan.


To avoid giving yourself away, tell your husband how much you’d like to play doubles tennis, but haven’t been able to find a partner. Or ask him to teach you to do something he used to love such as basketball.
Get certified in wall climbing and try something new together!

, Although it may not seem like the obvious exercise choice, on average you can burn between 175 and 250 calories for every 30 minutes of Latin/Salsa dancing.In addition to the health benefits, you will bond as a couple in attempting to learn the moves.

, The decisions you make directly impacts your spouse. If you opt to turn the TV off at night and go for a walk or play with the dog, your husband will follow suit. In addition to being a passive activity, marketing/advertising on the TV features a range of unhealthy food products, which negatively impacts a person's purchasing habits.Start small by creating a “no TV” rule one night a week. Choose a night and stick with it. Gradually work your way up to two or three nights a week.
Try playing a game instead.

, If either you or your spouse smokes, take the lead and quit! Not only is smoking bad for your overall health, but it affects your ability to absorb crucial vitamins and minerals such as calcium and vitamins C and D.In short, smoking effects a person’s diet and nutrition as well.


In case you need more convincing, heavy smokers are often heavier than light smokers or nonsmokers., Drinking and snacking go hand in hand. Whether it’s a handful of peanuts at the bar or a piece of pizza later in the night; drinking promotes unhealthy eating habits. Then there’s the unnecessary calories to consider when drinking. If you use only four ounces of a sweetened mixer, it can contain up to 25 grams of carbs. Richer drinks, such as a mudslide, can contain over 500 calories.Buy light beer instead. Ultra, low carb beer contains about 3-4 grams of carbs per bottle/can, compared to the 10 grams found in a regular version.If you do plan on having a cocktail, order a water as well. A good rule of thumb is to alternate water and your cocktail to ensure you've drank 12 ounces of water for every alcoholic beverage consumed. This may help to reduce your alcohol consumption by half., At the end of the day, you can do everything for your husband - meal preparation, grocery shopping, etc.; however, he still has to commit to putting in work as well. Be a good teacher and show him how to do things, whether it's meal substitutions or buying healthier options at the grocery store, make sure your husband can support his new lifestyle on his own.


Have him help with meal preparation and choosing recipes for the week.
Be a good support system for him, but remember that he is the one who ultimately needs to do the work!

Be aware some foods have to be verified.,
Look for other gluten-free products.,
Avoid processed foods.",How to Start a Gluten Free Diet1," The first step for immediately removing gluten from your diet is to clean out your pantry. You need to get rid of everything that contains gluten.


If you share a house with people who eat gluten, then label foods as ""gluten"" and ""gluten-free."";
, Most processed foods or foods that come in a package contain gluten. A good way to immediately get rid of gluten is to fill your plate with fresh foods. This includes vegetables, fruits, meat, and gluten-free grains, like rice and quinoa.These foods don't have gluten, so you are safe when you eat them.

Enjoy your new eating style.",How to Make the Diet Work," You have to forget that word if you really want to enjoy your new eating style and actually make it work. For now on you will talk about it as your healthy eating plan. This way you will remind yourself every time that it is not just about getting sexier but getting healthier.;
, Really, don’t. If you really want to make it work you need to know that no one can live just from water or fruits. You have to eat, and when I say eat I mean really eat, but of course I'm not saying you should go out now and eat three pounds of ice-cream. Here are some things that you should have in your healthy eating plan:


Protein: Eat meat, chicken or pig. If you are a vegetarian there is always another kind of food that can give you the protein you need, like gluten for example. This kind of food is perfect for lunch time, but if you want to add some protein to you breakfast, you can have in mind some other types of food that are rich in proteins like milk.
Fruit: You can always have some fruit at breakfast or mid-morning. They will give you some extra energy and they taste really nice and sweet.
Carbs: Stop being afraid of carbs. You have to eat some carbs in other to maintain your body working right. Add some bread to your breakfast or a small cookie to your meals. It will keep you active and won’t hurt if you don’t eat a lot of it.

, You can keep on eating; you only have to reduce the quantity of food you regularly eat. Try not to exceed your consume. Remember, we eat so we can keep on living, food is like gas to our bodies, so you don’t have to eat every-time you feel bored or every time you get anxious.

Go for screening blood tests at the recommended frequency.It is recommended that children get their cholesterol first screened between the ages of nine and 11, and then again between the ages of 17 and 21.,
Return for repeat testing of your cholesterol if and when any problems are identified.,
Use your blood test results as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment for high cholesterol.,
Keep your good cholesterol above the target range.In order to effectively monitor your cholesterol levels, it is key to know what results you are aiming for on your blood tests.,
Monitor your bad cholesterol to ensure that it stays as low as possible.Opposite to the good (HDL) cholesterol, you will want to keep your bad (LDL) cholesterol as low as possible.,
Take note of your total cholesterol and of your ratio of total cholesterol to good cholesterol.In addition to measuring your good (HDL) cholesterol and your bad (LDL) cholesterol, your blood test results will also inform you of your total cholesterol (TC).,
Pay attention to your triglycerides.,
Increase your aerobic exercise.Aerobic exercise is anything that elevates your heart rate for a continuous period of time, such as swimming, biking, jogging, or brisk walking.,
Improve your diet.Specifically, you can increase your consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, increase fiber through whole grains and whole fruits and vegetables, and decrease your consumption of fats and refined carbohydrates.,
Lose weight.Being overweight or obese is in itself a risk factor for elevated cholesterol.,
Begin a cholesterol medication such as a statin.If lifestyle measures alone are insufficient to reduce your cholesterol levels, your doctor will likely advise that you begin a statin medication such as atorvastatin (Lipitor).,
Opt for additional medical treatments if needed.If the statin medication is causing you adverse side effects, there are other medical treatments that you can try instead.",How to Monitor Your Cholesterol Levels," Assuming the initial childhood cholesterol screens are normal, people are advised to return for screening blood tests to check their cholesterol levels every five years thereafter.


For instance, if you go for a blood test at 36, your next test for cholesterol should be at 41, and so on.However, if you have a family history of high cholesterol, increased risk for heart disease, or other personal risk factors that may predispose you to elevated cholesterol, your doctor may ask you to return for screening at more frequent intervals.;
, In addition to routine screening for elevated cholesterol every five years, you will need to come back for more frequent monitoring if any problems are identified. For example, if your LDL (bad) cholesterol is on the high side, your triglycerides are elevated, your total cholesterol is elevated, or your HDL (good) cholesterol is too low, your doctor will likely recommend some form of treatment or lifestyle modification and then repeat blood tests to see if your cholesterol levels improve.


Your doctor may order a fasting lipid panel to try and get the most accurate data. For this test you will have to fast for up to 12 hours, as your triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels can change based on what you have recently consumed., The level that changes most with fasting status is the triglycerides.One of the key reasons that a doctor will order blood tests for cholesterol is to evaluate how the treatment of your high cholesterol is going. If you are diagnosed with high cholesterol, your doctor will likely begin you on a three month trial of ""lifestyle changes"" (unless your levels are very high, in which case medication will likely also be needed). Lifestyle changes typically include increased aerobic exercise, a diet higher in fruits and vegetables and lower in fats and refined carbohydrates, and steps to achieve weight loss as all of these are correlated to an improved cholesterol profile.


After a three month trial of lifestyle methods, your doctor can re-measure your cholesterol and evaluate the degree of improvement.
If your cholesterol has improved substantially and if you are back in the normal range, your doctor may advise that you continue with lifestyle modifications and you may not need medical treatment.
If, on the other hand, your cholesterol levels are still elevated, this would be an indication to begin medical treatment.
Repeat blood tests can then be taken every few months as you begin the medication to monitor its effectiveness and to screen for side effects, as well as to determine the dose that you need in order to get your cholesterol levels back in a healthier range.

, Good cholesterol (called ""HDL cholesterol"") is, perhaps ironically, a type of cholesterol where the higher your numbers are, the better.


Above 60 mg/dL (1.5 mmol/L in Canada and Europe) is considered the ""best"" range for your HDL cholesterol.
Between 50 – 59 mg/dL (1.3 – 1.5 mmol/L) is considered ""better.""
Below 40 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) in men and below 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in women is considered ""poor.""

, The target range that you should be aiming for depends on your overall health, and any other cardiovascular risk factors that you may have.


Below 70 – 129 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L – 3.3 mmol/L in Canada and Europe) is considered the best range for your LDL cholesterol (the specific ""target value"" for you, given that this is a broad range, depends on your overall health and other risk factors for heart disease and stroke).
Between 130 – 159 mg/dL (3.4 – 4.1 mmol/L) is considered ""borderline high.""
Between 160 – 189 mg/dL (4.1 – 4.9 mmol/L) is considered ""high.""
Above 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) is considered ""very high.""

, It will also provide you with your ratio of total cholesterol (TC) to good cholesterol (HDL). It is important to know your target ranges for each of these quantities.


Below 200 mg/dL (5.2 mmol/L in Canada and Europe) is considered ""desirable"" for your total cholesterol (TC).
Between 200 – 239 mg/dL (5.2 – 6.2 mmol/L) is considered ""borderline high.""
Above 240 mg/dL (6.2 mmol/L) is considered ""high.""
In terms of your ratio of total cholesterol (TC) to good cholesterol (HDL), a ratio above six is considered high risk.The lower the value for your ratio of TC:HDL, the better this is for your health.

, Triglyceride is a fat commonly found in the body that contributes to atherosclerosis, which is the accumulation of fat on your artery walls. This increases your risk of heart attack and stroke.It is essential to keep your triglyceride levels within a healthy range to reduce your cardiovascular risk.

Below 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L in Europe and Canada) is considered ""desirable.""
150 – 199 mg/dL (1.7 – 2.2 mmol/L) is considered ""borderline high.""
200-499 mg/dL (2.3 – 5.6 mmol/L) is considered ""high.""
500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and above is considered ""very high.""

, Try incorporating aerobic exercise at least five days per week for 30 minutes or more per session to improve your cholesterol. Note that you should always consult your doctor for a health check prior to commencing a new exercise plan.

, It also helps to choose healthier fats (such as the fat found in avocado, nuts, and fish) and lower glycemic index carbohydrates (such as whole grain breads, oatmeal, and quinoa).


Increase intake of omega 3 fatty acids (found in flaxseed oil, fatty fish like salmon, chia seeds, walnuts, and broccoli) to lower triglycerides. Try to eat at least two servings of fish per week or fish oil supplements.

, Losing weight has been shown to improve your cholesterol profile. Therefore, it is helpful to talk to your doctor about how many calories you should be eating daily, and how much exercise you should be doing, in order to optimize your weight and to get it closer to your ideal body weight for your specific height and build. Note that it is key to lose weight in safe ways, and not to starve yourself in the process.

, This medication works to improve your cholesterol; however, there are also some side effects to be aware of.


The main side effects that may occur with a statin medication are liver problems and/or muscle soreness.
Your doctor will test your liver function at your next appointment (following the initiation of the statin) to ensure that it is not causing any problems.
Tell your doctor about any muscle soreness you are experiencing due to the medication.

, These include bile-acid-binding resins, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, and/or injectable cholesterol medications.

Be aware of negative thought patterns about food.,
Disassociate food with certain activities.,
See bad eating in terms of a habit rather than calories.,
Seek support.,
Set small, realistic goals.,
Prepare a food journal.,
Plan your meals.,
Picture yourself thin.,
Pay attention to concrete behaviors.,
Hold yourself accountable.,
Consider planning a weekly cheat meal.",How to Mentally Prepare for a Diet," Oftentimes, diets fall apart because of negative thought patterns regarding food and eating. Try to be aware of your own thoughts in regards to food and how you should strive to change those thoughts.


Many times people feel special occasions mean it's okay to overindulge. There's nothing wrong with overeating now and again, but be honest with yourself in regards to what you see as a special occasion. When things like eating out, working lunches, office parties, and other small events become an excuse to overeat this can sabotage diet plans. Try to reevaluate how you define special occasion.Do you use food as a reward? Many people feel that, after a long day, they deserve take out dinner or a bowl of ice cream. Try to find means to reward yourself other than food. Treat yourself to a nice, hot bath. Spend some money on a new outfit. Watch a movie. There are many ways to reward yourself without using food.;
, Food is heavily linked to ritual. It can be hard to pass up sugary or fattening snacks if we emotionally associate them with certain rituals. Make a conscious effort to disassociate food with certain habits.


Try to be aware of when you overeat or ingest unhealthy food and drinks. Do you always get popcorn and a soda at the movies? Do you always have a few glasses of wine on date night? Can you not imagine a Saturday morning without coffee and donuts? If so, work to break these associations.Try replacing unhealthy foods with other associations. For example, play a board game on date night instead of chatting and drinking. Have fresh fruit and yogurt with your Saturday morning coffee. If you unwind by eating at the end of the day, try reading a book or listening to music instead., In the long run, you're more likely to stick to a diet if you address negative habits rather than solely restricting calories. Try to be aware of when and why you're eating. Even if it's just half a cookie, are you indulging because you've had a long day? Are you eating out of boredom and not hunger? If so, try to break out of the habit. Even if you're not going overboard on calories, it's the principal of the thing. You're eating the wrong foods for the wrong reasons., Change is hard. You cannot do it alone. Seek support from friends and family members. Tell them you're trying to lose weight and ask for their help. Ask them not to invite you to parties where junk food or alcohol will be served. Ask them if it's okay to talk to them when you're feeling frustrated or tempted. Talk to household members about your goals. Request that they keep tempting foods out of your sights.Talk to your doctor and get a referral to a registered dietitian. These professionals can help you strategize and come up with a diet you can stick to. They can help you make a meal plan, offer encouragement, and ensure you are getting enough nutrients while you diet.

, Many people sabotage diet and weight loss plans by setting their expectations far too high. If you want to stick to a diet, keep your goals realistic.


Keep in mind most people on a healthy diet lose 1 to 2 pounds a week. If you want to lose more than this, you may be setting yourself up for failure.Set specific goals. That way, you'll know when you've met those goals and will be motivated to keep going. Goals like, ""I will eat vegetables every day this week"" and ""I will order a salad instead of french fries when I eat out this month"" are good starter goals that set you up for success.A goal like

, Part of sticking to a diet is accountability. Go out and buy a journal to use as your diet journal. Record everything you eat every day and count up the calories. Physically seeing how much you're consuming forces you to confront your habits. This can help motivate you to revamp your eating habits.You can also use apps that you can download to your smartphone to conveniently track calories, exercise, and even water intake. Download one of these apps, such as MyFitnessPal or SuperTracker, and familiarize yourself with how to use it.

, Meal planning in advance can help cut back on cravings. In the days leading up to the start of your diet, make a list of healthy meals you want to make. Try doing some food prep. That is, cutting up the necessary ingredients ahead of time. You can even make a large batch of something like soup or a salad to have for lunches for the first week.

, Try to picture a thinner version of yourself. Many people are less likely to indulge on their diet if they have a clear picture of where they want to be. If you're striving to get back to a previous weight, it may be helpful to print out pictures of yourself when you were skinnier. Leave these up around your house for inspiration., Increasing your willpower can be difficult if you're working in abstract terms (like ""be healthy"" or ""lose weight.""). Addressing concrete behaviors can help you strengthen your resolve over time.


Make a list of concrete behaviors you want to change. Start with small alterations. Try to stick to altering these behaviors for a week or two and then move on to the next alteration to your regimen.For example, say something like, ""Today, instead of watching a movie after work I will take a 40 minute walk."" Hold yourself to that for a week. In the next week, increase the duration of your physical activity. Walk for, say, 60 minutes instead., Even if you have to be hard on yourself, you need to hold yourself accountable for lapses in willpower. This helps you acknowledge you're the only one who has the power to change your behaviors.


Acknowledge when you failed in one of your goals. Write it down in diet diary. Take responsibility for your failure.Write out why you failed in terms that make your self disappointment clear. For example, write something like, ""I chose to eat cake when eating out tonight because I wanted to feel good in the moment instead of waiting for the delayed gratification of meeting my caloric goals for the day. I felt negatively later on."" While it may seem harsh, many people find it helpful to spell out failures. It motivates them to make a greater effort to change., Many people find having a weekly cheat meal helps their diet seem feasible. Depriving yourself too long can result in your diet completely unraveling. Sticking to a strict diet can seem more doable when you know you have the food you've been craving waiting for you at the end of the tunnel. If you think it might benefit you, consider adding a cheat meal to your routine."

Get medical support.",How to Maintain Ideal Body Weight," There are many formulas that can be used to calculate your ideal weight. One of the simplest is the HAMWI formula, which is used for adults over 5 feet tall. For men, the formula is 106 + 6 lbs for every inch over 5 feet. For women, it's 100 + 5 lbs for every inch over 5 feet. Add 10% if person has large frame, subtract 10% if person has small frame. If you're unsure, assume a medium frame, and make no adjustment.So, a man with a medium frame who is 6'2"" would have an ideal weight of 190 lbs (106 + 84 lbs = 190 lbs).

You can also calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) which can help you decide if you should lose weight or maintain your current weight. To calculate your BMI, you’ll want to divide your weight in kilograms by the square of your height in meters.To calculate using pounds and inches, divide your weight in pounds by the square of your height in inches and multiply by a conversion factor of 703.There are several reliable online BMI calculators, including through the Mayo Clinic: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/in-depth/bmi-calculator/itt-20084938. Once you know your BMI, you can compare it to what is a normal BMI for your age, height and gender.
Keep in mind that these calculations are very broad and do not take into account that muscle weighs more than fat. For instance, many professional athletes would be considered obese based on their BMI because they have more muscle, which increases their weight on the scale.
Instead of getting hung up on a number, ask yourself: ""What weight is healthy for me and also allows me to be mentally and physically at my best?"" Figuring out what it realistic and healthy for you is more important than trying to hit some magical number.;
, To make sure you are eating the right amount of calories, you will want to determine your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). Your BMR determines the amount of calories your body needs to function while at rest, and knowing your numbers can help you ensure that you are not eating too many (or too few) calories.

To calculate your BMR, you’ll need to calculate the relationship between your weight, height, and age. For men, use the following equation: 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (years) + 5. For women, use: 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (years) – 161.
You may want to use an online calculator, such as the one at the Mayo Clinic: http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss/itt-20084941


, Once you have determined a healthy weight and how many calories you need to eat to lose weight, you’ll want to ensure you are not eating too many or too few calories. If you're eating more calories you're burning, you can either add workouts to your day, or cut back on the number of calories you eat. If you're burning more calories than you're eating, then you need to exercise less or eat more.


Count your calories. Make a note of what and how much you eat, and then look up the caloric value for those foods.Add them up to see your total daily caloric intake. You can use a pen and paper or an app like MyFitnessPal or the SuperTracker from choosemyplate.gov.
Ensure that the calories you are eating come from nutritionally dense foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole-grain carbohydrates. Choose a variety of foods from each food group to ensure you are getting enough nutrients.These foods will give you increased energy, added vitamins and minerals, and you can eat more of them, while staying within your daily caloric requirements., Your weight is linked to your emotions about food and exercise. View food as energy and as a path to achieve good health, have more energy, and improve your overall quality of life.Exercise can help boost your mood, combat disease, and improve your energy levels.Using food as a coping mechanism can make you feel worse and derail healthy weight management. Find other ways to meet your emotional needs, such as getting a massage, spending quality time with others, buying a new outfit, or a fun activity. , If you are above or below your ideal weight, make a realistic plan to achieve the outcome you want. Focus on taking small steps, such as eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day.Track your achievements, exercise, and calories. Keeping a record can help you see patterns over time and allows you to make necessary adjustments., Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity per day, though you may need more depending on your goals for reaching your ideal body weight.Find exercises that you enjoy. Activities like swimming, gardening, walking, bike riding or dancing all count. These can be a fun and pleasant way to burn calories and stay fit, and you’ll be more likely to stick with your routine., Drinking enough liquids (especially water) is critical to maintaining overall health, but also may help you reach your ideal weight.Drinking water may increase how many calories your body burns for at least an hour.Staying well-hydrated helps your muscles and heart work more efficiently., People who are successful at maintaining their weight monitor their progress and step on the scale regularly.If you note that your weight has gone up or down, you can take steps to remedy it, such as increasing or decreasing portion sizes or modifying your exercise routine.


Keep a health journal. Writing down your food and activity ensures that you are tracking how you are meeting your goals., On average, the less people sleep, the more they weigh.Sleeping enough hours per night is an easy way to maintain your ideal weight, while also being a key part of an overall healthy lifestyle.Most adults need seven to nine hours of quality sleep on a regular schedule each night.When you are tired, you may be more likely to reward yourself with food. , Getting regular physical activity will help you maintain your ideal weight, while also lowering your risk for diabetes, heart conditions, strokes, and certain cancers.Staying sedentary harms your metabolism and makes you more likely to gain excess weight, even if you are not eating more.Simple changes can help you get more activity in your day such as taking the stairs, sitting less, parking your car further away, or taking a daily walk., Eating the same types of food each day is better than eating more on weekends, holidays, or other special occasions.Don’t skip meals. This can slow down your metabolism and you’ll burn fewer calories at rest.Keep healthy snacks on hand. You’ll stay satisfied without adding too many calories., Savoring each bite of your meal will help you feel satisfied and fuller longer.Put your fork down between bites, chew slowly, and sit at a table to eat. These changes can help you become aware of physical hunger and satiety cues.Practice shopping smart at the grocery store. Plan ahead, bring a list, and avoid shopping while hungry.This will help you choose healthy foods and avoid bringing home non-nutritious foods such as cookies or soda.
Cook healthy recipes at home. Restaurant food is often salty, fatty, and highly caloric. Preparing food in your own kitchen can help you develop healthy habits at meals and consume the right number of calories for your body., There will inevitably be setbacks or interruptions to your routine, so be prepared. Weight maintenance is a long-term commitment.Make a plan if you know that your health routine for weight maintenance will be challenged or interrupted. Feeling like you are in control can help you overcome discouragement and keep you motivated., Part of maintaining your body’s ideal weight is knowing what is realistic and attainable. View yourself as a whole person and appreciate all that your body can do, instead of focusing on physical faults.A negative body image can impede your weight goals and lead to other serious health consequences, such as developing eating disorders or mental health issues.Remember that health is more important than appearance. Drastic approaches to achieving an unrealistic weight are harmful to your emotional and physical health., Asking a friend or family member to partner with you on your health goals can help you stay accountable.Social support is a key strategy in reaching and maintaining the weight that is best for your body.Choose a partner who shares the same goals for weight maintenance that you do, and have regular meetings.
Online communities can be a great source of social support for maintaining weight loss. Seek out groups in which you can share healthy eating and exercise tips., Take an active role in managing your overall health.Maintaining your ideal weight requires making good decisions and taking charge of your diet and fitness level.Stay accountable through keeping the big picture in mind, and setting permanent objectives for your weight and health..

, Keeping weight off after losing it is a tough task. Enlist your physician and other health professionals in helping you manage your weight.Get regular check-ups and discuss your weight with your doctor. They can advise you on healthy habits, and ensure that you don’t have any health problems that may make it more difficult for you to lose or maintain weight."

,, Don't forget to also add what kind of exercise you did and for how long, and anything else about your day that is relevant.

, just divide the page into 4 equal sections with pen and use smaller writing. This helps you get an overview of your progress. Alternatively, you can choose to have one page devoted per diet day if you want, so you can make more entries, (e.g., emotions, exercise etc.).

, On your main calendar page, total up the total number of calories/kilojoules/points at the end of the week. Also record your weight. Once you get a whole book filled, you will see how many calories/points it takes to maintain a certain weight, and you can see the weeks where you have lost or gained weight. You may also learn the triggers that cause you to eat more or less food.

Take an hour or two of your free time and write up your ideas for all meals and snacks.
Try tallying up all the food groups for each daily meal plan. Did you include dairy each day? How about enough fruits or vegetables?
If you're busy or on the go, plan for meals that are quick, require little cooking or recipes that you can freeze for easy-to-prepare meals.
Search online for sample meal plans and inspiration.;
, Stocking your kitchen with healthy foods from each food group will help make preparing balanced meals and maintaining a balanced diet easy. After you write up your meal plan, make time to go grocery shopping to stock up on a variety of your favorite healthy items.


A well-stocked pantry can be a great tool for maintaining a balanced diet.Stock up on shelf-stable foods for quick and easy balanced meals: canned beans, no-salt-added canned vegetables, canned tuna or chicken, 100% whole grains (like quinoa, 100% whole wheat pasta or brown rice) and nut butters.
Stock up on frozen items like: frozen vegetables (without sauces or seasonings), frozen fruit, frozen pre-cooked grains (like brown rice or quinoa), low-calorie frozen dinners (for busy nights) and frozen proteins (fish or chicken).
Keep a supply of fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy (like low-fat milk, yogurt and cheese and lean proteins (chicken, fish, pork or lean beef).

, Keeping a food journal can help you maintain a balanced diet in two ways. First, it can help you review your current diet and allow you see what areas your diet is lacking. And second, it's a great method to keep you on track long-term.Purchase a journal or download a journaling app on your smartphone. Track as many days as you can. Pay attention to the 5 food groups - are you consuming all of them each day?
We are often unaware if we are eating too much or too little of something. A food journal can bring this information to light.
When first starting, note where you think you can make improvements or better choices. For example, you're not a big vegetable fan and you typically skimp on this group, or you eat a lot of the same foods each week without much variety.

, Speaking to a doctor or registered dietitian can help you tailor your balanced diet to your personal health and medical history. They may be able to provide you with additional guidance or recommendations to improve or maintain your current health.


Speak with your primary care doctor. Your doctor is most likely aware of your health and medical conditions and may be able to give you general recommendations for certain foods or a diet pattern that can help you achieve not only a balanced diet, but one that may improve your overall health. They may also be able to refer you to a local dietitian for additional help.
A registered dietitian is a nutrition expert that may give you a ton of guidance on balanced diets and healthy eating. They will be able to educate you on the benefits of a balanced diet, show you where your diet is lacking and be able to give you a meal plan and tips to help you reach a more balanced diet.Visit the EatRight website and click on the orange ""Find an Expert"" button on the top right to search for a dietitian in your area.

, One of the cornerstones to eating a balanced diet is consuming foods from each of the five food groups: protein, vegetables, fruits, dairy and grains. Each food group offers different vital nutrients that your body needs. Aim to consume something from each group everyday.


Protein is essential to all cells and processes in your body – anything from building and repairing tissues to making enzymes, hormones and other chemicals.Ideally, choose lean protein foods like: poultry, eggs, lean beef, seafood, nuts and beans.
Dairy foods also contain protein, but are known for being high in calcium, potassium and vitamin D.Choose low-fat dairy products like yogurt, milk, cheese or kefir.
It can be beneficial to purchase a food scale to know exactly how many ounces of meat you are eating. You can also learn little tricks by looking online. For example, 3 oz of meat is about the size or a deck of playing cards.
Fruits and vegetables are two food groups that offer a host of nutrients like: vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants. They are also low in calories which makes them an essential component to a balanced diet. Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables each day.
The grain group can be split into two separate groups: whole grains (like brown rice, quinoa or oatmeal) and refined/processed grains (white bread, white rice or plain pasta). Aim to make at least half of all your grain choices 100% whole grain. These types of grains are high in fiber, protein and other essential nutrients.It can be difficult to have all five food groups present at each meal. Strive to consume foods from each group throughout the day. It's not necessary to consume all five at each meal.

, Some types of fat are known as ""heart-healthy"" or omega-3 fats and monounsaturated fats. These have been shown to have some health benefits including: maintaining or improving blood lipid levels or supporting the brain development of infants.It's recommended to consume a serving of these healthy fats at least 2-3 times weekly.Foods that contain omega-3 fats include: salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines, tuna, walnuts and flaxseeds.
Monounsaturated fats come from foods like olive oil, avocado, olives and hazelnuts., A balanced diet goes beyond just the foods in your meals. You also need to balance the amount of food you consume throughout the day. It's beneficial to consume regular, frequent meals throughout the day.


Eating three or more meals a day or including snacks makes it easier for you to consume all the recommended amounts of essential nutrients you need each day. Skipping meals puts you at risk for not being able to consume what you need.Regular, frequent meals and snacks provides a steady flow of energy to your brain. The fairly even blood sugar level helps your brain function well.Skipping meals on a regular basis is not recommended. You do not necessarily need to eat ""breakfast, lunch and dinner"" daily. However, eating every three to five hours is recommended.An example of one day of balanced eating may look like: scrambled eggs with vegetables and cheese for breakfast; whole wheat wrap with lean turkey and cheese and 1 cup baby carrots for lunch; a small apple and a cheese stick for an afternoon snack; and large spinach salad with raw vegetables and 4 oz grilled salmon for dinner.

, A minimum of eight glasses or 64 oz of clear, sugar-free liquids is essential to a balanced diet. Just because liquids don't necessarily fall into a food group, doesn't mean they don't play and essential part in your diet.


Choose liquid like water, iced tea, decaf coffee or no-calorie flavored waters.
Purchase a water bottle to help you monitor the volume of liquids you consume throughout the day.

, Consuming adequate portions of all foods is important to a balanced diet. It will make sure that you're eating enough of certain food groups and also not eating too much of others.


In general, portion sizes of fruits and vegetables can and should be larger compared to servings of items like grains. These low-calorie, nutrient packed foods should make up about 50% of your meals and snacks.Foods from the grain group like pasta, rice or bread should be monitored. It can be easy to overdo it from this group, which can throw off the balance of your diet. 1/2 cup of grains like rice or pasta is a serving and 1 oz of items like bread is also 1 serving.Dairy and protein based foods offer a lot of nutrition and should be consumed at most meals and snacks. Consuming 3-4 oz protein, 1 cup or 1 oz of dairy foods are appropriate portion sizes., Foods that are high in sugar and high in fat are generally also high in calories. In addition, they're generally not very high in nutrients like vitamins and minerals. Eating too many of these types of foods can make it difficult to maintain a balanced diet.


Maintaining a balanced diet does not mean avoiding favorite items like sweets or high fat indulgent foods like macaroni and cheese.
Choose these foods in moderation and enjoy them occasionally and in portion controlled servings.
Decide what moderation is for you. It may mean splitting dessert every Friday night or going out to your favorite burger place twice a month.

, Drinking liquid calories is a common way to throw off a balanced diet quickly. They're high in calories and sugar and can rapidly increase your total intake of sugar. Monitor how often and how much you're consuming items like: beer, wine, mixed drinks, sodas, sweetened tea or juice.


Although 100% fruit juice does have some nutritional benefit, juice still contains a relatively high amount of sugar and should be consumed in moderation. Drink four to six oz occasionally.Skip sodas and sugary drinks. If you still need the caffeine, consider coffee or tea with skim milk and limited sweetener.
Limit alcoholic beverages as well: one drink or less daily for women and two drinks or less daily for men.An occasional glass of wine or sweetened tea is OK. Again, it's important to enjoy these items in moderation.

, Exercise is an important part of a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Although it doesn't necessarily affect your diet, regular physical activity can help maintain your weight and health when you occasionally indulge in favorite foods.Aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio activity each week.Exercises like jogging, biking and swimming are good options.
Aim to participate in strength training at least two times a week.Lifting weights or going to a Pilates class are good options.

Realize what causes you to give up.,
Analyse your current diet plan to offset boredom.,
Have faith in the outcome.,
Be patient and expect gradual change, not instant perfection.,
Avoid fast results.",How to Kickstart Your Diet Regime," Psychological issues like boredom, lack of faith in the process, lack of patience, or conversely, really fast results can all have the effect of making you lose interest in your diet programme.;
, Look at what you are hoping to achieve with it eg. a specific daily calorie intake, an increase in the use of certain food groups i.e., fruits / vegetables / low-carb etc and then redesign your current diet so that you still achieve your daily goals but in a different way

, Lack of faith is a consequence of not seeing any results or anticipated results. This is best counteracted by examining all aspects of your health since you started your regime, for example, you may discover that although no significant weight is displaced that you have clearer skin, more energy etc. key indicators that your food intake is having a most beneficial affect on your body.

, Lack of patience is a difficult one, we are living in a world of instant gratification so after a few weeks on a diet regime we expect to be super-slim. Whatever you've achieved should be celebrated. Take your time. Three to six months is a small investment in the rest of your life. The rule is be good 80% of the time. In that way, you can still live a normal life but not revert back to old bad habits all the time.

, Fast results can ironically make us all take our foot off the pedal. A month of being focused can bring some good sold results that lull us into the belief that we can revert to old habits because we have come so far so fast. Adopting an approach of moderation can help maintain the success and keep the momentum ticking over before you start Phase II.

Eat breakfast every day before school.,
Pack a full water bottle.,
Put healthy snacks in your school bag.",How to Maintain a Healthy Diet at School (Teens)1," Go for yogurt with fresh fruit like strawberries or blueberries and granola, or a bowl of wholegrain breakfast cereal that is low in sugar with low-fat milk. Starting the morning off with a meal also signals the metabolism to rev-up, creating a calorie-burning, fat-burning environment for the rest of the day. Remember that what you eat at breakfast will impact your cravings for the rest of the day. Choose proteins, whole grains and healthy fats.


You can also have eggs and multigrain toast or a breakfast smoothie with a frozen banana, berries, water or coconut milk, and honey.;
, Sugary soft drinks and sodas will only lead to a temporary sugar high and a poor diet. Substitute sodas and fruit juices with a water bottle full of filtered water. Add a slice of lemon, lime, cucumber, or orange for all natural flavor. Put the full water bottle in your school bag so you have it ready when you’re thirsty at school., Wrap an apple and a banana in a paper bag and put it in your backpack in the morning, or put a few sugar free granola bars in your bag. This way, when you’re hungry between periods you have healthy snacks rather than processed snacks from the vending machine.Focus on foods that do not need to be kept cool. Sometimes a cold pack can be used, but to eliminate the chance of food-borne illness, choose foods that are shelf-stable and can easily be carried around throughout the day.
You can also prepare healthy snacks the night before by cutting up fresh fruit and packing it in tupperware, or putting trail mix in ziploc bags. Stash them by the front door so you can grab them in the morning or pack them in your school bag.

Prepare some topics on which you can speak well.,
Prepare some short stories about yourself.,
Be informed.,
Get feedback from trusted people.",How to Make a Good Impression When You Have an Intellectual Disability," Knowing the causes helps to plan ways to overcome or compensate for intellectual disability. Do you have a brain injury? Might your problems be due to a genetic trait? Are you under stress? Do you have clinical depression? Maybe you do not have any disability; you only feel intellectually inadequate?;
, If you have physiological, medical, psychiatric problems that are holding back your intellectual abilities, get help! Get checkups and tests. Ask for help from doctors, psychiatrists, counselors, knowledgeable people; read books to understand your condition.

, Here are some easy things you can do on your own, without any special tools or materials, to project yourself as an intellectually normal person.

, Role models are people who you would like to be similar to. Watch and listen to people on TV, radio, videos who behave the way you would like to be. Read books that describe characters that are the way you would like to be. They are your role models. It will take a few weeks for you to find role models that you really like. You can change them, or choose different models for different audiences. For example, you can have a set of role models for interacting with your friends and family; different role models for people at work and still others for strangers or people you want to impress.

, Saying only 'yeah' or 'nah' or 'uh-huh' makes people think you don't understand the topic or have nothing to say, or don't want to talk to them. Instead, you can say ""That's fine,"" or ""I understand,"" or ""I agree"" instead of ""OK.""

, People who are witty or ironic are often thought to be intelligent. Pay attention to what your role models say that are funny or ironic, or how they pick out funny or ironic topics to comment about. Remember some GOOD JOKES about common topics; make sure not to use any jokes that insults or belittles people.

, Pay attention to how your role models use words. Look up words, phrases and idioms that they use so that you will use correctly. Using the language incorrectly makes the user sound uneducated or foreign. But using big or unusual words could make you seem to be an over-compensating pseudo-intellectual, a fake. Using domain-specific phrases and idioms correctly, such as ""a bear market suppresses equity values"" for economics or ""RBI is a good way to rate a batter"" for baseball makes you seem knowledgeable.

, Do they start with a very short summary of their point, then add details? Do they start with a description of their thinking such as ""This is just an idea...""? Sometimes, intellectual people start with framing statements such as ""If we are talking about then..."" or ""If you agree that..."" Practice using the same types of sentences, phrases and idioms that your role models do.

, Look at the way your role models carry themselves. Most likely, they have good posture and hold their heads so that their chins are level with the floor. They look into the eyes of people they are talking to. They use gestures to illustrate or add emphasis to what they are saying such as extending an open palm when asking a question. They project self confidence.

, A neutral expression is a good default expression. A slight smile might let people know that you are friendly and open to connecting with them. Try to react to what other people are saying with a small nod, tilting your head sideways or smiling, or looking as if you're thinking it over.

, Most people love to be paid attention. When it is your turn to talk, ask a question about something they said such as ""You mentioned . Please tell me more about that."" Such a question reassures them that you heard what they said and it gives them another chance to talk.

, They don't have to be intellectual topics. They can be about your hobbies, places you've been, sports, a TV program, a historical event or a current news story. Prepare up to 5 sentences on a topic so that you are ready when you have to talk. You can start with ""I think is interesting because..."" Don't forget to ask questions.

, People are interested in other people's lives but make sure your stories are a little bit interesting and not at all embarrassing to you or to other people. For example, it would NOT be good to say ""I have to go to the bathroom every hour."" It's very common to tell people about your hometown such as ""I grew up in Atlanta so my accent is Southern, not Texan,"" or ""My favorite hobby is...""

, The best way to seem intellectually normal is to know what's going on in the world. You can do this by listening to what your role models and friends are talking about, following people on Twitter, ""Liking"" Facebook pages on subjects that interest you so you get new stories on that subject, or watching a national newscast, reading the headlines of newspapers or magazines or domain-specific webpages.

, Ask some trusted family members or friends, or professional such as counselors to let you know whether what you're doing is working. Ask them to tell you what you should do more of, less of, or something new that you should consider doing.

Eat fortified foods.,
Eat foods that naturally contain supplements.,
Take multivitamins if you consider that you have deficiencies in your regular diet.",How to Incorporate Supplements Into a Vegan Diet," Vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium, and iron can all be found in a variety of vegan foods. Common plant-based fortified foods may include non-dairy milks, meat substitutes, tofu, certain cereals, orange juices, and nutritional yeasts.;
, Iodine can be found in iodized salt. Omega-3 fatty acids are included in flaxseed oil, ground flaxseeds, olive oil, and canola oil.Iron and calcium are found in a variety of foods including but not limited to green leafy vegetables, whole grains, and some herbs.Protein naturally occurs in nuts, seeds, and legumes.

, You may wish to discuss this with your doctor first. There are many vegan multivitamins, which can provide the most commonly taken vitamins and minerals. They are also sold individually, and you can mix and match in virtually unlimited combinations.

Create a meal schedule.,
Pack your lunch the night before.,
Go for healthy options if you leave campus for lunch.,
Don’t skip a meal.,
Ask your parents if you can help with the cooking.",How to Maintain a Healthy Diet at School (Teens)2," Spend some time planning out your meals with a parent or guardian to ensure you have three meals a day, every day. Focus on lunch meals that are easy to transport, pack well, and are filling, but still healthy.Get a dry erase board or use a word processing program to make a grid for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. Then, write the days of the week that you go to school, usually Monday-Friday.
Work with a parent to come up with basic meals for a quick breakfast, a healthy and easy to carry lunch, and a filling dinner.
You can also use an app on your phone like ZipList, Evernote, and Pepper Plate to create a meal schedule and a shopping list for the grocery store., Making your lunch the night before should be part of your routine, and shouldn’t take longer than 30 minutes. If a parent usually packs your lunch, get involved and help him organize the meal and put it in containers or resealable bags.


Use leftover food from dinner or from a big batch of prepared food in a different ways, such as leftover BBQ chicken in a wrap or leftover vegetables on whole wheat pasta.

, Choose restaurants with quick and healthy options. Avoid most fast food restaurants or choose the healthier item if you find yourself at one. Choose salads, wraps, or deli sandwiches.


If your friends have a soft spot for fast food, look for the healthier food choices on the menu, like the vegetarian option or a sandwich with a side of salad instead of french fries.

, Skipping meals signals the metabolism to slow down and burn fewer calories. This is not ideal during a long day of sitting in a classroom. The ideal situation would be to signal the body to ramp up the metabolism and keep it high with healthy, timely snacks throughout the day.

, Get involved in preparing food and working with your parents in the kitchen. Learn how to cut vegetables properly and how to treat raw food. Ask you parents questions about cooking and preparing food so you can practice your cooking skills.As you help prepare meals, think about healthier ways to make certain dishes. For example, baking or steaming fish instead of frying it, or replacing red meat with other protein options like baked tofu.
Helping to cook meals will also allow you to control the portion size on the plates. Limiting your portion sizes to no more than a handful of each dish or type of food will ensure you do not overeat.

Look for fruit and vegetable options.,
Remember that most quick, fast options are laden with salt, sugar and fat.,
Load up on grains.,
Look for healthier drink options.,
Limit your portions.",How to Maintain a Healthy Diet at School (Teens)3," As of 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued new standards for school lunches, which increased the amount of fruits and vegetables served, emphasized whole grain foods, allowed only low fat and nonfat milk, and reduced saturated fats and sodium. By law, your school should offer a daily serving of fruits and vegetables, fresh or in a fruit or veggie cup without added sugar.If your school offers fruit juices as a beverage, they must be 100% juice, with no added sugar. They may also offer dried fruit options.
There should be vegetables available in the form of dark leafy greens like broccoli, or spinach, red or orange veggies like carrots or sweet potatoes, and beans or peas like kidney beans or lentils.
If starchy foods like corn or white potatoes are served, there should be no added salt. Beans and peas may also be offered as meat alternatives for vegetarian eaters.

, It is possible to find healthy options in schools, but the best option is always packing a balanced lunch. According to a report by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, the five worst meals you can eat at school are:Beef and cheese nachos, which contain 24 grams of fat and almost 1,500 milligrams of sodium
Meatloaf and potatoes, which contain 72 calories and 78 milligrams of cholesterol
Cheeseburgers, which have more saturated fat than a child should consume in an entire meal
Cheese sandwiches such as grilled cheese sandwiches and cheese quesadillas, which contain more than 7 grams of saturated fat and almost 1,000 milligrams of sodium
Pepperoni pizza, which contains more than 6 grams of saturated fat; pepperoni is a processed meat that increases cancer risk

, Schools in the U.S. are required to serve whole grain options for lunch every school day. These include rice, quinoa, and/or couscous. Look for these healthier grain options in place of carb-heavy foods like bread or pasta.Schools are also required to offer meat alternative foods, like tofu or soy yogurt, which can be a good way to get protein without loading up on red meat.

, There should be 100% fruit juice available at your school during lunch time, as well as milk options like fat-free or low-fat, with no added sugars or flavors. Your school should offer at least two types of milk, as well as fruit juices.Try to avoid sugary drinks like soda or fruit juices with added sugar from the vending machines at school.

, Portion control is an important way to maintain a healthy diet at school and to ensure you are getting all the nutrients and energy you need for the day. Divide your plate into four sections, with dairy (in the form of fat-free or low-fat milk) on the side. Your plate should be balanced with four types of food: fruits, vegetables, grains, and protein like meat, beans, or tofu.You should have about one cup of grains like rice or pasta, and one cup of vegetables and fruits. Clench your fist and place it over your plate. These portions should be no bigger than your clenched fist.
The meat or protein portion should be about as big as your palm.
Added fats like butter, mayo, or salad dressing should be the size of the top of your thumb.
None of your food should overlap or be piled high. There should be a small amount of space between each of the four food groups.

Choose brands that have ingredients that you recognize as food.,
Keep it simple.,
Skip low-fat, fat-free and sugar-free versions.,
Make your own ice cream with healthier ingredients.,
Make ice cream from bananas.,
Make sure you know about portion size.,
Plan ahead.",How to Include Ice Cream As Part of a Healthy Diet," If the ingredient list reads like a chemistry lab experiment, you may want to look for a product that contains more real food and fewer chemicals. If this is not always possible, at least be aware of the limitations of these “unnatural” foods with regard to your health, and use them consciously and sparingly.;
, Generally, the simpler versions of a food will contain fewer additives. For example, if you like to go out for ice cream, a dish of vanilla ice cream will have fewer additives than when it is enhanced with toppings and flavorings. The same applies if you buy ice cream at the grocery store. You will need to read the label to be sure, but generally look for plain flavors such as vanilla in a good quality brand that uses basic ingredients and add your own high quality toppings at home.

, These products are adulterated with chemicals to make up for the loss of flavor and texture.

, In the “olden days,” making ice cream at home was an occasion. You can recapture the fun by breaking out the hand crank freezer or the more modern electric or pre-frozen canister versions. You will find that ice cream you make yourself tastes better and because it requires time and planning, it will not be something you do every day, making it unlikely that you will overdo.

, This is a much better option than binging on fat-filled store bought ice-cream.


Cut 2 bananas into slices and freeze until completely frozen (about 2-3 hours; it's easiest if you put the slices in the freezer the night before you plan on making it).
Put the frozen banana slices in a blender.
Add 2 tablespoons (if wished, you can vary this amount based on how thick you want the ice cream) skim milk, soy milk, or any milk of your choice. (If you want a little more flavor, add peanut butter, or cocoa powder––just remember you are adding on the calories.)
Blend until it turns to ice-cream consistency. Serve immediately.

, The serving size established by the FDA for ice cream is ½ cup. You need to be aware that this amount (and only this amount)will supply the calories, fat, etc. that are listed on the label. Just once, take a half-cup measure and see what a serving really looks like in your bowl.

, Going out for ice cream is often part of summer festivities with family and friends. You can be part of the fun and still be healthy, if you decide ahead of time what you will have. Many ice cream stands have a web page that will tell you what is in their products, but failing that, you know you are pretty safe if you keep it simple by choosing a small vanilla cone or a scoop of chocolate or strawberry ice cream in a dish. In this way, you can satisfy your desire to stay healthy without missing out on a great tradition!

Select hearty, wholegrain cereals and proteins to get the metabolism machine running first thing in the morning.,
Enjoy a good fat-burning drink of green tea.,
Reach for nutrient dense, protein packed snacks during the day.,
Designate lunch as your powerhouse meal.,
Consider dinner to be an ideal time to gather the family for rousing conversation and a healthy meal.",How to Incorporate Fat Burning Foods Into Your Diet," Numerous research studies have shown that skipping or skimping on breakfast can actually contribute toward weight gain because those who skip breakfast tend to eat more later in the day (in order to compromise for the missed meal). Foods to consider first thing in the morning include:


Oatmeal (porridge). Oatmeal is rich in fiber, filling and can contribute toward equalizing your blood sugar due its slow release of energy, which helps fat loss. It's also good at helping reduce cholesterol levels and for getting rid of bad fatty acids. Select wholegrain, rolled oats that are unsweetened for added vitamins (and preferably, use organic sources). Make the oatmeal with milk, which contains calcium, itself acting as a good metabolic trigger. The complex carbohydrates help keep insulin levels low, which reduces the amount of fat which your body clings on to. Make your oatmeal even tastier by adding a dash or two of cinnamon, thought to stabilize blood sugar levels and even reduce your appetite.
Eggs. Nutritionists say that the body burns more calories digesting eggs than it does consuming a carb-heavy (cereals) breakfast. At only 75 calories per egg and 7 grams of protein, eggs may be one of the ideal ways to start your day, providing you with choline via the egg yolk, which can increase fat loss. Author of The 4 Hour Body Timothy Ferriss, considers that eggs are an important fat-burning addition to the diet.;
, Studies suggest that green tea has a positive effect on boosting the metabolism thanks to the phytochemical compound, catechins, with the most abundant catechin being Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). This chemical helps you to burn more calories. It works in a similar way to caffeine but without making your heart beat faster.


Drinks like coffee which contain caffeine also help you to burn more calories by speeding up your heart rate. Bear in mind that sweetening your coffee or adding milk, cream or other coffeehouse inspired delights will counteract this.

, Although that bag of chips in the vending machine may be calling your name, resist the temptation and make a better choice. Remember that the type of fat you consume matters and fats mutated during manufacturing are not your healthiest bet. Snacks to grab mid morning or afternoon include:


Greek yogurt. Lower in sugar and packed with more protein, Greek yogurt is a great source of nutrition and energy. According to sports nutritionist Leslie Bonci, MPH, RD, protein is the way to go if you want to burn more calories and drop weight. “Protein takes longer to leave the stomach,"" she says. ""That keeps you satisfied longer."" Plus the body has to work harder to burn protein than carbs, which can produce more weight loss.
Water-based fruit. Try watermelon, berries, grapes, grapefruit, pears or apples for a snack. In addition to getting your vitamins and minerals, fruit is full of water and is low in calories and it keeps you feeling full, which fits perfectly into your weight loss goals.
Raw vegetables. Low in calories and fun to crunch, partner a dish of carrots, celery, raw zucchini or radishes with your favorite low calorie dip for a mid morning or afternoon snack.
Roasted or raw almonds. Packed with protein, a handful of almonds is known to stave off hunger for a considerable amount of time. Just don’t eat more than a handful because almonds (and nuts in general) are high in calories.
Air-popped popcorn. Although eating three cups of air-popped popcorn may seem like a lot of food (especially when you see it sitting in a large bowl) it’s actually extremely low in calories, but will fill you up because it’s loaded with fiber.

, Instead of focusing on dinner as being the only time you include protein, make sure both protein and healthy carbs play a part in your midday meal. Metabolism boosting foods to add to your lunch repertoire could be:


Tofu. Not the “traditional” protein, however University of Illinois researchers believe that low-calorie vegetarian protein sources like tofu and tempeh boost the metabolism. It's recommended that you avoid processed soy products though––stick with the healthier tofu and tempeh versions of soy.
Chicken or turkey. Chicken and turkey are high in protein, which helps boost the metabolism, as well as helping bulk muscles if you exercise. Steer clear of the chicken nuggets and go for the real deal. Select a lean cut that can be grilled or baked and leave the skin in the garbage. Partner a grilled chicken breast with a side salad and some couscous for a well-balanced (calorie shredding) lunch.
Salad. Select greens that contain plenty of nutrients such as spinach or arugula and partner with other crunchy veggies and a protein (such as a hard boiled egg or grilled chicken or steak). Not only can you glean protein from a spinach salad but you can also obtain almost an entire day’s worth of vitamins and minerals. Use caution when choosing and adding salad dressing––pick something low calorie (such as olive oil and vinegar) and ask to have it “on the side” so you can control how much goes on the salad.
Tabouli. Although usually added to the salad family, tabouli can be served as a main course or as a side. Tabouli is high in protein and fiber. Nutritionists say that tabouli is low in calorie but satiates the body quickly thanks to its bulgur wheat base.
Soup. Skip cream based soups and try a clear broth with chicken and vegetables or even a cold soup like gazpacho. Experts say that soup is a great choice for lunch because it is water based, which can fill you up using fewer calories. Add more nutrients to your soup by substituting chicken or beef broth with tomato juice or V-8. Add chicken or turkey, your favorite vegetables and your stomach will feel full for hours without having to consume many calories.

, Incorporating a variety of metabolism boosting foods during dinner is important, however researchers at Rutgers University found that families who ate a well-balanced, home prepared dinner together were less likely to be obese or overweight. Items to include in your meal include:


Any lean meat. If your kids like steak, select a flank steak, eye of round or top sirloin that contain less than 4 grams of saturated fat per serving. Nutritionists suggest sticking with a 3 to 4-ounce portion.

Pork is also a good source of protein. The more protein you eat, the more work your body will have to do to digest it. Keep the pork lean, stay away from the BBQ sauce, instead grill it with herbs, or other low fat seasoning.
Red meat from animals raised on grass rather than grain are high in Omega 3 fatty acids, which will lower your Leptin hormone levels giving you a higher calorific burn. It also contains healthier fat and more vitamin E. But keep it lean! There are many ways to season red meat without going for sticky, high fat options.


Fish. Experts say that fish is one of the best sources of protein and studies have proven that fish is more satisfying than chicken or beef. One reason why fish is often a preferred is because it contains health-protecting, omega-3 fatty acids, known to fight heart disease and other chronic illnesses. Salmon contains lots of Omega 3 fatty acids. This can alter the amount of the hormone Leptin in your body. Lower leptin levels mean higher calorific burn. Grill it or BBQ it to keep it low fat.

Tuna. Research has shown that tuna can be effective in lowering the hormone Leptin levels. Grilled tuna steak is good for BBQ's or a nice low fat meal, or for a cheaper option eat it in a sandwich with whole grain bread.


Beans. According to sports nutritionist Leslie Bonci, MPH, RD, beans provide a “triple punch” because they are a vegetable, a protein and a great source of fiber. One cup of beans contains 12 grams of fiber, 4 grams of fat, and 15 grams of protein.
Quinoa. Vegetarians have sworn by this protein-based grain for years because it contains 8 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber in one cup. Additionally, quinoa contains nutrients like iron, zinc, selenium, and vitamin E.

Rather, try limiting them to a certain number of times a week. One or two times a week is usually a good place to start. That way, you can still have the foods you love, but they won't ruin your healthy diet., Often, people do not have a good idea of what a serving size of a particular food is. That can lead to overindulgence. Make it your mission to learn portion sizes for various foods that you eat, so that you can still eat them without going overboard. One way to learn portion sizes is to read labels and then measure out your food, but you can also learn some basic rules for portion size.For example, a typical serving of meat is about 3 ounces, which is about the size of the palm of your hand. A serving of peanut butter is about the size of your thumb.
For cheese, use your pointer finger to measure; the serving should be about the same size. A serving of milk or yogurt is about one fist.
For pasta, think a handful, while a slice of bread should be the size of your hand and a serving of cereal should be about one fist.
A serving of fruits or vegetables is generally one fist, with the exception of salad greens, which can be two fists., Instead of snacking from a huge bag or bowl, try putting a single serving in a smaller container. Then, put the food away so you're not as tempted to take more. Similarly, you can use a smaller plate at meals to keep you from overeating (and to trick your brain into thinking you're eating more than you actually are). Doing so is a simple way to enjoy a food you like while making sure you don't mindlessly overindulge., To make servings easier on yourself, try taking a large bag or container and portioning out several small containers. That way, it's ready to go when you want to eat some, and you don't have to think about portion size.For instance, if you buy a big bag of pretzels, try portioning it out into small plastic bowls or bags so they're ready to go when you need a snack.
This advice works well for healthy snacks, too. Try cleaning and chopping portions of vegetables, so you can easily grab them when you're hungry.

, If your favorite food is something you eat out, consider only eating half of it. You could split it with a friend, for instance. You could also ask to have half of it boxed up to take home before you even start eating. Either way, you'll be eating a more reasonable portion., The first task in losing weight is figuring out how many calories you need to just sustain your weight. Then, you can figure out how many you need to eat to lose weight over time. Your needed caloric intake is based on your weight and your activity level.If you are mostly inactive, you should multiply your current weight (in pounds) by 11. That will give you the number of calories you need to sustain your weight. So if you weigh 200 pounds, you need 2,200 calories a day to sustain your weight.
If you have a moderate activity level, you should multiply your weight by 13. So if you weigh 200 pounds, you need 2,600 calories a day to sustain your weight.
If you're very active, multiple your weight by 15. If you weigh 200 pounds, you'll need 3,000 calories a day to sustain your weight.

, One pound is equal to 3,500 calories. To lose a single pound, you need to reduce your caloric intake by 3,500 calories each week through diet and exercise. Aim to lose about 1 or 2 pounds a week by reducing your daily intake by 500 to 1,000 calories.Always consult a doctor or dietitian about your caloric intake, as you don't want to go too low or miss out on essential vitamins and nutrients. For women, the lowest you should go is 1,200, while for men, the lowest you should go is 1,500.

, Once you know how many calories you need in a day to lose weight, you can figure your favorite foods into that calculation. For instance, if you decide you want to eat a brownie one day, subtract that from your overall caloric intake. You'll need to eat fewer calories elsewhere to compensate.For instance, if you're supposed to eat 1,500 calories a day and the brownie is 300 calories, that means you only have 1,200 calories left for other foods.

, While counting calories can be beneficial, it's also helpful to focus on healthy calories. If your favorite foods are high calorie, you're going to find it harder to stay full on fewer calories. Make sure the main part of your diet consists of low-fat proteins (fish, chicken, low-fat dairy, egg whites, legumes), whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy. Emphasizing vegetables and fruits especially will help you keep your diet healthy and low-calorie., Counting calories isn't everything. In fact, exercise is equally important in your quest to lose weight. Each week, you should do a combination of aerobic exercise and strength-training exercises to build muscle and burn off calories.You should either do 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week or 75 minutes of intense activity. However, you may need to do up to 300 minutes of moderate activity for weight loss.
For moderate activities, you can try walking or swimming. Even housework can be considered a moderate aerobic activity if it is strenuous. For something more intense, try things like running, using an elliptical machine, cycling, or dancing.
For strength training, you can lift weights, use resistance machines, and carry groceries, just to name a few.

, Some foods you love are likely in-between meal snacks, which is fine. However, make sure you're eating when you're actually hungry, rather than just when you're bored. Also, stop when you're full, even if it's before you finish the portion you've laid out.Savor what you're eating. It can be tempting to just gobble down your favorite food. However, then you'll be tempted to get a second helping. Instead, take time to really slow down and enjoy it. You'll feel more satisfied, and you won't be as tempted to get more.Try not to eat with the television on or while you're playing on your phone. Pay attention to your food so you can truly enjoy it.
Take the time to really chew your food, so that the flavor lasts. Plus, taking longer to eat gives your stomach a chance to catch up and single that you're full.

, Drinking water can give you a feeling of fullness that helps you cut down on calories. Try drinking a glass of water before you sit down for a meal, particularly a meal where you're indulging in some less healthy options. Doing so can help you keep your portions under control.

, One option to still eat things you love is to make simple switches to make them healthier. These small changes likely won't make a big difference to the flavor, and you'll still get the enjoyment of eating the food.For example, if you enjoy eating macaroni and cheese, try making simple switches like choosing whole-wheat pasta, swapping one percent milk for whole milk, using a lower-fat margarine instead of butter, and using a lower-fat cheese.
Similarly, if you love burritos, try making burrito bowls instead. Load up on fiber-rich options like black beans, brown rice, sautéed onions, cilantro, and salsa, then go light on toppings like cheese. You can also use chicken instead of beef and choose fat-free sour cream instead of full-fat.

, Even if you don't want to make some of your favorite foods healthier, you can add other healthier foods to go with them. For instance, if you want pizza, don't just fill up a huge plate with slice after slice. Add a side of broccoli and a small salad, so you fill up on those foods while still enjoying your pizza., That is, rather than eating when you're stressed, try other activities, such as exercising. Exercising will help you de-stress and lose weight. You could also try other stress-relieving activities, such as meditation or yoga.If you're feeling very stressed, try some deep breathing. Take a moment to close your eyes, and then breathe in for four counts. Hold your breath for four counts, then breathe out for four counts. Repeat until you feel yourself calming down.

, Fiber is a great way to fill yourself up and eat healthier. When eating your favorite foods, try including fiber in them so you feel fuller faster, keeping you from eating too much. Fiber is mostly found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and beans.For example, if you love chicken and gravy over rice, try using brown rice instead of white rice, as brown rice is a whole grain and has more fiber. Also, you could sneak in some riced cauliflower into your brown rice, adding some vegetables.

, Another way to fill up on your favorite savory foods and stay healthier is to include some lean proteins. Lean proteins are foods like skinless chicken, fish, legumes (peas, beans, and lentils), low-fat dairy, and egg whites.Protein doesn't digest as quickly as carbs, keeping you fuller for longer.
For example, if you want to eat quesadillas, try using less cheese and adding a lean protein to make it healthier.

Yoga can help you develop better coordination, improve posture and breathing, and can also be very relaxing. It is also a form of exercise.See if your local gym offers yoga classes or find some yoga videos online.;
, Dyspraxia can also affects you mentally, and you might feel that your thoughts are often jumbled or disorganized. Meditate to combat this and to stay present and mindful in the moment. Meditate on a word, quote, or mantra that soothes you like “peace” or “steadiness.”, Exercise can also help to improve your dyspraxia. Hit up your local gym and lift some light weights to begin building your muscle strength. Though you may eventually want to use larger weights, do so with caution. Have someone to spot you just in case your muscles give way.Most gyms offer different weight machines that will make it easy for you to lift without having a spotter, as well.

, In addition to exercise and yoga, sports are also a fun way to grow stronger and more coordinated. Play sports like soccer, basketball, or tennis to help improve your motor skills while having fun and interacting with others.Check online to see if there are any local teams that you can join or play with your friends or family.
Take breaks when you get tired. Don’t give the sport up if you feel that you are not doing well, however. If you enjoy it, continue playing.

, Having dyspraxia often means that you might need a bit more organization in order to have a productive day. Utilize planners, calendars and alarms so that you don’t forget your responsibilities. You can set up alerts on your phone to remind you of any projects, assignments or tasks that you need to complete., In addition to keeping a planner, also consider keeping a to-do list. At the end of each night, write down everything that you need to do the following day. Put it beside your bed or on your desk so that you don’t forget about it. This will help ensure that you are organized and that your responsibilities are in order., Though large projects or new skills might seem difficult, breaking them into smaller tasks can make them seem less intimidating. For instance, cooking a meal can seem daunting, but it is really a series of several small and simple parts. Write down these list of small parts and then put it all together.For instance, if you are looking to cook rice, you will first have to find a pot. Then go to the sink and fill the pot about halfway with water from the tap. Then you will put the pot onto the stove. Turn the burner on. Add rice. Set a timer. When the timer goes off, turn off the stove. And then enjoy your meal!

, In addition to writing out a task step by step, you can also watch videos to help you learn basic motor coordination skills. Search YouTube or other websites for videos on how to do things and then mimic the actions from the video.You can also pause it when necessary or restart it if you get confused.

, Another issue you might be having in living with dyspraxia is self care. Search for tools like blowdryers with attachments that will make it easier to dry your hair. You can also purchase electric toothbrushes or razors. Find other low maintenance items that you can use for other tasks or hygienic care that you might need., Though you can most certainly do many tasks on your own, other tasks may be a bit more difficult and require some professional experience. One of the most difficult tasks for those living with dyspraxia is driving. Driving requires many tasks to be completed simultaneously, like checking blind spots, using turn signals, and hitting the brakes. Find an occupational therapist to help you develop the skills necessary to drive, if you are able., Many people you meet may never have heard of dyspraxia, but if you are seeking to have a friendship with them, then it will be important for you to explain. Explain to them what the disorder is and how it affects you specifically. Remember that you are not required to disclose your dyspraxia to your employer, but that if you need any accommodations, it may be necessary.For instance, you might say something like “Kelly, you may have noticed, but my motor skills are a bit different from most people you know. That’s because I have dyspraxia, which is a developmental coordination disorder. Mine is more moderate than severe, so I can complete most basic tasks like brushing my teeth or combing my hair, but it can be difficult.”

, Though you should certainly seek to spend time in groups when you desire to, often times, people with dyspraxia fare a bit better in a more intimate setting. Attend small dinners with friends or go to the movies with a few coworkers. Avoid overwhelming yourself with crowded atmospheres.It is often easier to make connections in these personal settings and to develop stronger friendships.

, Though you can certainly develop ways to manage and improve your dyspraxia, it is also important to focus on coping with the emotional and physical realities of it. Though dyspraxia is incurable, many people have found support groups to help cope with the disorder. Search for groups near you., One support system that you have that you can rely on is your family. Spend some time with your parents each week and go to dinner. Invite your cousins to come over and watch a movie. Having some quality social interaction with the people who love you most is critical in successfully living with the disorder., In addition to seeking an occupational therapist for large tasks like driving, consider occupational therapy in general to assist you in learning other basic tasks. These therapists can help teach you basic everyday skills that will be necessary for work or home, like bathing or even walking., Dyspraxia can also affect speech just as it affects motor skills. A speech therapist can help you to develop the skills that you will need to be able to communicate well and effectively. They can teach strategies on how to develop a more consistent speech pattern, as well., Another form of therapy that some with dyspraxia utilize is equine therapy. Equine therapy is horse therapy, during which time the participant will ride a horse as a way to achieve better balance and coordination. Equine therapy has been proven to improve dyspraxia symptoms by stimulating cognition, improving mood, and reducing the amount of support needed when walking afterwards., Though some might see dyspraxia as a limitation, people with the disorder are often highly creative. You likely have to problem solve more on a day to day basis than those without the disorder, as they do not have the same limitations as you. Use this to your advantage and celebrate the person that you are."

Skin hyperextensibility.This means the skin is very elastic, stretching very easily and then snapping back into place. The skin of someone with this condition is also often particularly smooth and velvety to the touch.
Easily being cut and bruised. People with EDS, Classical Type both bruise and bleed much more easily than the average person, due to the fragility of their tissue, even though they may be able to clot normally.People with EDS, Classical Type also find that wounds take longer to heal and are more likely to scar.Joint hypermobility. Depending on age, gender, and ethnicity, many people with EDS, Classical Type find they are unusually flexible.Specifically, people with this condition have loose and unstable joints that dislocate easily.Because of this, people with Classical EDS are often more prone to sprains and other joint injuries.
Absence of muscle tone. Young children with EDS often show a lack of muscle tone, as the development of their muscles is often delayed.This weakness can also lead to a delay in motor skills such standing or walking.Chronic pain or fatigue. Unrelenting pain (especially around the joints) and/or exhaustion are also common in people who suffer from Classical EDS.;
, EDS makes your body more fragile, so you'll need to take appropriate steps to avoid situations in which you could be injured. You'll also want to use your clothing to shield yourself from harm.


Because they are easily injured, people with Ehlers Danlos Classical Type should avoid all contact sports, as well as other situations in which they are likely to be bumped or jostled with any force.Activities like football, boxing, and even running (due to the strain it can place on the joints) are best avoided to reduce the risk of injury.
In day-to-day life, dress yourself in such a way as to reduce the risk of injury. Limit the exposure of your skin and when possible wear multiple layers to prevent scrapes and cushion your body.Always wear a helmet when cycling.
Wear elbow, knee, and shin pads when participating in outdoor activities. Soccer pads and ski stockings work well. Children with this condition may need to wear pads at all times., Certain foods can help your body better cope with problems created by Ehlers Danlos Classical Type. Specifically:


Take vitamin C (ascorbic acid). It can reduce bruising when taken regularly.A dose of two grams per day is recommended for adults, though there is no upper limit on how much you can take.
Glucosamine, magnesium, calcium, Methyl sulphonyl methane (MSM), silica, pycnogenol, carnitine, Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), and vitamin K are also thought to be helpful in alleviating the joint problems often caused by EDS.All of these are available in supplement form.Consult a physician before making any major changes in your diet or before taking supplements.

, People with EDS, Classical Type should not take Acetylsalicylate, more commonly known as aspirin.Many people with this disorder are sensitive to aspirin, and it can worsen bleeding problems.


Other anti-inflammatory drugs may useful in treating joint pain and can be taken to treat discomfort., Specifically, do non-weight bearing exercises. Exercise is important for people with EDS, Classical Type. It helps build muscle strength and coordination that can otherwise be difficult to maintain given the joint problems that often result from this condition.Activities that don't require lifting heavy weight or the risk being struck with hard objects should be undertaken in moderation.


Swimming, badminton, table tennis, and walking are all good options.At the gym, you can use the incline treadmill, elliptical machine, stationary bike, or stepper.
Core strength can be built by doing Thera-ball, yoga, ballroom dancing, or Tai Chi.Try doing bodyweight exercises or using a resistance band. Do not lift weights.
Avoid cross-fit and Olympic style lifting. Always consult your doctor to find an exercise plan that is right for you.

Look for jobs which complement your abilities.",How to Live With Disabilities," Knowledge is power, so learning about your disability can give you the power to live with it. Particularly if the disability is new to you, you should speak with your physician about what to expect. Some questions to ask include:


Is the disability temporary or permanent?
Are there common complications or secondary illnesses that often accompany the disability?
Are there any physical or emotional resources or support groups available in your area?
Will ongoing treatment or physical therapy be required to manage your disability?
What alterations might you need to make to your previous lifestyle, job, or activities to adapt them to a new or progressing disability?
If your disability is progressing, how quickly is the progression likely to take place? Are there means of slowing the progression?;
, Possibly the hardest aspect of emotionally adjusting to a disability is coming to terms with your prognosis. While it is always good to hope for and work towards recovery, if you do so while looking at your current state with disdain, you may end up depressed and unsuccessful. You need to accept your current situation as well as your possible future.By doing so, you’ll be able to focus your efforts on improving your standard of living, rather than on how upset you are with the way things are working out.


Don’t confuse acceptance with laziness. Accepting simply means that you fully understand that your situation is what it is; you still have the ability to work on improving it, though.
Denying or ignoring the severity of your disability can make regular emotional and physical tasks much more difficult.

, If you are new to having a disability as a result of an accident or a progressing illness, it can be very hard not to compare your present state to the way things were in the past. Letting go of your past goes hand in hand with accepting your situation.You don’t need to forget the way you were previously, but you shouldn’t look at your past with despair because of your present situation. Enjoy the memories from the past (before you might have suffered a disability) but don’t let them hold you back. Always be in the process of moving forward and aiming to improve your current situation.


You can still spend time reminiscing, but don’t let it depress you.
If you find that you spend all your time thinking about your life before, you should aim to do other activities that force you to plan for the future.

, It is normal for those experiencing a new or progressing disability to mourn the loss of your “old self.” It is okay to take time to acknowledge the emotions that you have regarding the change in your life.Realizing that it is okay to be sad or angry about your changing situation and allowing yourself to feel those emotions can help you move past them.

, You can make a huge difference in your mental and physical functioning by aiming to stay positive even when you’re going through some difficult things. Although the idiom might be worn out, always look on the bright side. You can’t be reliant on external stimuli and experiences for your happiness; you need to take responsibility for your own happiness, or you may never find it.


Try to find the good in each situation, even if it is something small.
Whenever you feel like making a negative comment, consciously stop yourself. Realize that you’re being negative and try to counter each negative thought with a positive one.

, It can be tempting to want to avoid people and social situations when you’re feeling down, but doing so will only make you feel worse.Don’t use your disability as an excuse to isolate yourself from friends and family or activities you love. Instead, you should be doing the opposite. Take whatever chances you’re given to get out and experience new and exciting things. Hang out with friends, go to social gatherings, visit family, try new hobbies. You’ll be much happier if you’re doing enjoyable things with people you love.


Spending time by yourself is different from isolating yourself. You should always try to fit in alone time, but don’t spend all of your time alone.
Consider having a weekly date with a close friend or family member. That way, you’ll always have a reason to get out and see someone you enjoy.

, Adjusting to a disability can make it difficult to realize your strengths and abilities. Instead of looking at the things you can no longer do, look at the things you are still quite good at. Encourage and grow these strengths whenever possible. You may even discover new strengths that grow from your experiences with your disability.When talking about your disability, don’t focus on listing things you’re no longer able to accomplish. Always speak about your abilities first.
Consider taking classes that will help you to grow your talents and abilities.

, One of the biggest stumbling blocks to overcome when new to a disability is becoming comfortable with asking for help when necessary. Although it can be frustrating or embarrassing, asking for help is often something that must be done. Know when it is appropriate to do something on your own, but don’t stress your limits. Pushing yourself too hard to accomplish something could actually be dangerous and cause you physical injury. Learn that you should not be ashamed of asking for help, and getting aid does not mean that you are not successful or incapable of accomplishing what you want.


If necessary, make sure that you have people (or a nurse) around at all times to offer you help.

, Although the thought of telling a stranger your problems might initially seem scary, there is no better person to help you through transitioning with a disability than a therapist. Therapists are trained to help people deal with the mental and emotional trauma that may accompany a disability.A therapist can provide you with the resources and services you need to accept your disability. Make an appointment with a counselor in your area who specializes in disability services.


If you’re suffering from an emotional or mental illness correlated to your disability, a therapist will be able to offer therapy or medication that can help.
Seeing a therapist regularly is also a good way to help you deal with problems you might be struggling with that unrelated to your disability. A new or escalating disability may cause old feelings to resurface.

, Group therapy for people who have disabilities is a great way to not only overcome your emotional struggles, but also to meet other people dealing with the same types of issues as you.People who attend group therapy regularly end up happier and better emotionally adapted to their disabilities. Look for group therapy in your area, and see if there are classes specialized to the disability you’re dealing with.


If you’re seeing a therapist, she may have suggestions for group therapy you may attend., If your disability significantly impacts your daily life, there are programs through the government and major charity organizations that are available for help. Get in contact with a local social worker to find out what programs you qualify for, and how they can benefit you.Keep in mind that many programs require multiple doctors visits to verify your disability, so don’t be offended if you’re asked for verification via a new doctor.
Search charities in your area that might be able to help with your specific disability.

, Service dogs are incredibly beneficial for two separate reasons: they may be able to help you perform tasks that your disability prevents you from performing, and they also supply animal-therapy, reducing your risk of depression and loneliness. If your disability prevents you from successfully accomplishing everyday tasks, you should look into getting a trained service dog. A service dog will allow you to get help whenever you need it, without being reliant or dependent on individuals in your life.There may be a government program or charity organization that can help provide you with a service dog.
Some service dog programs have long waiting lists, so keep in mind that you might not get yours immediately.

, Organizations exist that can help you manage your disability, know your rights in the workplace and public places, and point you towards local resources. A few places to start follow:


American Association of People with Disabilities
Center for Applied Special Technology
Mental Health America
Mobility International USA
National Organization on Disability

, If you stop doing your favorite things, you’ll only feel worse. When at all possible, do your best to maintain your favorite hobbies and activities.If things you previously loved to do are no longer easy for you, look for new ways to perform them. For example, if you used to love to read but can no longer accomplish that, consider listening to audio-books; if you are now using a wheelchair and love sports, look for teams in your area that accommodate wheelchairs.


Consider starting new hobbies, too.
Taking classes for a new hobby is a good way to be social and to do something you enjoy.

, Good diet and regular exercise are important for everyone, but can be especially helpful when you’re transitioning into a life with a disability. Make sure that you are eating regular meals that incorporate plenty of fruits and vegetables.Try to do physical activity every day, depending on what your skill set and level is. Keeping your diet and exercise in check will also reduce the risk of depression and loneliness, as they both increase levels of dopamine and serotonin (happy hormones) in the brain.


If necessary, look into doing physical therapy as your daily exercise.
Always check with your doctor before significantly altering your diet.
Regular exercise will help you to build and maintain muscles which may help overcome a physical disability., You may find that as a result of your disability, you are unable to keep a former job or to perform job tasks you used to be able to. In order to stay financially aloft and entertained, you could look for a new job that you can be successful in regardless of your disability.Make a list of the things you’re good at, and possible occupations that relate to those talents. Search for these types of jobs in your area, and see what comes up. Remember, it is illegal for an employer to even ask about your disability. As long as you’re able to accomplish the job at hand, your disability should not prevent you from being hired.Workplaces which are under the American Disabilities Act must provide you with accommodation, if they’re able.Consider doing volunteer work for fun if finances are not an issue. This can help you by giving you something constructive to do and taking your focus off of yourself. Many people who volunteer feel happier. "

Accept your limitations.,
Plan ahead.,
Make your house more accessible.,
Ask for help.,
Get enough rest.",How to Live with Ehlers Danlos Classical Type2," As difficult as it may be, to remain healthy and avoid injury, you will have to accept that you need to limit or avoid some tasks that would be routine for others. Specifically:Avoid heavy lifting whenever you can.
Try to sit down for any task that allows it.
Avoid unnecessary bending and stretching.
Stop tasks when you feel tired.
Use an activity tracker or pedometer to measure your heart rate so that you know if you are overexerting yourself.

, To the extent that you are able, organize tasks over time in such a way as to make them more manageable. Plan your tasks for home and work carefully. For example:Make a list of tasks you want to carry out, and prioritize them. When possible, eliminate those tasks that are least important.
Alternate active tasks with those you can do while sitting.
Look for energy saving shortcuts and ways to divide heavy tasks into multiple lighter ones.
Rather than ""clean the kitchen,"" for example, break this job into several smaller tasks that can be interspersed with physically easier tasks. You might, for example, sweep the kitchen floor, then sit down and balance your checkbook, then wipe the kitchen counters, then sit down and answer emails, and so on.

, There are many things you can do to make your home easier for you to live in and minimize strain and fatigue. For example:Replace low, soft chairs with seating that has firm and supportive upholstery to make standing and sitting easier. Similarly, have a raised toilet seat installed.
Install seating in your shower.
Keep a bag at the top and bottom of your stairs so that you can move any objects up or down in a single trip.
Get a long handled dustpan and lightweight vacuum for easier cleaning.
Keep as many kitchen items as possible at around waist level to avoid bending or stretching to reach items.

, Get help with challenging tasks from friends or family members. The less energy you have to use on tasks that could be carried out by others, the better.


For example, if you need help moving something heavy, you could say to a friend: ""My condition makes it difficult for me to move this chair up the stairs. Would you be willing to do it for me?""
Consider occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can help you find ways to minimize the strain placed on you by day-to-day activities, such as those related to your job.An occupational therapist may also be able to provide you with specialized equipment to make your life easier and minimize strain and pain, such as special braces. These therapists can also do assessments of your home and workplace to look for potential hazards and give you advice on how to pace activities to avoid fatigue., People with EDS often have trouble sleeping, in part due to chronic pain and discomfort. Make sure to allocate plenty of time for rest. Take breaks between tasks and go to bed early.


Rest helps your muscles to recover their energy.Even for short breaks, consider lying down rather than resting in a chair.
Get a mattress that provides plenty of support to make resting as comfortable as possible. Make sure it is of a height that makes it easy to lie down and get up.
Use a pillow that will not push your head forward too much.

Find an experienced practitioner.,
Seek medical treatment for wounds.,
Get regular check ups.,
Seek counseling.",How to Live with Ehlers Danlos Classical Type3," Because EDS is relatively rare, many doctors have little experience with it. Ask your general practitioner if he or she can refer you to a specialist who understands the disease well and is up on the latest treatments.You may need to travel to see a specialist, due to the rareness of this disease.
If there is not a doctor in your area experienced in treating EDS, at a minimum, seek a specialist in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Such a person can help you develop a rehabilitation plan to help with joint pain.Get children into physiotherapy. If your child has EDS, Classical Type, make take him or her to see a physiotherapist. This will be important for helping his or her muscles and motor skills develop as well as possible., If you or someone you care for has Classical EDS and is wounded, treat this seriously. Deep stitches will often be necessary and should be applied as soon as possible.Dermal (skin) wounds need to be closed up without stretching the skin to avoid scarringStitches must typically be left in for twice as long as would be typical with an ordinary patient.
Seek medical care for any wound in which the edges of the cut are separated from tissue underneath, or which will not stop bleeding. Likewise, see a doctor immediately about any dislocation or other injury of a joint.

, People with EDS need to see a doctor regularly to evaluate their condition. A doctor familiar with this condition can help make realistic assessments and offer advice for preventative care.


Starting from childhood, people with Classical EDS should receive cardiac echos on a regular basis.EDS, Classical Type can result in floppy heart valves, which can obstruct the passage of blood to and from the heart. This can be detected by cardiac echos.
Be especially vigilant during pregnancy. The weaknesses in body tissue that stem from Classical EDS can lead to cervical problems which may result in risks for both the mother and her child.Close monitoring of mothers with EDS is also recommended during the immediate postpartum period.

, Most people with EDS deal with ongoing pain, which can make life difficult. Doctors often recommend seeing a psychologist, psychiatrist, or other counselor to help patients learn to deal with the pain and the frustration caused by the lifestyle limitations EDS creates.People suffering from EDS often develop sleep disorders and poor mental health, which a qualified counselor can help you deal with.
Genetic counseling is also a good idea. The purpose of this counseling is to help patients understand the condition they are suffering from, how it is passed on, and the risk of passing it on to children they might have.Find other people with EDS to form a support group. You can even join an online support group.

Start early.,
Learn about the risk factors.,
Meet with your doctor regarding treatment.,
Ask your doctor about your medication options.,
Try psychotherapy.,
Think about engaging in a community approach.",How to Live with Schizophrenia1," Do not wait to get treatment for schizophrenia. If you have not been properly diagnosed, see a medical professional as soon as you notice symptoms in yourself so that you may begin treatment. The earlier treatment is started the better the outcome tends to be. Symptoms tend to begin in men in their early or mid-20s whereas symptoms are more likely to first occur in women in their late 20s. Signs of schizophrenia can include:


A sense of suspiciousness.
Unusual or strange thoughts, such as believing someone close to you wishes you harm.
Hallucinations, or changes in your sensory experiences; for example, seeing, tasting, smelling, hearing, or feeling things that others don’t experience in situations where they should if you are experiencing them.Disorganized thinking or speech.
'Negative' symptoms (i.e., reductions of typical behavior or functioning) such as a lack of emotion, a lack of eye contact, a lack of facial expression, neglect of hygiene, and/or social withdrawal.
Disorganized or abnormal motor behavior, such as putting one's body into weird postures, or engaging in pointless or excessive movements.;
, There are several factors that put individuals at an increased risk for developing schizophrenia:


Having a family history of schizophrenia.
Taking mind-altering drugs as a young adult or teenager.
Certain types of experiences in the womb, such as exposure to viruses or toxins.
Increased immune system activation from things like inflammation.

, Unfortunately, schizophrenia is not a condition that can simply go away. Treatment will be a necessary part of your life, and creating a treatment plan will help to turn your treatment into another normal part of your daily activities. To create a treatment plan, talk with your doctor about the medications and therapies that will best fit your specific condition.


Remember that everyone is different—not all medications or therapies will work for everyone, but you must keep trying to find the treatment that works best for you.

, Do not try to figure out what the right medications are for you by using the Internet—there is a lot of information online, and not all of it is accurate. Instead, talk to your doctor, who will be able to determine what medications will work best for you. Your symptoms, age, and previous medical history will all play a factor in finding the right medication.If the medications you are taking are making you feel uncomfortable, tell your doctor. She may opt to adjust the dosage or recommend a different medication for you to try.
Common medications used to treat schizophrenia include antipsychotics that act on the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin.Atypical antipsychotics tend to have fewer side effects and so are generally preferred, they include :

Aripiprazole (Abilify)
Asenapine (Saphris)
Clozapine (Clozaril)
Iloperidone (Fanapt)
Lurasidone (Latuda)
Olanzapine (Zyprexa)
Paliperidone (Invega)
Quetiapine (Seroquel)
Risperidone (Risperdal)
Ziprasidone (Geodon)


First generation antipsychotics tend to have more side effects (some of which may be permanent. They tend to be cheaper. First generation antipsychotics include:

Chlorpromazine (Thorazine)
Fluphenazine (Prolixin, Modecate)
Haloperidol (Haldol)
Perphenazine (Trilafon)



, Psychotherapy can help you stick to your treatment plan as well as aid you in understanding yourself and your condition better. Talk to your doctor about the kind of psychotherapy that they think is right for you. It is important to keep in mind, however, that psychotherapy alone cannot cure schizophrenia. Some of the more common forms of psychotherapy include:


Individual psychotherapy: This therapy involves you meeting with a therapist one-on-one to discuss how you are feeling, problems you may be facing, and the relationships you have, among other topics. The therapist will attempt to teach you how to face your day to day issues and understand your condition better.
Family education: This is where you and your immediate family members go to therapy together so that you can all learn about your condition and work towards effectively communicating and interacting with each other. Cognitive therapy is helpful for people with schizophrenia. Importantly, however, psychotherapy in combination with medication is the most effective way to treat schizophrenia., If you have been in a hospital because of your condition, you may want to consider the community approach, such as assertive community treatment or ACT. This approach will help you to re-establish yourself in a community and get the support you need while developing your daily habits and social interactions.Assertive community treatment involves the use of an interdisciplinary team who is involved in assessment and intervention in various forms. These forms may include substance abuse specialists, vocational rehabilitation specialists, and nurses.To find assertive community treatment opportunities near you, search the internet for “assertive community treatment + your city or state”, or ask your doctor for a recommendation.

Remember that people with intellectual or other disabilities are still people, who still experience the full range of emotions.,
Be kind and open.,
Speak directly to the person, not to whoever is accompanying them.,
Don't change your style of communication unless they ask you to.,
Offer help, without pushing it.,
Treat them the same way you'd treat any other friend or acquaintance.,
Approach the interaction as you would other situations when meeting a new person.,
If the person can hear and speak, you could make conversation.,
Consider alternative communication (AC*) methods to communicate as needed.,
When neither the option of using speech or hand gestures is available, eye pointing could be used.",How to Interact with Someone with an Intellectual Disability," Show respect and kindness with all people, independent of their abilities. Everyone should be treated with kindness and respect, whether or not a disability or impairment is present. This can be achieved by avoiding name calling and by ensuring that the body language used doesn't come across as defensive (such as crossed arms and legs) as this could come across as feeling uncomfortable around them simply because of their disability. Instead, keep arms and legs unfolded, lean forwards slightly and smile at them. Remember that they had no control over their disability. Treat them like you would treat anyone else.;
, People with cognitive and other disabilities can and do form strong interpersonal connections. Despite the challenges, even profoundly impaired individuals, may achieve a profound emotional connection.

, Most disabled people prefer to be directly addressed, and may be insulted if you talk about them like they aren't in the room. If the person isn't especially talkative, they're more likely to speak up if you talk to them instead of talking over their heads.

Ask any questions directly to the disabled person.
Some people with disabilities have different body language. For example, it is not uncommon for autistic people to fidget and appear ""zoned out"" while they listen closely to someone speaking. Don't assume that someone isn't listening just because of their body language.

, Many people with disabilities can understand regular speech, and don't want people to speak differently to them. Avoid coming across as condescending, and speak to them normally.


Speak at your normal speed and volume. If they need you to speak up or slow down, they will tell you.
Treat them like their real age. Speak to them the same way you'd speak to their same-age peers. For example, a singsong voice and baby talk are not appropriate for addressing disabled teens and adults.
Match your vocabulary usage to theirs. Many people with disabilities have average vocabularies. However, if the person only speaks with simple words, then you can also speak more plainly.
Never mimic their disability accent. It won't make them understand you better, but it may make them think that you are trying to make fun of them.

, It is okay to say ""If you ever need any help to make things easier, just ask.""


If they seem to be struggling with something, ask ""Do you need help?"" or ""Would you like me to _____?"" Then listen to their answer. Sometimes they'll say no because they want to try it on their own, or they don't really need help.
If they look puzzled, ask if they're confused about something.
Don't worry too much about it. While you may not have much experience with disability, they have lived with it for a long time, and they know their own needs pretty well. They can tell you if there is a problem.

, People with disabilities are ordinary people with hobbies, interests, opinions, and relationships. You don't need to treat them particularly differently than anyone else.

, Start with a culturally appropriate greeting, which typically consists of acknowledging their presence, introducing yourself, and showing openness to hearing what they have to say. Ask questions, listen, and share your own thoughts and stories. There are many types of intellectual disabilities, so unless you know the specifics of the impairment it is unnecessary to behave any differently than usual.

, Ask them about themselves. For example: How are you today? What do you like to do? If you ask the right question, their face will light up. It's always a great feeling to connect with someone. Find things you both like.

, For example, sign language, or simplified signing, hand gestures can be used for children and adults with limited communication skills.


Many of these are available online.
For some people, the use of symbols, photographs, or stickers will be easier. These could be presented to show what is happening that day, to illustrate their calendar, to communicate, make choices at mealtime, etc.

,


Use technology to help you. In some cases, electronic devices and specially designed computer software are more suitable options. These can enable a person with a learning disability or developmental disability (intellectual disability) who can't use verbal communication, and can promote their independence.
You might even make use of smartphone apps to help you interact with ease.
Never interact with them as you would interact with a toddler. Though their intellectual disability may make you feel like you need to baby them, doing so could make them depressed or even hateful towards you.
Try not to acknowledge that they have a disability, but don't ignore them if they need help. However, if their disability makes something difficult for them, never just do it for them, unless they ask you to. Instead, give some pointers on how they can do it better.

Learn the proper terminology.,
Communicate directly.,
Ask before providing assistance.,
Be respectful in your words and actions.,
Ask questions, if they're relevant.,
Find volunteer opportunities in your area.,
Raise or donate money.,
Help with accessibility.,
Volunteer to train a service dog.,
Use social media to your advantage.,
Address prejudice.,
Direct people to the proper resources.",How to Help Those Who Have a Disability," Make sure you use the right terms when discussing people with disabilities. Certain terms that were once considered the norm are now outdated and even offensive. The first step to helping people with disabilities is educating yourself about the right words.


When speaking about someone with a disability, it's often polite to place their personhood before their specific condition. For example, do not say ""mentally ill person"" or ""the mentally ill."" Instead say, ""person who has a mental illness."" Do not say ""wheelchair-bound."" Identify them by another means (like you would anyone else), and if you're talking specifically about the use of a wheelchair, say, ""person in the wheelchair"" or ""person who uses the wheelchair."" Keep in mind there are a few noteworthy exceptions to this; many people in the Deaf, Blind, and Autistic communities prefer identity-first language, meaning they want to be called an ""autistic person"" or a ""Deaf person"" (with the capital D indicating they identify as part of the Deaf culture).Certain terms were once considered politically correct are now outdated and can offend. The terms ""mute"" or ""dumb"" used to be appropriate for referring to people who cannot speak, but now terms like ""nonverbal"" or ""nonspeaking"" are preferred. Lame or crippled were once used to describe those with a physical disability that limited mobility, but now terms like physically disabled are preferred.
The terms ""r*tarded"" and ""mentally defective"" are considered very offensive by today's standards. Person with an intellectual, developmental, or cognitive disability is the preferred term. While ""r*tarded"" was once considered politically correct, as so many people use in a derogatory fashion this is no longer the case. Refrain from using the term in this way, as it's extremely unkind to people with cognitive disabilities.;
, Oftentimes, people with disabilities are assisted by interpreters, nurses, or friends during their day-to-day lives. It's important that, when communicating with someone with a disability, you talk directly to that person. Do not filter conversation through someone else.


Look at the person with a disability, and not their interpreter or assistant. Oftentimes, people who are deaf look to their interpreter while another person talks as they need to do so in order to follow the conversation. You should still look at the person who is deaf, however, as that is who you're communicating with, not the interpreter.If you are communicating with someone in a wheelchair, sit down so that they don't strain their neck looking up at you.Avoid bending down like you would to a child; this usually looks awkward.

, If you see a person with a disability struggling with something, your first instinct may be to jump in and help. However, without knowing that person's specific needs or intentions you may be doing more harm than good. Always ask before offering your assistance.


Sometimes, a person with a disability may seem to be struggling when they are actually fine. It may simply take them longer to do certain tasks, but that does not necessarily mean they need a helping hand. If you think they might need help, just ask.If you see someone with a disability struggling, simply say ""Would you like any help?"" or ""Do you need assistance?"" You do not have to say any more than this.
If someone declines your offer of assistance, do not be offended or insist on helping. Simply go on with your day.They know their needs better than you do, and pushing them would come off as rude.
Do not offer medical advice, especially if you are not a doctor. While suggesting yoga for someone who suffers from chronic pain may seem helpful, remember that person already has a doctor who knows his specific medical history and giving out advice without solicitation comes off as condescending., When interacting with someone with a disability, always be respectful in both your words and actions.


When introduced to someone with a disability, always offer to shake hands. Even someone with limited hand use can usually manage this and refraining from offering a handshake, a typical gesture of courtesy, calls attention to a person's disability.
Speak in your normal voice and tone. People often feel they should speak slower or louder, especially if they're interacting with a person who is hearing impaired, but this can come off as rude or infantilizing. Simply talk in your normal voice.
It is okay to do things to make communication easier. For example, if interacting with someone who is hard of hearing, make sure to look directly at them so they can read your lips and follow other visual cues. Sitting down to make eye contact with someone in a wheelchair can be a polite gesture. If someone has a speech impediment, rather than pretending you understand something they said when you did not you can politely ask them to repeat it.
Be yourself during any conversation. If you accidentally use a common expression that does not apply, like saying ""see you later"" to someone who is visually impaired, do not panic and apologize profusely. That person will understand this is a colloquialism and not meant to be taken literally.

, Oftentimes, people worry about inadvertently offending someone with a disability and end up acting off or nervous during interaction. This can be alienating for someone with a disability so be sure to be yourself and stay calm. If you have any questions, it's fine to ask them if they're relevant to the situation.


For the most part, people with disabilities would rather you simply asked a question politely rather than remaining confused. For example, it's completely appropriate to ask someone who is deaf if they can read lips and would therefore prefer if you faced them each you time you talked. If you're planning an event and you know the wheelchair ramp is in the back room, it's fine to say to someone in a wheelchair, ""Do you know where the wheelchair ramp is? It's hard to find, and I just want to make sure you know.""
People are wary to ask questions as they do not want to call attention to someone's disability. However, avoiding an obvious question can sometimes call more attention to the issue than simply addressing it. As long as questions are relevant to the situation at hand, they will likely not come off as prying or insensitive.

, You can find volunteer opportunities in your community. A variety of organizations strive to provide assistance to people with disabilities.


Ability First is an organization that provides programs for children and adults with disabilities via employment, recreation, and socialization programs. Ability First has different branches throughout the country and they offer opportunities for volunteers. Depending on the route you take, you may work with people with disabilities hands-on or perform clerical and office duties to help facilities, events, and programs run smoothly. You can browse the Ability First website to find volunteer opportunities in your community.The Southern Poverty Law Center has a program called Teaching Tolerance, where an instructor conducts workshops with college and high school students to teach young people how to interact with people with disabilities. You can browse the SPLC's website to see if there's a Teaching Tolerance seminar being conducted in your area and contact the leader to see if they need volunteers for set-up, advertising, or other tasks.The United Disabilities services is a non-profit organization that strives to help people with disabilities, including veterans and the elderly, live more independently. They help make homes more accessible, provide medical equipment, custom wheelchairs, and service dogs. The UDS takes volunteers for a variety of fields, from office work to community relations to fundraising and more. While the organization is based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania they do have branches elsewhere.You can also look for opportunities through organizations specific to your area. Call local hospitals and nursing homes to ask about where to volunteer or talk to someone you know works professionally with people who are disabled.
Some organizations, such as Autism Speaks,are considered to do more harm than good. Check with the disability community to make sure it is a good group.

, Sometimes, fundraising is very helpful. People with disabilities often need extra funds to cover medical costs, home renovations, and other expenses.


All the organizations listed above periodically conduct fundraisers. Donating money, even a small amount, can help. You can also ask friends and family members to donate as well. If you're having a birthday party, wedding shower, or other big even where it's custom to bring gifts, you could ask for donations instead.
If you know a disabled person who needs money for an issue related to their disability, you can help that person raise funds. You can throw an event, like a dinner or party, when entry fees are collected to pay for that person's medical costs. You can raise money via online campaigns, using sites like GoFundMe. You can have some kind of contest or raffle, charging submission fees or charging for tickets. There are a variety of ways to raise funds for someone you know in need.
If you're in school, certain organizations hire college students as fundraisers over the summer months. If you can find an organization that helps people with disabilities, applying for a job fundraising with them can both allow you to help people with disabilities and gain professional experience.

, Oftentimes, people with disabilities need assistance getting around. You can volunteer to help in this regard.


If a person's disability means they are unable to drive, you can volunteer to help with transportation. You can either drive someone directly or help people navigate public transportation. Many volunteer organizations recruit people for this purpose specifically.
Some organizations seek to make the world in general more friendly to people with disabilities related to mobility by installing ramps and other wheelchair friendly devices in public places. You can help by writing letters to congresspeople, signing petitions, collecting other people's signatures, and raising awareness of buildings or structures that limit access to those with mobility-related disabilities., If you're a dog person, volunteering to help train a service dog can be a great way to help people with disabilities.


Service dogs are dogs trained to assist people with cognitive or physical disabilities. Before they can be placed with an owner, they need special training and are usually placed with a volunteer owner until they are 18-months old.If you volunteer to raise a service dog, you will be required to attend regular training sessions and train the dog at home in between.While training a service dog can be rewarding, it is also a difficult experience. It can be hard to give up a dog or puppy after becoming attached. Make sure you are emotionally prepared to do so before committing to the task.
This is a great option for college students. First, many colleges students want a pet but cannot commit for too long of a period. Second, university is one of the best ways to socialize a dog as there is such a wide array of activity on campus.

, As so many people actively use social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter, it's easy to spread awareness through such platforms.


Post links to articles about various disabilities, educating people on a range of physical or cognitive disabilities. Do not just share factual information, however. Provide links to article on how to talk to people with disabilities and how best to help and volunteer.
If you're tying to raise money or collect signatures for a petition, social media is a powerful tool. Posting links that show people where to donate or sign is the quickest and most convenient way to help your cause.
Choose articles people are likely to read on their computer or phone. In general, internet users are more likely to select shorter articles, especially those that are in the form of a list or make heavy use of bullet points.

, If you hear people making derogatory comments, intentionally or not, about people with disabilities you should speak up.


Oftentimes, a person will unintentionally use the wrong word or phrase. If this is the case, you can politely correct. For example, if you hear someone say ""Down Syndrome girl"" you could say, ""Actually, the preferred term is 'girl with Down Syndrome.'""

The words ""retarded"" and ""retard"" are used a lot, even in some forms of media, as a catchall term for something frustrating or otherwise unpleasant. People will often defend their use, saying they do not mean it ""in that way"" but you can step in here and explain that, regardless of how they mean it, the word carries associations that are hurtful to many.
If you see discrimination against disabled people happening in a work or school environment, report the discrimination to the proper authorities. If you're unsure who to speak to, you can contact an organization that advocates for disabled people and ask them for advice.

, Many people do not mean to be hurtful or offensive and are simply unaware of how to interact with people with disabilities. If someone seems confused or uncertain, direct them to relevant websites and organizations that can help them learn how to interact with people disabilities. Education is a powerful tool in fostering social change and creating a more hospitable, tolerant world.

Avoid stressors.,
Get regular exercise.,
Get enough sleep.,
Eat healthy foods.,
Try out cognitive techniques.,

Avoid taking in a lot of caffeine.,
Avoid alcohol.",How to Live with Schizophrenia2," It can be common for those with schizophrenia to stop taking their medication. You can use a few approaches to try to stick to using your medication in times when you feel like quitting :


Remind yourself that your medications treat, but tend not to cure, schizophrenia. This means for you to continue to feel better, you likely need to keep taking your medications.
Use any social support you have; tell your family or friends when you are feeling well to strongly encourage you to keep going on with your meds when you feel like stopping.

You could record yourself a message for your future self, telling you to keep going with your meds and why (they are a treatment not a cure) and have your family play it back to you when you feel like quitting.



, Accepting your condition may help to make your recovery an easier experience. On the other hand, denying that something is wrong or thinking that your condition will just go away may lead to your condition actually getting worse.Because of this, it is important to begin your treatment and accept these two facts:


Yes, you have schizophrenia and it will be challenging to deal with.
Yes, you can live a normal, happy life.
While accepting your diagnosis is important for seeking treatment, being willing to fight for a normal life can help you to live the life that you want to live., The initial shock upon hearing the diagnosis can be a very tough for the diagnosed and their families. Living a normal life is possible but it may take some time to adjust to your condition and to find the right treatment plan for you.


People with schizophrenia who take their medications and go to therapy can have very few problems with social interactions, holding a job, having a family or otherwise excelling in life., Schizophrenia is often brought on when you experience a severe amount of stress. Because of this, if you have this condition, it is important to avoid things that may stress you out and cause you to have an episode. There are multiple ways to deal with stress, such as by:


Each individual will have different stressors. Going to therapy can help you to identify the things that cause you stress, whether it be a specific person, situation, or place. Once you know your stressors, work hard to avoid them when you can.
You can, for example, practice relaxation techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing., Exercise not only relieves your body of stress, but it can release endorphins which can increase your sense of well-being. Try listening to music that pumps you up and helps you get through your workout.

, Not getting a proper night’s rest can contribute to feelings of stress and anxiety. Be sure to get plenty of sleep at night; figure out how many hours a night you need to feel rested and stick to that.If you have trouble sleeping, try making you bedroom completely black and silent by blocking out sounds, changing your environment, or wearing a sleeping mask and earplugs. Get into a routine and follow it every night.

, When you eat unhealthy foods it can make you feel negative, which can add to your stress levels. Therefore, it is important to eat right to combat stress. Try eating lean meats, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. Eating healthy involves having a balanced diet. Avoid eating too much of any one food.

, Although these are not a substitute for therapy or for a therapist, there are cognitive techniques you can try to alleviate your symptoms.


You can, for example, use a technique called normalization. In this technique you see your psychotic experiences as part of the same continuum that includes normal experiences, and acknowledge that everyone has experiences that vary from normal, everyday life. This may make you feel less alienated and stigmatized, which can have a positive impact on your health outcomes.To cope with auditory hallucinations, such as hearing voices, try listing evidence against the content of the voice. For example, if a voice is telling you to do something negative, like stealing, list reasons why that is not a good idea (e.g., you could get into trouble, it is against social norms, it would cost someone else, most people would tell you not to do it, so don't listen to this one voice). , If you are suffering from hallucinations, try distracting yourself in some way, by, for example, listening to music or making artwork. Do your best to become fully immersed in this new experience as it may help to block out unwanted experiences. , To deal with the social anxiety that can accompany schizophrenia, try to identify then challenge distorted thoughts. For example, if you have the thought that ""everyone in this room is looking at me"" try questioning the truth value of this statement. Look around the room for evidence: is it the case that in fact everyone is looking at you? Ask yourself how much attention you pay to any one person when they are just walking about in public. Remind yourself that in a crowded room there are many people, and so people's attention is likely bouncing around to all of them, and they are probably not just all focused on you.

, Once you have your symptoms under control through medication and therapy, you should try to restart your normal life and keep busy. Idle time can lead to thinking about things that stress you out, which in turn may lead to an episode. To stay busy:


Put in an effort at your job.
Organize time to spend with your friends and family.
Take up a new hobby.
Help out a friend or volunteer somewhere.

, Sudden spikes in caffeine might make ‘positive’ symptoms of schizophrenia worse (i.e., unwanted additions such as delusions or hallucinations); although if you normally drink a lot of caffeine, stopping or having caffeine may not affect your symptoms for better or worse. The key is to avoid a large sudden change in your caffeine habits.It is recommended that individuals not consume more than 400 mg of caffeine a day. However, keep in mind that individuals’ body chemistries will vary, as will their prior history with caffeine, so you may be able to tolerate a little more or less than this , Drinking alcohol is associated with worse treatment outcomes, increased symptomatology, and a higher rate of re-hospitalization. You will be better off if you refrain from drinking alcohol."
"
Spend time with people who understand your condition.,
Try not to shy away from social experiences.,
Express your emotions and fears to someone you trust.,
Join a support group.",How to Live with Schizophrenia3," It is important to spend time with people that know what you are going through so that you do not have to feel stressed out by explaining your condition to an unfamiliar person. Devote your time to people who are empathetic, genuine, and sincere.


Avoid people who are not sensitive to what you are going through or who may stress you out.

, While you may find it challenging to muster up the energy and calm to interact with others in a social setting, it is important to do so. People are social creatures, and when we are with others, our brains release chemicals that can make us feel safe and happy.Make time to do things you enjoy with the people that you love.

, Schizophrenia can make you feel isolated, so talking to trusted friends about what you are going through may help to combat this feeling. Sharing your experiences and emotions can be very therapeutic and act as a pressure reliever.


You should share what you are going through, even if the person you are sharing with does not necessarily have any advice to give. Simply putting a voice to your thoughts and emotions can help to make you feel calmer and more in control.

, When it comes to accepting that schizophrenia is a part of your life, joining a support group can have many benefits. Understanding that other people have the same problems as you and have found a way to deal with them may help you to better understand and accept your condition.Participating in a support group may also make you more confident in your own abilities and less scared of the disorder and what it might do to your life.

Feed your child complex carbohydrates.,
Make sure your child eats plenty of protein.,
Feed your child zinc.,
Use helpful spices.,
Avoid harmful foods.",How to Treat ADHD Naturally in Children1," Children with ADHD usually have lower serotonin and dopamine levels. A change in diet can sometimes improve those deficiencies to some extent. A diet rich in complex carbohydrates can increase serotonin for improved mood, sleep, and appetite.Feed your child complex carbohydrates like whole grains, green vegetables, starchy vegetables, and beans.All these release energy gradually, rather than all at once like simple sugars.;
, A protein-rich diet may improve your child's ability to focus. Prepare meals that include several proteins over the course of the day to keep dopamine levels high.Proteins include meat, fish, and nuts. Some protein-rich foods like legumes and beans double as complex carbohydrates., Some research suggests that zinc may help counteract hyperactivity.Make sure your child gets plenty of this important mineral.


Seafoods, poultry, and fortified cereals are all good choices for boosting you child's zinc intake. Zinc supplements may also be effective.

, Some spices also have helpful properties. Specifically, Saffron counters depression, while cinnamon helps with attention., Just as some foods are helpful in controlling ADHD, others can worsen the situation. Specifically, avoid the following:


Simple sugars. Simple sugars like those found in candy and soda create a burst of energy and a serotonin spike. Your child should eat foods that help maintain stable levels, as complex carbohydrates do.Bad fats. Avoid serving your child fats such as those found in trans fats and fried foods, burgers, and pizzas. Instead, pick foods rich in omega-3 fats like salmon, walnuts, and avocados.These fats may actually help lower hyperactivity while improving organizational skills.
Dyes and food coloring. Some studies suggest there may be link between food dyes and ADHD symptoms. Red dyes in particular may be an issue.Wheat, dairy, and processed foods. These foods make up a big part of most American's diets, so you may not be able to cut them out all together. Some studies suggest, however, that limiting your child's intake of these foods may help."

Learn the general symptoms of ADD in children.,
Learn the symptoms in adults.,
Take self diagnostic tests.,
Do not rely solely on personal diagnosis.",How to Test for ADD1," While professional diagnosis is crucial, you should get a sense of the general symptoms of ADD before making an appointment with a professional. This can help give you a sense of whether or not professional testing would be appropriate for your child.


The symptoms of ADD are broken down into three categories: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.Children displaying symptoms of inattention are often easily distracted. They may frequently miss details, forget things, and switch quickly from one activity to another. They may struggle to complete new tasks and have trouble focusing on a single task long term, unless it's something fun. They may frequently not turn in homework assignments and lose small items, like pencils and folders. They are also prone to daydreaming, have difficulty following instructions, and may not listen.Hyperactivity symptoms may still be present in children with ADD, but they may be minimal and not as obvious as they are in children with ADHD. Hyperactivity symptoms may include fidgeting, getting up and moving around when he or she should sit still, talking a lot, having a hard time playing quietly, or having a hot temper.Children displaying symptoms of impulsivity are marked by intense impatience. They may blurt out inappropriate comments, struggle to regulate or constrain their emotions, and display an inability to understand consequences. Children may interrupt activities or conversation and be unable to wait their turn in class or at home.Children with ADD may also have another mental or medical health condition that looks like ADD or that accompanies it.;
, If you're an adult who struggles with everyday tasks, you may have ADD. Many adults with the disorder do not realize they have it. If you suspect you may have ADD, you need professional diagnosis. However, learn a bit about the symptoms first in order to gauge whether testing is appropriate for you.


Adults with ADD struggle to prioritize and focus in day-to-day life. They may run late frequently, miss meetings at work, struggle to keep up with social obligations, and miss deadlines. The impulsivity associated with ADD may be marked by difficulty waiting. Adults with ADD may experience intense frustration or impatience waiting in traffic or waiting in line at the store.Other general symptoms include restlessness, mood swings, disorganization, a hot temper, unstable relationships, and a difficulty coping with stress. If you have ADD as an adult, you also had it as a child even if you were not officially diagnosed. If you remember having any of the symptoms of childhood ADD listed above, this may indicate ADD in the present.It's normal to have difficulty concentrating and coping with stress on occasion. This is what can make ADD difficult to catch. If you've only struggled with the above symptoms occasionally, you probably do not have ADD. If these symptoms are an ongoing problem that affect your personal and professional life, seek professional testing.Many adults with ADD have at least one other mental health condition, like depression or anxiety. If you've been diagnosed with a mental health condition in the past, you're at higher risk for ADD.Adults with ADD are also at a higher risk of abusing alcohol or drugs.

, If you display any of the above symptoms, there are many diagnostic check lists and self tests online. Look for reputable websites, however. Universities often have diagnostic tests through their counseling centers. Websites like Psych Central and Psychology Today may offer self tests. Such tests can give you a sense of whether you may have ADD. They serve to help you see whether your symptoms are a problem and if professional testing is necessary for you.

, Most self checklists and online tests will advise that you make an appointment with a mental health professional. This is because symptoms of ADD are often similar to symptoms of other physical and mental health disorders. Only a qualified, licensed psychiatrist or doctor can make a proper diagnosis. Do not attempt to diagnose or treat yourself if you suspect you may have ADHD.

Consider the military.",How to Treat ADHD in Teens," There are two components to ADHD. For children under the age of 17, at least six of these must be present for an ADHD diagnosis. The first set of symptoms deal with an inability to pay attention or focus. A child with an attention disorder will exhibit the following symptoms:makes careless mistakes, is inattentive to detail
has trouble paying attention (tasks, playing)
doesn’t seem to be paying attention when someone is talking to him or her
doesn’t follow through (homework, chores, jobs); easily sidetracked
is organizationally challenged
avoids tasks requiring sustained focus (like schoolwork)
can’t keep track of or often loses keys, glasses, papers, tools, etc.
is easily distracted
is forgetful;
, The other category of symptoms related to ADHD suggests hyperactivity or a lack of impulse control. People with ADHD must display six or more of the following:fidgety, squirmy; taps hands or feet
runs/climbs inappropriately or feels restless
struggles to play quietly/do quiet activities
“on the go” as if “driven by a motor”
excessive talking
blurts out answers before questions are asked
struggles to wait for his or her turn
interrupts others, inserts self into others’ discussions/games

, The brains of persons with ADHD are slightly different than others. Specifically, two structures tend to be smaller: the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex.The basal ganglia regulates the movement of muscles. It signals which should be working and which should be at rest during given activities.If a child is sitting at his desk in the classroom, the basal ganglia should send a message telling the feet to rest. In the case of ADHD, the feet may not get the message. They often remain in motion when a child with ADHD is seated. A deficiency of the basal ganglia often can also cause fidgety hand movements or pencil tapping.
The prefrontal cortex is the brain’s hub for conducting higher-order tasks.It is where memory and learning and attention regulation come together to help us function intellectually.The prefrontal cortex influences the level of the neurotransmitter dopamine.Dopamine is tied to the ability to focus and tends to be at lower levels in persons with ADHD.Serotonin is another neurotransmitter found in the prefrontal cortex.It impacts mood, sleep, and appetite. Eating chocolate, for instance, spikes serotonin causing a temporary feeling of well-being. When serotonin drops low, however, depression and anxiety result.A smaller prefrontal cortex with lower dopamine and serotonin means greater struggles to focus.As a result, persons with ADHD struggle to focus on a single thing at a time, and are more easily distracted.The prefrontal cortex is still in development through late adolescence. This can make the perceived deficiencies for adolescents with ADHD even more severe., ADHD often occurs alongside other mental-health problems.


Specifically, one out of every five with ADHD is diagnosed with another serious disorder, such as depression and bipolar disorder are common partners.
One third of children with ADHD also have a behavioral disorder, such as conduct disorder or oppositional defiance disorder.ADHD also tends to pair up with learning disabilities and anxiety., If your teen displays many of these traits, you should see a doctor to get a professional opinion. Knowing whether ADHD might be the cause of the challenges your teen faces will make it easier to move forward.

, It is important to keep in mind that ADHD is a serious condition. It is not simply a matter of your teen not trying hard enough or being ""stupid."" Strive to understand these challenges and react to them with compassion.People with ADHD face serious obstacles as they struggle to reach their life goals. They often feel misunderstood. It is common for teens with ADHD to believe that others think they are stupid.
Other people, including relatives may have a hard time understanding what you and your teen are going through.
Prepare yourself for time and expense invested in therapy, trips to medication managers, and the pharmacy. There is often also a huge amount of time spent dealing with school issues.
Children with impulsivity issues often rack up more trips to the emergency room or more suspensions from school.
Much of this occurs during weekdays. As such, the time expended may mean lost wages or the need to take a job with decreased responsibilities or shorter hours.

, For many people with ADHD, medication is an important tool for coping. There are two basic categories of ADHD medication: stimulants (such as methylphenidate and amphetamine) and non-stimulants (such as guanfacine and atomoxetine).It may seem odd to treat hyperactivity with stimulants. However, the brain circuitry being stimulated is responsible for controlling impulsivity and improving focus.Stimulants including Ritalin, Concerta, and Adderall help regulate neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and dopamine). So do non-stimulant anti-depression medications often used to treat ADHD.Deciding on the right form and specific prescription of medication is tricky. Different people respond differently to different medications.Further, the effectiveness of the medications changes during growth spurts, hormonal fluctuations, diet and weight changes, and as resistance builds up.
Medication can increase the ability to focus and decrease impulsive behavior.
Many medications can be taken in an extended-release format. This erases the need to deal with dosing at school.Over time, medication may become unnecessary. Or, it may be reserved for special occasion usage, such as when taking college entrance exams or finals.

, A change in diet can diminish the effects of the hormonal deficiencies your teen may be experiencing. Feeding him or her the right foods can make the conditions less severe.


A diet high complex carbohydrates can boost serotonin for improved mood, sleep, and appetite.Avoid feeding your teen simple carbs like sugars, honey, jelly, candy, soda, etc.These cause a temporary serotonin spike.Instead, choose complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, green vegetables, starchy vegetables, and beans, all of which act as an energy “time-release.”To improve focus feed your child a protein-rich diet that includes several proteins over the course of the day. This helps keep dopamine levels high.Proteins include meat, fish, nuts, legumes and beans.Avoid feeding your teen “bad fats” such as those found in trans fats and fried foods, burgers and pizzas. Instead, choose omega-3 fats from foods like salmon, walnuts, and avocados.These may help lower hyperactivity while improving organizational skills.
A diet rich in zinc may also help. Feed your teen seafoods, poultry, fortified cereals and other foods with a high zinc content, or give him or her zinc supplements. Zinc promotes lower levels of hyperactivity and impulsivity.Certain spices may also help. Saffron counters depression, while cinnamon helps with attention., Just as some foods can help with ADHD, other foods may make the effects more pronounced. For example:


Avoid feeding your teen food with dyes, and red dye in particular. Some studies suggest there may be link between food dyes and ADHD symptoms.Eliminating wheat and dairy, as well as processed foods, sugars, additives, and dyes may also have a positive impact., A good therapist can often help you and your teen manage the challenges created by ADHD.Therapy typically begins with an analysis and restructuring of a family’s structure. The goal is to create an environment that fits the way the child’s brain functions so the child can succeed.


Therapy also provides a safe place for family members to vent their frustrations in a healthy way and work out issues with professional guidance.People with ADHD benefit greatly from learning more about their condition and knowing they are not alone in their struggle.

, In addition to these forms of treatment, there are also strategies you can use on a day-to-day basis to help manage the symptoms of ADHD. For example:


Talk to teachers about allowing your teen to sit on bungee chairs or large exercise balls. This reduces concerns about extra noise or fighting an endless battle against the student rocking back on two legs.
To deal with hand-fidgeting, encourage your teen to use a stress ball that he or she can squeeze quietly rather than tapping a pencil or drumming fingers. This can help a lot during exams.
Consider allowing your teen to play muted handheld electronic games during long waits. This can help in restaurants or at other times they must sit quietly (during a church service, in a clinic waiting room, etc.).
Immediately before long periods of sitting, these teens might find it helpful if they have a place to “run it out.” Encourage your teen to run some laps or to the fence and back, etc. Exercise can really help., The key to success lies in establishing consistent schedules and routines combined with organization and structure. This will reduce the stress on the child with ADHD. It should also decrease misbehaviors that are spurred on by that stress.


Children with ADHD need tasks broken into steps that are given either one at a time or in written form.Parents should give positive feedback as the child completes each step.Establishing routines that reflect consistent instructions, given one step at a time. Ask your teen to repeat the instructions back to you..This works well with chores that can be broken into smaller steps or to-do lists. For example, imagine your teen is responsible for mowing the lawn. You might instruct him or her to first mow the front yard, then mow the area alongside the house, and finally to mow the backyard. At the end of each step, you might come out and compliment them on how good the area looks. If there are several chores you are asking your teen to complete in a day, you should consider providing a written list. Again, offer praise as each item is checked off the list.
The less stress, the more success. The more success and praise, the better the self-esteem. This sets your child up for additional success in the future., Routines are crucial for making sure homework and chores get done. Set up a regular schedule for accomplishing these tasks.


The homework routine should be consistent: same time, same place every day. Have plenty of supplies on hand, organized in bins if you have the space.
Be sure homework doesn’t start the second your child walks in the door. Let him or get rid of excess energy by doing something fun.
When appropriate, show how you would organize the work and recommend ways to prioritize the assignments. Chunk big projects and set deadlines for completion of the individual stages.It’s a good idea to coordinate with teachers whenever possible. Does the teacher provide a daily homework list or does the school promote the use of planners? If not, buy a planner that has plenty of space to write daily notes and show your child how to use it.
Decrease the arguments around assigning chores by setting and enforcing a consistent time they occur. Tie them to a regular reward whenever possible. For example, keep the video games controllers stored out of sight, and give them to your child only after chores are complete.
Post visual cues to remind your child of chores that need to be done. Calendars and written schedules or chore boards remove the “I forgot” excuse.

, Winter, spring, and summer breaks can be nightmarish times for parents of children with ADHD. The structure and schedule of the past school year suddenly ends. Plan ahead and install structure so your family doesn’t unravel.You must replace the missing structure with another regular schedule. Encourage your teen to join a club, audition for a play, or volunteer with a local charity that has regular hours. This can help keep a routine in place.

, People with ADHD are constantly trying to make sense of their environment. Parents can help by organizing the home for success.


Establish a storage system that separates items into categories and reduces crowding.
Keep a box or a storage bin in a central location of the home where you can pile items your teen leaves around the house, such as clothes, books, or games. This makes cleanup easier. It also provides an obvious place for your teen to find items they have mislaid., It’s important to think about how siblings of the child with ADHD are processing the situation. Make sure your other children understand that there is a good reason for the difference in how your teen is treated.


Some parents assume their other children will understand why they expend so much time on the special-needs child. In reality, those siblings may feel resentment at the amount of time dedicated to the other child, the shorter chore list that child has to accomplish, or the plethora of rewards available to the child with ADHD that may not be available to other siblings.Talk honestly to your children about the situation. Use language that is age-appropriate and non-judgmental.
Explain that that you value his or her ability to be responsible and independent during this challenging time. Make sure he or she knows that you will be there if needed, and that you love him or her just as much as the sibling with ADHD.
Set aside special bonding time with your other children. Having a teen with ADHD can take a lot of your time, energy and attention. So, be intentional about caring for and attending to your other children.

, It is mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausting to be the parent of a child with ADHD. Be sure to care for yourself and your spouse, if you have one.Take breaks from your child, no matter how much you love him or her. You won’t be at your best for your child if you let yourself get run down without a break. Your teen will also need time to assert his or her individuality and pursue relationships outside the home.
You may also want to consider seeing a therapist to help you navigate the challenges of being a special-needs parent.

, All children need discipline and they need to learn that bad behavior comes with consequences.Taking Charge of ADHD: The Complete, Authoritative Guide For Parents by Russell A. Barkley (2005).</ref> For discipline to change behavior in ADHD teens, it must be, above all, consistent.


Teens should know the rules and know the consequences for breaking the rules. The consequence should happens the same every time the rule is broken.Both parents must be on board, providing consequences in the same way., Because teens with ADHD have a harder time focusing, it is important to make consequences as immediate as possible.


The consequence should have an immediate impact. It should not be delayed. Persons with ADHD often struggle with time concepts,so postponed consequences may have no meaning.
If the child experiences forgotten consequences for a previous infraction, this invites conflict.

, Consequences for misbehavior should be substantial. If your teen can easily dismiss them, they will not be taken seriously.


If the consequence for speeding was paying a fine of a dollar, we’d all speed constantly. That isn’t a powerful enough consequence to change our behavior. We will monitor our speed to avoid a $200 ticket plus higher insurance premiums. The same applies to children with ADHD. The consequence needs to be powerful enough to act as a deterrent.Don’t backtrack on consequences.If you threaten a dire consequence and you don’t follow through on the promised punishment, your teen won’t listen next time. Say what you mean and mean what you say if you want respect and obedience.

, Administer discipline in a way that suggests you are rational and in control of the situation.Your anger or raised voice may cause anxiety or send a message that your child can control you by getting you angry. Remaining calm and loving will convey the message you want.

, People with ADHD tend to feel that they’re “always” messing up or in trouble. Regardless of your parenting style or personality, it’s extremely important that you stay positive. A child with ADHD needs to feel that he or she is being praised more often than criticized.Positive input must significantly outweigh negative input to counterbalance feelings of failure. Work overtime to “catch him or her being good” and offer praise for achievements.
Whenever possible, invert house rules so they read as positives.For instance, instead of admonishing, “Don’t interrupt!” use “Wait your turn,” or “Allow your sister to finish what she was saying.” It might take practice to flip those negatives from “Don’t talk with your mouth full!” to “Finish what’s in your mouth before sharing,” but it can become habit with patience. Positive rules make slip-ups feel less like failures.

, You need to learn to foresee future problems when you have a child with ADHD. Look ahead and anticipate what problems you might encounter and plan interventions to prevent them.Help your child develop cause-and-effect and problem-solving skills by troubleshooting possible problems together.Make it a habit to think about and discuss possible pitfalls with your child before challenging situations arise.If your teenager feels that he or she has entered into an agreement about how to handle some situation, he or she may be more likely to follow through on appropriate behavior. If she or he does not do so, the the consequences will at least feel less arbitrary.

, Teens with ADHD often struggle in school. Parents often complain that schools and teachers fail to treat children with ADHD as children with disabilities. Teachers may view them as willful, disobedient, and not trying hard enough. Thus, it is important to communicate with your teen's teachers to make sure they understand the true nature of the problem.


Hopefully, meeting with a child’s teachers will lead to a collaborative effort. Teachers can incorporate their professional experience with the parents’ knowledge of what works with their child. In doing so, you can produce a plan together by which the child can succeed, academically and behaviorally.Parents should discuss a variety of topics with teachers. This includes effective rewards and consequences, how to establish effective homework routines, how teachers will communicate on a regular basis about problems and successes, how parents can mirror what teachers are doing in the classroom for greater consistency, etc.

, As with chores and homework, school success for a student with ADHD will be more likely if there is a consistent routine. Do everything you can to help your teen establish a productive routine.For some students, success will come relatively easily with consistent schedules, routines, and homework communication.
Effective organizational tools such as planners, color-coded binders, and checklists can also help.

, Even with a consistent routine and helpful teachers, some students will need extra help.A variety of services re available to the students of parents who know how to get them. These range from extra time to take tests to self-contained classrooms with teachers and aides who are specially trained.Children qualify for free special education services based on one of two basic reasons. They must have a qualifying disability or have fallen far behind their peers academically.
If you feel that feel your teen needs more help, request a special education evaluation. You should make this request in writing.Beware the school that tells you ADHD is not a qualifying disability. Someone may tell you that ADHD is not listed in categories in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Category nine, however, is “other health impairment.” This is later defined as “… chronic or acute health problems such as asthma, attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder… which adversely affect a child’s educational performance.”, An Individual Education Plan (IEP) is a document created by school staff and parents. It spells out the academic, behavioral, and social goals of special-ed students. It specifies how results will be measured, specific interventions to achieve the goals, and so on.After providing documentation of your child’s ADHD diagnosis and a special education evaluation, you will take part in an IEP conference.
An IEP lists decisions about self-contained classrooms, percentage of time in mainstream classrooms, accommodations, discipline, testing, and more.
The school is legally bound to follow the guidelines laid down in the IEP. Teachers failing to follow the IEP open themselves and the school up to lawsuits.
The school also must invite parents to regular IEP conferences to evaluate the progress of the child and the effectiveness of the plan. Adjust the plan as needed.
An initial IEP makes it easier to establish special education services when changing schools.

, When any child turns 16, it’s time to look at what needs are looming as he or she moves beyond the secondary school setting. When children on IEPs reach age 16, the focus of the paperwork changes toward transition services.You can help facilitate this process.


Many teens with ADHD need special college preparation guidance. This includes searching for the right institution that will support specific needs. It also covers obtaining accommodations for testing, and deciding how to address special needs during the application process.
High school students with ADHD may be behind their peers in life skills areas.They may not know how to open a checking account, arrange for car insurance, negotiate a sales price, read a cell phone contract, or establish a monthly budget, for example. These are concerns for all teenagers to master. For those ADHD, schools may be able to provide extra guidance.
Those with ADHD also need to be able to monitor their mental health needs. Can they schedule appointments as needed with primary care physicians, therapists, and medication managers? Do they know what medications they take, when and how to take them, and when and how to refill them? These and other questions are important to address, in conjunction with the school's IEP based services.
Sexual development is also often a concern. Struggles with cause-and-effect thinking combine with impulsivity to create a “perfect storm” situation. Some schools have programs to introduce students to the responsibilities of parenthood. They may also provide contraceptive and/or abstinence information. Teens with ADHD need strong guidance to help navigate these rough waters.

, After high school ends, your teenager will need to either continue his or her education, or enter the career world. You can provide guidance that makes these decisions easier. Here are some insights that may help you.


College is not for everyone. Some students with ADHD will be happier avoiding college and seeking a trade school or other career path. Having ADHD, however does not mean college is out of the question.
All colleges have student support services, but it is up to students to initiate those services. Colleges might not ask applicants if they require or desire accommodations or other supports. It is important for the student with ADHD learn what help is available and get the ball rolling before classes begin.Several colleges have strong structures to guide students with ADHD. They help with achieving academic success and in learning more about succeeding in their chosen career fields.
Most students with ADHD may find attending college less stressful and more successful if they do not have to move too far from home.Having a strong, supportive structure at their college also helps them compensate. Selecting a smaller college where your teen will not feel overwhelmed may also help.

, Vocational training may be the answer for some students with ADHD. It is a great option for those who do better at learning hands-on than from traditional academic teaching.Vocational schools (also known as trade schools or career colleges) provide hands-on, technical training and certification in a variety of fields. Many community colleges offer vocational training in short certification or longer two-year associate-degree programs.
These options may give students the qualifications they need to work as electricians, plumbers, mechanics, veterinary technicians, graphic designers, secretaries, and in in many other fields.
Some of these programs, once completed, may be credited by some universities toward a four-year degree.
Work with high school and/or college guidance counselors when choosing vocational programs.

, Entering the military may be a viable option for some teens with ADHD. It is often a good fit for those who thrive under tight structure and would benefit from vocational training.


In the past, ADHD was an automatic disqualifier for U.S. military service. Today, new guidelines allow adults with ADHD who have not taken medication in a year or more and who do not “demonstrate significant impulsivity or inattention” to enlist in the U.S. military."

For older individuals, only five are necessary. The first set of symptoms relate to problems with attention or focus. They include:making careless mistakes, being inattentive to detail
having trouble paying attention (tasks, playing)
not seeming to pay attention when someone is talking
not following through on homework, chores, or jobs; easily sidetracked
being organizationally challenged
avoiding tasks requiring sustained focus
not keeping track of or often losing items such as keys, glasses, etc.
being easily distracted
frequently forgetting things;
, The other category ADHD symptoms relate to hyperactivity or a lack of impulse control. Watch for the following:fidgeting or squirming; tapping hands or feet
feeling restless; running or climbing inappropriately
struggling to stay quiet
talking excessively
blurting out answers before questions are asked
struggling to wait for his or her turn
interrupting others

, The brain of a person with ADHD is slightly different than others. Two structures in particular tend to be smaller: the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex.The basal ganglia controls the movement of muscles. It signals which should be working and which should be at rest at any given time.For example, if a child is sitting at a desk in the classroom, the basal ganglia should send a message telling the feet to stay still. In the case of ADHD, the feet may not recieve the message. As such, they might remain in motion. A deficiency of the basal ganglia can also sometimes cause fidgety hand movements. For example, people with ADHD may tap a pencil on a desk, or drum their fingers.
The prefrontal cortex is important for conducting higher-order tasks.It is where memory, learning, and attention regulation come together. This area is essential for intellectual functions.The prefrontal cortex plays an important role in regulating the neurotransmitter dopamine.Dopamine affects your ability to focus and is usually at lower levels in persons with ADHD.Serotonin is another neurotransmitter related to the prefrontal cortex.It affects mood, sleep, and appetite. When serotonin drops too low, depression and anxiety result.Lower levels of dopamine and serotonin can make it harder to focus.As a result, people with ADHD struggle to focus on one thing at a time, and are more easily distracted., ADHD often occurs alongside other mental-health problems. This is called ""comorbidity.""One in five people with ADHD also have some other serious disorder. Depression and bipolar disorder are most common.
One in three children with ADHD also have a behavioral disorder. These include conduct disorder and oppositional defiance disorder.Learning disabilities and anxiety also commonly appear alongside ADHD., If you or a loved one has many of these traits, you should see a doctor to get a professional opinion. Knowing if ADHD could be the cause of these difficulties will help you choose the right treatment.

, For most people with ADHD, medication is an important part of treatment. There are two categories of ADHD medication: stimulants (such as methylphenidate and amphetamine) and non-stimulants (such as guanfacine and atomoxetine).Using stimulants to treat ADHD may not seem like it makes much sense. The parts of the brain they stimulate, however, are responsible for impulse control and focus.Stimulants like Ritalin, Concerta, and Adderall can help regulate neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine.
Non-stimulant anti-depression medications often used to treat ADHD regulate the same neurotransmitters. However, they do so via a different chemical process.Doctors may prescribe them if stimulants don't work or have harsh side-effects.Deciding on the right medication can be challenging. Different people respond differently to different medications.The effectiveness of some medications can also change during growth spurts, hormonal fluctuations, diet and weight changes, and with the passage of time. The best way to choose the right medication is through conversation with your doctor. Remember that if something doesn't seem to be working, you can talk to your doctor about trying a different option.
Some medications are available in extended-release varieties. They release active ingredients gradually over the course of the day. This eliminates the need to take additional doses at school or work., Some foods can reduce the effects of the hormonal deficiencies that are typically part of ADHD. Here are some suggestions


Complex carbohydrates can increase serotonin levels. This can mean improved mood, sleep, and appetite.Try to eat foods like whole grains, green vegetables, starchy vegetables, and beans. These foods release energy gradually.Avoid simple carbs like sugars, honey, jelly, candy, soda, etc.These can produces a short-term serotonin spike,but do more harm than good over the long run.
A diet rich in protein can improve focus. Try to include several proteins over the course of the day to keep dopamine levels high.Good sources of protein include meat, fish, nuts, legumes and beans.Take zinc. Zinc promotes lower levels of hyperactivity and impulsivity.Eat seafood, poultry, fortified cereals and other foods with a high zinc content, and/or take zinc supplements.
Eating certain spices may also help. Saffron may counter depression, while cinnamon can help with attention and focus., Other foods can sometimes make the condition worse. For example:


Avoid “bad fats” such as trans fats and those found in fried foods, burgers, and pizza. Choose foods high in omega-3 fatty acids instead. Good sources include salmon, walnuts, and avocados.These may help lower hyperactivity and improve organizational skills.
Avoid food with dyes and food coloring. Some studies suggest there may be link between food dyes and ADHD symptoms.Red dye in particular may be a problem.
Reduce intake of wheat and dairy, sugar, processed foods, and additives. These foods may have a negative impact on ADHD symptoms., A good therapist can help you and/or your loved ones manage the challenges of ADHD. Therapy often begins by analyzing the family structure. The therapist will often suggest changes to create environment that works with the brain functions of a person with ADHD.


Therapy also provides a safe place for family members to vent their frustrations in a healthy way. It is a venue work out issues with professional guidance.Experts often recommend that preschoolers with ADHD receive behavioral therapy.This approach teaches people how to change behavior and control impulses.
Adults with ADHD generally benefit from psychotherapy.This helps them accept who they are while seeking improvements to their situation.
People with ADHD benefit greatly from learning more about their condition. Therapy helps them understand that they are not alone in their struggles.

, Exercise stimulates production of many of the same neurotransmitters as ADHD medication. Serious workouts are a great way to regulate your brain chemistry, but even a few 30 minute walks each week can make a big difference.Specifically, exercise stimulates production of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. All these can help boost attention and focus., People with ADHD are constantly trying to make sense of their environments. Organizing the home is a great way to start.


People with ADHD often have trouble remembering where they put things. Having designated bins, tubs, shelves, or hooks for different types of items can make life much easier.
This is especially important for children, who benefit from well organized bedrooms and play areas.
Help children stay organized by providing color coded bins and tubs.You can also label these with pictures or words describing the types of items that belong inside.Similar organizational techniques can also benefit adults in the workplace., People with ADHD also have trouble filtering out distractions in the environment. Here are a few tips for reducing distractions in the home or workplace.


Turn off the TV and stereo when you are not watching or listening. Both of these can be distracting. This is especially important when the person with ADHD is trying to focus or when you are trying to communicate with children.Adjust lighting. Lighting that creates shadows or unusual patterns can be distracting for people with ADHD.Make lighting in your home consistent, and replace flickering bulbs right away. Steer clear of fluorescent lighting, as the hum of the bulbs can also make it hard to concentrate.Avoid strong scents. Distinctive smells can also make it hard for someone with ADHD to focus.Avoid scented air fresheners, as well as perfumes and colognes.

, People with ADHD do well with consistent schedules. Doing the same thing at the same time and in the same place every day makes it easier to remember and focus on important tasks.


For children, having specific time set aside for homework and chores is helpful. It can also reduce arguments around these topics.
Breaking routine tasks down into small, manageable chunks also helps. People with ADHD have trouble holding lots of instructions in their head at the same time. Even things that seem simple can be simplified. For example loading the dishwasher can be broken up into loading the top rack, bottom rack, and silverware.For young people with ADHD, praise and small rewards at each step can help reinforce the pattern.For deviations, immediate and consistent discipline can also help.Make the sure the consequences for misbehavior are the same every time, and come quickly after the behavior.
Creating structure during school breaks is especially important for children and teens.Encourage them to join organized activities that have regular meetings. Good examples include summer stock plays, sports teams, or clubs.

, Keeping a planner or calendar can be very helpful for people with ADHD. This can be a place to record the daily routine, as well as specific tasks like homework or work meetings.


A planner is most helpful if you check and update it often.You can use apps or online planners with visible or audible reminders to make sure you don't forget appointments or scheduled tasks.
For children, its a good idea to ask teachers to initial the planner each day to make sure the student has recorded homework correctly.

, Schools provide many services for children with ADHD. These services range from extra time on exams to self-contained classrooms with specially trained teachers and aides.Communicate with teachers to make sure they understand the nature of the child's condition. Some teachers mistake ADHD for stubbornness or a bad attitude.
Request a special education evaluation. This will allow you to work with the school to create an Individual Education Plan (IEP) for the student. This document specifies goals for the student, as well as interventions and strategies for reaching those goals.Make sure to submit the evaluation request in writing.You'll create an IEP in conferences with school officials. Do not allow the school to pressure you into signing a ""one-size-fits-all"" IEP. It should be tailored to the needs of the individual student., There are also may services available for people with ADHD who are seeking employment. These are available through schools, state agencies, and non-profit organizations.


A variety of transitional services are available to help school-aged children apply for college, trade school, or jobs. This includes help with filling out applications, interviewing, and independent living. Transitional services should be the focus of IEPs for students over the age of 16.All states in the US offer vocational rehabilitation (VR) services. These are services for people with disabilities who need help seeking or maintaining employment.VR counselors can sometimes help with financial assistance to a college or vocational training school. For example, a VR program might sponsor truck-driving classes to get a commercial driver's license. Look on your state government's website to see what services are available.
Other VR services might include computer of job skills training. A VR program might provide hearing aids or other adaptive technology. It might also offer help completing applications or creating resumes, and practicing interviewing skills., People with ADHD often struggle to keep jobs. Issues with focus, time management, and sometimes social skills create barriers to gainful employment. Here are a few tips for getting help:


Communicate with supervisors and coworkers about the limitations that come with ADHD. If they know about the condition, they are more likely to be compassionate and make allowances for it.VR services also provide training that can make it easier to function at work. They can help with job skills and organization. Again, check the state's website to see what services are available.You can hire a job coach who will walk through your workday with you. This person will look for problems and make recommendations to you and your boss for making your work more efficient and productive.VR services often provide or pay for job coaching. Non-profit organizations in your area may also provide this service.

Keep electronic distractions to a minimum.,
Control the lighting.,
Minimize use of strong scents.,
Create organizational systems.",How to Treat ADHD Naturally in Children3," Children with ADHD have a hard time focusing. They find it difficult to filter out environmental stimuli. You can help by simplifying the environment. Keep electronic distractions at home to a minimum.Keep the the television off when your aren't watching it. This goes double when trying to communicate something important to the child.
Don't play music when the child is trying to focus on a task.
Keep your phone on silent to avoid the distraction of incoming text messages, etc.

, Unusual lighting can also distract people with ADHD.Try to keep lighting in your home uniform and adequate.


Shadows or unusual light patterns can cause distraction, as can flickering bulbs.

, Even smells can make it harder for someone with ADHD to concentrate.Remove strong-smelling items from your home.


This includes candles, scented air fresheners, and even strong perfumes and colognes.

, People with ADHD are constantly trying to make sense of their environments. Parents can help by organizing the home for success.


It is most important to organize the child's room and play area.
Establish a storage system that separates items into categories and reduces crowding.
Consider color-coded storage cubes and wall hooks, as well as open shelves. Use picture or word labels to remind your child what goes where.Get separate storage tubs for different toys and school supplies. Label each with pictures of the type of items that belong inside. Separate clothing so that socks have their own drawer with a picture of a sock on it, and so on.Keep a box or a storage bin in a central location of the home. Use it to collect your child’s toys, gloves, papers, and other miscellany that might otherwise spread all over the place. It will be easier for the child with ADHD to empty that bucket than to pick up all his or her things from the living room.You also might establish a rule that the third time you find an object in the living room unattended, it gets confiscated for a week. Or, if the bucket gets full, a lid will be put on it and it’ll vanish for a while with all those special treasures inside. This will create incentives for your child to remember to pick up.

Set a schedule.,
Break routine tasks down into parts.,
Use reminders.,
Reward successes.,
Include exercise in the schedule.,
Get more sleep.,
Get extra help at school.,
Discipline appropriately.",How to Treat ADHD Naturally in Children4," Routine is extremely important for children with ADHD. It helpful for them to have a schedule they may refer to. This tells them where they are supposed to be or what they are supposed to be doing, and makes life much easier.A routine can establish specific times for chores and homework. This helps the child to accomplish these tasks. It can also reduce stress for the child and lead to more successes. In so doing, it can help a child build self-esteem, which is often a problem for children with ADHD.A clear routine also reduces conflict about doing homework and chores.
Be as consistent as possible, with scheduled tasks occurring in the same time and place every day.

, Children with ADHD need tasks to be chopped into steps. This sometimes called ""chunking.""Steps should be given either one at a time or in written form. Set up routines that reflect consistent instructions. Ask the child to repeat the instructions.
Offer praise at the completion of each step.For example, imagine your child is responsible for doing the laundry. You might instruct him or her as follows: First find all the pants and put them into a stack here. (“Awesome!”) Now put shirts in a stack there. (“Super!”). Then have the child fold each stack, then put the stacks in his or her room, one stack at a time.

, Provide your child with tangible reminders of the routine to help him or her stay on track. This makes it harder for the child to forget what he or she is supposed to be doing. For example:


Give the child a planner with their daily schedule written in it.She or he can also use it to write down homework assignments.
Get a calendar or chore board for your home that specifies when tasks need to be done.
Check items off the list as they are completed, and offer praise each time.

, Children with ADHD tend to feel like they are always doing the wrong thing. You can build self-esteem and encourage good behavior by rewarding their successes.


In addition to praise, you can give rewards in the form of small tangible items, like small toys or stickers.
Some people have found a point system works well. This is a structure in which children earn points for good behavior. They can spend those points on special privileges, like a trip to the movies.You can assign points for activities that are part of the daily schedule.This builds self-esteem through repeated success, while also reinforcing the routine.

, Make exercising a scheduled part of your child's daily routine. Whether it's running some laps or playing a sport, movement and exercise can help reduce behavioral problems.


Exercise increases blood-flow to the brain. This can help improve the function of areas that control behavior, planning, thinking and emotions.Exercise also causes the brain to release neurotransmitters such as dopamine. These brain chemicals help control impulsive behavior. They are the same substances that many ADHD medications stimulate the brain to produce., Research has shown that more sleep can help ease and treat ADHD in children. Even just a half-hour of extra sleep can keep kids from being restless at school and improve their behavior. Conversely, cutting back on sleep can result in tears, tantrums and frustration.

, When your child is at school, you can't be there to make sure he or she is following the routine. As such, you'll need to take steps to make sure others are monitoring your child.


Communicate with teachers. It is important that your child's teachers understand his or her condition. They should work with you to ensure that a productive routine continues at school.
Get your child evaluated for special education. Request an evaluation in writing.This, along with an ADHD diagnosis, makes your child eligible for special services. This could include extra time on exams. It could also mean access to self-contained classrooms with specially trained teachers and aides.
Work with teachers to create an individualized education plan (IEP). After your child qualifies for special assistance, you will participate in an IEP conference. School staff and parents work together to create this document. It spells out the academic, behavioral, and social goals of special-ed students. It specifies how results will be determined and specific interventions that will used to achieve the goals.An IEP can help create a structured routine for your child during the school day.

, When your child breaks the routine in a serious way, you may need to punish him or her. Here are some tips for effective discipline that can help keep the routine on track.


Be consistent. Make sure you give out the same consequences every time a certain violation occurs.Do not allow persistence or begging to deter you.
Be timely. Dole out the consequences immediately.Children with ADHD have short attention spans. They may not be able to understand a consequence that occurs long after the undesired behavior.Be powerful. Make sure the consequences are significant enough that the child will care about them.Weak consequences do little to reinforce the routine.
Be calm. Don't get angry or worked up when disciplining your child. This may send a message that your child can manipulate you through bad behavior."

Make an appointment with a child psychiatrist or a doctor.,
Take your child to the appointment.,
Have your child undergo a medical exam.,
Answer any questions the psychiatrist or doctor asks.,
Ask questions yourself.,
See more than one specialist.",How to Test for ADD2," If you worry your child may have ADD, make an appointment with a child psychiatrist. Only a trained mental health professional or doctor will be able to test for the condition.


Prepare for the appointment ahead of time. Make a list of your child's symptoms and any difficulty he or she has in school. Take stock of personal information regarding your child, including any recent changes that may affect his or her behavior.Make sure you know all your child's medications, including any vitamins or herbs you give your child. Such things can potentially affect your child's behaviors, causing symptoms similar to ADD.If your child has been tested for ADD or other mental health disorders before, bring any evaluations you have with you. Sometimes, schools may do testing for ADD and then recommend your child see a psychiatrist., On the scheduled day, bring your child to his or her doctor's office. Be open with your child about what's going on but phrase things in non-judgmental terms.


It's important to phrase things in non-judgmental terms for your child. You do not want your child to feel stigmatized for having a mental health issue. Instead of saying something like, ""We're going to the doctor to see what's wrong"" try something like, ""We're going to the doctor to see how we can help you.""
Evaluations for ADD are primarily a matter of information gathering. A doctor or psychiatrist will ask your child a lot of questions. If your child is too young to answer or understand all the questions, you may have to step in and help on occasion.Your doctor or psychiatrist may give you a series of questionnaires regarding your child's behavior. These will have to be filled out by family members, teachers, and babysitters.As a lot of information must be gathered to diagnose ADD, it's unlikely that a single appointment will be enough. You'll usually be asked to come back for a follow up, with all the information you and your child were asked to fill out., Symptoms of ADD can be caused by underlying medical conditions. To rule out a medical cause, your child will have to have a basic physical. Depending on the child's age and medical history, additional exams or blood work may be required.Your child’s vision and hearing may also be evaluated if there are any concerns.

, Your psychiatrist or doctor will ask you a variety of questions about your child's behavior. Strive to answer all questions to the best of your ability.


You will be asked about symptoms of other mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, or conduct disorders. These can cause symptoms that are similar to ADD, and may often go along with ADD as well.
You will be asked basic questions about your child's behavior. Your doctor will want to know when the troubling behavior started, how severe the behavior is, and whether it occurs all the time or only in certain situations.The doctor will also ask about your child's eating, drinking, and sleeping habits. He or she will want to know whether your child gets enough sleep, whether your child consumes caffeine, and whether your child's diet is high in sugar.You will also be asked about your discipline methods as a parent and the typical daily routine in your home.Keep in mind symptoms must be ongoing for at least 6 months to warrant an ADD diagnosis.Symptoms that have been occurring for a short period only could be the result of a variety of factors, like changes to your household or routine.

, You should ask questions. ADD can be a confusing disorder and difficult to deal with as a parent. Have some questions ready when going into an appointment.


You will probably have questions about how to proceed if your child does have ADD. Ask your doctor about the various treatment options and what resources are available for parents.If you're considering medication for your child, be sure to ask about side effects and the best means to administer medication.Ask for printed materials or website recommendations you can use to learn more about ADD., Diagnosing ADD is a long process. In order to help get the big picture, you'll need to see a variety of specialists in addition to your child's regular physician.


Clinical psychologists, social workers, school psychiatrists, teachers, learning specialists, and others involved in a child's life and education will be consulted to make a diagnosis. Learning and language disorders can also have symptoms that are similar to ADD and may also affect how it is treated, so your child's teachers and other school personnel can help with the evaluation and treatment of ADD. As a parent, providing as much information as you can regarding your child's behavior, schedule, and symptoms can help the process.Be proactive about getting your child diagnosed. If your child does have ADD, the sooner a diagnosis is made the better. Check in with any doctors or specialists you see to get test results and assessments. Make appointments with any specialists recommended by your doctor as soon as you can. Call your child's school and speak to the principal. Be open about the fact you are trying to determine if your child has ADD. By law, public schools are required to assist you in these matters.During the course of diagnosis, there will be a variety of test taking an information gathering. Your child will likely have to take standardized screenings for ADD. He or she may also need to take a basic IQ test and psychological tests that measure social adjustment. A family medical history is important to diagnosis as are interviews with a child's teachers, babysitters, and other caregivers. You can help by staying up-to-date on what information is needed. Try your best to provide this information at the request of doctors and specialists."

Before your appointment, make a list of your symptoms. You should also include any problems at work, home, or school that these symptoms cause.List personal information about yourself that may be relevant. For example, any major changes in your life can cause symptoms similar to ADD.List your medications. Certain medications can cause side effects that are similar to ADD., At your appointment, you'll likely be asked a variety of questions about your behavior and lifestyle. These will help your doctor or psychiatrist figure out whether an ADD diagnosis is appropriate.


Your doctor will ask about when your problems concentrating started. He or she will also ask whether these problems are continual or only happen on occasion. Your doctor will also want to know the level to which such problems have affected your health and well-being.Your doctor will also want some personal history from you. He or she will ask about your childhood and any traumatic experiences you've undergone in the past. Such things can affect your behavior and change the nature of your diagnosis.Your doctor will also want basic information about things like your diet, sleep habit, stress level, and work., Certain medical conditions, including other mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression, can cause symptoms similar to ADD. Your doctor might want to test for these conditions before making a diagnosis. What tests you will need depends on your personal medical history. Your doctor may request basic blood work to rule out other medical problems.In order to be diagnosed with ADD as an adult, you need to have shown symptoms of the disorder as a child. If you remember displaying symptoms of ADD when you were younger, such as struggling to concentrate in school, mention this to your doctor., If you are diagnosed with ADD, you will likely have a lot of questions about your diagnosis. Make sure you ask your doctor about your treatment options, medications, side effects of medication, and for resources you can use to learn about your condition."

A behavior therapist can work with you (and/or your child) to create a plan that leads to better outcomes in behavior and productivity. A behavior therapist may work to modify responses to anger, use role playing, social skills modeling, and activities to promote focus.Meet with a behavior therapist to create a behavior plan and track progress over several weeks.


For more information, check out How to Get the Most out of Behavioral Therapy.;
, The therapist will ask what desired behaviors or goals are needed. Think beyond “I want better behavior” or “I want to punish my child less.” Reflect on where the struggles are, such as completing homework or work projects. Then, set small goals. You can set goals for getting work done (“Work for 20 minutes, then I get a break”) or for behavior (“Share toys with your friends” or “decrease impulsivity during playtime.”)Think about what goals you may have, then try to break them into smaller parts. For instance, you may want a clean room. Break this into smaller parts by saying, “All shoes will be put away, all laundry in the basket, toys picked up off the floor, and bed made each day.”

, Work with the therapist to encourage immediate success. Criteria for rewards can become harder as the program continues, but keep motivation high in the beginning to encourage following the program.Have small prizes to begin with, such as a little toy or sweet treat (like an ice cream cone) as a reward for completing basic positive behavior.

, Decide what behaviors to reinforce and which behaviors to not reinforce. Then, brainstorm motivating incentives and/or consequences for completing (or not completing) tasks. Providing rewards or positive reinforcement is motivating and will encourage more positive behaviors.For children, some people use sticker charts, which allow the child to earn a sticker for positive behaviors displayed.
Rewards can be small toys or objects (which are good for small children, who respond best to immediate reinforcement), or a point system to save up for larger prizes (good for older children).. For adults or older teens, the reinforcement can be a treat (like an ice cream cone or brownie), or the ability to save up and purchase a desired item. Children may want to choose their own rewards, which can be beneficial in motivation.
Consequences can include taking away certain privileges (no tv if homework is not completed), or deducting points if using a point system.

, The key to implementing behavior modification systems (like a point system or behavior chart) is consistency. Don’t start the behavior system then gradually forget about it. Be consistent and persist with enforcing the behavior system. A behavior therapist will check in on the system each week during therapy. Respond to positive behaviors as they occur; don’t let time go by without positively reinforcing good behaviors in the moment. The faster you reinforce positive behaviors, the better connection is made to continue positive behavior.
Make time each day to go over the day’s behaviors, and discuss what can be improved. For instance, praise a good day filled with many positive behaviors. If one day does not include many good behaviors, discuss what can be improved upon for the next day.

, Behavior therapy is often useless if it’s only discussed and implemented for one hour each week during therapy. It’s important to bring the learned skills home. Many people with ADHD find it hard to stay on task and complete goals. Distraction is far too easy and before you know it, you’re in the middle of another task. Keep life simplified by having a daily schedule. Know your morning, afternoon, and evening routine, and keep it the same and predictable.This goes for children, too. Have a morning and after-school schedule in place so that the child knows what to expect. Keep motivations in the schedule, like setting aside 30 minutes of tv time once homework is completed.
The more predictable the day is, the better someone with ADHD will follow through and accomplish goals.

, Use bins, storage containers, baskets, or anything else that keeps you organized. If you constantly lose certain items (such as your keys or your cell phone), have a place for them in your home where they always go. For a child, have toy bins that help your child to know which toys go where. Sort clothes so that it’s easy to put them away.


For more information, check out How to Organize Your Life.

, Place clocks throughout the house so that you (or your child) can stay aware of how much time is left to get ready or to finish homework before dinner.Use a timer to motivate work getting done, such as homework or projects. Set the timer, and provide a small reward when the timer goes off.


If a task seems to big to manage, break it down into smaller parts. Use a timer to work for 20 minutes, then take a break for five minutes.

, This helps keep out distractions and allows for better concentration. Turn off the tv and have the workspace in a room away from noise or other people. If music is wanted, keep it with minimal or no lyrics, but something relaxing and not distracting.

, If you have a request for your child, make it clear that you are directing it to him or her. Say the request clearly and simply. It’s not enough to ask your child to “be good”; be specific in your speech and make sure that he or she understands.Say, “Aaron, please stand next to me” or “Sheila, please do not touch anything in the grocery aisle.”
A behavior therapist can help you practice or rehearse how to communicate more clearly with a child.

, When a child wants something, like to watch tv or play with toys while in the middle of homework, gently remind that the child that he or she must complete the task at hand first. Then, once the task is completed, he or she can have the reward.Be firm and communicate simply with the child, then drop the discussion so he or she cannot continue to try and get what is desired.


Say, “Yes, you can play with your dinosaurs when you finish your homework” or “Yes, first you will put away your toys, then you can have your dessert.”

, If you want a child to behave a certain way, model the appropriate behavior for your child. If your child has a difficult time monitoring aggression during interactions, show your child what kind and non-aggressive interactions look like. If you want a child to be less messy, model picking up your things before moving on to a different activity.If the child has siblings, have them model good behaviors as well. If you’re working on your child putting his or her shoes away, have everyone in the family put shoes away in a quick and organized fashion.
If you’re struggling to model target behavior, ask the behavior therapist to model it for you.

, A behavior modification system designed for a 3 year old will not work as effectively once the child is 5. Adjust the system as the child grows. Modify rewards and also target behaviors. Make sure the system continues to motivate the child to working toward positive behaviors.Younger children often respond well to immediate rewards and feedback, like a small toy. If your child begins to lose interest, ask for input on rewards. As the child gets older, he or she may want larger prizes, which can be earned with points.
The therapist will monitor progress and see if adjustments need to be made.

, Children respond to consistency in their environment. Talk to your child’s school teacher and inquire whether a behavior system is used at school, and if not, how you can help your child succeed in school by using a behavior system. Especially if your child struggles to complete assignments at school or has difficulty with impulsivity or social skills, a behavior system can help. The more it aligns with the system at home, the more consistent and predictable the plan, and the better the child can adhere.Ask a behavior therapist what recommendations he or she may have for following a behavior modification program at school. It may include reinforcing when the child raises his or her hand versus blurting answers out, waiting patiently in line, or not rushing through tests but taking one’s time.

Join the Feingold Association.,
Clean out your pantry and fridge using the Feingold Food list or the following guidelines.

,
Get rid of all food coloring (dyes) (Blue Lake 5, Red 40, etc).,
Get rid of all artificial flavors (including vanillin – imitation vanilla).,
Get rid of artificial sweeteners (Splenda, Equal, Nutra-sweet, etc).,
Get rid of the petroleum based preservatives BHA, BHT, TBHQ.,Get rid of synthetic fragrances (look for lotions, bubble bath, laundry soap, candles, air fresheners, dryer sheets…)

,
Replace all the stuff you just got rid of with natural versions.,
Now about the foods: Some Feingold members find that in addition to having issues with synthetic additives they also have problems with some foods which would otherwise be healthy for the general public.",How to Treat ADD/ADHD with the Feingold Association," The program can be partially implemented by following the rest of the instructions (and not joining), but results may not be satisfactory due the presence of hidden additives and failure to eliminate potential problem foods. Read further down for more details on this.;
,, This is not just all the neon colored cereal and candy. Dyes are in many unlikely places such as marshmallows (blue), pickles (yellow, blue), frozen pie shells (yellow), waffles (yellow), toothpaste(red). Take a hard look at EVERYTHING, even things appearing to be white or pale in color. Note: carmine coloring, annatto, titanium dioxide and caramel color can be listed as “artificial” but they are actually okay.

, Again, it’s not just in the obvious places. Read all labels carefully. Desserts and sweet treats are especially prone to artificial flavors, but they can be in items like bacon or breads.

, If low-calorie sweeteners are desired, use stevia or agave syrup.

, Other preservatives such as sodium benzoate, sodium nitrate, and so forth may be problematic, but do not need to be avoided initially. This is where joining Feingold is really important for success in managing ADD/ADHD with diet. Labeling laws are not consistent for these preservatives and they can be hidden in other ingredients or sprayed on packing materials. Without contacting the manufacturers (which is what Feingold does for you), you can’t be sure. The most common sources of hidden preservatives: Vitamin A fortification: breads, cereals, dairy products… Oils: shortening/hydrogenated oils, frying oils, pan sprays …. Packaging sprays: shelled nuts, cereal, string cheese… sausages, pepperoni, etc

,, Use the Feingold food list or read those labels carefully. This is not as bad as you think. Given any product on the grocery store shelf there is almost always at least one natural version. Some specialty items (e.g. marshmallows) might require a trip to the “health food” store (or natural foods isle in your regular store). When in doubt, organic items are generally free from synthetic additives, although they tend to be more expensive and are not a requirement for the program.

, If this seems strange to you, think about peanut allergies: Most people are just fine with peanuts, but some have a real problem. Information on which foods to try avoiding is provided for free on the Feingold web-site and is too extensive to go into in this article. This is another reason to join the Feingold Association: it is very difficult to avoid some or all of the potential problem foods if you use any processed items due to labels listing things like “spices” and “natural flavors”. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell whether avoiding the foods is worth the effort unless you try it. The standard Feingold Association advice is to eliminate the foods initially and then re-introduce them. However, the opposite approach can also be taken, which is to not eliminate the foods unless just eliminating the additives does not achieve the desired effect. This is not suggested due to the fact that it may significantly lengthen the time until results are seen and may lead you to the conclusion that the Feingold program is not working. If there is sufficient family resistance to eliminating the foods, then it is probably better than not trying at all.

By law, your teachers are required to adhere to any accommodations listed in the letter.
This could include things like no penalties for arriving late to class, extended deadlines on homework assignments, or even being allowed to take quizzes and tests in a quiet place without distractions.;
, Some students with ADD work better with a lighter load, and there's no shame in that. Others might find that they can handle the average amount or even more, and it is up to you to find the number of classes that suits you best. If you are taking a bunch of classes, and you feel you can handle it, do not let people tell you that you are incapable of managing it.


Like a non-disabled student, if you feel stressed about the workload, you might want to lighten the amount that you take.
Try not to do things that overwhelm you, or make you feel uncomfortable. For some, for example, taking classes back to back might be too much, and scheduling them further apart might be helpful.
Consider the amount of reading and homework for each class that you take.

, Physical classrooms can pose challenges for people with ADD. You may find yourself distracted by other students. Sitting still may also be quite difficult for you. But an online class may be easier because you can study at your own pace and do not have the distractions of other aspects of college life.


Try creating a study space that is separate from where you usually do fun things (such as browsing the internet or going on social media). This can help you remember to stay on track.

, This may coincide with when your medications are in full effect. In the evening, the medications may start to ""wear out,"" making it harder to study or pay attention.Schedule yourself downtime when you know you'll have a hard time focusing. Treat this as a mandatory mental health break, so you can enjoy your free time with no guilt.

, People with ADD often have trouble managing too many things at once, so try to avoid doing too much at one time. Be mindful of how many tasks you are trying to accomplish and minimize how many things you allow yourself to focus on or stress out about.


The number of classes you can handle may vary based on the difficulty of your classes. Learn which classes are notorious for being hard and assigning lots of work, so you can be prepared.

, An important way for you to reduce your stress levels during college will be to work on staying organized. Try making checklists to help you keep track of assignments and appointments as well as other tasks you need to complete.Planning ahead and keeping track of deadlines will help you minimize stress.

, This is especially important if you are hyperactive. You might say things that may offend people, talk too much, and do other quirks that might bother other people.Of course, only discuss your condition with your roommates if you are comfortable with it. Your medical conditions are no one else’s business unless you choose to tell them about it.

, Music that is too loud, such as rap, can be distracting for people with ADD. This is especially true when you are trying to focus on something like when you are studying.


Instead, try to listen to more calm, soothing music like classical or country.

, College is an exciting time of transition, but it also means more adult responsibility. One of the biggest problems for college students with ADD is figuring out where to get their medications. This is something you should discuss with your parents or your insurance provider. Find a pharmacy that works for you and your medication needs., If you have Attention Deficit Disorder, you might often struggle with your ability to concentrate on the task at hand. You might be easily distracted by other things going on around you and become bored easily.This symptom might be noticeable if you zone out while doing other things (even when having conversations) or if you have difficulty focusing when you are reading or listening to someone speak.
If you have ADD, you might be categorized as a poor listener because you may have trouble focusing on one thing at a time – like when someone is talking to you.Because it may be hard for you to focus and you become distracted easily, you might often overlook details in your work and struggle to complete even seemingly simple tasks.

, Since people with ADD usually have trouble concentrating fully on certain tasks, you might frequently appear forgetful and disorganized. You may struggle with beginning and finishing projects because you procrastinate. Some signs of this symptom include losing or misplacing important objects (wallet, phone, keys, etc.), constantly being late or forgetting important deadlines, and missing appointments altogether.

, For people with ADD, a common side effect is trouble focusing on a single task. In situations like this, you might act impulsively. This is often because you struggle with controlling or inhibiting your behavior.You might interrupt others or say something inappropriate because you spoke before thinking.
You might have poor self-control or addictive tendencies.

, Even though ADD is often diagnosed by a person’s inability to focus on tasks at hand, another symptom of the disability is that you can become overly focused on tasks that you find stimulating or interesting. If you are hyperfocused on a task, you tune out everything else around you and often lose track of time. This can be very useful, but can also result in not finishing things that you need to because you are so focused on the one thing you are doing.
This symptom can be managed with tools such as a light-up timer, that will tell you when it's time to switch gears.

, If you struggle with ADD, you might have trouble dealing with your emotions. This can manifest through irritability and mood swings, or even through a short temper.


You might have feelings of insecurity and low self-esteem.
You often feel stressed about your life and become flustered easily.
Sometimes you might not respond well to criticism, even if it is well-intentioned.

, This symptom is similar to how children with ADD are usually diagnosed. Even adults who suffer from this disorder typically show signs of hyperactivity or restlessness. You might appear to have a lot of energy and trouble staying still.If you have ADD, you might feel like your mind is constantly racing.

, If you have ADD and it is making your life harder, one of the best things you can do is to go see your doctor. Getting properly diagnosed by a medical professional will help you figure out what steps are next.A doctor can also prescribe you medication for ADD that could significantly improve your ability to function.
You can also take an online ADD test to compare your own symptoms with common symptoms of ADD.But this kind of test should never be used as a substitute for advice from a real medical professional.

, Medications are no miracle cure, but they help improve the symptoms. If your doctor prescribes you some medication for ADD, make sure you follow through with taking it. Remember to take it at the desired time daily.


The most common prescribed medication for people with Attention Deficit Disorder is Adderall., Seeing a counselor regularly about your ADD can significantly improve your ability to handle your condition and cope with the symptoms. Therapists usually employ cognitive behavioral therapy to help you change negative thinking patterns, specifically those related to your condition.Counseling could help you improve your self-esteem, learn how to manage your time more effectively, improve your relationships, or cope with other difficulties in your life.

Consult a doctor about medication.,
Make studying fun.,
Limit the distractions when you study.,
Know how you learn best.,
Choose study materials that you love.,
Read a lot.,
Understand your disorder.,
Don't be afraid to take notes anytime.",How to Study with ADHD," ADHD is a treatable disorder and there are several prescription options available to help you deal with it. These medications can help you focus and work better during the day, mitigating or eliminating the effects of your ADHD. See a doctor to discuss your options.;
, Studying is easier, faster, and more effective when you're interested in what you're doing, and if the material isn't quite compelling enough for you, design study methods that will hold your interest. For example, make studying for a test a game. Write questions and their answers down on flash cards, and include appropriate point values for each question, with more points for harder questions. Then have someone quiz you, keeping track of the points you earn - or compete with friends in the style of a game show like Jeopardy. Award prizes to the winner, or set a larger goal that will take you several study sessions to achieve.

, ADHD makes you very easily distracted, making it hard for you to focus on your studies, so limit this by getting rid of as many distractions as possible. Turn off the TV and music so that you can focus on your notes. Study in a quiet place, keep your work area clean, and put away any toys or other objects.

, Some people can learn all the material just by reading their notes. For most people, however, this is not enough. Try writing down all the information you want to remember. This forces you to actually pay attention to it, rather than letting it go in one ear and out the other. For more visual people, it can help to make charts or draw pictures. Viewing it from another perspective makes you understand it better, and drawing it out helps you internalize the information more effectively.

, Buy a notebook with a cool design or your favorite Disney characters on the cover. If you love the design, you'll be happy to carry it around everywhere, and you'll be more inclined to use and study from it. Similarly, having pencils and pens, erasers, and textbook covers that you enjoy will make you want to use them. With these materials, studying will be more fun and less of a chore.

, Reading has all kinds of benefits: it makes you better at spelling and grammar, it helps your comprehension and focus, and it makes you a better writer, no matter what you read. Choose books, articles, and any other written material that you genuinely enjoy. This will make reading fun and make you want to read more and more often. You'll start to love reading, and this will help your focus and attention span, even when reading materials for school.

, Although your ADHD makes it hard for you to study and learn well, this doesn't mean that you are stupid or lazy. People who don't understand your disorder might tell you these things, or that you're not capable of keeping up with other students, but know that this is not true. It is more difficult for you because there are more ideas and distractions bouncing around in your head, but with perseverance and a little extra work, you can excel in school.

, If it helps you, carry around a notebook with you at all times and jot down anything you need to keep track of: what you need to get at the store, when and where you're meeting a friend, your homework for that day, when your next test is, etc. This can help you keep track of important details, information, and events that might otherwise slip your mind, and having all of this in one place will help you feel more in control of things.

Allow a professional to examine how you conduct yourself at work, noting the things you do best and the things that need improvement. This evaluation can help you learn where your strengths and weaknesses are, so you can adapt your work style to do better at the office.The reason a professional evaluation is important is that a career counselor or therapist can help you see things that you may be blind to. In turn, you can work to change some of the things that cause you problems.;
, Stressors and distractions can lead to you being less productive. If you can cut some of those distractions out, you may find you are able to work better. In some cases, you may need to work with your boss to cut down distractions.One way you can cut down on distractions is to do part of your work when fewer people are at the office. For instance, you may find that coming in early works better for you than coming in at the regular time.
Try metaphorically or literally closing the door. If you have a private office, shut the door to cut down on distractions. If you don't have a private office, try moving to an empty conference room or putting in headphones with white noise or wearing earplugs to help limit distractions.
Cut out visual distractions, too, by facing a wall and keeping your office neat., Some of your distractions come from within, whether from boredom or creativity, and you need to work on those, too. They can be just as detrimental to your productivity, as you're working against yourself.For instance, one internal distraction is daydreaming. If you find yourself daydreaming a lot, that's a sign you're bored and trying to avoid work. You may need to find ways to make it more interesting.
You may also find yourself interrupted by ideas. For creative ideas, keep a notepad nearby where you can write them down and move on.
Also, you can be distracted by suddenly remembering you need to do something. Cut down on these by buying a planner and keeping a to-do list.
Try setting aside a little time throughout the day to allow yourself to be distracted, such as by setting a timer on your phone to go off every 30 minutes and taking a few minutes each time it goes off to be distracted.

, While hyperfocusing can be an advantage for getting things done, it can also cause you to lose track of the time, which can be detrimental to other projects. Try to make sure you are aware of the time by setting alarms on your phone or your computer to remind you of the time and bring you back to reality., While medication is not the answer for everybody, it may help you do better in the workplace. ADHD medications can help you focus, which in turn can help you be more productive and efficient. Talk to your doctor or a psychiatrist to determine if medication is a good option for you.Also, make sure you talk to your doctor about having a medication to cover you for the whole day. For instance, depending on when you get to and leave work, an eight-hour pill may not do it. You may need to take a four-hour pill in the afternoon.
Keep in mind that stimulant medications can interfere with your sleep, so it is best to avoid taking these medications in the late afternoon or evening. Let your doctor know if you begin to have trouble falling or staying asleep.

, While you can't expect to have every need accommodated, talking to your boss about how you work best can help them understand you better. In turn, they may be willing to adjust their management style a bit to help you work better.For example, people with ADHD often work better in an environment that has some accountability, where you must check-in, but that also has a bit of flexibility when it comes to time management.
Try asking your boss to work with you to make a detailed schedule of the day, so you know what to do and when to do it.

, As an ADHD adult, you'll likely have times where you can't be as productive as you need to be because you're distracted and your work is expecting high demand. That means that you'll have to put in the extra time to make up for it, so you stay on top of your work., If you are affected by the hyperactivity part of ADHD, you should try to move around when you can. For instance, stand up and walk when you're on the phone, or go see a colleague who you need to converse with. By moving around, you'll help yourself focus when you do sit back down.Other similar adjustments may help. For instance, you may like a standing desk, or you may need ""fidget"" toys around to help you stay focused.

, Adults with ADHD tend to have the ability to hyperfocus on things that truly interest them. That's an advantage in the workplace because it means you can get a lot done in a short time if you're interested in what you're doing.That often means that you can get significantly more done than your coworkers in a short time, something your boss will appreciate. In turn, your boss will likely be willing to give you more projects based on your interest.

, One way to succeed as an adult with ADHD is to pick a career that is relatively active. If you have ADHD, you may not be satisfied with an 8-to-5 office job, as you prefer to be more active. Therefore, look at career fields that will keep you going throughout the day, so you'll have a better chance of succeeding.""Active"" doesn't necessarily to refer to being physically active. A career that is mentally engaging and fast-paced can be just as good for you as a physically active one.
Some good career fields for adults with ADHD include entertainment, sales, politics, and emergency medical.

, When choosing a career field, whether for the first time or mid-career, it's important to evaluate a new field before jumping in. If you are mid-career, you may find you have as much trouble succeeding in that field as you do currently in your career. If you're just starting out, you want to pick a career that will help you be successful.Do research on your new field. Research online to see what the work entails.
However, don't just stick to online research. Contact someone in the field to figure out what the day-to-day looks like. You can even ask to shadow someone to figure out if the work is something you're interested in.

, Even if you don't pick a career field that is active overall, you should pick a job in that field that IS active. Most career fields have less active and more active jobs, so consider switching over to one you find engaging, if possible.For instance, if your job is exclusively paperwork, you may be happier in an area (in the same field) where you work with people more.

When you feel yourself going into overdrive, stop everything that you are doing. Shut the electronics off, put the work aside. If needed, go to another room, or nearby quiet place. Take a few deep, slow breaths. Close your eyes. Stretch your neck, back, arms, and legs.
, Laughter not only elevates your mood, but research has shown that having a good laugh can decrease stress and increase concentration.So, take a brief moment to read, watch, or listen to something humorous.

,

Think about what specifically you need to do. Whether it is how to finish a report or make it through a required lecture, planning can help you remove some of the mental clutter and focus on what is most important right now. It can also help you figure out how to efficiently do what needs to be done. Just the act of writing down a plan of action can release some energy which can help calm your mind.
Break down large, overwhelming tasks into smaller, more manageable action steps.Consider what resources you will need and what distractions you can eliminate.
Be sure to include time for short breaks in your plan.

, Although it is a stimulant, caffeine reduces blood flow to the brain, which can slow your brain down. Drinking a caffeinated soda or having some chocolate can help you focus.

Remember, though, that too much caffeine (for example, more than four cups of coffee a day) isn't good for anyone., As much as possible, remove anything that might distract you. Keep only the supplies you will immediately need for the specific task at hand and put everything else away.

, Focus on completing one thing at a time.Multi-tasking may seem like a good idea, but it forces your brain to focus on several things at once, which doesn't help slow it down. Instead, complete one task before you begin another.

, Use your plan to guide what you are doing. Place it somewhere that you can see so that it is a visual reminder of what you are focused on. Utilize your planned breaks to allow your mind (and body) time to recharge and refocus. Remember to reward yourself when you have finished!

, She may consult with, or refer you to, another professional such as a psychiatrist. There are several different types of treatment, including medication, therapy, and alternative treatments available. Many people use a combination of treatments to manage their ADHD.

Consult with a professional, such as your physician, to determine which treatment or combination of treatments will be most effective for you., It is one of the most common and popular forms of treatment for adult ADHD. Stimulant medications have been proven to be effective for treating many of the symptoms of adult ADHD.Other medications, including some antidepressants, have also been found to be successful., These forms of treatment are often used in conjunction with medication treatment. Some of the most widely used therapies for ADHD are Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT) and family therapy.


CBT teaches specific methods for changing your thinking so that you can feel mentally and emotionally calmer and more in control.Family therapy can assist by addressing some of the interpersonal issues ADHD may cause. Techniques for problem-solving and effective communication are often introduced., Although the research base for them is not as strong as for medication and therapy, there are a number of alternative treatments that numerous people with ADHD have found to work for them. Two popular alternative treatments are elimination diets and meditation.Some research has indicated that eliminating foods high in processed sugars or containing dyes and certain other chemicals may alleviate some ADHD symptoms.Mindfulness Meditation, in which you focus on being present in the here and now, has also shown some success in recent research.Consult your medical professional before beginning any alternative treatments.

,

Getting enough sleep, a balanced diet, and regular physical activity can help reduce some of your ADHD symptoms.

People with ADHD may especially feel the effects of lack of sleep as the brain goes into hyper-mode the next day to compensate for the loss.Establish a sleep routine so that your mind and body are calm. Turn off your electronic devices, dim the lights, make some tea, meditate, etc. These regular actions signal to your brain that it is time to slow down.
Eating healthy does not necessarily mean adopting an elimination diet, although it is one form of treatment for ADHD. Maintaining a balanced diet (including drinking water) not only helps your overall health, but ensures that your brain has the necessary nutrients to function at its best.
Regular exercise not only improves your physical health, but can help with focus and memory, as well. Some studies have indicated that martial arts, in particular, benefits people with ADHD because they include a mental aspect, along with the physical, and often involve some form of meditation.,

Remove the clutter from your life. As much as possible, organize your physical space so that distractions are minimized. Use a planner or calendar to organize your business/school, family, and social life. Knowing where things are and when things need to be done decreases the number of things your mind has to attend to., When possible, anticipate times you might get restless and plan appropriate ways to release your energy.

For example, if you have a meeting or class scheduled, bring a small stress ball or other item to unobtrusively use to release energy."

Know what purposes stimming can serve.,
Decide what you are and aren't comfortable with.,
Develop a repertoire of stims.,
Be polite with your stims.,
Recognize that people may be more respectful than you think.,
Never let social rules interfere with your needs.,
Remember that there is nothing wrong with stimming or being yourself.",How to Stim1," Stimming has many different benefits, and everyone does it to some extent. (Ever seen a non-disabled person tap their foot or twirl their hair?) It can be especially important for disabled people, who may find it helps them...


Stay calm
Concentrate
Cope with discomfort or pain
Prevent meltdowns
Express emotions;
, Some stims are more subtle or unusual than others are. Some may be considered ""socially inappropriate."" Consider which individuals are more accepting than others, and whether you care about conformity or not., This way, you have choices when you get the urge to stim. It's good to know a variety of both discreet and obvious stims, so that you can pick whatever fits your desires and situation.

, Do not use stims that are highly disruptive when people are focusing, and don't touch people without their consent. Disability is not an excuse to cross other people's boundaries.


Use subtle/moderate stims (e.g. chewing gum rather than loud echolalia) when people are concentrating, such as during a lecture or exam.
Step outside to stim a little if you need to.

, The autism acceptance movement (which includes talk of stimming) is gaining traction in the public eye, and people are becoming more open to others' differences.

, Sometimes stimming is just for fun or for an optional boost in concentration, but other times, it is a real need. Do not put your needs aside just because other people might judge you.


People tend to care less than you might think.
It is absolutely okay to stim in public for any reason—for fun, for concentration, for staving off meltdowns, or for whatever. Do what makes you comfortable., Stimming is a symptom of disability, just like a wheelchair or having unique facial features associated with Down Syndrome. It is okay to be disabled in public, and do not let judgmental people make you feel ashamed."
"
Look at ordinary objects that move repetitively.,
Buy or create stim toys.,
Look at nature.,
Find repetitive animations on the internet.,
Play with light.,
Make repetitive motions with your hands.,
Watch videos of people spinning.,
Sing or hum a tune.,
Repeat words and phrases out loud (echolalia).Unfortunately, echolalia is not considered socially acceptable in most areas, so you may want to limit this to places that feel comfortable and safe.",How to Stim2," Fans, car wheels, and washing machines all make repetitive motions.

, Plenty of fidgets and desk toys involve some sort of moving patterns.


Snow globes
Lava lamps
Mobiles (A mobile of planets is considered socially acceptable for older ages.)
Glitter jar (made from water, glitter glue, food coloring, and glitter)

, Watch the wind move long grass or leaves in trees. If nature isn't easily available to you, look up calming nature videos on the internet. Even 30 seconds of watching a video of long grass can help you feel relaxed.

, These can feel very calming. Many follow a specific pattern, which can be pleasing for autistic people whose brains are optimized for systematizing.


The ""Mesmerizing Gifs"" thread on reddit contains plenty of gifs.Be careful about gifs if you have epilepsy.

, Try messing with a flashlight, lighting fireworks, or flickering the light in a room (if no one else is there).


Try moving colored paper or translucent objects over flashlights to see cool colors and patterns.
Download light- and pattern-related games onto your mobile device, such as a firework-generating app.

, This can provide gentle stimulation to help you in overwhelming situations.

, Sometimes parents or friends of autistic people will make adorable videos of them spinning around, and the autistic people will post them online.

, This is socially acceptable in most environments, and it lets you have a pleasant song in your head for the next few hours.

,


Repeat things that you need to remember, such as material from your exam study guide.
Repeat something nice someone said to you.
Repeat something you read.

Chew gum or suck on a lollipop.,
Consider wearing chewy jewelry.,
Carry a small piece of sweet-smelling lotion, soap, or essential oils.,
Enjoy good smells in the scenery.",How to Stim3," Carrying these around can be useful to quickly address stress or focus issues. They are especially helpful if you tend to bite your nails or put non-food objects in your mouth—as soon as you notice what you're doing, stick some gum in your mouth instead.


Sugar free gum will not cause cavities.

, These can have the same effect as gum and candies, and are more portable. While most companies market them to children, a few (such as Stim Tastic) are also for adults and teens.

, Pick a scent that is especially calming to you. When stressed, take a sniff and count to ten.

, Step into cafes and bakeries, or stop to smell the flowers. It can be fun to explore the local area and experience its different scents.

"
Wear soft or breezy clothing.,
Hold or rub things with pleasing textures.,
Play with stim toys.,
Use a weighted blanket or lap pad for deep pressure.,
Place a pillow on your lap or body.,
Wear a weighted vest or heavy leather jacket.,
Squeeze yourself.,
Ask a loved one for a bear hug.",How to Stim4," You can rub your sleeves or feel the silky fabric of your scarf as you are sitting at your desk. Try fleece and microfiber for special softness.

, Try rubber pencil grips, smooth stones, and jewelry with cool textures.


At age 12-ish and under, you can get away with carrying around a soft stuffed animal in most social settings. At college and under, it's common to have stuffed animals in your room.
Petting an animal is considered socially acceptable at all ages.

, The possibilities of tactile stim toys are endless. Many are available at special needs stores, and more are sold as ""fidgets"" to office workers. Here are some examples of tactile stim toys:


Stress balls and rubber sea urchins
Tangles
Chains of key rings
Slinkies
Coil bracelets or beaded bracelets
Balloon filled with a fistful of flour
...and much more

, A large beanbag will also suffice. Leave it on top of you as you sit or sleep for improved focus and calm.

, Then place something heavy (e.g. a dictionary) on top of it. The pillow will distribute the weight more evenly on your body, mimicking the effects of a weighted lap pad.


This works if you can't afford a lap pad, or if you are in a pinch.
When piling things on your chest, make sure that you can lift them off, or that there are people around to help you if not.

, These will provide subtle deep pressure as you go about your day.

, Squeeze your hands tightly, rub your legs, massage your shoulders, and move your hands firmly over your arms. These subtle stims will provide deep pressure as you need it.

A surgical brush can also be used for deep pressure.

, Not only will you feel the soothing effects of deep pressure, but it will be from someone you love.

Switch out your chair for an exercise ball.,
Use trampolines and swings.,
Find natural ways to move during a conversation.,
Get a vibrating stuffed animal.,
Flap your hands, shake your leg, or wave your arms.,
Spin around in circles.",How to Stim5," You can bounce, rock, and adjust while doing your daily work. It is also easier to take breaks for excited stimming.

, Both of these can be indoors or outdoors. (See special needs stores for indoor swings.)


Small trampolines are portable and can be leaned against a wall for storage.

,


Rock in a rocking chair
Bounce on an exercise ball
Pace

, When pressed, they will shake and provide vestibular input. These can be especially helpful for bedtime stimming.

, Many autistic/disabled people do this instinctively, and it can help with processing surprises, handling challenging experiences, or expressing emotion.


If you flap your hands/arms, people will usually be able to tell you are disabled. Whether this is good or bad is for you to decide.

, Use a swivel chair, or stand up and spin. This is good for informal situations, outdoors, or at home.


Watch for obstacles such as sharp corners.
This is especially fun in a long skirt or dress.

Put important dates in a calendar.,
Make a list of tasks.,
Organize your study materials.,
Create a study plan.",How to Study when You Have ADHD1," One way you can make studying easier when you have ADHD is to stay organized and prepared to study. Start by putting all important due dates and deadlines in a calendar. This could be a physical calendar on the wall in your room, a day planner that you carry in your school bag, or a calendar you keep on your phone. Record all important dates in the calendar so you can stay organized and on top of your assignments.If you are using a calendar on your phone, make sure you set an alarm that will remind you a day before or several hours before an assignment is due. This way, you are reminded of the assignment and have enough time to get it done.;
, When you have ADHD, you tend to have difficulty prioritizing your assignments. To avoid getting overwhelmed, sit down and make a list of all of your study tasks. Then, read over the list and number them in order of importance. Put the most important tasks first and the least important tasks last.If you have a large assignment that you need to tackle, write out each step of the assignment. This will make it easier to divide the task up into manageable chunks so you do not feel overwhelmed.
For example, if you have to do a 10 page research paper, write down each step: “Find five scholarly sources for the paper. Read the scholarly sources and pull out quotes. Outline the paper. Write each section of the paper, using the quotes from sources.”

, Lay out all the materials you are going to need to study. Make sure you have all the required textbooks and reading materials. Have your study notes from class nearby. If you like to record your teacher’s lectures to refer to later, have the recordings ready and accessible. This way, you will have everything you need to dive into studying.You may create separate folders for each subject or class you are taking. Then, you can pull out the applicable folder and stack of study materials when it is time for you to study for that subject or class.

, Organize your time smartly so you can stay focused and prepared. Make a study plan that outlines when you are going to study for each class or subject. Break your study time by hour or half an hour. Label each hour or half an hour so you know exactly what you will be studying at any given time. This will help you stay on track and ensure you are prepared when you sit down to study.For example, you may write down on your study plan for Monday: “Review terms for 30 minutes for test on Wednesday” or “Go over class notes for 1 hour for quiz tomorrow.”

Keep your child away from pesticides.,
Look out for PCBs.,
Watch for items that contain phthalates.,
Steer clear of PFCs.,
Cut out foods and beverages that contain additives.,
Protect your child from cigarette smoke.,
Do not drink alcohol while you are pregnant.",How to Reduce Environmental ADHD Triggers1," Pesticide exposure has been linked with the development of childhood ADHD.You can be exposed to pesticides by either eating contaminated foods, drinking contaminated water, or through direct skin contact. To reduce your child’s risk of pesticide exposure:


Wash fruits and vegetables before eating or cooking them (even if they are organic).
Avoid gardening products that contain chlorpyrifos (Dursban). If you have any products that contain chlorpyrifos, call your local hazardous waste control agency to get information on how to dispose of it.
Do not use any flea control products that contain propoxur, tetrachlorvinphos, amitraz or carbaryl;
, Polychlorinated Biphenyls PCBs have been banned in the US since the late 1970s. However, they are still present in dirt, water, contaminated fish, poultry, and other meats. PCBs have been associated with low birth weight, slowed growth and development, and ADHD-like behaviors.Some things to avoid include:


animal fats, which often contain PCBs.
farmed salmon from anywhere other than Washington state or Chile. Choose wild salmon whenever possible.

, Phthalates have a strong association with childhood ADHD.Phthalates are often added to plastics to increase their flexibility, durability, transparency, and longevity. They are also known as endocrine disrupters, which means they can affect the hormonal systems in both males and females. You can find phthalates in:


plastics, including plastic baby bottles, food storage containers, and toys. Choose glass baby bottles and food storage containers instead. Throw out plastic toys that were made before 2009. Also, avoid plastic containers with the recycling codes 3 and 7. These containers may still contain phthalates.
solvents
anti-foam agents
pesticides
tubing
alcohol denaturants
vinyl products
personal care products such as fragrances, cosmetics, shampoos, and nail polish. Avoid any scents or air fresheners unless they are labeled ""phthalate-free.""

, Polyfluoroalkyl chemicals have water repellent, oil repellent and stain resistant properties. You can find PFCs in food packaging, nonstick cookware, paper/textile coatings, foods, stain-resistant carpets, industrial surfactants/emulsifiers, non-stick cookware, personal care products, and firefighting foams. PFCs have been associated with ADHD, liver dysfunction, cancer and thyroid hormone disruption. They are also endocrine disruptors.To minimize your child’s exposure to PFCs, avoid:eating fast food, packaged foods, or greasy foods
stain-or dirt-resistant furniture or carpeting
clothing that is water, dirt or stain-repellant
teflon-coated cookware
personal care products with the terms “fluoro” or “perfluoro” in the ingredient list

, Certain additives, especially preservatives, food colorings, and artificial sweeteners may be linked to the development of childhood ADHD.However, there is no solid evidence that these additives cause ADHD.


Check labels before you buy and opt for foods that do not contain any preservatives, food coloring, or artificial sweeteners.
Consider putting your child on an elimination diet or take your child to see a dietitian or pediatrician.

, Exposure to the chemicals in tobacco has been linked with the development of childhood ADHD.To eliminate this risk factor for your child, do not smoke while you are pregnant and do not smoke around your child either.

, Drinking during pregnancy can increase your child's risk of developing ADHD as well as put your child at risk of other health problems. To reduce your child's risk fo developing ADHD, do not drink during pregnancy."

Weigh your child’s risk factors for a learning disability.,
Track delays in speech, walking, and other motor skills.,
Take note of atypical behaviors and skill levels.,
Watch for a lack of enthusiasm for childhood activities.,
Talk to your child’s teacher.,
Ask about speech and language concerns.,
Look into difficulties with reading, writing, or mathematics.,
Consider other possible signs as well.,
Watch for indications of dyslexia.,
Look for evidence of dysgraphia.,
Consider possible signs of dyscalculia.,
Identify signs of Auditory Processing Disorder (APD).,
Notice signs of Non-Verbal Learning Disability (NVD or NVLD).,
Pay attention to difficulties with visual perceptions.",How to Spot Early Signs of Learning Disabilities," A learning disability can occur in any child, and the potential causes are numerous and often indeterminate. There are, however, certain risk factors during the earliest stage of life that may increase the likelihood of a learning disability.For example, premature babies are more likely to develop learning disabilities. Certain early life injuries or illnesses, particularly if they affect the brain, can also increase the risk. In some cases, frequent ear infections or sleep disorders in young children can also indicate an increased likelihood of a learning disability.;
, Part of why it is so difficult to identify a learning disability in a young child is that all kids develop at their own pace. Some walk at nine months, others at twelve, still others at fourteen. Some infants pick up talking quickly and chatter away, while others acquire language skills more slowly. That said, noticeable delays in the development of skills like walking, talking, and manipulating objects with the hands can sometimes indicate a learning disability.Everyone seems to have an opinion on the “right” age for an infant to begin walking or talking, but you should rely on your child’s doctor to conduct regular assessments and determine whether your infant is on a typical path.
For sake of reference, though, most babies start walking at around 12–15 months, speaking two or three words (other than ""Mama"" or ""Dada"") at around 12–15 months, and can stack a few wooden blocks with their hands by around 15 months., Children with learning disabilities are sometimes described as restless, impulsive, impetuous, inconsistent, easily distracted, and inappropriate in behavior. Of course, plenty of kids without learning disabilities also possess one or more of these qualities. Look for qualities and behaviors that are noticeably more significant or unusual for a child of your kid’s age.You may also notice difficulties in regards to age-appropriate skills. Preschool-age children (between three and five years old) should be learning skills like like identifying words that rhyme, or differentiating between right and left, up and down, before and after, first and last, and yesterday and tomorrow.

, Children with learning disabilities are sometimes shy or introverted, and may have trouble making friends. They might prefer to observe the other kids playing without joining in. When engaged with other kids, they may quickly lose interest or be distracted. Once again, though, many kids without learning disabilities possess some or all of these qualities as well.Some kids with learning disabilities may not be shy, and yet still have difficulty interacting with other kids and engaging in activities with them. Some, for instance, are prone to talking rapidly and at length on a single topic that the other kids may not find interesting.

, You know your particular child better than anyone else, but an experienced preschool or kindergarten teacher has observed or interacted with dozens or hundreds of kids. He may pick up on possible signs of a learning disability that you as a parent are unable to perceive. Talk to your child’s teacher(s) regularly and raise the topic of potential learning disabilities if you have any concerns.Whether or not your child has a diagnosed learning disability, work with her teacher(s) to identify your child’s strengths and weaknesses and adjust the educational experience to better utilize the former and minimize the latter.

, You or your young child’s teacher may notice, for example, that your kid can run through the “ABC song” flawlessly and yet have trouble identifying individual letters. Or, he may demonstrate pronunciation difficulties without any speech impediment, or have trouble identifying and recalling new words.Remember as always, however, that all children develop at a unique pace and on a unique path. If your child’s speech and/or language concerns are to the point that he doesn’t want to learn anymore, that can be an indicator of a possible learning disability.

, Even in preschool, signs of challenges in these core aspects of learning may be apparent to a teacher. If your child has delayed development in one or more of these areas, and especially if the delay is combined with a lack of enthusiasm or interest, further investigation into the possibility of a learning disability may be warranted.For example, a child who has a lot of difficulty properly grasping a pencil or crayon may have difficulties with hand-eye coordination related to a learning disability. An inability to visualize the concepts of addition and subtraction could be another sign.

, School settings provide ample opportunities for interaction with other kids, so problems with interest or ability to make friends or play with others will often become more apparent than at home. Extreme separation anxiety might also indicate a possible learning disability.Issues with poor coordination, such as falling regularly or having trouble joining in physical activities, might also be more clear in school. Or, challenges with paying attention, following directions, or keeping organized may be more obvious to a teacher than a parent., Learning disabilities come in many forms, and are truly unique to each individual. Dyslexia, though, is one of the most common learning disabilities. Children with this condition often have difficulty recognizing the connections between letters and sounds or with spelling and word recognition.In younger children, potential signs of dyslexia can include: delayed speaking ability; difficulty learning songs and rhymes; difficulty distinguishing left from right; trouble remembering numbers in order; difficulty expressing himself and/or understanding what others are saying.

, Dysgraphia is a condition that causes difficulty with writing, often characterized by awkwardness in holding and using a writing instrument to the point of body discomfort. Not everyone with poor handwriting has dysgraphia, but incurably poor handwriting is one potential indicator of the condition.Recognizing dysgraphia can be more difficult in young children who can’t yet write letters and words extensively. But watch for a strong dislike of drawing pictures or trying to write letters, or an interest in drawing or writing that quickly wanes once the child makes an attempt.

, Like dysgraphia, dyscalculia is a learning disability that usually becomes more apparent as a child gets older. It typically creates a difficulty in understanding basic mathematical concepts like positive and negative numbers, fractions, and arithmetic.Young children with this condition may have difficulty describing or understanding simple arithmetic (like adding or taking away “apples”), or struggle to understand sequencing (such as the time sequencing of events).

, Also known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder, APD affects sound and how it is processed by the brain.If your child has APD, she will be unable to distinguish between similar-sounding words (like belt vs. build, three vs. free); be unable to locate where sounds are coming from; be unable to block out background noise and find it distracting; take all language as literal, making metaphors, puns, and jokes difficult to understand; find it difficult to remember information given verbally, including directions.One sign of APD is if your child says ""What?"" a lot, even if you know she heard what you said.Language Processing Disorder (LPD) is a specific type of APD in which the child struggles only with processing language and does not affect how other sounds (background noises, where sound is coming from, etc.) are interpreted.A child with LPD will find it difficult to interpret spoken language and will struggle to express herself verbally. She may be able to draw or describe and object but be unable to to give its specific name., A child with NVLD has superior verbal skills, but will have difficulties with his motor, visual-spatial and social skills.This child may have difficulty with social interactions because he has difficulty recognizing facial expressions or body language. He will have difficulty with fine motor skills like tying shoes and you may notice bad handwriting; he may also appear ""clumsy,"" often bumping into things or people and have difficulty with understanding directions and spacial orientation.A child with NVLD may also ask a lot of repetitive questions in class — to the point of being disruptive — and have difficulty switching gears., A child with Visual Perceptual or Visual Motor Deficit has difficulty processing information that is delivered visually, or through the eyes. You can watch for certain behaviors that indicate Visual Motor Deficit, such as closing one eye while working, holding papers at an odd angle while reading, yawning while reading, holding writing instruments too tightly (to the point that they sometimes break), and complaining about sore eyes and words blurring on the page.She may also lose her place while reading; have difficulty copying, cutting, and pasting; and often mix up similar-looking letters, like b and d or p and q."

Find a quiet, distraction free place to study.,
Break your studying up into chunks.,
Walk or march while you study.,
Read your study materials out loud.,
Change subjects if you start to lose focus.",How to Study when You Have ADHD2," Staying focused when you have ADHD can be a challenge. Make studying easier by choosing a study spot that is quiet and distraction-free. You may choose to study in your room with the door closed. Or you may pick a quiet spot in your school library.If you are studying at home, let everyone know you are studying and that you are not to be disturbed. Ask everyone in your household to be quiet and respect your need for focus.

, When you have ADHD, you may find working intensively in short chunks may be more effective than trying to study for prolonged periods of time. Break your studying up into manageable chunks, such as 30 minutes at a time. This can help you stay focused and retain information without feeling overwhelmed or distracted.For example, you may try studying for 30 minutes and then getting up and doing something else for 5-10 minutes. Repeat this until you get used to focusing for 30 minutes at a time, followed by short breaks.Instead of cramming the night before, try studying for smaller periods every day for a few days leading up to a test. For example, instead of studying for three hours the night before, try studying for 45 minutes every day for four days., Sitting still can be a challenge if you have ADHD. Do not be afraid to move around while you study. Walk or march while you read a textbook. Pace around as you memorize study terms or read over your study notes. Moving around can make focusing easier for you, especially if you tend to fidget or have trouble sitting still.You can also try sitting on a chair that shifts or rocks to help you stay focused. Get a sitting disk, which is a lightweight portable cushion that fits on the top of a chair seat. This way, you can still move around in a gentle, controlled way and focus on studying.

, Reading out loud helps you use your auditory skills. It can also help you memorize information and retain it better. Try reading your study materials out loud, focusing on each word. Walk or march as you read. This will help you focus your attention on the study materials.You can also try reading a section of your study materials to yourself and then paraphrasing it out loud in your own words. This can help you retain the information better and process the information more effectively.

, If you start to feel your attention start to drift, try changing subjects. This is called shifting, where you shift to a new topic or subject when you start to drift. Have a different subject or topic on hand so you can shift easily. Try shifting back and forth between assignments until all of your work is completed.Make shifting between subjects part of your study plan so you can change subjects easily. Doing this can help you stay productive without feeling overwhelmed.

Talk to your teacher.,
Hire a professional tutor.,
Find a counselor or coach.,
Speak to your doctor.",How to Study when You Have ADHD3," As a student with ADHD, you are entitled to learning accommodations at your school. Talk to your teacher about accommodations in class and for your assignments that can help support you as you complete your studies. Your school may offer accommodations for you as a student with ADHD, which can help you focus and do better in your classes.You can also talk to your school counselor and administrators at your school to find out about possible learning accommodations for students with ADHD.
Accommodations may include getting an extension on assignment due date to accommodate your ADHD as well as different learning options, such as doing oral presentations instead of written papers to make doing assignments easier for you.
You might ask your teacher to help you set daily or weekly goals to help you keep focused., A professional tutor can help you learn how to study and stay focused while in school. Look for a professional tutor who has worked with students with ADHD in the past and who has experience working with students with disabilities or disorders. Ask them for guidance on how you can study better and more effectively.The tutor may work with you one on one and share tactics that you can use to study better on your own.

, Your school or university may offer counseling services with experienced counselors, therapists, and coaches who can help you schedule and manage your time effectively. They can teach you healthy organization and study skills. They may also offer positive reinforcement that can help you build confidence.If you are a university student, your university may offer these services as part of their psychological services or as a part of their accessibility and disability resources.
A school counselor can help you with the process of applying for accommodations. You might qualify for help with note-taking or test-taking. You may even get permission to record lectures., If you are still finding it hard to study with your ADHD despite adjusting your study habits, speak to your doctor. Discuss your struggles with studying and focusing with your doctor. Your doctor may refer you to a mental health counselor who can then help you identify what is holding you back. You may also be given talk therapy or medication to make it easier for you to focus.Your doctor may also try to rule out other issues that may be causing your lack of focus, besides ADHD. Sometimes the symptoms of ADHD mimic the symptoms of anxiety and other disorders. Determining your disorder will ensure you get the proper help and support that you need to succeed in your studies.

Replace lead pipes.,
Hire a professional to remove lead paint.,
Eliminate high-mercury fish.Although the link between mercury and developing ADHD is not conclusive, there are other health problems that can result from consuming too much mercury, so it is a good idea to look for ways to reduce the amount of mercury in your diet.,
Consider having your child’s fillings replaced.",How to Reduce Environmental ADHD Triggers2," Exposure to lead has also been connected with the development of ADHD.Check your plumbing for lead pipes, especially in older buildings.


If possible, have these pipes replaced. If you can’t have them replaced, then you can install a water filter on your faucet or use a pitcher filter to remove heavy metals.
You can also try running the tap for at least one minute to flush away any lead.

, If you think you may have lead paint, do NOT try to remove it yourself. Lead paint is a hazardous substance and it needs to be removed by a professional.If the paint is in good condition, then you can also paint over it or cover it with paneling, drywall, or a sealant. Consult a painting professional for advice.
Never let your child eat lead paint or put painted toys in his or her mouth.

, Some types of fish may be contaminated with mercury, so you should avoid giving your child these types of fish. However, you do not have to eliminate all fish, just avoid giving your child fish that have high levels of mercury. The fish that have the highest levels of mercury include:


Mackerel (King)
Marlin
Orange Roughy
Shark
Swordfish
Tilefish
Tuna (Bigeye, Ahi)

, The FDA considers mercury amalgam fillings to be safe for children over the age of six, but some people choose to opt for porcelain or composite fillings instead. If your child has mercury amalgam fillings, then you may consider having them replaced to eliminate a potential ADHD risk factor.

Be aware that some risk factors are beyond your control.,
Watch for symptoms.,
Seek help for your child.",How to Reduce Environmental ADHD Triggers3," While you can control many factors that have been linked to the development of ADHD, you cannot control them all. Some children are at a higher risk of developing ADHD due to a family history of ADHD, genetic factors, and premature birth., ADHD symptoms are wide ranging and fall into different categories. A child with ADHD will have symptoms for at least six months and they will have an effect on the child’s ability to function in school and at home. Symptoms may include:not paying attention or having trouble focusing
not listening when spoken to
not following through on tasks and chores
being easily distracted
losing items, such as pencils, homework, toys, etc.
fidgeting
constantly moving
talking too much
interrupting others
failing to stay quiet during quiet activities
blurting out answers

, If your child is showing signs of ADHD, then take him or her to see your pediatrician for a diagnosis and treatment. ADHD will not go away on its own and your child may need interventions to help him or her function well in school and at home.


Your child's treatment may include medications, behavior therapy, and school interventions.

Believe in your calling.",How to Become an NFL Scout," While a college degree isn’t necessary, earning one demonstrates to teams that you have more to offer, distinguishing you from your peers. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics says that scouts typically have degrees in business, marketing, sales, or sports management.Earning these degrees signals to NFL teams that you have developed practiced writing, communication, management, leadership, organization, and time-management skills, which are crucial to being a successful scout.


If you don’t have a bachelor’s degree, or you have a degree in another field, taking courses in management and business can also help you to develop and demonstrate these skills.;
, Scouting requires a high level of football knowledge and understanding - you need to be able to successfully identify and predict talent, a skill that only comes from years of living within the sport. NFL teams are therefore looking for people who are passionate about the game and know it well. Having a background as a player, coach, or even student manager is important. You don’t need to have played at a high level; many scouts played lower levels of college or high school football, or not at all, but still have a high football IQ. But you will need some background in the sport in order to develop a total understanding of the game.

, Courses such as those offered by Sports Management Worldwideand The Scouting Academyoffer invaluable educational and networking opportunities. Their curricula weave together business and management skills with scout-specific skills, such as how to rate talent and write scouting reports. These courses are also taught by successful football scouts, who are important contacts to cultivate, and offer access to extensive networks in professional football.

, Developing an eye for talent is crucial. Attend high school and college games. Bring along a digital camera to record the game. Use a pen and notepad to take notes on each player. Write down specifics about them. Pay attention to how the players handle the ball and how they carry out each play.Developing an understanding about how the game is played and what each position does is essential to becoming a good NFL scout. You should know what qualities (body types, mentalities, and abilities) a good player must have, and also what qualities are important for each position on the team. You should be able to get an idea if a player possesses such qualities by watching him play. The time you spend practicing and the reports you generate will become the basis for your professional portfolio.

, Professional scouts usually start low. Some start their careers as part-time talent spotters, others as independent contractors or for a sports agency, and still others work as trainers or coaches and slowly move to scouting at a higher levels. Many more simply don't make it. Have reasonable hopes and keep an eye out for opportunities. There are also options even if you fail to get that coveted spot. Would-be scouts have gone on to do things like open their own agencies to represent prospects, for example, or assume management roles with teams. There are other ways for you to be involved with football outside of scouting., Courses in NFL scouting should give you a start, but you need to develop those connections and form new professional relationships. Often it isn’t what you know, but who you know that will help you get your foot in the door. Former football players may already know people,but others need to do whatever it takes to meet football insiders. Going to the Scouting Combineor to the Owners’ meetings,will give you opportunities to get your name and face out there.

, In order to distinguish yourself from other would-be scouts, you need to be polished, persistent, and memorable in the ways you network and share job materials (letters, resumes, portfolios). For instance, Daniel Kelly wrote a 350 page draft guide that he circulated in triplicate to multiple people in every organization in the NFL.This is what got him noticed, and less-so for the evaluations it contained than the passion, work ethic, and attention to detail that it demonstrated.


Send your materials to everyone from interns to owners, and all in-between; if you catch the eye of just one person, they could be the one to put it in front of the decision makers in the organization. Stress in your resume and cover letter that you want to be a scout. You will not be hired to scout if you say “I’ll do anything.”, You can gain valuable experience interning as a scout for local arena football or college teams, but in order to gain experience in the NFL, demonstrate your skills and value, and go on to a successful NFL scouting career, you’ll need to intern for an NFL team. Many NFL teams offer internship programs., Former NFL scout Daniel Kelly has written that belief - and commitment to the calling - is essential to becoming a pro scout Getting into the league will not be easy. The skills that it takes come from a total passion for the game - a willingness to watch endless hours of tape, travel long distances, and perhaps toil for years at lower levels at low pay. You will not get these skills with a bachelor's degree or from an online course alone. Credentials help, but, ultimately, you will need desire and self-belief.

Do some research.,
Know the three ADHD subtypes.,
Recognize the childhood symptoms.,
Recognize the adult symptoms.,
Understand that ADHD is different in each person.,
Understand the affects of ADHD.,
Learn about the environmental factors that can impact ADHD.,
Inform yourself on treatment options.,
Talk to a doctor about getting diagnosed.",How to Recognize the Signs of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)," Many people only know the stereotypes of ADHD behavior, but don't realize that many subtler symptoms exist, especially in girls and adults. Do some searching on the internet or at your local library for books, articles, and websites that explain ADHD in ways you can understand.;
, ADHD people can display a range of symptoms which make up three ADHD subtypes: inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and combined. Inattentive type is characterized by distraction, daydreaming, losing things, and trouble finishing work. Hyperactive/Impulsive type is characterized by disorganization, restlessness, impulsive decision making and constant movement. Combined type is typically a mix of inattentive/hyperactive symptoms.

, Most generic screening tools are aimed at children, and one of the requirements for an ADHD diagnosis is the presence of symptoms before the age of 7. Even if you are now an adult, knowing and recognizing childhood symptoms can help you determine if you are a candidate for ADHD diagnosis, or if your symptoms are more recent (and therefore not ADHD). The American Psychiatric Association uses the following questionnaire to screen for childhood ADHD, with section A being symptoms indicative of inattentive type, and B being indicative of hyperactive/impulsive type.


A. Six or more of the following symptoms of inattention have been present for at least 6 months to a point that is disruptive and inappropriate for developmental level:






Often does not give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, work, or other activities.
Often has trouble keeping attention on tasks or play activities.
Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.
Often does not follow instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (not due to oppositional behavior or failure to understand instructions).
Often has trouble organizing activities.
Often avoids, dislikes, or doesn't want to do things that take a lot of mental effort for a long period of time (such as schoolwork or homework).
Often loses things needed for tasks and activities (e.g. toys, school assignments, pencils, books, or tools).
Is often easily distracted.
Often forgetful in daily activities.


B. Six or more of the following symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity have been present for at least 6 months to an extent that is disruptive and inappropriate for developmental level:
Hyperactivity:






Often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat.
Often gets up from seat when remaining in seat is expected.
Often runs about or climbs when and where it is not appropriate.
Often has trouble playing or enjoying leisure activities quietly.
Is often ""on the go"" or often acts as if ""driven by a motor"".
Often talks excessively.


Impulsiveness:






Often blurts out answers before questions have been finished.
Often has trouble waiting one's turn.
Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games).



, While all adults with ADHD should have exhibited childhood symptoms, these behaviors may not have been disruptive enough for a diagnose, and symptoms evolve with age to reflect behavioral and environmental changes. Adults with ADHD are more likely to exhibit the following symptoms:
Inattentive type






Procrastination
Indecision, difficulty recalling and organizing details required for a task
Poor time management, losing track of time
Avoiding tasks or jobs that require sustained attention
Difﬁculty initiating tasks
Difﬁculty completing and following through on tasks
Difﬁculty multitasking
Difﬁculty shifting attention from one task to another


Hyperactive/Impulsive type






Chooses highly active, stimulating jobs
Avoids situations with low physical activity or sedentary work
May choose to work long hours or two jobs
Seeks constant activity
Easily bored
Impatient
Intolerant to frustration, easily irritated
Impulsive, snap decisions and irresponsible behaviors
Loses temper easily, angers quickly



, Many trends exist in ADHD symptoms, for example young boys are the most likely to exhibit the hyperactive/impulsive subtype, and adults and girls tend to exhibit more inattention symptoms than hyperactive symptoms. However, symptoms vary from person to person, as does the degree of interference these symptoms cause. For some people ADHD does not pose a problem in childhood, but can become more disruptive with increasing workload, such as when the person starts college, enters the workforce, or has children. Some people go their whole life without ADHD ever posing a real problem.

, Beyond the symptoms that define it, ADHD can have a large impact on lifestyle and behavior. Girls with ADHD often struggle to relate to their peers and therefore have trouble making and keeping friends. Adults can become discouraged by a seeming inability to complete tasks or keep up with colleagues, and many women are falsely diagnosed with depression or bipolar disorder when the cause of their symptoms is actually ADHD. More and more research is emerging linking ADHD to troubles sleeping and mid-day fatigue and exhaustion, as well as eating habits like binge-eating.

, Some studies suggest that environmental factors like sugar and food additive intake can have adverse effects on attention, and that eliminating or regulating consumption can reduce the severity of ADHD symptoms. Caregiver relationships can have a profound impact on a child's attentional abilities as well, which may be linked to a higher incidence of ADHD-like symptoms in foster children and child abuse victims.

, Many ADHD medications are well known, such as Ritalin and Adderall, but medication is only a small piece in the effective treatment of ADHD and is not recommended in all cases. Medication can boost the ability to focus and calm some of the symptoms of hyperactivity, but behavioral changes and even diet can be important in managing symptoms. There are many ADHD websites that provide useful ideas, but the best resource would be a psychologist or therapist with experience managing attention disorders.

, Talk to your regular doctor about the possibility of be diagnosed with ADHD. Often a general practitioner (family doctor) can do a basic ADHD screening using the above questionnaire and prescribe medication, but it is a good idea to get a referral to see a psychologist or neurologist. They can provide a more thorough assessment through interviews and behavioral questionnaires. Some can even perform a comprehensive learning disability screening which quantitatively measures brain activity and provides hearing, vision, speech and language assessments. These tests are very insightful and can pinpoint the underlying learning disabilities that often go hand-in-hand with ADHD, such as sensory integration disorders.

Play or attend games.,
Know the rules.,
Go to rules clinics.,
Referee local football games.,
Stay physically fit.,
Become certified.,
Referee college and semi-pro games.,
Work your way up.,
Keep track of your experience.",How to Become an NFL Referee," Football is a complex sport. True, your general layperson can follow most of the ins and outs during a quarter of a game. However, as a referee, you will make the final call. Football is a game that requires physical contact. Therefore, the job of a referee is very complicated. Since the players are allowed to touch each other, you need to know how to delineate between what is permitted and what is not. You can gain the knowledge you need to make these determinations by playing or watching football as much as possible.


By playing football, you will be observing firsthand what it is like for a player. Empathy for the players will help you make fair, rational judgments.;
, As a referee, you will be called upon to make appropriate judgments. To do this, you must learn the rules. These rules should be on the tip of your tongue. On the field, people expect you to make a call immediately. Study football referee signals and practice them when you have the chance. Know the difference between a bad call and a good call.


The NFL rulebook is long and complex. The rulebook is supposed to make judging a game easier by analyzing different situations that you might potentially see in a game. Therefore, there are hundreds of rules in the rulebook. You should take your time and study the rules in the book. The entire rulebook is online. You should make note cards of plays and rules. Try memorizing these cards every day. With practice, you will be able to rattle them off when asked.
Try watching games with your rulebook in front of you. After a call is made a referee, read up on its history in your book. This will keep you focused on the game and the regulations.
The NFL has official hand signals.You should study these when you are preparing to become a referee.

, A football rules clinic will tell you about the current rules for a specific association. Generally, these clinics are mandatory in order to participate in that year’s season. This is because the rules have slight variations every year. If there are any changes, then you will learn about them in a rules clinic.These clinics will also allow you to learn more about the fundamentals of the game of football.


The type of clinic that you go to will depend on your association and purpose. If your association requires that you go to a clinic, then they will inform you of the registration process beforehand. Generally, high school clinics, for example, are free for officials. However, if you are going to a professional clinic in order to better yourself, be prepared to pay a significant amount of money. Some clinics charge participants hundreds of dollars.These more expensive clinics will often offer an online application for you to fill out.
The NFL has official football rules clinics. Generally, an official NFL Football Officiating Academy (FOA) clinic will focus on leadership, teamwork, and accountability along with the fundamentals.At these clinics, you will learn by studying football videos with fans, players, and officials.

, Learning how to judge a game properly comes from practice. You should try to referee football games in your community, if possible. Find out if there is a middle school or high school near you that needs referees.


You may want to start at a lower-level when you first begin refereeing. You don’t want to be over your head. If you start by refereeing children’s games, then you will be able to build your understanding of the game in a low pressure setting.
If you have been refereeing for a while, then you should try to referee a level higher than the level you are used to. For example, if you generally have been refereeing middle school games, then you should see if you can referee high school games. Not only will this give you more experience, but you will also be showing an upward trajectory.

, Refereeing is a rigorous profession. You need to be able to keep up with the players at all times. Therefore, you must be in shape. If you find yourself short of breath when running, then you won’t be able to stay in the flow of the game. Exercise as much as possible, but don’t over-do it!


Cardio is what you should focus on. Referees need to run quickly for an entire game. Make sure you are jogging every day.

, The NFL requires referees to have membership in a accredited football organization. Look for local football associations in your area by attending middle school, high school, or semi-pro games and talking to the officials there. They will likely be involved with football sports associations. They can give you some information about what associations you should join. You can also try searching the internet to find accredited associations in your area.


These associations will also inform you about games that you can officiate in your area.

, This will depend on how long you have been refereeing. You need to have at least five years of experience at the college or minor league level to be considered by the NFL.If you've just started, this is something that you should keep in mind for the future. However, if you are already refereeing at the high school level, then you should consider applying to college and semi-pro positions.

, The path to becoming an NFL referee is a long one. In order to be considered for the position, referees are expected to have at least ten years of experience. This experience is usually gained by refereeing high school games, college games, and semi-pro games. Keep refereeing more minor games until you have enough experience to be considered for the NFL referee position. This is a long process; there is a reason that the average age of an NFL referee is 51., When you finally do end up applying to the NFL, you will have to supply them with a large amount of information. They will need your officiating schedule for the past three seasons. They will want to know which schools you worked at, what your position was, and the dates you worked. Therefore, you should keep detailed notes about your entire referee career.


Write down all of the games you referee, including dates and teams.

Be aware of the expectations of the role.,
Keep in mind the work environment of an athletic trainer.,
Understand the demand and the pay scale for athletic trainers.,
Do well in biology and physics in high school.,
Earn your bachelor’s of science degree in athletic training.,
Consider getting a master’s of science degree in athletic training.,
Pass the Board of Certification (BOC) exam to become a certified athletic trainer.,
Join an athletic trainer association.,
Apply for positions at high schools, colleges, and fitness centers in your area.,
Consider applying for marketing positions at an athletic equipment company.",How to Become an Athletic Trainer," Athletic trainers are often the first ones on the scene when an athlete is injured and must be prepared to recognize and evaluate injuries quickly and effectively. You will often need to provide immediate medical care to athletes in a hectic environment, such as a game or match.Your duties as an athletic trainer can vary from applying bandages or braces and making sure athletes recover properly from their injuries. You may also provide physical therapy, massage, and medication to help relieve muscle pain and irritation. In a game environment, you may make decisions about whether or not a player needs further medical treatment outside of your expertise.
As an athletic trainer, you will also focus on rehabilitating an athlete after they have sustained an injury, sometimes over a period of months or years. If you work with a specific team or group, you may work with the athletes during their training to ensure they are training properly and are not at risk of injury. You may also need to speak about athletic training and injury prevention at businesses, schools, or in front of sports teams.
The position of an athletic trainer is often confused with the position of a personal trainer. But there are major differences between the positions, as athletic trainers treat many different types of patients, from professional and youth athletes, dancers, musicians, and members of the military. As an athletic trainer, you also offer physical medicine, rehabilitation and preventative services to your patients.;
, A certified athletic trainer will often work under the supervision of a physician and work closely with other healthcare professionals, athletic coaches, and the parents of athletes. You will get to know all your patients or clients on an individual level and become very familiar with how to best treat their injuries. You may work in the following settings:Professional and college level sports
Sports medicine clinics
Hospital emergency rooms and rehabilitation clinics
Secondary and intermediate medical schools
The performing arts, such as professional dancing
Law enforcement and the military
Doctor offices

, According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job prospects for athletic trainers are good and the field for athletic trainers is growing faster than average. The average salary of an athletic trainer is $42,000 a year.According to a recent survey by the National Athletic Trainers’ Association (NATA), the salary for athletic trainers have risen steadily every year.Since 2003, the three fastest rising areas for athletic trainers are in youth sports (up 41% to $46,296), professional sports (up 31% to $50,515) and high schools (up 16% to $42,442)., It’s never too early to start preparing for your career as an athletic trainer. High school biology will provide foundational knowledge on how to treat injuries to the human body and physics can be useful for your university level courses.You may also want to work on improving your public speaking skills in English class, speech class, and drama class. This may come in useful when you need to communicate with athletes, other healthcare professionals, or clients.
If you are athletically inclined, consider joining a sports team or a sports club to build more first person experience working with athletes and a team. If your high school has an athletic trainer, ask her if you can shadow her for a day and observe how she treats athlete injuries.

, Athletic trainers are required to have a bachelor’s of science degree in athletic training or a related field. Most athletic training programs have classroom and clinical requirements, with courses such as kinesiology, therapeutic rehabilitation and reconditioning, sports psychology, human anatomy, and clinical pharmacology.


Make sure your program of study is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). Many athletic trainer programs and exercise physiology programs are accredited by CAATE. A list of CAATE programs in athletic training can be found here: http://caate.net/find-programs/.

, Though a master’s degree is not required to be employed as an athletic trainer, it can give you a higher level of expertise and lead to management positions. You should consider two types of master’s degree programs: entry-level master’s programs for students who do not have an undergraduate degree in athletic training and advanced master’s programs created for students who have received their Athletic Training Certification (ATC).Master’s programs in athletic training will offer classes on athletic training administration, orthopaedic evaluation, educational research statistics, and therapeutic exercise.

, As of 2009, 47 states require licensing or registration for athletic trainers before they can be hired in a position or practice. To become certified, you must pass the BOC exam and earn your bachelor’s degree or master’s degree in athletic training.The BOC is an independent body that offers standard certification exams for athletic trainers. You can contact your local BOC chapter in your state for more information on the exam. Most students take the BOC during the last semester of their degree. To maintain your certification, you must adhere to the BOC Standards of Practice and Disciplinary Process and enroll in continuing education courses.The American Society of Exercise Physiologists (ASP) offers the Exercise Physiologist Certified (EPC) certification for physiologists. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) offers certifications for exercise physiologists., Joining a professional association for athletic trainers, such as the National Athletic Trainers Association (NATA), can help you to network and connect with other trainers and potential employers. As a member, you will also have access to conferences and continuing education courses to expand your knowledge and keep up to date with the latest practices in the field.More information about NATA can be found on their website: http://www.nata.org/. The NATA website also has a career center page with job listings and opportunities., When you start to look for positions as an athletic trainer, you should consider your preferred work environment and your desired level of pay. High schools, colleges, and fitness centers are all viable options for a starting athletic trainer, as well as health care centers.You can increase your level of pay by focusing on different sports teams or sports field that can be more lucrative than others. As you gain more experience as an athletic trainer, you may be able to move into an administrative or managerial role in a clinic or a hospital.
When you are crafting your resume, you should highlight your educational background, your BOC certification, and your relevant intrapersonal skills, such as your strong communication skills, your ability to work well with others, and your ability to think quickly on your feet.
To ace your job interviews, you should dress professionally and appear confident and friendly. You should prepare a few examples of past situations where you had to use your athletic training skills and have at least two references you can provide to the potential employer.

, If you have a passion for sales and marketing, you may consider applying to sales and marketing roles at an athletic equipment company. As an athletic trainer, you can act as a sales expert and sell medical equipment to patients and hospitals."

Check into your expected duties, work environment, expected pay, and job outlook.Most sports announcers are either play-by-play announcers, talk show hosts, or sports anchors. Your duties may require you to announce plays, provide commentary, and interview guests.
You must have thorough knowledge of the rules, terminology, and history of various sports.
Most announcers work in radio and television studios. Some may stay in studio, but many must travel to game sites. You could also be a part-time or self-employed announcer.
Expect to work long hours since you may need to be at work before, during, and after games.
The median annual wage for announcers as of May 2012 was $28,020, and the job outlook is expected to remain competitive through 2022.;
, If you're reading this while in junior high or high school, you can start preparing now. Look for extracurricular courses dealing with computers, public speaking, communications, English, and foreign language.On an informal level, start familiarizing yourself with sports terminology and history. You should also watch and listen to popular, professional sports announcers. Observe their style and skills; take notes, so that you have a document to reference as you develop your own announcing style.

, While not strictly necessary, this is a fairly competitive career field, and having a four-year Bachelor of Arts will greatly improve your odds of finding work as a sports announcer.


Get your degree in an applicable field. Journalism, Mass Communication, and Broadcasting are your best bets. If possible, look for a program that allows you to concentrate in broadcast journalism or sports communication.
Through the program, you can expect to learn about audio production, mass media, broadcast journalism, media writing, and communication law.Aside from the broadcasting skills you'll learn through your major, you should also study ethics, sports business, sports entertainment, and the social role of athletes.
Liberal arts colleges can be a good place to start, but you might also want to look into broadcasting school or technical school, since these schools may offer programs that are more heavily concentrated on the skills you need.

, Just as you should start your education as early as possible, you should also start your work experience as early as possible. Many high schools have student newspapers. Some even have small TV programs or morning announcers. Try to get involved in as many of these activities as possible.


Ideally, approach these activities from a sports angle. Offer to cover games for your school's newspaper or do the Monday morning sports recap during over the P.A. system.
If you cannot do these activities from a sports angle, however, you should still take part as able. The skills you will learn as a reporter or broadcaster can still benefit you.
You should also look for chances to call the action at youth sporting events, whether those events are through your school system or simply within the community.

, While only a few high schools will provide you with the opportunity to do sports announcing on TV or radio, most substantial colleges do offer those opportunities.


A college or university with a large communications department may have a mock television studio and a radio station. If you are part of that department, your chances of being accepted to work through that studio or station are already better than those of an unrelated student. Note, however, that you will likely have competition. You will need to demonstrate a consistent level of skill within the classroom if you want your professors and advisers to recommend you for work at the university station or studio.
Student newspaper is also a good avenue for gaining experience.

, While you're still in college or broadcasting skill, search out internships with local television studios, radio stations, and newspapers.


This sort of experience can be even more valuable than experience gained at a college studio since you will be able to see how a professional station operates.
Find out if your college or broadcasting school has a department focused on student career services. That department might be able to help you find an appropriate internship.
Internships are also a good chance to begin networking. Even if you are unable to do much actual announcing work, you will be able to meet professional contacts within the field of sports entertainment. Staying on good terms with these contacts can help you break into the industry after graduation.

, In the current age of the Internet, you can get yourself noticed using less traditional methods of experience. Internships and formal work experience are still preferable and should be obtained if at all possible. If you have time and dedication enough, however, try supplementing these experiences by running your own sports show.


Put out the best quality you are able to put out. If you do not have a good microphone but have a little web designing skill and impressive writing skills, start up a sports blog. If you have an adequate microphone but are unable to put a set together, run an audio-only podcast. If you have the resources to run your own moderately impressive video show, however, aim to do that.
Focus your sports show or blog on the aspect of the field you are most interested in. If play-by-play announcements are your thing, do play-by-play recaps. If commentary is more your style, however, include plenty of that.
Take your digital presence into the real world. Offer to cover local community sporting events on your blog or podcast, or even offer to call plays in person when applicable. Interview community athletes and those involved in local athletic programs.

, As you gain experience, compile a demo tap of your most impressive audio and video clips. These clips should show you doing your best work at sports announcing and broadcasting in general.


If possible, take your demo tape to an academic adviser or broadcasting professional you have already networked with. Ask that individual for an honest critique.
Refine your demo tape as much as possible. When you think it is presentable, you can begin sending it out with your resume as you apply for work within the field.

, As a general rule, you should gain roughly 10,000 hours of experience before you head out into the real world for your first official job. Gain experience in different aspects so that you can be sure of which niche to sink into.Try being a play-by-play announcer as well as an anchor and reporter.
Do on-air work as well as behind the scenes work. Learn to edit and set up the lighting.
Work with a variety of sports, including everything from men's football to women's lacrosse.

, A big, national station will not notice you right away. Your better option is to turn to a smaller, local station or studio. Local TV news programs and local radio station that cover sports are usually your best options.


A station you worked for as an intern can be a good place to start, especially if your supervisors gave you nothing but positive reviews.
Don't be surprised if you do not have an on-air role for your first job or so after graduation. If you have enough experience before you graduate, you might be able to land an on-air role immediately. Chances are, though, you will need to assist with behind the scenes work for a few years before you can advance, even at a local station.

, Within the field of sports announcing and broadcasting, who you know is just as important as what you know. If you want to land your dream job, you will need to know people within the industry who can help guide you there.The best way to make contacts is simply to be involved and energetic at every job opportunity you have in the field of sports broadcasting. Do your job well, and do it in a way that makes people see how eager you are to advance. A positive attitude will catch the attention of your higher ups more than a dull or negative attitude will.
Once you make a contact, keep that contact. That individual's current position may not make him or her especially valuable in terms of career advancement, but you have no way of knowing where that person might be in five years and how he or she could help you then.
You should also attend conferences and similar events geared toward sports announcers or broadcast professionals.

, Climbing your way up in this industry can take quite some time. With enough talent and persistence, you can find your way onto the national stage, but you need to be prepared for a lot of hard work without any guarantee of major success.


You will likely begin your career in a non-broadcasting position. Expect to find work as a reporter, equipment operator, or production assistant.
If your talent is noticed, you might be offered work as an on-air announcer or broadcaster.
As your work at smaller stations gets noticed, larger stations may come to notice you, as well.

Only attend an accredited undergraduate institution. For a listing of accredited schools, check the U.S. Department of Education’s (“DOE”) Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs.;
, The most critical skill you can have as an attorney is the confidence to speak to anyone, often with little preparation. Sports attorneys sometimes appear in court, addressing judges and juries, but they also speak in front of a variety audiences, including business owners, athletes, arbitrators, and corporate representatives.


You should begin to develop public speaking skills while in college. Join debate or public speaking clubs, or act as a tour guide for the school.
At the same time that you build your public speaking skills, don’t forget to improve your writing and research skills. Upper-level classes that require you to write long research papers are good preparation for a career in law.

, Not everyone gets into law school—especially those with a low grade point average (GPA). To increase your chances of getting in, graduate with at least a 3.0. Of course, a higher GPA is even better. Admissions counselors interpret a high GPA as proof that you are a hard worker who is self-motivated.The higher your undergraduate GPA, the more selective you can be about what schools to apply to. Even if you do not care about the rank of the law school you attend, a higher GPA makes scholarships easier to get.

, To apply to law school, you will need to submit several letters of recommendation. They can be from professors or employers. The strongest letters will be written by people familiar with your work habits and temperament. Therefore, try to get to know faculty well.


To build relationships with faculty, look for opportunities to work as a teaching assistant or as a research assistant.

, The best way to see what a sports attorney’s career is like is to work for one. If you have time during college, try to intern or work part-time for a sports attorney.


Sports attorneys might not advertise jobs with your school. To get a job, search the internet for sports attorneys in your area. Then you can draft a resume and send an email to the attorney, asking if an internship or part-time job is available.
Part-time work is a great way to get a reference from someone practicing in the field. You might also earn some money on the side.

, Do you like working long hours for demanding bosses? That is what the legal profession is really like. Before you invest time and money applying to law school, you should consider how much you want to be a lawyer. Although law used to have a reputation as a stable, high-paying profession, the legal field has changed dramatically. Now newly minted attorneys often struggle to find enough part-time legal work to pay their bills.


You should consider how comfortable you are working in a different area of law. Should you not get a job as a sports attorney, you may end up doing criminal defense, real estate, or family law. You may also have a general practice, with representing athletes making up only a small fraction of your practice. If this type of career path does not appeal to you, then you might not want to go to law school.
In the same vein, you should think about how you will pay for law school. Students now pay over $30,000 a year in tuition alone, which does not include additional costs for living expenses.If you are not careful, you could graduate law school $200,000 in debt and unhappy performing the only kinds of legal work that is available.

, The LSAT is offered four times a year, in June, September, December, and February. It is offered on Saturdays, but there are special sessions for those who observe a Saturday Sabbath.Create a free account at the Law School Admission Counsel’s (“LSAC”) website.
Find a test date and location. To do this, start on LSAC’s Law School Admission Counsel’s website Dates and Deadlines page.

, The LSAT is the most important part of your law school application. It tests reading comprehension, analytical reasoning, and logical reasoning.The test is scored on a 120-180 scale, with 180 being the highest score.


You can study for the exam using a commercial test prep company, which can charge over $1,000 for a study course. Or you can study on your own, by using older exams.
Old exams are sold individually (and in packets) online. Your local or school library may also have old exams.
Take your practice exams under timed conditions, just as you will take them on exam day. Doing so will perfect your ability to answer questions quickly and accurately.

, The LSAT has five multiple choice sections and one unscored essay. Four of the five multiple choice sections count toward your score. The fifth is experimental and does not count toward your score. The experimental section is not disclosed to you.


Be sure to follow the rules. If you violate any rule on test day, then you will prevented from taking the exam. To read the complete set of test day rules, visit LSAC’s website on its Day of the test webpage.

, You can take the exam more than one time. Each school will decide how to treat more than one score. Some schools may take the higher score only, while other schools may average the two.


On average, test takers are able to increase their score only two to three points on a re-take.You should hesitate taking the exam a second time unless your score is far below what you were scoring on your practice exams. Two low scores could look worse than one.

, All law schools use CAS. You send them your required transcripts, letters of recommendation, and evaluation, and they in turn create a packet that is sent to schools.Get any outstanding documents to CAS as soon as possible. Schools will not move forward with your application unless they have a complete packet.

, No law school application is complete without letters of recommendation. You should ask the faculty you worked for if they can write you a strong letter of recommendation. If the professor hesitates in any way, then move on and ask a different professor.


Employers also make good recommenders. Ask a sports attorney you worked for if he or she would write a letter of recommendation. Getting a letter from someone in the field can help make your application look stronger.
Some recommenders may need to be reminded to get their letters in on time. Be sure to give each professor (or employer) several months to complete the letter.

, Law schools require that you write a short statement, typically on a topic of your choosing. The statement is usually only 500 words, or roughly two double-spaced pages.Always follow the directions and observe limits, especially word limits. If you go over, the school may disregard the extra material. Showing that you can follow rules is critical for your success in the admissions process.
You might be given permission to write on any topic you want. Try to pick a topic that you feel comfortable about. Often short anecdotes make vivid writing samples.

, If you have criminal convictions, student code violations (e.g., cheating or plagiarism), or semesters with very low grades, then you should consider writing an addendum. Meet with your pre-law advisor and talk about whether you should write one and what you should say. A solid addendum will provide context for any information that might raise “red flags.”You shouldn’t make excuses in your addendum. If you had to drop out of college for a few years because of an addiction, then be honest about that and clarify what you learned about the experience. If you were caught cheating, then explain for the admissions committee how you now understand cheating is wrong and what steps you have taken so that you won’t be tempted to cheat again.

, Always request job placement data from any law school you are thinking of attending. Over the past few years, a sea change has occurred with respect to the way schools collect job placement data. Schools provide much more detailed data on the jobs their graduates get.


Most importantly, look at the number of students who get “full-time jobs requiring a JD” after graduation. Full-time jobs requiring a J.D. are the hardest jobs to get. Other statistics will include people who get part-time work, or people working full-time in a non-law field.
Law schools probably don’t keep statistics about the number of graduates who practice sports law, so you can’t really differentiate schools on the basis of the number of graduates who practice in this field. However, you should search online for sports attorneys and see what schools they attended.

, Only a handful of law schools have national reach. Instead, most law schools place their graduates in the local legal community, usually in small firms or local government agencies. You should therefore pick a law school in an area where you want to practice.

, As you compare law schools, you should always have costs in the forefront of your mind. You might assume that public schools are always cheaper than private schools, but that is not always the case. The tuition for out-of-state law students is often comparable to the tuition of a private school.


If you want to move to a state and hope to qualify as an in-state resident, contact the law school’s admissions office for information.

, A great way to get hands-on legal experience while in law school is to participate in a clinic. Unfortunately, there aren’t many sports law clinics in the nation. Harvard and Valparaiso each have one,and Marquette and a few other schools have sports law institutes.In the Valparaiso sports law clinic, students represent individuals involved in amateur sports (whether as a coach, athlete, or trainer) who have a legal issue arising out of their sports-related role.Students work under a faculty advisor to represent clients in disputes involving doping, stipends from national sports authorities, and collegiate eligibility.You can also look to take other clinics that will help you develop relevant skills. For example, a clinic on negotiations would help you begin learning how to negotiate on behalf of a client. Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Centers exist at a variety of law schools: Harvard, Northwestern, and William Mitchell each have one.In a negotiation clinic, students work in teams under the supervision of a faculty member and represent clients involved in disputes. Students help the client resolve the dispute, but also assist clients in conducting conflict assessment and designing dispute resolution systems., Law school admissions is a function of basically two numbers: your GPA and your LSAT. With those two numbers, you can safely judge what schools will admit you and which will reject you.


You can gauge your likelihood of gaining admission to specific schools by using the LSAC calculator. Enter your undergraduate GPA and LSAT score to see your chances at different schools.
If you have a 3.5 GPA and a 155 LSAT, then you have a 25% chance of getting into Arizona State, a 50% chance of getting into Michigan State, and a 75% chance of getting into the University of Miami.
If you have a 3.65 and a 170 LSAT, then you have about a 50% chance of getting into Cornell and a 65% chance of getting into the University of Texas.

, Applying to more than one school increases your chances of being accepted. Apply to several schools where your LSAT and GPA put you near the school’s 75% median. You will have a strong chance of being admitted to those schools.


Visit the University of New Mexico’s Tips on How to Make your Application as Competitive as Possible for ideas on how to complete your law school applications.

, Law schools generally require about 90 credits, spread out over 3 years. Your first year will consist mostly of basic courses: torts, contracts, property, civil procedure, criminal law, and constitutional law.


Most sports attorneys work in large law firms.Accordingly, you will need to do very well in your 1L classes in order to be competitive for a job at a large law firm. The largest firms often come onto campus to interview students for 2L summer associate positions.
Ask Career Services for a list of firms that come onto your campus. Career Services should also have information on the GPA required to be hired by these larger firms. Gathering this information can give you some idea of how well you need to do in your studies.

, Your grades are important, especially for a first-time job. If you want to work at a large law firm, then you will need top grades—preferably at the very top of your class. Though the importance of grades decreases over time, poor grades could keep you locked out of jobs, at least initially., After you complete required foundation classes, you can spend the last two years of law school taking mostly whatever courses interest you. As a future sports attorney, you will want to take courses such as sports law, entertainment law, negotiations, antitrust, and labor law.These fields are important for sports attorneys.

, You should join the SLA or other sports and entertainment law committees sponsored by your local or state bar association while in law school. Participate as actively as you can by serving on committees, writing articles, or whatever they will let you do.


Participation in sports law organizations will help you meet people in the field, make contacts, and learn more about what you want to do when you graduate.

, While in law school you may want to try and intern for a law firm or a sports organization, such as a governing body (like the NFL or NCAA) or a professional sports team. You should contact your school’s Career Services office and ask about available internship opportunities. Internships often can be taken for credit.

, In your spring semester of law school, start searching for summer jobs. Larger firms will advertise through your school’s career center. However, you can also send out a copy of your resume and transcript to smaller firms and ask if a position is available. Find an attorney who practices sports law and ask if he or she is looking for summer help.


Approach all summer jobs seriously. Don’t expect to be paid much. Instead, look for experience. In particular, you will want to get writing experience. When you apply for a job, employers typically ask for a writing sample. It is better to have a motion or a brief drafted for a real client than a writing assignment you did for a legal writing class in law school.
View your summer job as a chance to build your reputation. Once you graduate law school, you might not have a job. However, your summer employer might remember you, especially if you did top-notch work. If so, you can hit up your former employers for contract work to tide you over until something full-time opens up.

, The Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination is required to practice in all but three jurisdictions in the United States. The exam has 60 questions and tests your knowledge of legal ethics.You will take the exam in your third year of law school.

, Once you decide on what state you wish to practice in, you should contact that state bar. Each state admits its own attorneys to practice.The state bar will provide you with a list of the necessary steps to take.

, Virtually every state requires that you pass a written exam. The exam typically includes an essay portion as well as a multiple choice test.The bar exam is typically offered twice a year—once during the summer (June or July) and once during the winter (usually February). If you have to take the bar exam over, you have to pay each time you take it.

, To prepare for the bar exam, you can take a commercial prep course. These courses last several months and prepare you for both the essay and multiple choice portions of the bar exam. They can be pricey; some prep courses can run up to several thousand dollars.You can prepare more cheaply by purchasing old study guides published by the bar prep companies. Old copies can be found on eBay, Amazon, or other online retailers.

, In addition to passing the bar exam, you also need to pass a “character and fitness” review.To initiate the review, fill out a detailed survey on your background: where you have lived, worked, and attended school. The survey will also ask about criminal convictions and arrests, as well as any financial difficulties you might have had.


Give yourself plenty of time to fill out this survey. It must be filled out completely and honestly. Often the attempt to hide something is worse than the offense in the first place, so disclose everything.
Common problems with character and fitness include criminal convictions, financial irresponsibility (such as bankruptcy), and accusations of plagiarism. These may not completely block you from admission, but be prepared to discuss them with the character and fitness committee.

, The bar exam is typically held over the course of 2 days. The first day consists of a multiple-choice exam covering topics such as contracts, constitutional law, criminal law, evidence, and torts.The second day, consisting of essays, is often state-specific.Typically, you will not receive your score for several months. In Illinois, for example, those who take the exam in July will not receive their results until the first two weeks of October., Because most sports lawyers work in larger firms, you should plan on participating in OCI. During OCI, large and medium-sized law firms come onto campus to interview students for potential summer associate positions. If hired, you will work for a few months during the summer before your 3L year. If the firm likes you, then it will extend an offer to join the firm after you graduate.


Your Career Services office will send out detailed requirements for participating in OCI, such as preparing a resume and ordering copies of your transcript. Be sure to follow all policies to the letter, otherwise you could be prohibited from participating in interviews.
As you research what firms you want to bid on, look at this list of the “best” sports law firms. Though all “best of” lists should be taken with a grain of salt, this list will point you in the direction of law firms with healthy sports law practices.

, If you did not get a summer associate position (or if no offer was extended to join after graduation), then you will have to search for jobs during your 3L year and after you take the bar. Your Career Services department should keep a listing of jobs. You also will have to look online. Most jobs are now posted online, at various sites:


Indeed.com. This website aggregates job postings from other websites, such as Monster. You should search by city and search for both “lawyer” and “attorney.”
Craigslist. Lawyers often post job openings to Craigslist. Often, you are requested to send a resume and writing sample.
State bar association. Your state’s bar association may have a jobs bank or a bulletin board where jobs are posted.

, After taking the bar exam, you should identify attorneys whose sports law practices you would like to learn more about. Draft a letter (not an email) and introduce yourself. Be sure to mention who gave you their name.


In the letter, explicitly state that you are not asking for a job. You will get a better response this way.
Develop a list of questions (at least five) and take notes. Be engaged.Ask the attorney if she knows anyone else you can talk to, and be sure to send a thank you note afterwards.

, If you cannot find a job after passing the bar, re-connect with attorneys you worked for during the summer or part-time during the school year. They may have overflow work for you to do, such as research assignments, court appointments, or briefing. They may also be looking to hire a part-time or full-time lawyer.


You can also cold call other sports lawyers and ask if they have any overflow work. If you do not have a job, you should be most focused on building your reputation and not be picky about how much you get paid. If you do good work for low wages (or even for free), then the attorney may come back to you with additional work.

, Even if sports law is your dream, you might need to take another legal job simply to pay the bills. You might have to find a job as a transactional attorney, an insurance claims adjuster, or work as a legal research assistant. Alternately, you might have to take a job doing criminal defense or family law.


As you advance in your career, you can expand your practice to incorporate sports-related litigation or deals.

, To stay up-to-date on sports law, you should think about joining a law association. The Sports Lawyer Association is a non-profit organization made up of over 1,000 sports lawyers.It provides education resources for those practicing in the field.

Know what the job entails.,
Understand the benefits and drawbacks of a sports agent's work.,
Be obsessed with sports.",How to Become a Sports Agent1," Sports agents handle athletes' employment with a team and endorsements with corporations in exchange for a small percentage of the athlete's salary. The agent's role is to help manage the athlete's career by negotiating the best deals possible for the athlete.


Agents are responsible for presenting their clients with the options available to them and using their expertise in the field to help guide the clients toward the best or most lucrative choices.
Agents market their clients as candidates for teams or company endorsements. A background in marketing and communications is helpful for this purpose.
Agents act as their clients' representative in dealings with team owners, coaches, and executives. In order to broker deals effectively, they must understand legal language in contracts and be aware of rules and regulations that apply to the client in a given situation.
Some agents work as individuals or start their own agencies, while others work for large sports agencies.;
, Agents who represent supremely talented or famous clients receive a lot of the perks that come with fame. They may earn a hefty paycheck, have access to the movers and shakers in the professional sports domain, and travel around the world with their clients. The drawbacks include long hours, a lot of time away from family, and little guarantee of financial success. Great sports agents have the following traits:


They're charismatic. Sports agents meet with team managers, coaches, owners, executives, and any number of other important people on behalf of their clients. They have to be outgoing and consistently ""on"" - whether that means talking people up at parties or pitching their clients' skills in a boardroom.
They're willing to take risks. Most sports leagues have more agents than players, and only 5 percent of sports agents bring in over $100,000 per year. In such a competitive field, agents have to be willing to put a lot on the line for their clients. They may have to put in a few years of work before earning a steady paycheck, and the long hours can take a toll on their personal lives.
They're self-directed. Sports agents are scrappy go-getters who whose livelihood depends on their ability to woo new clients. Even agents who work for large agencies are expected to bring in clients independently.

, Sports agents know the intricacies of the recruiting and drafting process for various sports before they decide to make sports their career. They're knowledgeable about the major sports and the leagues, teams, athletes and staff that play a part in the industry.

Get a college degree.,
Get experience.,
Get certified.",How to Become a Sports Agent2," Sports agents have at least a BA or BS, and often a higher level degree. Majors like sports management, marketing, communications, business or pre-law are excellent preparation for a career as a sports agent.


Sports management firms offer courses for people who already have a degree and want to learn the specific skills that come into play in sports management.

, Major sports agencies offer internships or shadow programs for people interested in learning more about the field. Having an internship can also give you a better shot at getting a job with an agency once you've completed your education.


Consider what sport you want to specialize in. Most agents focus on one sport and become experts on the players and regulations in that particular realm.
Think about whether you want to work with professional or lower league players. The competition is much higher in the professional leagues, but the pay is lower when you're dealing with lower leagues.

, The requirements for certification vary between leagues, but you will definitely be asked to display an understanding of league policies. Before being granted certification, you'll also have to pay a fee of up to $1,500 and get professional liability insurance.


Study up on the rules, bargaining agreement, player's benefits, and agents' rights and responsibilities of your chosen league. Read books and websites on the subject, and talk with people who work for the league for detailed information.
Apply to get certification by sending in your personal information, fee, and resume.
Your league may require the completion of one or more courses before granting certification.

Create to-do lists.,
Color code items around your house.,
Keep a regular schedule.,
Create work rooms.,
Get support from others.,
Focus on your family.",How to Organize Home Systems for ADD," Individuals with ADD like to see things visually. Write down tasks that need to be completed. This can include regular housework as well as special projects for work or school.


Break large projects into smaller ones. If children have a research paper due at school, for example, help them make a list of steps that can be taken to complete the project.
Set a timer for certain tasks so that the individual with ADD knows when it is time to take a break or move on to the next task. The timer helps keep them from getting sidetrack or losing sight of time.;
, This can include towel sets, dishes, toy bins, files, and bedroom sets. Color coding helps those with ADD keep things organized by adding a visual element to each item. The individual with ADD can then transfer this organizational system to their study or work environment.

, Have a morning and bedtime routine. Eat meals at the same time each night. Hang a family calendar so everyone knows when special events are coming up. Plan ahead as much as you can, but plan to be a little,if needed, for detours along the way if the schedule needs to be revised to accommodate for minor changes.

, It is important to limit distractions while individuals with ADD study or work. Creating separate study areas and entertainment or play areas will remove potential distractions. Keep the work room simple. Give them the tools they need to work and leave everything else out.

, Your local community may offer resources to help your family put organizational systems in place. Ask people who are naturally well-organized to help you and your family find a good organizational system to use. You can also ask others for encouragement.

, Keep your priorities in check. Setting up a home organizational system is important for individuals with ADD, but having a positive home environment is probably the best thing you can provide for them.


Have family nights. Laughing and talking together is a great way to invest in those relationships. It also provides an opportunity for you to model positive social skills that the individual with ADD needs to see.
Encourage each family member to take some time for themselves. Everyone needs time to refresh. If that means that some chores occasionally go undone, it is okay.

Become aware of the reality of being an instructor.",How to Become a Snowboard Instructor," There are several different governing bodies around the world. In the USA, the governing body is The Professional Ski Instructors of America - American Association of Snowboard Instructors (PSIA-AASI).In Canada, the governing body is known as The Canadian Association of Snowboard Instructors (CASI). Note that Japan also uses CASI as their governing body.
In New Zealand, the governing body is called Snow Board Instruction of New Zealand (SBINZ).
Switzerland acknowledges two governing bodies. The first is The British Association of Snowsport Instructors (BASI), as well as The New Zealand Snow Sports Instructors Alliance (NZSIA).;
, There are many different training courses around the world. Doing an internet search using the terms “Become a snowboard instructor” plus the name of the country will provide you with a list of various training courses. Courses can range anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on where the course is being held and the accommodations that are included in the course. However, if you look hard enough, you might be able to find paid internships that act as a certification course as well. You will have to pay a program fee, but you will earn money during the course, which could help offset your costs.It would be wise to take a course in the country where you plan to be an instructor. That way, you will be sure that your certification is valid where you plan to teach.
Before signing up for a school, be sure to check that the school can certify you according to the governing body of your country, or the country where you plan to teach. If this information isn’t readily available on the website, give them a call and ask them directly.
If you live close to a ski resort, you can also check to see if they offer any instructor training. This may save you a lot of money in travel and accommodation costs.

, To earn your Level 1 certification in the United States, you will need to demonstrate your ability to snowboard, as well as your understanding of AASI’s teaching methods. You will need to practice your snowboarding skills, but you will also need to spend time learning about AASI’s mission and values.One of the most important things to learn about is safety on the slopes. You will need to understand, for example, how to keep your students safe. You will also need to learn about how weather conditions can affect students, for example.
You can learn much of what you will need for the Level 1 certification at a snowboard instructor course, but it doesn’t hurt to do some extra studying on your own.

, In order to earn your Level 2 certification, you will need to have spent some time working as a Level 1 instructor. By this time, you will have improved your teaching and snowboarding skills, and will now be ready to teach more difficult skills to more advanced snowboarders.You will also be qualified to teach snowboarders how to deal with more challenging conditions at this point.
There is a three day examination process that a snowboard instructor must pass in order to reach Level 3.

, If you wish, you can earn your Level 3 certification and become a fully certified instructor. In order to reach this level, you will need to participate in a four day certification course, and then successfully pass the exam at the end.Only about 10-20% of instructors pass this exam on the first attempt.
Though it is challenging, becoming a Level 3 instructor can open up a lot of professional doors.

, If you are in the US, you should seriously consider joining the PSIA-AASI. Even if you are not yet a certified instructor, you are still allowed to join. Once you earn your certification, you can become a certified PSIA-AASI instructor.Joining will give you access to a network of other instructors.
As a member of your country’s professional association, you will be able to show potential employers that you are a dedicated and professional instructor.

, If you are an inexperienced, Level 1 instructor, you can probably expect to make about $7.50 per hour. If you are an experienced, Level 3 instructor you may make as much as $15 per hour. One-on-one lessons will usually be the most lucrative, and you may earn additional money from tips.Some resorts only pay you for the hours actually spent teaching, while others may pay you for your time spent teaching as well as doing other things such as helping set up and maintain the resort.
Keep in mind that instructing is a seasonal job. You won’t be able to be a snowboard instructor the whole year round.
Many instructors have a second job at the resort that they do when they aren’t teaching. This helps earn a bit of extra money.

, Even if you think you are a pro at snowboarding, there is always more to learn. As an instructor, you will need to be able to help others understand the movements and techniques involved in snowboarding. Thus, while improving your skills, you can focus more heavily on understanding the movements involved in snowboarding rather than just learning how to do cool tricks.


Look for an instructor that is at least a Level 3 instructor. Explain to them that you are on your way to becoming a snowboard instructor yourself and that you want to learn how to be a good instructor while also improving your own skills.
You don’t have to be an expert snowboarder to be a good teacher, but you do have to be able to do it well enough so that you can explain it to others. If you are just starting out as an instructor, the focus will be on your ability to teach.However, improving your snowboarding ability will also be beneficial for your teaching.

, Finding a job as a snowboard instructor can be challenging, especially if you don’t have any previous work experience. If you can afford to do so, consider looking for an internship where you will work as instructor to gain some experience.Some training courses (that you have to pay for) include an internship as part of the course. This will allow you to earn your certification and gain work experience at the same time.

, Most ski and snowboard resorts do their hiring in the summer months, not a few weeks before the season begins. Don’t put off your applications, as many resorts have a cutoff date and won’t even look at your application if you don’t submit it on time.Be aware that if you only have a Level 1 certification, it may be next to impossible to find a job as resorts prefer to hire people with at least Level 2 certification. However, you may be able to find a resort that will let you work while also working towards your Level 2 certification.
Being a member of your country’s governing body can also be helpful for finding a job.
Try doing an internet search for “snowboard instructor jobs” and you will find several websites where resorts post their job openings.

, For snowboard instructors in the US, there are 3 levels of certification. The lowest level is Level 1, and the highest level is the Level 3 certification. Knowing what level you would ultimately like to achieve can help you plan out your future accordingly.For example, a Level 1 instructor is only able to teach beginner and novice snowboarders, and in some cases, may only be able to teach on artificial slopes. On the other hand, a Level 3 instructor can instruct on very technical skills and can also train new snowboard instructors.

, If you are certified with the PSIA-AASI, you will need to work to maintain your certification through continuing education credits. You will need to earn at least 12 credits (approximately 12 hours) of continuing education every two years in order to keep your certification.You may also be able to earn these credits in more specific areas. For example, if you enjoy teaching children, then you can spend time learning about how to teach children and why it is different than teaching adults.

, If you love snowboarding, you may think that being an instructor would be a dream come true. In many ways, this is correct. You will get to snowboard as much as you like during your free time, and you will get paid to teach something you love. However, being a snowboard instructor comes with its own drawbacks, so take time to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this career choice.For example, most people find their first job teaching children. As a snowboard instructor, this might be more difficult because most children start out skiing so there is less demand.
Sometimes the snow will be absolutely perfect, but you won’t get to take advantage of it because you’ll be teaching.
Sometimes you’ll have to teach in terrible weather.
Initially, you may have to spend a lot of money in order to become an instructor.

Which sport are you most passionate about?
Which sport are you most familiar with?
What refereeing opportunities are available in your area?
Do you have friends/family/children that play a sport you could referee?;

, If you are not sure which association certifies referees in the sport you are interested in (or how to contact it), attend games and ask coaches or referees.


Some sports associations have regional representatives who can guide you through the process of becoming a referee., Lots of people can be referees; you don’t have to be perfect or even great at your sport.There can be great, unfilled opportunities for refereeing in your area, or ways that you can give back to your community by refereeing.


For instance, a youth soccer league in your area might be in need of a referee. Even if you aren’t a spectacular player or have no previous refereeing experience, you can learn to become a referee and make a difference in people’s lives.

, Some sports associations will require you to be above a minimum age (such as 21) in order to be certified as a referee.If you are below this minimum age, you can still find out everything you can about refereeing in your chosen sport while you wait.

, To become a referee for many sports, you must have normal vision, hearing, and mobility.Some certification processes will also involve physical fitness tests, so you should begin training even before you expect to become certified.

If you can win races at a young age, sponsors will start taking notice, and you may be able to jump into professional race car driving.;
,


To join, you'll need a sports physical from a doctor. You'll need a form from the SCCA's website.
You'll also need to fill out the novice permit form, another form on the SCCA's website.
You'll also need to passport-size photos. You can buy these at a local pharmacy, usually. You'll also need a copy of your license (both sides), and you'll need to pay a fee. As of 2015, the fee is $125.
You can also become a track-side person with your local club, giving you the inside scoop. From there, you can possibly move up to car racing., Many driving schools offer single-day courses, which can help you decide if race car driving is something you really would like to do., If you become good at kart driving, you may be able to qualify for driving school. Some of these schools offer 3-day courses for teenagers as young as 13 and 14, but they of course take adults, too. They teach you the basics of how to drive a race car.In driving school, you'll learn about things such as how to take a corner, how to approach your visual field, how to accelerate and brake properly on a race track, and the basics of passing.
Your instructor should be able to give you some idea about when you're ready for the track. If you're not getting the basic skills, you may need to spend more time in school.

, While most new drivers don't think about seating position, how you position yourself is important. In a crash, you want to be braced against the seat, and while driving, the seat helps you withstand the forces of the car.Square up your body with the seat. That is, don't lean or twist one way or another. Make sure all of your body that should be touching the seat is, including your shoulders, head, and legs.Ensure your arms are at the proper distance from the steering wheel. With your shoulders back against the seat, your wrists should be resting on top of the wheel. This extra space helps you to make turns without moving your back from the seat.Ensure your legs are the proper distance from the pedals. Like the arms, you should be able to press the pedals without overextending your legs. Press the pedals down with the ball of your foot. Your knee should still be slightly bent., Place your hands at 9 and 3. That is, pretending the steering wheel is a clock, place your hands at 9:00 o'clock and 3:00 o'clock, which gives you the most control over the wheel.Push into the turns. Instead of pulling with one hand, use the hand away from the turn to push the wheel. Use your other hand to add control.Pushing, rather than pulling, provides smoother steering, giving you more control of the car and increasing your speed., Only place your hand on the gearshift when shifting. Otherwise, you lose half of your ability to steer the car. Also, make sure to only shift with as much force as necessary. If you're shoving the gearshift too hard, you will slow yourself down., Race cars generally have four pedals: the accelerator, brake, clutch, and rest. Use the ball of your foot when pressing the pedal, and press it in one smooth motion.Like in a regular car, the rest pedal is to the left. It's a place to rest your leg away from the clutch.The clutch is to the right of the rest pedal. To take corners on a race track, you need to perform the heel-toe downshift. As you brake into the corner, you press the clutch with your left foot and downshift with your right hand. However, you also need to rev the engine, as the car has been losing speed. With the ball of your right foot still on the brake, you give a small push to the accelerator with the heel of your right foot. After you return your foot completely to the brake and release the clutch, you move your right foot to the accelerator, and you speed up as you come out of the corner.The brake is to the right of the clutch. To apply the brakes, first apply a smooth, constant pressure. Next, hold the brakes until you feel them start to vibrate towards locking up. As you slow down, gradually release the pressure from the brakes so you can turn into your pit stop.The accelerator is on the far right. When coming out of a turn, make sure to gradually increase speed. If you jump in too quickly with the accelerator, you can lose control of the car., The best way to take corners is to create the simplest line from the entry point to the exit point. The apex is the farthest point you reach inside the turn.To take the corner as quickly as possible, come into the turn on the outside of the track. Cut across the inside of the corner, then proceed to the outside of the track.Essentially, it is like cutting off the corner of a piece of paper in an arching motion.Use a reference point when taking a corner. When doing practice runs, choose a reference point for when you turn, as well as one for the apex and exit. Doing so will keep you consistent throughout the race., Races take a lot of money to enter, so to race, you'll need money. You may be able to find sponsors if you're good enough. You might also be able to enter with a team if they recognize your talent and pay your entrance fee. However, both of those options require that you already be established as a race car driver with talent.Nonetheless, local races cost a great deal less. For instance, you may get away with a couple hundred dollars per day at a local race., Even for local SCCA races, you need your own race car. You can rent one if you don't want to buy one right away, but rental prices are also high.


Your local chapter, specifically your Competition Chairman, can tell you where you can rent a car.

, You'll have other costs, as well, including your racing suit and helmet, which can cost thousands for custom gear. However, you should be able to find suits for much cheaper.Your gear will need to be approved by the SCCA before entering a race.

, The entry packet will specify exactly what you need for the race, the time you need to appear, and any other classes you may need to attend beforehand.

, Just like in any race, you need someone who can maintain your car during the race.


You can hire a local mechanic to come with you. Just ask at a local shop. You can also contact your SCCA to find a mechanic.

, When you enter high-end races, you'll need spare parts (enough to build two more cars), numerous sets of tires, as you'll burn through them, and a huge amount of fuel, as you can burn as much as 21 gallons per 60 miles., Just like any sport, you have to practice hard and often. Some drivers practice up to 7 days a week.Race car drivers train by putting hours in at the track, but they also use simulators to hone their skills. In addition, expect to do some physical training--running, weight-lifting, or swimming--to get yourself in top physical condition., Go through a lap in real-time in your head while you're waiting for the race to start. It helps calm you and prepares you for the drive., You'll need to take classes at your local SCCA to move up from novice.


You need to move up from novice status to compete professionally.

, Once you apply to be a novice, you have 2 years to compete in three races.

, At your third race, you should have your novice permit signed by the Chief Steward to show you have completed the required number of races.

, You can find the application on the SCCA website.

, This application will allow you to have a full competition license. You will also need to pay a fee with this application.

, You will also need a copy of your physical exam with this application.

, The more races you compete in, the better you'll become.

, The best way to jump into professional races is to start winning local races. Sponsors will notice if you've got the talent to compete professionally, and you need sponsors to move up to the professional level, unless you can front the money for professional races (which can run into the 100,000s with equipment and entry fees).

, Your body will be subjected to being pulled around by g-forces. You'll also need to sustain high temperatures inside the race car, as much as 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Your body needs to be in shape to handle it., Crashes happen in race car driving. The better shape you're in, the more likely you'll be to survive it. Also, racing is hard on the shoulders and back. Many racing teams have massages during breaks in the race., Eat balanced meals with protein, vegetables and fruits, and whole grains. You may need to carbohydrate load before a race to build up energy., Especially during a race, you need to drink a substantial amount of water. Some racers also drink energy drinks, light on the sugar., Any extra weight on you slows down the car. So you have to stay in shape.Try light weight-lifting. It builds light layers of muscles while keeping you lean. Another great option is boxing."

Learn to fight.,
Narrow your focus.,
Train hard and frequently.,
Get a good trainer to train with.,
Be willing to pay.",How to Become a Professional Fighter1," If you're going to go pro as a fighter, you're going to have to be the best fighter you possibly can be. Study the techniques and training regimens necessary to whatever style of fighting you're interested in.



MMA is by far the most popular modern fighting style. Combining elements of boxing, kick boxing, Muay Thai, wrestling, and jiu jitsu, MMA will require that you develop a ""total package"" of fighting skills. If you're strong, fearless, and an adaptive learner, MMA may be the right choice for you.

Martial arts such as karate, tae-kwon-do, or ju-jitsu require a tremendous amount of mental as well as physical discipline to learn. The study of these will take many years to perfect and might involve moving to another country in order to study with the best possible trainers.
Wrestlers have a wide network set up in schools and universities. Consider joining a wrestling team to get the necessary skills involved in mat wrestling and as a foundation for expanding your fighting skills to other styles.
Boxing is the classic fighting sport. Old-school gyms filled with heavy bags and jump-ropes exist all over the country, in rural and urban areas. Often, youth boxing programs are available at relatively inexpensive rates if you want to get started early.;
, Do you want to go pro in boxing? MMA? Muay Thai? Even if you're interested in many forms of fighting, if you're going to be a professional, you'll need to specialize. Find a gym that trains in the particular kinds of fighting that you're interested in and hook up with a great coach who can teach you the secrets of the trade.


Consider joining more than one gym to learn from a number of different coaches and practice with a variety of opponents.

, Spar with a wide variety of opponents to hone your combat skills such as strike delivery, reaction, and speed of recovery. During sparring, wear protective gear to minimize the harm impact can do to your body.

, An experienced trainer who has trained professional or high-level amateur fighters will be invaluable to your career. He can help you develop your strengths and minimize your weaknesses by assessing how you perform, and adjust your training accordingly. He can also pair you with good sparing partners that challenge you appropriately during sparring., Highly regimented nutrition, expensive gym memberships, time commitments, and the toll on your body--the cost of pro fighting will quickly add up. If you break a wrist in a fight before you've gone pro, who's going to pay for it?


Get a physical job that will allow you the hours you want for practice and keep you employed while following your dream. UPS truck loaders have to lift heavy boxes but work early hours, allowing the rest of the weekdays free. The physical work will also do double-duty, keeping you in shape while you're making money. UPS also offers competitive insurance packages that will keep you safe.

Learn about the career path.,
Work at dude ranches and rodeos.,
Get in shape.",How to Become a Rodeo Clown1," While the word rodeo clown may sound funny, the job itself is fairly serious. Rodeo clowns help distract animals, such as bulls and horses, in order to prevent ranchers and rodeo performers from getting injured. It's a job that takes a tremendous amount of bravery and physical skill.


Entertainment is an aspect of a rodeo clown's work. As rodeos are supposed to be fun, carefree events you need to keep the audience calm while quelling an unruly animal. There's a creative aspect to clowning. Many rodeo clowns use props like fireworks and costumes to prevent accidents while keeping the audience engaged.
You can make quite a bit of money as a rodeo clown. You're generally paid by gig, earning anywhere from $100 to $500 per show. Full time rodeo clowns make around $50,000 per year average. However, the downside is you do have to pay for your own travel expenses. Rodeo clowns also have a rubber safety barrel which they slip into in the event something goes wrong. This is another expense you'll have to pay yourself.Another perk is that finding work is fairly easy. Nationwide, every rodeo needs a rodeo clown and many people are unwilling to take on the task. Rodeos are always looking for new clowns. As rodeos are a popular form of entertainment, not appearing to be going out of style any time soon, you'll have some longterm job security as well.;
, Most people who become rodeo clowns grow up around farm and rodeo activity. If you want to become a rodeo clown, get acquainted with the ins and outs of the field. Try to land summer and seasonal work helping out at ranches and rodeos.


There's usually ads in the local paper or on Craig's List in areas, such as Colorado, Montana, Texas, and Kansas, where rodeos and ranches are popular. While some experience working with livestock is a plus, you may not need tons of experience to get an entry level job as a farm hand. While the work is not glamorous, you'll make connections and gleam valuable insights into the life of a rodeo clown.Talk to the rodeo clowns as you work. This gives you a chance to learn about the career path. Ask the rodeo clowns how they made the connections they did and how they got their jobs. You may find out about online registry websites, training programs, and more., Rodeo clowns have to be able to act fast in the event of an emergency. You'll need to develop agility, strength, and stamina. It's important to be in peak physical shape if you want to become a rodeo clown.


Build your stamina. Strive to be able to engage in vigorous aerobic activity for a prolonged period of time. You can build stamina by joining a gym and using equipment like elliptical machines, treadmills, and stationary bikes. You can also take up running or jogging.Strength training is also important. You'll need to build up muscle if you want to be a rodeo clown. Join a gym and engage in weight lifting and other forms of weight training. You might want to talk to a trainer about how to best build your muscles to top form.Practice improving your balance and agility. Exercise programs like cross fit, triathlon training, and other forms of exercise that engage multiple muscle groups and skill sets.
Strive to work out at least 5 times a week, focusing on weight training 3 of those days. Rest in between days you weight train.

, An instructor should be certified by an accredited association, such as the American Council on Exercise (ACE), or have passed a kick boxing certification exam from a licensed training facility. Instructors also should be experienced in the proper kick boxing techniques. Martial arts belts typically indicate their level of expertise.

, Most of the terms used by announcers during kick boxing competitions detail the competitors' positions and how they move from one position to another.

, A kickboxing competition will give you a chance to talk to some of the fighters about how they got started in the sport.

, They will help you get into top-notch condition, arrange your matches, negotiate payments, and promote you and your kickboxing competitions.

, To get status as an amateur kick boxer, you must file a license application with your state's local amateur boxing organization and have a routine physical. Participate in unsanctioned boxing events to gain experience before your first amateur match.

, These organizations provide a link between fighters and promoters.

, You'll need copies of your birth certificate, Social Security card and a photo ID; a signed statement from your physician verifying that you past a physical and an ophthalmoscope or dilated eye examination; and the results of your Hepatitis B and C and HIV tests.

Compete in amateur fights.,
Network.,
Talk with management companies.,
Be unique.",How to Become a Professional Fighter2," With your trainer's help, determine which competitions would be good for you to compete in and steadily build up the number of fights you enter per month. The more fights you win, the more you'll get noticed by scouts for sponsors., It would be great if a sponsor noticed your skills in the ring and offered you a contract to become a professional fighter, assigned you to a team, and hired you a new manager and trainer, but the truth is you'll have to do most of the work to get noticed. At conventions and big fight nights, tell everybody you meet you're training to become a professional fighter. Profiling yourself as a dedicated and skilled fighter with a number of amateur titles under your belt will win the interest of sponsors.Join fighting-centric websites and message boards to make connections on the Internet. Use as many resources as you can to build a name for yourself. Use social networking to market yourself as the next big thing.

, Approach management companies like Fight Tribe or Made to Win, that have a proven track record of managing fighters and negotiate a management deal with them.


By calling the shots yourself, you'll stand a better chance of determining who your team will be. However, it's important to understand that most management companies will only be interested if you have proven to be an interesting investment in the ring by winning a number of key fights against strong opponents. Keep winning to give yourself the best possible chance.

, ""Iron"" Mike Tyson used to come to the ring without the gym robe traditionally worn by boxers, and was surrounded by police officers, accompanied by the sound of chains clanging and a siren going off. It was beyond intimidating and instantly iconic. Kimbo Slice's prison tattoos, gold teeth, and giant beard made his YouTube bare knuckle fights all the more memorable and striking. The more savage and flamboyant your reputation, the better chance you'll have getting noticed and becoming a professional fighter.


Earn a nickname and use it to market yourself. Make it scary.
Use your background to create a story for yourself to give people something to relate to. If you're a veteran, use that image to appeal to people's patriotism. If you've served time in jail, use that. Even if you're the wealthy child of an insurance executive, cultivate a killer Wall Street persona to stand out from the crowd.

Stay healthy.,
Fight regularly.,
Forget the losses and the wins.,
Seek championships.",How to Become a Professional Fighter3," Your body is your life, so keep it in top working condition. Train correctly, regularly, and intelligently. George Foreman tried to return to the ring late in his career and appeared out of shape and unprepared. Don't make the same mistake. Get injuries taken care of and rested before jumping into the ring and risking your career. Avoid drugs, alcohol, and other unhealthy lifestyle choices.

, If you want to stay on top of the fighting game, you're going to have to keep fighting. Taking too much time off might allow people to forget your skills and let you slip in people's estimation of your talents. Treat your training as a job and your fights as a promotion. Constantly work toward the next victory and the next rung on the ladder.

, Few fighters will retire undefeated. If you're beaten, go back to the gym and get training. Do your best to forget about the losses, and avoid becoming overconfident about your victories. A fighter should always be eager to prove that he's the best. Challenge fighters that are better than you to continue honing your skills and get better.


Michael Jordan used to tape negative criticism (even if it wasn't that negative) to his locker to motivate himself for games. A good fighter will adopt a similar attitude. Prove yourself to the crowd, to the other fighters, and to yourself.

, Eventually, a career as a fighter will end if you don't make it to the top. Too many losses or too many periods of inactivity will result in lost sponsorships and a demotion in the prestige of your fights. To maintain a career as a fighter, you have to seek championship fights and defend your titles against the best fighters in your division.

Seek out an apprenticeship.,
Consider a training program.,
Make connections.",How to Become a Rodeo Clown2," Many smaller, youth rodeos offer apprenticeships to people interested in becoming rodeo clowns. This is a great place to both make connections and learn the ins and outs of the field.


Talk to ranchers and rodeo clowns you met working as a farmhand. Ask them if they know of any apprenticeship opportunities. As connections often help you land a job, this is where you should start in terms of seeking out apprenticeships.
You can also see what kind of youth rodeos are available in your area. Contact those running the rodeos, explain your credentials and career goals, and ask if they offer any apprenticeship programs.
There are a variety associations nationwide. Browse the websites of rodeo associations as they often advertise job listings and apprenticeship opportunities.

Invest in protective equipment.,
Book gigs.,
Join a professional rodeo organization.,
Be prepared to move.",How to Become a Rodeo Clown3," Remember, most rodeo clowns provide their own protective equipment. Before you start working in the field and booking gigs, invest in making sure you're protected.


You'll need your own rubber escape barrel, which can be quite pricey. A good barrel costs around $1,000.
Protective padding for your legs, hips, chest, and arms is also important. Padding can range from $100 to $300.Most rodeo clowns have a specific act or routine and many use props. If you want to wear a particular costume or use something like fireworks in your act these are expenses you'll have to take care of yourself.

, Once you have your equipment ready, you can begin booking gigs. It can be difficult to find work at first, as you're just starting out. However, go back to some of the connections you made along the way to see if anyone can help you find work. You can also find a rodeo clown contractor in your area, usually by asking at a local rodeo, and see if he has room for you in his registry. A contractor can help you find regular work and build a reputation., There are many professional rodeo organizations in existence. Being part of an organization can help give you credibility and make connections. This can lead to steadier work.


There are many professional rodeo organizations in existence. They include the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, the Southern Rodeo Association, the Woman's Rodeo Association, and more. Find an association that suits your need
Applications and membership vary from organization to organization. Most web sties should list member requirements online. See if you meet the qualifications and are financially able to keep up with any subsequent fees.

, Rodeos are often seasonal and move from town to town to state to state. Travel is an essential part of your career as a rodeo clown.


Budget for travel expenses. Rodeo clowns are usually not compensated for travel costs.
Be emotionally ready for a life on the road. There's a reason so many country songs focus on the lonely rodeo participant. Life in constant movement can be difficult. It can be hard to maintain romantic relationships and friendships when your location changes by season. Make sure you're ready for this kind of sacrifice.

Be willing to ask your prospects for money once they've demonstrated a real interest.",How to Become a Martial Arts Instructor," For example, the black belt is the highest belt in karate, awarded only to people who have put in the work, time, and dedication into learning the forms they are taught. This takes years to achieve, and you'll be expected to go to the karate classes at least two times a week. You shouldn't be teaching if you yourself haven't trained long enough, so you'll have to be a black belt if you want to teach karate. You may have to be past a first degree black belt, as well.;
, They vary widely depending on the country you'll be working in, and some are more strict than others (particularly Asian countries, where they are trying, for good reason, to preserve the art in ""martial arts""). Will you need some unpaid teaching experience first? Many dojos will allow you to teach without pay once you've proven yourself and have become a black belt., For example, getting enough training, getting unpaid teaching experience, finding your own place if that's what you'd like, et cetera., Before you go out and start renting your own dojo, you should first get some experience elsewhere! Try health clubs, rec-centers, churches (if you are teaching a highly spiritual martial art, churches may not be your best bet), and community centers -- these are all great examples of places that may let you start teaching. Many successful instructors have started this way, and it won't hurt your budget.


If you'd like to teach at an already-existing dojo, then get in contact with them and see if they'll give you an interview. You may have the best luck trying to teach at your current martial arts location, however.







, It's great to have credentials, but it's largely a waste of time pursuing ran"" simply for the sake of how it appears in a yellow pages ad. Many students won't care much for instructors who are more concerned with the ""alphabet soup"" at the end of their name than giving their students the best possible instruction. Besides, although all instructors should be Black Belts -- not all black belts should be instructors., The better you can market your ability to help people with your teaching, the more people you'll be able to teach. Ask yourself this: ""What #1 benefit will my karate instruction provide""? Spend more time answering that question and you'll rarely -- if ever -- have to worry about ""finding"" students; they'll find you. Also, be clear on who your classes are catered to, such children or adults, beginners or experienced students.

Don't be bashful: You've got to be willing to throw the modest humble-guy/gal approach out the window. You'll get more students by being unafraid of saying, ""Hey, here's why our style is better than such and such, and here's why you should study with me.""






Consider buying a mailing list of the type of prospect (that's business lingo for ""ideal potential karate student"") that you think you'll either attract, prefer, or otherwise end up teaching by way of either your personal style or characteristics. The purpose of advertising is to create a ""lead"" (person with interest in karate); the purpose of creating a lead is to ""convert"" that person into a ""prospect"" (someone who's very interested and is ready and looking for karate).

, (Make your ""next step"" something easy-to-do. Don't ask for or suggest that they spend money with you right away - that's what the conventional karate schools are all doing. Instead, offer a free consumer report like: ""5 Things You Need To Know Before You Even Think of Visiting a Karate or Martial Arts School"" -- or -- ""Kids Karate: How to choose one based on your child's personality"".

, Probably the most overlooked ""skill"" in becoming successful and well-paid martial arts instructor is the skill in answering the phone. You must possess the skill of getting someone to go from ""Passive Phone Talker"" all the way to ""Active Participant"". And you'll do this by getting everyone who calls you to commit to (and show up for) an introductory lesson. You can make your ""Intro"" free, or, you can offer a nominal, low-risk fee for ""test driving"" your expert instruction.

, The best way to do this is to practice it on people who you've not spent money on (i.e. role play with your friends, family, spouse, etc.). Sit or stand in front of them and tell them to pretend as if they just took a free class with you moments ago.... and then practice saying, ""The best part of our program, John, is that all you need to get started today is $295 dollars -- how did you want to take care of that; by check, cash, or credit card?""

Let your personality shine.",How to Become a Laker Girl," Laker Girls are expected to have at least 8 years of dancing experience. While this is not a requirement, it is recommended by organizers.Try ballet, jazz, modern, and hip hop dance classes. Your dance routines during the Laker Girls audition could include any of these types of dance, so you should know the basic moves in each of these styles.;
, You need to be in good shape to be a Laker Girl, so daily cardio workouts are necessary to maintain your physical stamina and body shape. Spend at least thirty minutes a day doing an activity like running, kickboxing, swimming, or any type of upbeat dance.Try a special workout class like barre, which combines aspects of ballet, yoga, and pilates for a full-body, high-energy workout.

, Don’t starve yourself. Your body needs some fats and carbs to have the energy to perform, so don’t cut these things out of your diet entirely. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, but also eat protein like turkey sausage, grilled chicken, and eggs.Make protein smoothies by mixing greek yogurt, your favorite fruit, some spinach or kale, a scoop of protein powder, and some ice.
Give your metabolism a boost by eating five small meals or snacks a day rather than 2-3 large meals. Healthy snack ideas include veggies and hummus, hard-boiled eggs, almonds, and greek yogurt.

, If you make it past the first few rounds of cuts, you’ll perform a solo for the judges. Have this choreography ready and polished before you arrive. If you’re having trouble coming up with something, listen to several songs and pick the one that inspires you the most. Then just dance along to it several times, letting the music move you. After awhile, you’ll begin to associate certain movements with certain parts of the music.Keep your dance choreography down to a few minutes at most. Try to blend dance styles to show that you’re versatile. Include leaps and turns to show off your skills, and try to make it fun and upbeat to match the type of dancing the Laker Girls normally do.

, You’ll be taught your first routine in the span of about five minutes, and then you’ll only have a few minutes to practice before performing for the judges. Practice this quick turnaround time by attending advanced dance classes, where this technique is common. Or have a friend make up some choreography and teach it to you in five minutes, then perform it for them a few minutes later., Laker Girls know all kinds of dance styles, but most of what you’ll see them do is upbeat jazz. They may perform complicated footwork with quick transitions, leaps, and pirouettes. Watch videos of them performing on Youtube or on the Lakers’ website so you can become familiar with their particular style of dance., Many girls wear soft dance shoes from brands like Capezio or Bloch. But you can also just wear a regular athletic shoe as long as you feel comfortable dancing in it. The only rule is that the shoes have non-marking soles on the bottom.Opt for a tan-colored dance shoe to make your leg line appear longer.

, Make sure the judges can see your body as you move through the dance routines. You can wear a crop top with sleeves if you’re not comfortable wearing a bikini top, but this is not an environment for modesty. Most girls will be wearing bikini tops or sports bras.Look for a bikini top from a place like Victoria’s Secret, where you’ll find colorful padded tops that offer lift and support. Just make sure you can dance and jump around without anything coming loose.

, You can visit a dance store and buy dance briefs, which are just tight, spandex shorts. Or buy swimsuit bottoms that match the top you’ve chosen. Opt for the boy-short design so they look more like shorts than underwear.If you want extra coverage on your legs, you can wear nude tights under your dance briefs., Your dancing ability is the most important part of your audition, but with so many other good dancers out there, you need to find other ways to stand out. Many girls will be wearing black dance shorts, so opt for an outfit with lots of color. Pick a pink, purple, or turquoise bikini, and add sequins or rhinestones to make it sparkle., Your instinct may be to pull your hair back into a tight ponytail or bun, but you want to show off a little bit of sex appeal. Wear your hair down and style it with large, loose curls. Wear eyeliner, eyeshadow, mascara, and red lipstick to make your features pop when you’re out on the floor.Wear jewelry if you’d like to, but be sure it won’t fly off or get in your face while you’re dancing.
Practice dancing with your hair down to get used to how it feels before auditions begin.

, Laker Girls are required to be at least 18 years old at the time of auditions. While there is no maximum age, most Laker Girls are in their late teens and early twenties. Bring a photo ID to prove that you’re 18 or older., Include all of your dance experience on your resume as well as past employment and performance credits. Education is relevant is you’re attending (or already attended) a well-known performance school like Juilliard or the School of American Ballet. Include experiences like being a dance extra in a music video or a commercial.

, You may be disqualified from auditioning if you don’t have a photo with you, so bring a couple copies just in case.Consider hiring a professional photographer to take your headshot. Avoid just taking a selfie and printing that off to give them; it doesn’t look nearly as professional to the judges., Tryouts are held at the Toyota Sports Center on Nash Street in El Segundo, California every year in early July. Visit the Lakers website for the most recent information., Registration begins promptly at 9:00 a.m. There are hundreds of women who show up to audition, so get there an hour or two before 9:00 to get in line., The girls all move onto the gym floor after registration, and you’ll have some time to stretch before things get started. Change into your dance shoes and practice some turns and leaps. Practice your splits to get a good stretch in your legs., You will be required to learn a short routine quickly and perform it for the judges. Pay attention to what the instructor is saying and showing you. This will typically only take five minutes, and then you’ll get some time to practice. Run through the routine several times by yourself, and ask other girls around you if you have any questions., There are hundreds of girls there for the first round, so you’ll be performing the first routine in large groups. If you make the first cut, you’ll learn a harder routine and repeat this process a couple more times.Do your best during these audition dances. If you make a mistake, keep going and keep smiling. Making an error doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be cut, as long as the judges still see your skill and energy.

, Toward the end of the day, when the pool of girls has been greatly reduced, the judges will ask you to introduce yourself and perform a solo. Tell them a little bit about yourself – your background, interests, and where you’re from. Then perform a dance that you choreographed yourself., Interviews will typically take place 2-3 days after the dance auditions. This is the final step toward becoming a Laker Girl. Since you’ll be representing the franchise at community events, the judges want to be sure you’re well-spoken, intelligent, energetic, and can carry a conversation. Be prepared to tell them why you want to be a Laker Girl.Leave the bikini at home for this part. Wear a dress that’s pretty and charming, but also hints at a little bit of sex appeal. A cocktail dress will typically work for this.Avoid generic answers like, “I love to dance,” since they already know that. Instead, talk about what you love about the Lakers or why this team and city appeals to you more than any other., Remember that they’re looking for more than just a good dancer – you need to be a brand ambassador. Be sure to smile and stay positive, enthusiastic, and friendly."

Decide if you’re suited to IT.,
Identify your passions and work with them.,
Focus based on your work style.,
Get to know the right people.",How to Start a Career in Information Technology1," You may be inclined towards information technology work, even if you haven’t given it much thought before. If you have a computer and use it for more than just homework, games, and casually browsing the web, then you may have the right stuff for the job.


IT work involves a lot of puzzles and experimentation. This makes it great for folks who like making connections and solving problems.People who want to go into IT should be able to work independently. This means that you must be motivated to solve problems on your own, and able to push yourself to improve.;
, IT is a vast field, so it’s worth it to focus on sectors that reflect what you love. For instance, if you love computer games, focus on that! Look into “IT computer gaming careers” and you might learn about IT fields you never knew existed, from game testing to writing game software to gaming customer support.

, You may love computer games, but that doesn’t mean you’re suited to every gaming job. Your personality shapes your talents as much as your passion does. There are hundreds of IT job descriptions out there, but most of them fall into three categories: consultant, project manager, and developer. The one which suits you most will depend on your personality.Look into consulting if you’ve ever dreamed of having your own advice column. Consultants work independently and dish out advice and expertise to multiple entities; the best consultants are friendly, patient, and helpful.If you’re good at getting organized and inspiring people, think of being a project manager. Not all project managers are as rigid as Darth Vader. Successful ones are energetic, focused, and good at seeing the big picture.If you’re bursting with ideas, look into being a developer. These workers are the creative side of IT: they invent new strategies and fix their own mistakes., Many IT gurus love to assist people. If you’re just dipping your toes into the world of IT, investigate to see if you have someone in your friendly or professional network who can tell you about the basics of your chosen field.There’s nothing wrong with networking, so don’t be shy about asking questions.


Find a role model. If you know someone with your dream job, it’s especially important to talk to them! Meet for coffee and ask them about their career arc. What kind of education do they have? What do they know now that they wish they’d known before?If you don’t know your career role model personally, that’s fine too. Try looking at the LinkedIn pages of folks with jobs you admire. What sorts of experiences have they racked up? What do they emphasize about themselves?"

Passing the audition and completing the franchisee training makes you a franchisee and a certified Jazzercise instructor.

, Once you are a qualified Jazzercise instructor there are two main ways to begin your new career. You can work as an associate instructor, or you can become an owner instructor. Associate instructors work for someone else who runs their own Jazzercise business, and you will just be teaching rather than dealing with business side of things.


An associate instructor can be a sensible way to start. You will limit your initial costs, and you can keep your day job while you develop your knowledge and client base.
There are still considerable costs involved to start as an associate. Jazzercise, inc. estimate the annual costs for an associate will be around $3,000.
This includes an initial franchise fee, an annual associate fee, as well as insurance, music downloads, and some equipment., If you are ready to quit your day job and become your own boss, you can set up as an owner instructor. Every qualified Jazzercise instructor can do this, it just requires extra work and costs to get going. As an owner instructor you will be running every aspect of your Jazzercise business, and you should plan out how you will pay for all of the following expenses:


Hiring space for the classes.
Obtaining the required equipment and facilities
Advertising and marketing your business
Keeping clear business and accounting records., The costs of being an owner instructor entirely depend on the level of investment you put in, but you should have a clear business plan before you start spending money. Jazzercise, inc. suggest that the cost of setting up and running a new Jazzercise centre could be anywhere between $9,000 and $38,000.


As an owner instructor you will be required to pay a Monthly Continuing Franchise Fee to Jazzercise, inc.
This is 20% of gross revenues or $250 per month minimum. There is no minimum for the first six months."

Become an 'Open Water Diver'.,
After completing your 'open water diver' course, progress onto the PADI advanced open water course.,
After completing your five advanced dives, move on to the rescue diver course, where, as the name suggests, you will learn to be of assistance to instructors and dive masters in an emergency situation.,
Take the Dive Master Course.,
Take the Instructor Development Course or IDC.",How to Become a Diving Instructor," This is the first step on how to become a Diving Instructor and it teaches you the necessary skills and methods for you to become a competent diver. The course will start with academic sessions in which you will learn the basic information required to understand what happens to your body when you dive and how to plan your dives safely. This is followed by the confined water sessions in a swimming pool or other controlled environment where you will be introduced to the skills you must complete in order to progress. You will then complete four open water dives and complete many of the skills that will form the basis of your continued development through to instructor level.;
, This course consists of five open water specialty dives; deep diver, navigation, and three dives of your choice. The dives you choose will be down to your personal preference but guidance will be given by your instructor.

, The course begins with a first aid standalone course called Emergency First Responders course, or EFR. You will learn basic first aid, useful in everyday life and also how to deal with dive related injuries such as decompression sickness. The course will then move to the pool where, once again, you will learn the skills to enable you to aid other divers that may be in trouble. The course then culminates with open water dives, in which situations will occur and you will be expected to use the skills that you have learned over the course to rescue the diver or divers in trouble.

, At this point, you will be a competent and experienced diver, able to deal with many situations that may occur in day-to-day diving life and well on your way to be learning how to become a diving instructor. The next major milestone on your progression of how to become a diving instructor is the dive master course. This is a structured course in which you will learn new skills and methods, how to run a dive boat and lead dive trips, as well as assisting instructors with their courses and providing support for students on their open water, advanced or rescue diver courses. You will sit exams and gain further knowledge in the science of diving, such as physics and biology. You will also cover the basics of teaching skills such as with a scuba review for those that have had a gap in between diving. The course will enable you to dive as much as you want, which is beneficial as you will need at least sixty dives in order to be signed off as a PADI Divemaster.

, This final course takes about three weeks and consists of the PADI Assistant Instructors course, the Instructors Development course or IDC, mock exams and final practical exams. Once you have completed and passed this final course you are now ready to take the Instructor Examination or IE. This is a program that is administered by PADI headquarters and may be done at their headquarters building in Rancho Santa Margarita, or an Instructor Examiner may travel to your area on a set schedule. The IE consists of a closed book five part Dive Theory Exam, an open book PADI Standards and Procedures Exam, giving a classroom presentation, a confined water skill presentation, confined water skills assessment to demonstration quality, two ocean skills presentations, and an ocean Rescue assessment. After successful completion of the IE, you are awarded a certificate of completion and are designated an Open Water Scuba Instructor or OWSI. And that’s it on how to become a diving instructor!

Evaluate your existing degrees and certifications.,
Review your self-taught skills.,
Identify your availability.,
Search for educational opportunities.,
Look into professional certifications.,
Get an internship in a reputable IT department.",How to Start a Career in Information Technology2," A bachelor’s degree in IT is helpful for entry level jobs, but it’s not absolutely mandatory. Some employers will accept a bachelor’s degree in a related field (like computer science) or an unrelated field (like history). You might even be able to swing an entry-level position with no bachelor’s at all.However, many if not most IT positions prefer some sort of higher educational experience.

, The more education you get in the field, the better your income will probably be in the long run.Still, don’t discount the importance of skills you’ve learned outside the classroom.


Think about projects you’ve worked on (like designing a website or a game). What role did you play in them? Were your creative or organizational powers challenged?
Find out if any of these skills are certifiable. Certification is often as easy as paying a fee and taking a test; if you’re already so comfortable with something that you feel confident about taking an exam in it, go ahead and get certified.

, Are you just starting undergrad, or are you a stay-at-home parent? The amount of time you have to devote to your IT training and education will shape what you are able to do. However, if you’re not able to set aside 40 hours a week to learn about IT, don’t despair; remote and part-time opportunities may be just what you need., Based on your desired career path, current educational and professional experience, and amount of free time, look into different schools to figure out which suits you best. Don’t forget to determine what the entry requirements are for each field of study.


Make a spreadsheet to keep you on track. Include time commitment, commute, and financial aid, as well as certification.Don’t go into unmanageable debt for a higher-education degree. Reputable online programs, trade schools, and financial aid can help you manage the cost of your schooling.
Know that there is no single educational path to an IT career. It's a broad field, and your education may take anywhere from a few months to four years to complete. For instance, to be a systems analyst, you may need a bachelor's degree, but for help desk work, you may only need experience or an associate's degree., Even without a college degree, an MCSE or A+ certification can gain you significant credibility. For most certifications, you'll study and review a certain narrow subject, then sign up for an online exam. There is usually a fee, but the exams are often quick and can be done in your home.Figure out the best certifications by researching which ones are popular in your country and field, and stay updated! As you might expect in a tech field, certifications emerge, update, and become obsolete every year.
Consider getting certified in a popular programming language, like Java.Information Technology Infrastructure Library certification has been around since the 80s (with updates, of course). It's one of the most broadly applicable certifications around, so it's good for generalists.Database certification will also serve you well, since all sorts of businesses use them to organize their information. Oracle offers several database certifications at different levels.Don’t assume your educational degree will be enough. Certifications can net you an 8-16% pay increase. Not only that, but they make you look committed to learning and growth, which is attractive to employers., Good grades are nice, but work experience is even better. If you get a feel for what it’s like to work for a reputable company, you’ll build a network and learn a great deal about IT workplace norms. Also, many of IT internships are paid, which is a nice bonus.


Talk to professors or professional acquaintances to make internship connections.Make your resume as great as possible. Even if you don’t have a ton of work experience, a clearly-written and focused resume which highlights your strengths can help you snag that internship.Apply for internships at a range of companies, from tiny to well-known. You might be intimidated by the idea of interning at Google, but remember that someone has to fill the internship spots there. Why shouldn’t that person be you?

"
"
Form a resume.,
Apply with a broad focus.,
Take time on your cover letter.,
Interview smart.,
Keep honing your skills.",How to Start a Career in Information Technology3," Even if you already created a resume to nab an internship, give it a refresh before you apply for a full-time job. Resumes adhere to strict guidelines, but if you work within those parameters, they can say a lot about you. Write in clear, accessible language, and don’t be afraid to show yourself in a positive light.


Include relevant work experience and accomplishments.In many cases, customer service is relevant, even if it doesn’t directly pertain to IT.Emphasize your certifications and education, too.
Know you’ll have to tweak your resume based on the jobs you’re applying to. Stay flexible.Post your resume on job search and networking sites like Monster and LinkedIn.

, You don’t need to apply to every single IT job in a hundred-mile radius, but don’t waste time looking for the perfect job either. Read job descriptions thoroughly, and give your time to any that pique your interest and seem to mesh well with your skills and experience., Your resume shows a lot about your history of accomplishments, but your cover letter shows off your personality. There isn’t as much structure to a cover letter, but in general, you’ll want it written in businesslike language, focused on you and the job you want, and carefully edited and proofread.


Tailor the letter to the job. Mention details of the job description, and why they match up to your skills and talents.Emphasize the good qualities and things you’ve accomplished that might not be visible on your resume.For instance, if you’ve done relevant volunteer work as the webmaster of your church’s website, you can expand on it and explain its relevance to the job you’re applying for.

, If your cover letter and resume are up to scratch, you may be invited in for your first IT interview. Interviews in any field can be stressful, but with a little preparation, you’ll be able to breathe a lot easier. Focus on doing your homework before so you can concentrate on seeming confident in the interview.


Practice your answers to questions the night before. You won’t be able to predict everything you’re going to be asked, but know your chief strengths and weaknesses, your relevant experience, and how to describe yourself in a minute or less.Show up on time and dress neatly. IT workers are famous for a casual aesthetic, but you still want to look like you pay attention to detail.
Remember that you’re interviewing the company, too. Ask questions about the culture and expectations.Some examples are “What is the last person with this position up to now?” and “Do people in this position work in teams, or independently, more often?”

, IT is constantly changing, and once you have a job, you should continue growing along with the field. Keep up with evolving applications, hardware, and software that you'll need to utilize. Blogs and IT publications can be useful resources to find out what’s new, and so can your coworkers and professional network.<


Consider getting additional certifications outside of work, either to broaden your scope at your job or make you better at your current specialty.Keep your ears open about professional development opportunities offered within your company."
"
Identify your value proposition.,
Determine what makes your service unique so that you can differentiate yourself from the competition.,
Identify your target market.,
Less competition


When you offer an IT service to consumers, you're offering something they don't already have and they may think it is something they don't need.,
Determine your target sector.,
Decide on your approach to the market.",How to Sell IT Services," Your value proposition is defined as the value you will deliver to your customers. You might be selling remote database administration or maybe custom software development, but you need to determine what benefits your service will provide to the customer.

, For example, ask yourself if your company has unique expertise or extensive knowledge of a certain industry.

, Determine whether you will target businesses, consumers, or both.


Targeting businesses presents a very lucrative opportunity as companies tend to have bigger budgets than consumers.
Companies are always in need of vendors and they tend to treat vendors as needed suppliers of inputs and business services unless they can cover the need internally
You will have more competition if you choose to target businesses than if you target consumers.
You'll want to consider the size of the businesses you decide to target. Selling to Fortune 1000 enterprises will require a longer sales cycle and the approval of more decision makers. Selling to Fortune 1000 companies may also require purchasing liability insurance. Contracts received from Fortune 1000 companies will be larger, but will be more competitive. Targeting small to medium sized businesses is often touted as pursuing ""low lying fruit"" and can be a good place to start.

, Be prepared that it may take more effort to sell IT services to consumers.;
, Are there particular industries that would benefit from the type of IT service you are offering? Are there particular industries that are unlikely to use your service? For example, machine shops are not very likely to utilize software development services.

,


Cold calling prospects is an old fashioned way of getting business. Start off by buying a list based on certain specifications from a reputable lead supplier and then contact the decision makers.

In rural areas, it may be difficult to find someone proficient enough in this martial art to sufficiently guide you. If you live in a highly populated area, you may have to pick a good teacher from among many. The most important part of this process is to find a teacher that works well to motivate your development and who is capable of teaching you advanced skills.


A karate teacher can be called “senpai”, “sensei”, “renshi”, “shihan”, “kyoshi”, or “hanshi”.
Senpai is used for anyone who is your senior. Sensei gets used for any teacher.
Renshi is a title that is independent of rank, and is commonly used to refer to teachers.Shihan designates an expert teacher, but has little meaning outside of its organizational meaning.Kyoshi is used for a person in the 7th and 8th dan.
Hanshi refers to a master teacher, one who instructs instructors. This title means they have attained the 9th or 10th dan. ;
, You'll never make it as a karate teacher if you haven't mastered your skill. Anyone can buy a black belt and pretend. It is another thing altogether to earn it. Karate practitioners are considered to be proficient once they've earned a black belt. This is called the 1st dan. It requires a person to be 15 years old and have undergone three years of training.


Kyus are the lower levels in karate. These represent students who have not yet attained the first dan. A person who holds a kyu rank is called a mudansha. Kyu rank color belts start with white and end with brown.
Dans are the levels of mastery. There are ten. However, only the first 8 are attainable without recognition from an international governing body (there are many, and they correspond to the style of karate you choose). A person who holds the dan rank is called a yudansha. This is commonly what people mean when they say, “I have a black belt in karate.”, You must continually work to hone your skills. If you do not practice, you will not be very good. No one will want to learn karate from a teacher that performs poorly. By practicing regularly, you make sure your skills are sharp for your students., There are some differences between the major styles of karate, however the major difference is the location where they were practiced. Each one is named after a city. There is no way to determine which style of karate is best for any individual. In order to figure out which one you like best, try them all.


Shuri-te is from Shuri in Okinawa.
Naha-te is from Naha in Okinawa.
Tomari-te is from Tomari in Okinawa.
Shotokan is practiced more commonly on mainland Japan.

, This will earn you notoriety and titles. There are two major components of typical karate exhibitions: kata and kumitejiai. By competing in one or both of these categories, you will enhance your skills and standing within the community. Find out about championships by contacting dojos in your area.Kata means forms, and is an individual demonstration of karate moves.
Kumitejiai is a sparring match. In it two practitioners compete for points.

, This can provide you with resources. Seminars and networking, as well as membership information and benefits can aid your quest to become a karate teacher. One downside to many of these organizations is membership fees. However, these are often offset by perks. There are four major styles of karate, each with their own international governing body.


Shotokan is the most common style, with two organizations and nearly 1,000 branches. The Japan Karate Association and Shotokan Karate International are the major groups of this style.
Wado Ryu's governing body is the JKF Wado Kai.JKF Shito Kai represents the Shito Ryu style.The international organization for the Goju Ryu style is the International Karate-do Goju Kai.The Kyokushin style is organized through the International Karate Organization and Karate-do Daido Juko., There is no better way to learn how to teach than by learning from another teacher. Apprentice, assist, or student teach under a master you respect. This will help you gain valuable experience working with students, as well as expert advice with any complications or troubles you might encounter. You will have to take initiative and contact these teachers yourself, calling, e-mailing and visiting dojos.

, Before and during your work as a teacher, you will need to develop your skills as a teacher. Teaching draws upon a wide variety of skills, not just combat abilities. You can be the greatest fighter in the history of the world, but if you can't interact well with students, then you won't make a very good teacher.



Learn how to communicate with students of all ages. As a karate teacher, it is likely that you will have students who are children and some adult students as well. When speaking with your young students, you will need to put things into simpler terms to help them understand and try to hold their interest by being a little silly sometimes. With your adult students, you will need to develop a friendly rapport and offer direct, yet considerate feedback to help them learn.

Practice patience when working with students. Most students will try and fail many times before they succeed, so being a teacher requires a lot of patience. Even if you feel frustrated with your students, try not to let it show.

Work on encouraging your students. Students need encouragement to stay motivated enough to stick with karate. Compliment your students when they do a good job and encourage them to keep trying when things get tough.

, An easy way to get into teaching is to work at a dojo that is established. Make contacts in your area to see if any school has an opening or is willing to rent their space for your lessons. By allying yourself with an established dojo, you may be able to draw upon their experience, as well as their established client base.

, You don't need a dojo to teach other people karate. You can give lessons in your home, in your students' homes, or in the park. Place a listing online, in the newspaper, or put up fliers to inform potential students about your classes.

, If you have the financial means, you can open your own dojo. This may take some saving, taking out a loan, or building it yourself. This is a lot of work, but at some point, every successful dojo began with very little and worked their way up.


Be sure to get registered with your local or national karate organizations.
Be careful, as this can be a major investment of time and money.
Consider your class demographic. For example, if you are not good with children, think about targeting your classes at adults."

Expected growth industries change a little every year, especially in the technology sector where new platforms and programs create new types of jobs. Do extensive research before you enter school. Search online for articles about high-growth technology jobs, read business and technology journals and discuss job growth with people you know in the technology sector.;
, While there are some technology jobs that do not require a 4-year degree, this is the standard for engineering, administration and software development. Consider Management Information Systems (MIS), Computer Science or Software Engineering.

Once you’ve earned your college degree, you’ll be prepared to start gaining experience in IT-related fields.;
, Any IT consultancy companies that you apply to work for will want to see at least a couple years of experience on your resume. Experience in the IT field will also prove valuable when you need to generate a list of potential clients for your business.Internships are a valuable way to work in an IT field without going through a competitive hiring process. During or after college, personally visit consulting companies in your area and ask if they are willing to hire you as an intern.
Volunteer as much as possible; although volunteer positions are seldom paid, they look impressive on a resume and will quickly build your level of experience in the IT field.

, Decide what specific type of job you want; IT consulting is a large field and, in order to remain competitive and not exhaust yourself, you’ll need to hone in on specific jobs.


For example, consider if you would prefer to work as a systems engineer, network support, etc.
Do not plan to service overly large groups, such as “everyone” or “small businesses.” Both of these target markets are too broad for IT consultants.
Ask yourself what types of clients or technology you want to work with, by evaluating where most of your own experience and interest lies., You should have your resume laid out and up-to-date before you begin applying for any jobs. Keep the resume short (1 page), and focus on highlighting your previous work and experience in IT fields.


Consider which of your distinct skills will be most valuable in the position you are applying too, and foreground that on your resume.Pay attention to the wording of the job description, and tailor your resume to show your proficiency at the specific job skills that the employer has asked for.
Describe the specific steps of work (whether when employed or as an intern) that you have already performed in an IT field., You can start developing professional contacts during college or early work experience, and they will prove valuable as you begin to search for potential employers.Network contacts can also serve as a potential client base once you are working in an IT consultant position.


Professional and academic contacts are also a useful resource to ask for letters of recommendation.
A great way to utilize and expand on your professional network is through social media. Websites such as LinkedIn and Facebook allow you to easily keep in touch with a large number of people. You can also use these sites to reach out to consulting companies that may be looking to hire IT consultants.

, Once your resume is ready, and you have used your network base to find out about potential IT consultant positions, you’re ready to start applying for jobs. When applying, don’t be humble or shy: highlight your strengths on paper and in person, and focus especially on your education, work, and internships in the IT field.


Websites such as “Indeed” allow you to specify the type of job you are looking for and the location you would like to work in, and then deliver a list of relevant jobs you can apply for.

, Once you’ve been called in for an IT-consultant interview, you’ll need to prepare and learn about the specific consultant company. As always, when giving an interview, present yourself with professionalism and confidence.


In the interview, explain how your It skills are relevant and helpful to the specific position that you are applying for. You should also come informed and knowledgeable about the company and their clients.Bring a couple of specific ideas to the table, and show that you are interested in the future and vision of the company, and in ways in which you can be involved in that future.Many IT interviews consist of multiple phone interviews prior to the face-to-face interview.The phone interviews may discuss the job itself, and also inquire about your IT qualifications and knowledge.

, You’ll be able to work more effectively as an IT consultant—and you’ll enjoy you work more—if you find a niche or specialty within the IT field, in which you excel and enjoy working. Few IT consultant positions require you to work with all types of technology and clients—find a specialty that you enjoy, and hone your skills in that specific niche.During your first few months on the job, see which types of work you enjoy the most. Then, try to work with more clients in that specific area, and develop your skills through experience or even an academic certificate.
Your niche could depend on your prior IT experience, which types of IT work you enjoyed most in college, or which clients you prefer to work with.

, Once you have a job working in an IT-consultant position, it’s time to increase your knowledge and master the subject (keeping in mind that you’ve already selected a specific niche). Becoming an SME will also help you remain competitive in your job, as IT is a rapidly developing field.Consultants who do not master their specialty can be left behind when competing for jobs or promotions.


Building your networking and increasing your credentials are two essential aspects of becoming an SME. A more developed network will include other IT-professional contacts, potential clients, and former associates.
You can increase your credentials by pursuing certifications and gaining experience in the field., Once you have worked in your consulting position for at least a year, you can begin to work your way up by earning a promotion and, hopefully, an accompanying raise. This is an important step of professional development.


When asking for a promotion or raise, lead with your accomplishments. Show your supervisor some of the successes you’ve had over the last year or two, describe your specialization and unique interests, and state your case for why you deserve a promotion.

, This is your unique combination of specialized skills, work experience, and personal demeanor that your clients, coworkers, and employers will come to associate with you as an individual.


A valuable part of a personal brand is to know your area of expertise, and focus on promoting that. Take jobs that primarily play into your IT strengths.
Network and become known within your field. Branding also influences how you are seen within your professional network; attend conferences and workshops, and set yourself up as an expert in your niche.A strong and appealing personal brand will make you a more appealing IT professional to your clients. Your personal brand will help your clients trust you more., Although starting any type of small business involves startup costs, working as an IT consultant will not require a large up-front investment, especially if you are working from your own home.Your major startup costs will come from:


General and Professional Liability (E&O) Insurance.
Purchasing a domain name and setting up a business website.
Creating business cards and a separate business phone.
Advertising and marketing.

, While a consulting business can be somewhat abstract—you sell your experience and opinion, not a concrete objects (e.g. cars or houses)—advertising is still a necessary way to attract clients.Consider purchasing advertising space in venues like:


IT magazines, both print and online.
Other tech publications.
Cold-calling local small businesses.

, The best way to specialize is to rely on your own previous experience. Personal work experience in the tech field is often the best starting place for your IT consultancy.


If you worked in computer repair and setting up servers for small businesses, as many IT professionals have, continue to offer these services as an independent consultant.Many new IT consultants make the mistake of trying to market too broadly. Consider narrowing down your focus by region, industry, company-size, and existing technology platform.Specialize based on the location you work in. Your geographical area may have a large number of desktop PC users, Mac users, cloud-based computing needs, etc. Exploit this kind of opportunity to provide the service most needed in your own location.If you are in a large urban area, you will likely be able to find plenty of IT work in your immediate vicinity.
If you are based in a smaller town or rural area, you may need to travel more in order to keep a business afloat. You may also need to service a broader spectrum of IT needs.

, Unlike working in IT in a large business or office setting, as a consultant, you will often have to multitask and keep up with several different jobs at the same time.You will need to simultaneously work with varying types of software, hardware, and network technologies.

, This is important to maintain strong business relationships with your clients. Ask them if the service you provided met their expectations, and politely accept any criticisms they may have.After finishing a job for a client, ask them if they will return to you for their future IT needs.

, Make sure you work most with small-business clients that value the ongoing support and oversight that you bring to the table.


Many new IT consultants spend way too much time and energy dealing with one-shot-deal, transaction-oriented customers, with very little potential for substantial repeat monthly business.
Look especially for small businesses that have the needs and budget to consult with you on a regular basis.

Market and profitize your app.",How to Become a Mobile Application Developer," While a degree in computer science is not strictly necessary, it can give you a foundation for the field. Plus, many companies will prefer you have at least a bachelor's degree in computer science if they are going to hire you on as a developer.If you can, try specializing in mobile application coding while you are in school.
Other degrees in relevant fields can also help, such as in software development. In fact, some schools offer degrees specifically in mobile app development.;
, The major platforms are Android, Apple, Windows, Symbian, and RIM (Blackberry). You can learn to code for all of these platforms, but you probably need to choose one when you're first staring out.Android is the dominate market, but Apple is not far behind. One of these two would be a good place to start., For instance, Apple offers the iOS Dev Center. In the center, you can view tutorials and videos to help you begin learn coding. Android has a similar site, Android Developers Training.However, you don't need to rely on just the official streams. Many websites across the web offer free classes and tutorials, though you can also find for-pay classes if you want to take it to the next level.


One example of a place where you can learn coding is W3Schools, a well-known website for learning coding. It has a section on JQuery Mobile, which you can use to create mobile apps. This coding system is based in CSS3 and HTML5.You can also try places that offer free online courses on a wide variety of subjects, such as edX or Coursera., You can take classes while you're getting a degree, take classes at a community college for cheaper, or even take classes at online sites such as Coursera to develop your marketing skills. If you're wanting to go out on your own as an app developer, you need to be able to market your game to the public; otherwise, the public will never even know it exists., Like marketing skills, business skills are also essential for building successful apps on your own. Business classes can help you learn how to properly monetize your app, as well as how to create incentives for people to spend more., If you prefer to be hired on by a company, some great practice in the meantime is to develop your own app. It doesn't really matter what it is as long as it is useful or fun. Then, when you are searching for a job, you have something to prove your work.


Having experience in the field, even if it's just developing your own app, can put you ahead of other candidates., Of course, a large number of apps are games. Games help people pass the time. However, any place you see a need could be a starting point for an app. So the first step is to determine where there's a need. Look at your own life and friends' lives, and consider what problems you or they have that an app could help solve. Once you've got an idea, start mapping out your app.


For instance, apps such as DocScan and Scannable were developed because people needed a way to scan and store documents away from computers. The people who developed the app saw a need and filled it.
Other apps, such as recipe apps, make it easier for people to find and use recipes because it's easier to use a recipe off a tablet or phone than off of a computer.

, First and foremost, an app needs to be easy to use by the customer. Therefore, the main page should lead the person through the app with clear buttons, contrasting colors, and easy navigation.One trick is to make sure you're using as much of the screen as you can. That doesn't mean you should cover every available inch with controls because you need negative space around the tools to make it readable. You have to balance using as much space as you can with making your buttons as large as you can. Partially, that means you need to keep your controls and buttons as simple as you can.Make it easy to understand. That is, your user shouldn't need to reference other pages to figure out how to use your app. They should be able to figure it out just from the controls., While you may have the coding skills, you may not have the design skills you need. If you need help in a particular area, consider hiring people on or collaborating with people who agree to take a portion of the profits as payment. Just be sure to give credit where credit is due whenever you are presenting the app.


If you're not sure where to hire help, you can check freelancing sites such as UpWork, where you can hire people in different fields.

, New apps always have bugs, so play-test your app. Have your friends test it, too, to see where the bugs are so that you can fix them. It also teaches you what works and what doesn't work in an app.In other words, have your friends download the app on your phone. Let them play through it to see if they notice glitches.
It's also important to get feedback on how the app and controls work. Ask your friends questions such as ""Did you have trouble working the controls?"" and ""What problems do you see with the app?""

, Once you learn how to build an app on one platform, it's time to convert it to other platforms. You are missing out on customers if you don't offer the app on platforms that all customers use.With each platform, you must think about different problems. For instance, when moving from iOS to Android, you have to consider screen size difference. In iOS, the number of screen sizes is more limited, while Android has a much wider variety, and your app is going to look a little differently on each one.Another key point is to keep it simple. The more complicated it is, the harder it will be to convert and to have it look nice on different screens., Another way to gain experience, even while you're in school, is to apply for internships. You can often find internships through your school, as companies will approach schools to find people to be interns. You may even make some money to pay for school or get school credit for the internship.Internships are great experience, but don't expect to be coding right away. You'll likely be doing at least some menial tasks while working at an internship.
Many of the major tech companies will offer internships to local college students, so check their websites, as well.

, Certain areas are up-and-coming for this market. Silicon Valley in California is an obvious choice for this field. However, other, more unexpected areas, such as Washington, D.C., Alabama, Virginia, Utah, and Montana, have projected growth in the field of up to 45 percent.While some companies may let you telecommute, most of the time, they are going to want you in the office. Many tech companies value group creativity, which is easier to encourage in an office setting.

, If you plan to work for a tech company, start by applying for positions. You can find job listings on major job websites, such as Monster, Indeed, or Yahoo.However, you can also search the websites of major mobile app companies to find jobs. Think about the apps you love, and look at the developer. Those places are where you want to apply because you already have a passion for what they do.


What type of company you apply to depends on what you want. If you work at a startup, you're likely to have more hands-on time with the app and maybe more control. However, you don't know if a company is going to succeed or fail in it's early stages. With a more established company, you're more likely to be working on one small part of several apps, rather than being in control; on the other hand, you can be more confident that the company doesn't go under.

, If you have a degree and experience, use that to help you get a job. For instance, if you designed your own app, you now have a way to show how well you can code or design. If you interned at a company, you now have experience under your belt that other candidates may not have. Use whatever you've got to stand out from other candidates.Be sure to highlight the experience you have in your cover letter. For instance, if you had an internship, you could say, ""I would be a valuable asset to your company, as I already have experience coding at a similarly sized tech company. I interned at XYZ Tech for 6 months in 2014.""

, When you work in the tech industry, you need to always know what's coming. One way to do that is to read tech magazines, as they often focus on what's ahead. As new coding platforms and technology comes on the market, it's your responsibility to learn it, so that you don't become obsolete., If you're going into business for yourself, that means you must be everything to your app. You must figure out the best way to profit off it, and then you must market your app across major social media outlets.Some companies offer the app for free, then charge to make the game faster or more enjoyable, such as offering packs of coins or stars. Customers may already find these types of incentives in the game, but the packs make the game move along more quickly for impatient players, especially if you pace the game so that only so much can be completed in a day without more of the in-game coinage.
Find the right keywords. When naming your app and writing up a description, think about what your customers will be looking for. What word would you use to search for your app? You need to make that a part of your title, description, or keywords if possible.Use in-app sharing. One way to encourage users to share is to have ways to help each other in the game, such as being able to give other users extra lives. If users can share on major social media platforms, such as Facebook, you'll have more luck with word-of-mouth.Don't forget to pay. You can set up an app on Facebook or a mobile platform, but if you're not willing to pay for advertising, you're going to have a hard time building your customer base, especially if you're just relying on your friends.

, Without these, the web and other programs wouldn't function properly. Programming languages and platforms are what developers use to create applications, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to follow.
There are dozens of different programming languages.
Each language uses a different platform or program to write scripts, programs, and instructions.

, This is one of the simplest and most commonly used programming languages for websites. Most people can learn the basics of HTML in an afternoon using one of the many online tutorials available.
HTML is a language that consists of multiple short codes are typed into a text document. It has its own grammar and syntax just like any language.
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
Hypertext is the method by which you move around the internet. You click on a link, which is hypertext that directs you from one page to another.
When you write in HTML, you will use a series of tags. These tags tell the text what to do: be italicized, link to another page, be a bulleted point etc.
When you write HTML in a text file, it is then saved as an html file. This file is then opened by a browser, like Google Chrome or Firefox.
Your browser reads the file and translates your code into visual form. That's the website you see.
To utilize HTML, you can use a simple text editor or a powerful HTML editing tool like HTML Kit.
Other programming languages work similarly, but use different syntax and tags. Other languages are available for more complicated types of webpages.

, This is a very commonly used programming language for web developers. The main goal of Java is to allow web developers to write a script or set of instructions for an application.
This language allows application writers to ""write once, run anywhere"".
Some popular websites that use this language are Netflix, Edmunds and Zappos.
Some of the most popular tools for writing and coding in Java are JSON and CORE.

Eclipse is another popular tool for using C++. , This is a very popular coding language used by many popular websites. Python is a programming language known for its ease of use that allows developers to quickly create code and integrate systems.
This language has programming syntax that is easy to read and follow. This reduces the cost of program maintenance. Some of the websites that you probably use everyday are Python based, such as Google and Youtube.
Some of the tools you can try for working with Python are Komodo Edit IDE, PyCharm IDE, and Eclipse with PyDev.

, Most web developers don't do their own graphic design, but its important to know the basics. You should know how to crop a graphic, resize it, change color scheme, and add text.
There are many different graphic and photo editing apps and programs for you to use.
Each has their own interface and methods.
While most web developers at larger companies don't do the graphic design for apps and pages, its important to have a good general sense of basic graphic editing.
Many web developers will end up doing some basic graphic editing, especially at smaller firms or if they are self-employed.

, This will allow you to practice and get oriented with simple graphic editing.


Free editing software suites such as GIMP and Inkscape are available for download.
There are number of online tutorial for GIMP and Inkscape. These free editing software packages allow you to do the basics of graphic and photo editing.
With GIMP and Inkscape you can crop and resize a photo or graphic, add shapes and text, remove red-eye and change the colors of your graphic.

, Create a simple website based on a topic you are interested in.

You should begin to focus on math and business courses, as these will be most directly related to your future work. A strong background in reading, writing and analysis will also be helpful., To get a job as an equity analyst, you will need a college degree. You can get started with a four-year bachelor’s degree, although a master’s degree will make you a stronger job candidate. You should focus your studies on economics, finance or business.The guidance counselor at your high school should be able to help you research colleges and universities that have strong financial programs. If you are already out of high school, you may try calling the guidance office of the high school in your area to see if they could help you anyway. You might also check with the reference librarian at your public library or at an area college library.

Your company may have a program to reimburse you for education costs. You may also be entitled to salary increases in relation to the courses that you take.

, One of the best ways to gain experience is to work in an internship while you are studying. Some schools may offer internship programs for undergrads, while other internship programs are for graduate students only.

Before you begin applying for jobs, you should at least understand the two types of positions and be aware of the focus for the companies where you apply.A sell-side analyst often works for a large investment bank.

A common question, particularly for a position in a top-level company, would be to ask you to discuss one or more particular stocks that you have studied, and explain why you would or would not recommend them to a client. In short, you need to be prepared to be put on the spot just as you would on the job.Through your interview, you need to project enthusiasm as well as intelligence. You need to show that you are able to analyze stocks, make decisions, and communicate your thoughts clearly.

, The most useful certification for an equity analyst is the Chartered Financial Analyst, or CFA. There are other certifications, but the CFA is the most likely to be beneficial. Some top business schools offer MBA programs that include study for the CFA certification.

The Level I exam is offered in either late spring or fall, while the Level II and Level II exams are offered only once a year, in the late spring.

The general range of topics includes:ethics and professional standards
quantitative methods

Set up your office.",How to Become a Trader," They are a variety of different types of trader which you can become, so spend some time thinking about what role and job description fits your skills and interests most. Most traders will work for a company, buying and selling shares, bonds and assets for investors. Flow traders work for banks, buying and selling for the bank’s clients. Proprietary traders buy and sell on behalf of the bank itself.


Sales traders act as intermediaries between a client and the market, investing their clients’ money. They talk to clients directly, advising them on the market and investment opportunities.
The main difference is that sales traders only invest where instructed by their clients, so the trader is not taking a risk with the investment.
Some traders will specialise in a particular product or market area.You could also work independently as a day trader if you had enough capital.;
, Trading is a very demanding job that requires a particular skill set, as well as the ability to learn new things quickly and adapt to a constantly changing environment. Before you think about getting the official qualifications and certifications you will need, consider the general skills that a trader must demonstrate.


Traders will need exceptional analytical skills and an aptitude for working with large amounts of quantitative data.
Traders will also need softer skills, such as the ability to communicate well with clients and provide detailed advice on market movements and opportunities.You must be able to work well in a team, but take responsibility for yourself.Traders must have a keen interest in the workings of the market and be able to learn quickly.
Traders need very strong personal discipline and motivation. You will have to make split second decisions without emotion, based on your analysis., Spend some time researching and learning about trading, how markets work, and what the daily working life of a trader involves, before you commit to a course of education and training. A trader’s day will involve analysing the market, and providing detailed market reports to clients or colleagues.


You will look for mispriced assets or other opportunities.
You will work to keep people informed and up-to-date on relevant events and prospects in the markets, liaising closely with clients and colleagues and building strong working relationships.
You will make numerous trades, acting quickly to respond to the shifting financial landscape.
You may seek to gain new clients and present opportunities to them., It is not necessarily essential to have a degree to become a trader, but the competition to work for a major financial institution is considerable. Without a high-quality degree from a prestigious university, you will have a difficult time getting a foot in the door. It may in some instances be possible to enter through an administrative position, make some contacts, and work your way up to a trading position. In theory you do not need a degree in a specific subject, but the following areas are those most highly valued:


Economics.
Mathematics.
Finance.
Accountancy.
Sciences., While you are studying you can help yourself get ahead by actively seeking out internships or summer placements. A placement will give you valuable experience of the realities of daily working life as a trader, but it will also help you to develop contacts who may then help you get your first graduate position.

Many financial institutions will run schemes, so it is often best to contact one directly to inquire about the possibilities.
You can also ask your professors, who may have a contact or a recommendation for you.
There are also a number of websites that list internship opportunities online that you can search through.

, Once you have achieved a good degree in a relevant subject, the first step is usually to get a position as a graduate trainee at a bank or investment company. These are highly competitive, so you will need a very strong academic record as well as a real enthusiasm and commitment to working as a trader. Employers will be looking for candidates who have excellent numeracy and quantitative analytical skills.


But employers will also want people who have strong interpersonal and communication skills.
You should try to demonstrate strong mental and physical stamina, and a preparedness to work exceptionally hard., The competition is fierce, and often employers will have a large number of excellent candidates for a small number of positions. In this situation networking and personal recommendations can be highly beneficial, and help you stand out from the crowd. Talk to your university and try to identify people who are working in the industry who are happy to be contacted by a fellow alumni.


Ask around friends and family to see if there is someone you know working in trading.
Stay persistent throughout. It is a difficult industry to break into so you will need to prepare for a long struggle, and not be put off by some setbacks., Once you have got yourself onto a graduate trainee scheme, you will still be required to continue your education. You will need a licence before you are actually able to buy and sell on the markets. The requirements for this will depend where in the world you. In the US, you must obtain a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) licence.

In the UK, you must become an approved person by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

You will take the necessary qualifications as part of your graduate position.
Usually the company will pay for your examinations, but you will have to commit a lot of spare time to studying and preparing.
This may include attending lectures, seminars and conferences.
You will also be expected to pick up the more practical everyday skills by shadowing a more senior colleague., Most often, your first two years in a position will be considered your traineeship. This is when you will get certification, and help out around the office, learning the ropes on a variety of tasks. You need to work very hard, be patient, and always look for opportunities to develop your knowledge, skills and experience. After two years of satisfactory performance, you may be moved up to the next level and become a trader or analyst.


You will need to have completed all your exams and be fully certified before you can trade.
After a few successful years you can expect to move up to an associate position.
The next step up to executive level is much rarer and harder to achieve., You can become an independent day trader, trading with your own or a client’s money. If you are thinking of doing this, ensure that you are not committing money that you cannot afford to lose. It is estimated that around 90% of day traders lose money, so you shouldn’t be thinking of trading as a way to make a quick buck to get out of a job you hate.This is a job that requires professional training and extensive knowledge.
You will also need sufficient hardware and software to create your own trading desk.
You should be realistic about the profits you want to make, and don’t take it lightly.

, Before you commit your own or somebody else’s money to the market, spend some time carrying out theoretical paper trades. This gives you an opportunity to experiment and learn about markets before using actual capital. There are some good electronic tools out there to help with paper trading, where instead of actually making a trade, the beginner just postulates a trade and tracks the result.Understanding the markets is essential to any trader. You need to have an in-depth knowledge of the functioning of the market, including all the terminology.
You need to learn about the different securities, stocks, bonds and assets that you are interested in trading in.

, You cannot become a proprietary trader in the US until you have passed the Series 57 Exam. This is a replacement for the Series 56 Exam that comes into place in January 2016.

You may have completed some day trading courses, or even have a degree in a relevant subject, but if you have not passed the exam you are not a licensed trader.You can register online for the exam.
The exam consists of 100 multiple-choice questions, and takes approximately two and a half hours to complete., If you are making a go of trading, you will need significant capital to get you going. No traders constantly turn a profit, so there will be inevitable losses that you need to be able to cope with. The amount of capital you need will depend entirely on the type of trading you want to do, and how much trading you want to do.


One guide estimates that someone wanting to work full time as a day trader will need around $100,000 to get started.Remember that every trade is a risk, and once you start trading you need to be managing those risks., Before you commit any money it’s vital that you spend time coming up with at least two different trading strategies that you can then apply. You should never rush into a market, but have a well-worked out plan that you can implement. This should include information on how you will enter and exit the market, what kind of capital you will invest, the frequency of trades and the value of the trades.


Markets can be highly volatile. A clear plan is vital, but so is the ability to read situations and adapt to circumstances quickly.
If a strategy stops working, you need to be ready to adapt it or drop it. Having multiple strategies that you can use support each other is helpful., In order to start trading, you'll need access to the stock market. Unless you already work for a bank or other institution as an employed trader, you'll need to start by making an agreement with a broker or brokerage firm. If you plan to make fewer trades opt for a per trade plan with a broker, but if you will make a lot of trades discuss a staggered plan.You will need some designated personal space to pursue market trading. If this space is in your home, you may be able to use it as a tax-deductible expense.
You will need the relevant software and a high-tech computer to monitor and track the markets and make quick trades.

You can obtain these through your current insurer as a separate form of financial protection. As a contractor, many states require you to be bonded before you can begin working legally.The prices of surety bonds range from between $10,000 and $15,000. You'll only be responsible for paying a small percentage (typically around 2%) of the total amount that the bond is worth.The type of bond you'll most likely need is referred to as a ""performance bond,"" which guarantees that the requirements of the contract will be fulfilled., Once you’ve passed your licensing exam, registered your business through the proper channels and shown proof of liability insurance, you can submit an official application to receive your contractor’s license. This can be done online or by mail. Following a short review process, you’ll be issued your license, after which you can get to work securing jobs and building your business’s reputation.You’ll be asked to provide a few points of basic personal info, as well as relevant work experience and documentation of apprenticeships and certifications.
As of June, 2017, the total fees for a contractor’s license in the US stand at $300.

, The final step to becoming operational is to actually form a business entity. Usually, this is as simple as filling out a few forms with the Business Services Division of your local government. Private contractors will need to file for sole proprietorship, which means you'll be recognized as having full ownership of the company.Contact the office governing business operations in your state to request the necessary paperwork. These agencies also frequently make convenient business registration guides available online.
Review the tax criteria in your region carefully to find out more about how to handle your private contracting company's business taxes."

A lack of post-secondary education can be a deal breaker for many prospective employers, however.Enrolling in business classes, even if they’re at the learning annex or a community college, shows a determination to learn that will definitely appeal, and should be highlighted on your resume. Everybody has to start somewhere!


College. A degree in business makes sense for any businessman, though you should research the industries you’re interested in before declaring your major. Some positions may prefer more specialized degrees, so do your homework.Trade schools. If the business you’re interested in specializes in a particular trade, you might be best off immersing yourself in the trade.
Lectures and seminars. Listening to the advice of those who are successful in their field can be enlightening. Check the schedule at local colleges for speaking tours, or search online for industry-related speaking engagements in your city. Staying up-to-date on what the top minds in the industry are saying is essential, even if you already think you’re at the top of your game.;
, Success in the business world means going the extra mile. There are multiple resources available to you online to further immerse yourself in further learning, if you find you’re finishing your schoolwork (or the work at your side job) with time to spare. Never rest on your laurels: think about what should come next.


Many employers nowadays are prioritizing the skills a candidate brings to the table over their GPA or higher education.Research example resumes for positions you’d like to hold, and put effort into developing those skills in your free time.
The extra mile shouldn’t come at the expense of every other aspect of your life, though. Finding time to reward yourself for hard work will instill better habits in you for the future.

, Developing a relationship with a professional whose career you admire is one of the more direct and efficient forms of networking. Establishing the connection might prove difficult, but reach out through whatever means are available to you. Prepare a few pertinent questions for your meeting, e.g. “How did you get your start?”; “Did you go to business school?”; and “Was this your first endeavor in the industry?”


If a coworker or friend of your parents works in a profession you’re interested in, ask your parents for their email address, or to arrange a meeting.
With a local business owner, you might just try walking up to them in their place of business and asking! Introduce yourself as an aspiring businessman and admirer of their accomplishments, and ask if they have any time available to speak with you on the subject.
At school, you might find a mentor in a professor. Never neglect the wealth of knowledge which exists in a university, and don’t make the mistake of thinking you’re only allowed to learn during class. Approach your professor for advice during their office hours.
Some companies employ on-the-job mentoring programs which pair recruits up with experienced workers.Take advantage of these, and look to them not as a burden but as an opportunity to learn and excel.

, When you don’t yet have the experience, use internships to get your foot in the door. Don’t balk at unpaid positions if they can build the bridges you need to succeed in the long-term, and the hours won’t leave you penniless in the short-term. Internships provide many college students their first opportunities to network on the job with working professionals.Low-paying entry level jobs are simply the price to be paid in the business world right now, when true “entry level” jobs won’t give you a chance without a few years of experience already under your belt.


Do balk at unpaid positions which don’t present themselves as pathways to success, either within the company or by opening further doors to you.

, Complete the tasks which will benefit you the most in the long run first. You’ll need to identify the difference between “high-value” tasks (those which will benefit you the most in the long term) versus “low-value” tasks (tasks which may be easier, but will offer fewer benefits)., Avoiding the less pleasant aspects of work doesn’t make them disappear. Building up a huge hunk of the bad stuff to deal with all at once, after you’ve completed the enjoyable stuff, is just going to leave a sour taste in your mouth at the end of a project.Make lists. Enough can’t be said about the anti-procrastination benefits of seeing your work in front of you, and crossing it off as you finish it.Each list should be long enough to keep your workload in perspective, but not so long that your day feels paralyzingly demanding.
One tactic is to divvy your seemingly unmanageable task into manageable chunks, then sprinkle those less-enjoyable aspects of a task into that other stuff that you really like.
Stick to a schedule: physically writing out to-dos and calendars isn’t necessary for everyone, but establishing a regular schedule can help you efficiently take care of business. Scheduling the work you dislike for a specific day—and then pushing it out of your mind to avoid stress on other days—might help you conquer unhelpful procrastination habits.

, Finishing one project will teach you exponentially more than a dozen fizzled-out attempts, even if you never want to look at that project again.


Sometimes you’ll find yourself bogged down in work that seems, now that you’ve toiled away at it for a week, misguided in its goal. If the project has a projected timeline that will take up a great deal of your time moving forward, it’s sometimes best to reassess whether you’re spending your time well (see above, about “high-value” tasks versus “low-value” tasks). So how do you know when you should drop a project? Honest introspection, and self-awareness. If you find yourself thinking this often—and you’ve got a string of unfinished projects in your wake—it might be a sign you need to buckle down and see this to the end.

, Whether they’ve done well or screwed up, a successful businessman must be able to take responsibility for their actions. It signals to both employees and employers a willingness to deal openly and responsibly with the tasks at hand. Squirming away from negative fallout your missteps have made endears you to no one, and can have disastrous consequences on the relationships you’ve made in the business world.

, Passion doesn’t translate to “fun 24/7,” but it should be meaningful to you in some capacity. The effort you exert should always be on something that will make you proud in the end, or will at least put you one step closer to what it is that you really want to do.

, Healthy work life balance is essential to long-term success and a worker’s well-being. But as might be expected, when you’re starting out, more ambition means longer hours. Passion for your work will help to keep those hours you spend burning the midnight oil meaningful.


Diving too hard into work without giving yourself a break will increase your stress levels and decrease your effectiveness.Set boundaries on your workday, and take frequent breaks to recharge your batteries.
Don’t confuse your work for who you are. Finding time and space away from our work—even if it is our life’s passion—can often provide insight on that work.

, The more meaningful your work is to you, the tougher this can be, but great, as they say, is the enemy of good. Focusing too intently on creating the perfect, most ideal iteration of that pitch, graphic, or copy can leave you with one excellent piece of work, instead of the ten pieces you needed.


Find a balance in your work that satisfies you, your boss, and your client without causing the rest of your life to suffer. Employers prize those employees who can deliver solid work dependably over those who occasionally produce great stuff… but repeatedly miss their deadlines., When you’re beginning a new enterprise, it might feel presumptuous to speak of your career like it’s the real deal. Doing so, however, will help others see you seriously, and will help you see yourself seriously as well.If you’re starting a business, don’t equivocate. Talk about your new business as you would any other. Refer to it as “work,” and even when you work from home a certain room can be “the office.” It’s alright to have a sense of humor about it, but don’t undermine your efforts.

, Behaving respectfully, courteously, and humanely to everyone you meet is a good starting point! You never know when you might form a true bond on an unexpected occasion, and find your next business partner, investor, or employer.


Definitively end relationships only when it’s absolutely necessary. When you leave a job, resist the temptation to gloat, slack off, or tell your boss “how you really feel.” When you tug on a thread in your network, you never know who’ll be feeling its reverberations down the line.

, Networking can feel mercenary and shallow when advertised too overtly. Understand that networking is essential to success in most industries, but that you should never forget that you’re forging connections with people. Taking a holistic, human approach to your interactions can make you more memorable down the line when it comes time for hiring; employers might have thoughts not just of “Who do I know that would be good for this copywriting job?” but “What job do I know that would be a good fit for Richard?”


Everybody else in your industry understands how crucial networking is, so don’t think you’re the only schmuck out there advertising your skill. Self-promotion is, to some degree, the name of the game., Not only will you need these skills to navigate the day-to-day with your employers and employees, you’ll also benefit from them when you negotiate deals and contracts. Studies have shown that the most successful business people excel in both cognitive and social skills.Make it a point to appreciate the work and input of others.
Practice active listening. This means acknowledging what other people say by repeating it back to them in your own words, as you understand it to be.
Pay attention to others. Be proactive about noticing others' feelings, words and body language.
Connect people. A successful business owner is a hub through which other interpersonal connections are made. Promote an environment that brings people together by treating people equally and fairly, and encouraging them to work together.
Take a leadership role when it comes to resolving conflicts. Act as the mediator, rather than involving yourself personally.

, Co-workers and potential employers aren’t the only people you should be forging strong relationships with in the business world. Make an effort to develop appropriate relationships with the people who come into your store, use your product, or appreciate your work. Emotions—not prices—are often more of a deciding factor in many purchasing decisions., Your employees are your support network, and are necessary to your success. Hire those who are skilled and competent, but also consider how well your employees will mesh together as a team.


Homogeneity should never be prioritized in an effort to have your employees mesh well. Diverse viewpoints offer myriad advantages to your business as a whole, in both innovation and experience.Be careful if you’re in a situation to hire family members and personal friends as employees. While connections are the #1 way in which many jobs are found, nepotism can reflect poorly on you. Ensure your hires are qualified for the position,

, As a business owner, the most important goal when beginning a new business, job, or craft is simply to survive.If you’re starting your own business or getting in on the ground floor, avoid establishing unrealistic goals for the fledgling enterprise.


The heart of all businesses, even those with altruistic, selfless ownership, is making money. The goal might be modest (just enough to allow your business to survive and grow) or enormous (to attract additional investors and satisfy shareholders), but this is true to some degree for every business.
You will never achieve that goal of, say, providing mittens to all of the underprivileged kids in the world through your new mitten shop, if you don’t focus on keeping that coffee shop in business and thriving first. Long-term goals are important, but shouldn’t come at the expense of sustainable short-term ones.

, Ever heard the saying “You’ve gotta spend money to make money?” Frugality is advised wherever possible, but only so much that it frees up capital for the more important, more deserving expenses. Those expenses might be the salaries of particularly accomplished professionals you’re hoping to woo, or trade magazines, or simply a nice suit so as to look the part in the company of your colleagues and clients. Aim to invest in future success, not just celebrate current success.Avoid exorbitantly expensive ties and jackets, company cars, and huge offices you really don’t need—but don’t take it for granted that nice things are automatically exorbitant. Image is an important component of success in business, but not just when it comes to the superficial. Having an enormous office you can’t fill or work you can’t pay for punctually (on account of that enormous office or company car lease) will feed into other companies’ perception of you as well.

, New businesses need to survive if they’re going to ever be anything, but all businesses must take on risk of some kind.Stepping outside the norm, either in your role at a company or in the expectations for the industry, is necessary for success in a crowded field. Plan your ventures carefully and hedge as much risk as you can, but be prepared for the occasional setback.

, Successful innovators are held in high esteem in the American consciousness, but actually pursuing unproven ideas can be terrifying. Don’t be afraid of venturing into the unknown—great ideas may be a dime a dozen, but putting in the work to pursue a great idea shows spirit and tenacity.


An idea’s failure isn’t always indicative of having the wrong idea—sometimes it’s simply the right idea, pursued ineffectively. Don’t scrap everything you’ve been trying all at once and or totally restructure. When working within a company or partnership, for example, the issue could be solved by better understanding each member’s accountability., Failure illuminates some truth about your methods and goals, however much it may sting. Interpret your failures not as shameful, but as a reason to reflect on your work. Sometimes it’s only through facing the insurmountable, failing, and then struggling to pull ourselves back together that we develop the tenacity our work requires of us.”Failure,” as Henry Ford put it, “is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.”"

Apply for union membership.",How to Become a Longshoreman," The TWIC (Transportation Worker Identification Credential) is a certification administered in the United States by the Transportation Security Administration. In order to work on a dock, you first have to obtain this certification. To get a TWIC card, schedule an appointment with the TSA and bring all of your identifying documents to the appointment. You will have to fill out a questionnaire and pay a fee, after which you will be approved and receive your card.;
, Along the west coast of the U.S., this is likely to be the ILWU (International Longshore and Warehouse Union), while the prominent union along the east coast is the ILA (International Longshoreman's Association).

, Dock work is peculiar in that no longshoreman is required (or even able) to work a fixed schedule. Each day, the amount of labor hours needed based on the dock traffic expected is transmitted to the union's hiring hall. Longshoreman seeking work that day arrive at the hiring hall, and the available work is assigned by seniority.


Your career as a longshoreman begins as a ""casual worker."" Casual workers are those who are not members of the union, and therefore get picked last when work is being assigned. This leads to a very unreliable and erratic work schedule, where weeks can pass between available shifts.

, If there is a shortage of work available, the hiring hall can advise you not to attempt to work that day, as all available shifts will be taken by union members.

, If there is a prospect of casual labor being assigned on a given day, arrive at the hiring hall at the designated time. You will generally have to wait in a line as work is being assigned, with no guarantee that there will be a shift available for you.

, If you remain persistent in seeking casual dock work, you will eventually be recognized by the union as an identified casual and given an ID card. This does not make you a union member, so you will still be behind union members in seniority. However, you are now given preference over non-ID casuals when work is assigned.

, Once you are an identified casual, you can apply for membership in the union. The union will distribute applications when they are seeking to expand their membership, and the process is generally very competitive. You may have to apply several times before being accepted. Once accepted into the union, your schedule will become more reliable, as you are now given preference over casual workers. Union members are full-fledged longshoremen and receive benefits from the union.

Look for a job as a meat manager.",How to Become a Journeyman Meat Cutter," Because you'll be working with meat all day, which can serve as vectors for bacteria and other germs, it's really important that you're clean and have excellent hygiene habits. This includes:


Being aware of where you put your hands
Washing hands frequently
Minimizing cross-contamination when possible
Knowing the laws of the FDA and/or the USDA. Depending on where you work, the meat you cut will either be inspected by the FDA or the USDA. Knowing the rules of either body will give you a head start when it comes to hygiene.;
, (22.7 kg). Meat cutting requires that you lift heavy carcasses regularly. You will need to be able to lift heavy slabs of meat onto hooks and tables. It might be a good idea to begin working out if you don't already.

, Most training programs and employers require that you complete this level of education before enrolling or applying.

, In order to ensure that you have the desire and stomach to be a meat cutter, you may want to experiment with hunting or basic butchering tasks. Although this is not required, you cannot be squeamish about meat and animal by-products.

, The work world usually has a pecking order, and the meat cutting industry is no different. Expect to start off as low as low goes and work your way up. Starting low will help you get your foot in the door. Here are some possible options for where you could start off:


Meat clerk. Meat clerks usually wrap and work lunch meat, as well as clean the meat shop at night.
Seafood helper. Similar to a meat clerk, except you'd be working with seafood instead.

, You can also contact your state's industrial relations or labor departments for information about apprenticeships. Look for employment/training programs that pay for your training and supply you with an apprenticeship job.

, In order to develop the knowledge about animals, cuts of meat and knife skills, you will need to be enrolled in a long-term, on the job training program.


An apprenticeship is good for both the meat cutter who's training you and for you. He gets someone on the cheap who is eager to learn and branch out on his own. You get someone to teach you the ins and outs of the meat cutting industry — real on-the-job training.

, Before you can be hired as a journeyman meat cutter, you must first have the experience of working in the industry for a few years. Here are some of the things you'll learn in your apprenticeship:


First and foremost, cutting meat. What cuts of meat are there, and how do you master them? How does the architecture of different animals affect the cut?
Merchandising, presentation, inventory. What cuts perform the best regionally, as well as seasonally? How are the choicest cuts presented to stimulate sales? How are the cheapest? How much meat do you keep in inventory depending on the demand and business model? How do you keep enough in tow so that you never run out but that it also doesn't get lost to spoilage?
Making money cutting meat. At the dawn of automation, how do you make money as a meat cutter? Do you try to sell a lot of product with thin margins, or do you try to sell less product with higher margins?

, After 2 years of experience, you will be qualified to move your career forward and receive a raiser or better position. You may need to go to another job to find an empty journeyman meat cutter position.

, This is a good mantra for every worker who's dedicated to their craft, but it applies to meat cutters especially. In many cities, Sundays and holidays are extremely busy, necessitating more workers to accommodate demand. Here are some of the perks of working on days that others prefer not to:


You'll get paid more. Depending on your employer, you may get 2x pay on Sundays and 3x pay on holidays. You could earn a hefty amount for working the same amount as you usually do.
You'll develop a reputation as a hard worker. Doing the work that no one else wants to do will help you earn the reputation of the go-to-guy when work needs to get done. This is a great reputation to have.
You'll have more time to butter up management. Moving up the ranks as a meat cutter often means getting in the good graces of your supervisors. The harder and more often you work, the more likely your supervisors will groom you for a better position.

, Because most meat cutters have to interact with people in order to to their job successfully, developing a personal touch will go a long way in your career. Think about what the customer wants in their transaction, and constantly evaluate how you can improve their satisfaction:


Are there any questions about the cut of meat that you can help answer?
Are there any suggestions you can make about what meat is good today?

, After a few more years of experience as a meat cutter, you may want to increase your salary and responsibilities by managing other employees or looking after a company's meat department. You will need to study USDA meat standards, safety procedures, inspection procedures and hazard analysis.

, Many journeyman meat cutters advance their careers by taking on more administrative duties. You may be asked to manage the production side of the meat department.


If you are seeking employment as an upper level meat manager or food manager, consider applying for a food science bachelor's degree program. This is a highly specialized field, so you may need to research who offers these courses in your state extensively.

They inspect and repair wiring, transformers and circuit breakers.As a journeyman electrician, you could work as an outside lineman or an inside wireman.Once you have worked as a journeyman for a period, you can eventually become a master electrician.As an outside wireman or journeyman lineman, you work on all of the electrical lines that connect power generation to the power meter. In this role, you spend more time outside, such as fixing the wiring on poles and towers.
As an inside wireman or inside journeyman, you maintain the electrical systems inside a building.
The term ""journeyman"" is often a level of license that is followed by the next level ""master electrician.”
There are many areas in this profession, such as industrial wiring, factory wiring, as well as wiring data, alarm and telecom systems. The field is full of opportunities.;
, Since the average salaries for journeyman electrician varies a lot depending on geography, firm and experience, you should search career sites to find relevant salaries in your region. For instance, you could search Glassdoor or similar websites to find the average salaries for journeyman electricians in your area.In the United States, the overall income range is between $37K and 81K. The firm you work for has a huge impact on your overall salary, as well as geography and your level of work experience. If you are at the top end of earners in this profession, you may benefit from bonuses and profit sharing.Starting pay for a first year apprentice is usually not too much more than minimum wage.

, Most journeymen electrician are still men.But there are more women getting involved in the electrical trade so, if you identify as female, you should go for it! Trade unions and women in trades organizations are trying to get more women involved in the electrical trade, so take advantage of resources directed to women in trades. You may also be interested to hear that most women report positive experiences working as journeymen electricians.If you are a woman in the electrical trade, you may want to be mindful of favoritism.
Female electricians report that it is important to know when to accept or turn down help from male colleagues. You can lose respect if you accept too much help.

, You will need a high school diploma to become a journeyman electrician. If you are career transitioning as an adult and do not currently have a high school diploma, you should get your GED or high school equivalency. However, if you have not finished school and are considering this career, you should finish high school as a first step.You can study for the GED at a local community college, which might have online courses for this purpose.To get your GED, you will need to take the exam or test that is administered by your local state.

, As a helper, you can prepare tools and materials for the electricians, dig ditches and do other manual labor. If you do well in this position, you can land a paid apprenticeship or enroll in a program at a vocational college.You do not need any special qualifications to be an electrician’s helper.
It is expected that helpers have a basic working knowledge of electrical safety, hand tools and electrical construction methods.
As a helper, will you to learn to identify the large assortment of tools and materials in the electrical trade.
Wage increases come with progression to 2nd, 3rd and 4th year helpers.

, Vocational training at the college or trade school level is not absolutely necessary for becoming a journeyman electrician. However, because this training will give you a heads up and open up opportunities for an apprenticeship, you should look at enrolling in an electrician program in your area.You can learn about electrical codes, electrical theory and workplace safety, amongst other topics, at an electrician program.
One of the advantages of completing an electrician program is that you will be better prepared for the tests and interview process involved in becoming an apprentice.
The technical school training can be obtained after high school, or as part of the high school curriculum in a vocational/technical high school.
The IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) offers paid training for a limited number of interested candidates. IBEW training is typically 4 years in duration, but may also vary by local area.Most branches of the U.S. armed forces provide paid training and generous benefits to those that choose this career path at the time of enlistment.

, After completing your electrician program, you should find an apprenticeship through a job board or an electricians organization. At this stage, you should also think about whether you want to train for a particular specialty, such as outside lineman, inside lineman, VDV installer technician or residential lineman. You can find an apprenticeship through one of the following organizations:The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW).
The National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA).
Independent Electrical Contractors (IEC).

, You may need to pass an aptitude test prior to starting the apprenticeship, which will involve some arithmetic, algebra and comprehension skills. However, the aptitude test is only required for some apprenticeships. You may also need to pass a drug test and show you have some level of hands-on, mechanical aptitude. After the aptitude test and passing any other specific requirements, you will complete an interview to determine your suitability for the position.For the IBEW inside wireman and limited energy technician apprenticeship programs, you have to do an aptitude test focused on basic math and reading. The math portion consists of 33 questions that you have to answer in 46 minutes. The reading part consists of 36 questions that you have to answer in 51 minutes.If your apprenticeship program requires an aptitude test, you should prepare by brushing up on your basic math skills. Most people who fail say they wished they had spent more time studying for the math part of the exam.If you fail the aptitude test for an IBEW apprenticeship, you will have to wait at least six months before doing it again.If you are female or a minority, your local trade union should be eager to find you an apprenticeship, since they are trying to build a more diverse workforce.Although there are increased training opportunities for female electricians, it can still take up to a year to get accepted into an apprenticeship.

, Some places require you to register as an electrician trainee or apprentice, so you should check with your local department of labor before beginning your apprenticeship. If you do need to register, you will just be asked to fill out a few forms., Your apprenticeship will last around four years and will include a mix of on-the-job and classroom training. During this period, you will get to learn all about construction blueprints, the national electric code, wiring, lighting fixtures, testing and inspection of electrical systems. You will also earn an hourly wage, which is typically around half of what you will end up earning as a certified journeyman electrician., Since the requirements for becoming a licensed electrician differ substantially depending on where you work, you will need to contact your local licensing board to find out specific requirements. Typically, getting licensed will require having worked a certain number of hours in the field, studied the profession in a classroom setting for a certain number of hours and completion of a licensing exam.Some regions do not require an exam.
The specific number of work and study hours varies substantially by region.
In California, you need to have registered as a trainee, completed 720 hours of classroom time, 8,000 hours of on-the-job experience and passed a state certification exam.
If you live in the province of Ontario, you’ll need to do the Certificate of Qualification exam.Licensing assures employers and the public of a minimum level of competency.

, Most licensing authorities and electrical wiring inspectors use the National Electrical Code (NEC) for electrical code enforcement. Determine if the version used for enforcement is the NEC, or other state, county or city code. Familiarize yourself with the codes for the area where you plan to work.

, If your jurisdiction requires an exam in order to become a licensed electrician, you should figure out the format of the exam. In some regions, tests involve a mix of multiple choice, essay, computation, practical (hands on) and verbal examination. Many licensing authorities make use of a two-part examination, including a written test and a practical examination. The practical is designed to identify individuals that have never really performed the work in the field but have a very good understanding of the code.


Some jurisdictions, such as New Jersey, do not require an exam as part of the licensing process.Use of the electrical code book may or may not be permitted during the exam.
Obtaining aides for the particular type exam offered can be a wise investment.

, Once you have completed your four years of apprenticeship training, you can go ahead and take your licensing exam. The exams are administered by state licensing boards, so you’ll need to contact them to find out about the exam. The licensing board may also have a requirement for a certain number of hours working in the field. Once you have passed the local licensing requirements, such as number of hours and exam, you can go ahead and work as a certified electrician.In some states, like New York, cities administer the licensing exams. If you live in one of these states, you’ll need to contact the city licensing board to find out about exams.
While there are locations that have no licensing, many others require multiple licenses such as state, county or city license(s).
Many licensing authorities require that a minimum amount of documented time has been spent working in the trade to be eligible for license examination. It is not uncommon for 6,000 to 8,000-hour minimum time requirements.
Examples of documentation include tax information (W-4) or pay stubs, school transcripts (if claiming time spent attending a technical school), etc.

, You can search for a position as a certified electrician with a construction company or contractor. If you completed your training through a college or trade school, you could see if they have a career center that can help you.

"
Assess your talents and interests.,
Earn a high school diploma or GED.,
Focus on math.,
Get in shape.",How to Become a Master Carpenter1," Keep in mind that carpentry can be a rewarding as well as demanding occupation. Before you take the time pursuing a career in it, consider your strengths and preferences regarding how you hope to spend a typical working day. Ideally, you should enjoy:


New challenges
Problem-solving
Physical labor
Working in various conditions (indoor, outdoor, and inclement weather);
, There a few different ways to start your training as a carpenter, and you don’t necessarily need to have graduated from high school to start them all. However, regardless of how you choose to start, anticipate having to enter an apprenticeship program at some point. Before you do this, be sure to earn a high school diploma, a GED (General Education Diploma), or an equivalent degree in order to qualify., Expect carpentry to involve lots of mathematics. If you’re still in high school or earning your GED, double down on your math classes. If you’ve already graduated and feel like math wasn’t your strong suit, brush up on it through resources like:Adult education or tutorship
Apps designed to test and strengthen your math skills
Mentally doing the math for everyday situations (like totaling your grocery bill)., Be aware that carpentry can often be a physically demanding job. Anticipate having to stand on your feet for long hours, lift heavy objects and equipment, and engage in repetitive actions like bending and climbing. Also keep in mind that you will need to be very precise in your handiwork, regardless of how tired you feel. If you tire easily, start exercising with a focus on:Strength
Stamina
Dexterity
Hand-eye coordination
Agility

"
Decide if this career is a fit for your personality.,
Learn what the position entails.,
Expect to work on- and off-site.,
Review the job outlook.",How to Become a Quantity Surveyor1," If you are logically-minded, think methodically, and are good with numbers and finances, quantity surveying may be right for you. In addition to practical thinking, you should also be good at creative problem solving and approaching issues in inventive ways. Quantity surveyors transform complicated data into simply worded reports. They are natural leaders and negotiators who also work well on a team.You should be willing to learn a lot about construction, including information about materials, past and present building technology, and business/legal topics.;
, As a quantity surveyor, you will come up with a rough estimate of the project’s cost before construction begins. Your estimation will come from project measurements, based upon the sketches of a client or designer.You will then see the project through to completion by monitoring the budget, managing invoices and contracts, giving financial advice, and negotiating resolutions. Expect to be involved in court hearings and arbitration as well.Quantity surveyors assist the designer(s) with staying in the budget limit throughout the project, by implementing pragmatic solutions. If there are delays or deviations from the original plans, you will evaluate the cost effects of those changes, and work on modifications with the contractors.
At the end of each project, you will create a final account statement that delineates the actual cost within each section of the project.

, Quantity surveying is office-based. However, it also involves site visits which can last an entire day. The amount of time you will work is similar to office hours, but with a little extra.For example, your hours as an on-site contractor might be 7:30 am to 6:00 pm Monday through Friday. If you work for the local government, you may have a shorter time span, such as from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm during the week. Expect to work occasionally on the weekends.
You will likely travel and possibly stay overnight as needed. Depending on your employer, the client, and the site location, you may have opportunities to work overseas as well.

, The median annual salary for cost estimators in the U.S. is $60,390, or $29.03 per hour. This position is projected to grow nine percent through 2024, which is faster than average. Your overall job prospects should be good, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.This position is growing two percent faster than the average growth rate of seven percent for all occupations.

Start as a helper.,
Earn a PACT certificate.,
Find an apprenticeship program.",How to Become a Master Carpenter2," This step isn’t a must, so if you’re eager and qualified to begin more direct training in the field, feel free to skip it. However, if you’re unable to begin an apprenticeship right away and a local carpenter or construction crew is hiring helpers, take advantage of it. Use this opportunity to learn what you can by observing journey workers in action while completing other tasks on-site. This is an ideal learning experience if you are:Under the age of 18
Still earning your high school diploma or equivalent
Still waiting to become a U.S. citizen or legal resident

, As with the helper position, obtaining a PACT (Pre-Apprenticeship Certificate Training) certificate isn’t strictly necessary in order to become an apprentice. However, if you have little to no experience with any form of construction, consider the benefits of earning one. These include:Introductions to carpentry as well as painting, plumbing, masonry, landscaping, and other building trades.Lessons on tools, construction materials, math, safety, and first aid.
Certification that qualifies you for entry-level employment in the construction trade.

, Whether or not you decide to start as a helper or earn a PACT certificate, consider an apprenticeship as an absolute must in becoming a journey worker. Commit to a two- to four-year program, during which you will receive both technical training in class settings and on-the-job training from a journey worker. Programs are available through various sources, so to find one in your area, contact local:Construction unions
Contract associations
Contractors
Technical schools
Colleges"
"
Complete your technical training.,
Finish your on-the-job training.,
Fulfill additional coursework.,
Complete your final exams.,
Gain experience.,
Build your reputation.",How to Become a Master Carpenter3," The exact curriculum for your technical training may vary depending on the exact apprenticeship program that you joined. However, expect to attend roughly 144 hours of instruction each year that your program lasts. Subjects covered in this class setting may range from:Basic carpentry and math skills
Blueprint reading
Structural framingBuilding code requirements
Safety and first aid

, Again, the exact number you need to fulfill may vary according to your program, but expect on-the-job training to take up the bulk of your time. Anticipate having to complete approximately 2000 hours of paid training per year while working on site with one or more journey workers. Obviously, the aim of this is to bring you up to their skill-level by the end of your program, but in the beginning, expect instructions in simpler tasks like:


How to use both power and hand tools safely and proficiently.
Basic carpentry like measuring and cutting studs.

, First, complete the OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) safety courses when specified by your program, which is a must for all programs in the U.S.Additionally, if you became an apprentice through a college, keep in mind that earning an associate’s degree may be part the program. Anticipate having to take general education courses in conjunction with your training.General education courses may include subjects like English, math, and science.
60 or more credits of general education may be required on top of your technical and on-the-job training.
Many colleges offer online courses for their general education requirements to make life easier for apprentices.

, Expect most if not all programs to finish with one or more exams that you must pass in order to become certified as a journey worker. The exact nature of these vary from program to program, but whatever form they take, bone up and study. Prove your skills and knowledge so you can achieve your hard-earned credentials.A journey worker credential will enable you to work on your own, without supervision. This qualifies you to pursue work as an employee for an established contractor or start your own business.

, Technically, there’s nothing keeping you from calling yourself a ""master carpenter"" once you become certified as a journey worker. However, hold off on advertising yourself as such. For now, stay humble and simply bill yourself as a journey worker. Then aim to do the best job possible.Gain even more experience by pursuing additional training. Keep up on new carpentry methods and materials. Round out your skillset in other related areas in construction (including construction management)., Keep in mind that online reviews and social media make it quite easy for potential customers to check out your previous handiwork. Expect people to be far more negative in their comments if you billed yourself as ""master"" and then botched a simple job. Wait until you've earned a solid reputation with clients and employers so they will back your skills up and confirm that you're a ""master"" at your trade.A good rule of thumb to follow is to gain roughly 10 to 15 years of experience before billing yourself as a “master.”

Building Science undergraduate degrees include courses like alternative energy, building methods, sustainable building practices, and building performance, structures and science.
Construction Science degrees teach building technology, cost estimating, and construction safety, management and procedures.

, Look for internship opportunities if you weren’t able to secure one through your college or university. Check online job boards for combinations of keywords like “quantity surveyor,” “cost engineer,” “project controls manager,” “intern,” “internship,” and “summer placement.” You can also research companies you would like to work for and send them cover letters.Mention any relevant work experience you have, including any student jobs. Explain what was involved in each role. If you don’t have any work experience yet, focus on your education, strengths, and goals.

, You may benefit from getting licensed as a Professional Engineer (PE) or a Registered Architect (RA). Many employers will require you to have a valid driver’s license to apply as a quantity surveyor, since you will need to drive to job sites. If you want to work overseas, you may need a quantity survey license.Professional certification is voluntary. If you’re interested in getting licensed, you can do so through the Association for the Advancement of Cost Estimating International, the American Society of Professional Estimators, and/or the International Cost Estimating and Analysis Association."

Comply with any additional requirements for advanced or professional licensing.",How to Become a Certified Land Surveyor," If you know as early as your high school years that surveying is the profession you wish to enter, you should work hard to earn good grades. You will likely need a college degree, so doing well in school will help you gain access to the college or university of your choice. You should begin to focus on math and science courses, as these will be most directly related to your future work. A strong background in reading, writing and analysis will also be helpful., To get a job as a surveyor, you will need a college degree. In some cases, you may be able to get what you need with a two-year associate’s degree, although a four-year bachelor’s degree would be preferred when looking for work. A good program is one that will include in-depth study in advanced math, technical drafting, writing, physics, and technically advanced computer program use.The guidance counselor at your high school should be able to help you research colleges and universities that have strong programs that can lead to a career as a surveyor. If you are already out of high school, you may try calling the guidance office of the high school in your area to see if they could help you anyway. You might also check with the reference librarian at your public library or at an area college library.
For licensing purposes, some states require that your degree come from a school or program that is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Before you apply to any school, you should ask an admissions officer if they have this accreditation.

, The general category of surveying involves many smaller categories, which you may wish to choose as a specialty for your studies in college. You will want to research these topics before enrolling in a college or university program, so you can best tailor your studies. Some of the topics related to surveying include:Geomatics. This is a fairly new science that includes the collection, interpretation and reporting of geographical data.
Geodesy is the science of geographical measurement and representation. It measures such things as the gravitational fields of the earth, tectonic plate movements, polar ice shifts, and tidal phenomena.
Photogrammetry is the science of acquiring geographical data from photographs and photo images. This field includes studies in aerial photogrammetry and close-range photogrammetry.
Land management is the study of the way land is used, to best take advantage of its geological structures.

, Many university programs will help you get involved in an internship as part of your program while you are attending classes. An internship is a placement with an actual surveyor, so you can learn real, on-the-job techniques and business practices, in addition to your classroom education. If you do well in your internship, it can also lead to full-time employment beyond your college degree.Many states may require that you spend time in an internship under a licensed surveyor before you are even eligible to sit for the licensing exam.

, Throughout most of the United States, the Fundamentals of Surveying (FS) exam is required to become licensed as a surveyor. This exam is usually offered in April and October. The exam is scheduled to last approximately 6 hours and consists of questions covering general topics like algebra, trigonometry, other basic sciences and writing skills. It also includes questions on such specific topics as boundary law, field data acquisition and plane survey calculation. Most of this information should be covered during your course of study in your college or university., In most cases, your college study should prepare you for the FS exam. Many people elect to take the exam while nearing the end of their college program, or soon after graduating.If you wish to engage in additional preparation, specifically designed for the exam, there are numerous books, study guides and even courses available to help you prepare. A quick Internet search for “fundamentals of surveying exam” will lead you to all the information you need.


In addition to commercial study guides, you can find various free resources online. For example, the publication The American Surveyor has posted an article that contains a summary of the test and sample questions. The article is available at http://www.amerisurv.com/PDF/TheAmericanSurveyor-TestYourselfWithoutAnswers-CharterIssue.pdf.

, The NCEES, the professional organization that administers the FS Exam, posts an FS Reference Handbook on its website. To access the Handbook, you must first register an account with NCEES, which you can do online at http://ncees.org/surveying/fs/. The FS Reference Handbook contains all the information you need about the content of the FS Exam and about registering and sitting for the exam.The FS Reference Handbook is the only resource that you are allowed to use as a reference during the exam itself.

, You can register for the FS Exam at the NCEES website at http://ncees.org/surveying/fs/. You will need to create an account, which will be private with a password. You will use this account to register and schedule your exam, as well as for communication between yourself and the NCEES.Registering for the exam includes the payment of a $225 exam fee. You will pay this with a credit card online.
Some licensing boards may require an additional application and application fee. You should check with the jurisdiction where you wish to be licensed to determine its requirements.

, When the date arrives for your exam, you should arrive at your testing location early. Take along multiple forms of identification and any registration materials that you have received. Realize that the test lasts for approximately 6 hours, which includes a brief tutorial on the use of the computer and a break for lunch. You will take your test on a computer under proctor supervision. Within seven to ten days after your exam, you will receive an email notification that your scores will be available in your NCEES account.If you are not familiar with the area, you may wish to take your lunch with you for the day, to avoid any anxiety on that issue.

, NCEES offers a useful page that provides links to the licensing boards of all 50 states in the U.S. Find your state and then follow the link to the licensing board’s website. From there, you should be able to follow the instructions for information about a license application.For example, the link for Alabama will redirect you to the website of the Alabama Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. From there, you can choose the link for “Applicants” to learn your application requirements.If you wish to get licensed in Texas, for example, the link will take you to the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying. From there, select the tab “LSLS” to get information about becoming a Licensed State Land Surveyor., When you find your state’s licensing board’s website, look for a link to “Application” or “Application Process.” You will need to print the application form, complete it, and provide whatever application fee is required. This fee is in addition to the exam fee that you were previously required to pay for the FS Exam. Read the website carefully to find out if any additional materials are required.


For example, if you are applying for licensure in Texas, you are required to provide all of the following materials or information:Completed application form.
Application fee of $128.69.
3 Completed References. These are to be provided using the state’s official form, which is available on the website. The references are to be in individually sealed envelopes with the seal of the referring party on the back of the envelope. At least one of your references should come from a licensed surveyor.
A working sketch. You are to prepare a working sketch of a location of your choosing. Instructions for the sketch are reported on the website.
An appointment with the Director of Surveying of the General Land Office. This appointment should be made before you create your working sketch.



, Some states will require a state-based exam, either in addition to or in place of the nationwide FS Exam. You should read your state’s license board’s website to find out if such an exam applies to you. If it does, you will need to submit your application materials in time to be able to take that exam.


Staying with the Texas example, you will need to submit your application by January 15 in order to take the LSLS exam in April, or by July 15 to take the LSLS exam in October., In many jurisdictions, the initial license that you will receive is a preliminary or temporary license. This will generally qualify you to work as a surveyor in conjunction with or under the supervision of a professionally licensed surveyor in your state. After some prescribed time, you will qualify to sit for an advanced exam, known nationally as the Professional Surveyor’s Exam (PS Exam). The procedure to register for the PS Exam, which is also administered by NCEES, is similar to the procedure for the FS Exam.You will also need to determine what your state requires for advanced licensing.

If you are their parent, take them to see the doctor.


Eating very little and avoiding fatty foods.
Severe weight loss and dangerously low weight.
Fear of gaining weight.
In females, loss of periods.
Thinning of hair.
In males, body dissatisfaction and obsession with building a muscular physique.
Body image distortion, where the body is seen as larger or smaller than it actually is.
Weighing oneself excessively, also known as checking.;
, Obviously, there's nothing wrong with being in good shape. Regular exercise and healthy eating can result in being fit. There are differences, however, between healthy, fit bodies and unhealthy bodies.


In males, unhealthy bodies may be 15% lower in body fat than is normal for his age, height, and activity level. He may lift weights compulsively and be obsessed with toning his muscles. He may also take anabolic steroids in order to gain muscle mass.In females, unhealthy bodies may have a consistently low weight, such as a 17.5 or less on the Body Mass Index, which she can calculate by clicking here. She may diet excessively and spend a lot of time on scales and in front of the mirror., A trigger is a person, place, or thing that causes them to turn toward anorexic behaviors to cope.They can gain control over how they react in these situations by learning to identify what triggers them, such as:


Interacting with someone who is judgmental of their body.
Specific foods that are difficult for them to eat or think about.

, Goals that are reasonable and realistic will help them make progress in their recovery. These are goals that can be achieved within a specific time-frame without causing problems in other areas of their life.If they have trouble eating a typical amount of food three times a day, ask them to try once a day. After they have mastered this smaller step, they can continue to the bigger goal. This will help them feel accomplished and work at a realistic pace, so that they don't overwhelm themselves.

, Although writing a journal is no replacement for a supportive community or professional help, it can be a powerful tool for them to share their feelings and reflect on what is happening in their life.


Have them try the Five-Minute Sprint approach by Kathleen Adams, founder of The Center for Journal Therapy. Give them these instructions: set a timer for five minutes, pick a topic that's been on your mind, and write. You don't need to put a lot of thought into this writing exercise; try to let your thoughts flow onto the page. Now read this draft back to yourself, and whenever something stands out to you, write: ""Reading, I notice or feel _________."" This will help them begin to process their emotions around these issues. It's a good idea to do this exercise with them to show solidarity.

, It can help them learn to listen to their body's needs and develop a healthier relationship with food. Show them you care by learning about this system together. Intuitive eating can help them:


Listen to when their body is hungry or full.
Find ways of solving their emotional difficulties without using food.
Learn how to take pleasure in eating.

, Because the condition involves different areas, discuss in-patient treatment options with them, such as a dedicated eating disorder facility. These sites will be able to address all of the problems anorexia brings up, so that their body and mind are both taken care of.


This is especially important if they are severely underweight or malnourished. Doctors at these facilities can help them maintain their body's health, while psychologists can address the mental part of the condition.

, Therapy can help them deal with the emotional difficulties underlying anorexia. A good therapist will help them change the way they feel about their body and food.


Cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT is the most researched method of therapy for eating disorders.It can help them change their thoughts and behavior so that they don't fall into the same old irrational beliefs about their weight and food.
Interpersonal therapy. IPT focuses on improving the relationships in their life so that the symptoms of anorexia will go away on their own, as their social sphere becomes healthier and more supportive.Search for a therapist by clicking here.


, Research shows that people who have an eating disorder are more likely to have depression and anxiety as well.These complex issues can make recovery more difficult, so it's a good idea for them to seek out help for any other major difficulties they are having as well, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or depression.


Obsessive-compulsive disorder is the most common anxiety disorder that shows up at the same time as eating disorders. If they mention having repeating thoughts about things they can't control, like germs or intruders in their home, they may want to ask their doctor about OCD.
Depression can lead to eating disorders and also be caused by them. If they seem to have persistent sad moods, constant tiredness, or difficulty feeling any pleasure, have them ask their doctor about major depression.

, People with anorexia frequently have deficiencies in nutrition. Contacting a registered dietitian will help them get their body back in balance. A dietitian can assist with gaining weight as well as replenishing whatever their body may be lacking, such as electrolytes. Research suggests that it may actually be necessary to address food and weight concerns before recovery can take place.Look for a dietitian who specializes in eating disorders. You can find one local to them by clicking here.


, There are no medications specifically for eating disorders, but things like anti-depressants or medication for anxiety can be helpful in treating the psychological symptoms of anorexia, which is often a necessary step in recovering from the disorder.If you are their parent, you can ask the doctor directly. If you are a friend or sibling, you may want to talk with them about it first.

, The first step is to cultivate awareness around their disorder so that you and other people will understand what they are going through. You can ask a doctor or view a resource like the National Eating Disorders Association's toolkit for parents.


Click here for the toolkit.

, There are most likely things you and others can do, or not do, to help them recover from anorexia. Let them know that you are there for them whenever they need help. Research shows that recovery from an eating disorder has a lot to do with how connected the person feels to other people.The kind of supportive care they get from friends and family is essential to their well-being, so do your best to let them know that you care and are willing to help in any way possible.


For example, if their doctor or dietitian puts them on a specific diet, ask if they want help managing this new routine.

, One promising method of treatment for anorexia is family therapy, which involves other members of their family undergoing therapy with them. This kind of therapy enlists their family members as allies to help them recover from the condition. Some research actually suggests that family therapy is more effective than individual therapy.The therapist will teach you and other family members how to be supportive and increase their chances for recovery. He may even observe your family eating together in order to make suggestions for healthy ways to encourage a better relationship with food., If they are still living with parents, it's a good idea for them to have at least three meals with them each week. Research shows that people who have regular meals with family are less likely to have an eating disorder. This time together can be a healthy way of getting them back on track, especially if combined with family therapy, so that their family members know how to best support them while they are struggling with food issues.

, Isolation is one of the worst things they can experience if they are already struggling with anorexia. It may seem like a good idea to hide away from the world while they try to manage their weight, but isolating themselves will only make the situation worse.Talk to them about letting their friends and family into their life so that they can be there for them. Relying on the people who care about them and want to see them recover is a key to success.

Consider why you began restricting.,
Distract yourself from your appearance.,
Try using harm reduction by slowly modifying harmful habits.,
Treat yourself the way you'd treat a good friend.,
Start balancing your diet.,
Consider your exercise regimen.,
Gently introduce more foods into your repertoire.,
Get support from education and the internet.,
Work on things you love.",How to Get Help as an Anorexic Teen," Did you feel out of control with your life? Is there a specific issue you can pinpoint (e.g. abusive parents, toxic expectations), or is it more difficult to figure out? Taking steps against what started it may help you feel more powerful and ready to recover.


A good therapist can help you pinpoint underlying issues. Medical help is important and can help you improve.;
, Cover mirrors if you need to, and try taping a picture of a smiley face with ""You look great!"" where the mirror would be.

, A lot of your time and energy has gone into habits that make things worse for you, and that isn't easy to undo. Rather than trying to go ""cold turkey"" and relapsing, make little changes bit by bit.


Add a stick of string cheese to what you usually eat. Continue with this until you feel comfortable with it. Then add a small cookie. Then start serving yourself bigger portions of meat.
Weigh yourself two times a day instead of three. Then weigh yourself only at night. Then try weighing yourself every other day.

, Would you tell a friend not to eat so much, or tell them they're fat and unlovable? You are your own best friend. Every time you're wondering what to do, imagine giving advice to a friend in that position. Then follow that advice.

, Fruits and vegetables are important and good. So are proteins, fats, and grains. You need to eat some of every food group in order to have a balanced diet.


There are no ""good"" or ""bad"" foods. Too much or too little of any food group is bad for you.
Think of desserts in terms of benefits—ice cream has calcium for strong bones, dark chocolate has antioxidants for lowering cancer risk, and fats boost brain and cellular health.

, Exercise should be fun, and it should not make you feel dizzy, too hot, faint, or nauseated. Practice taking it slowly, stretching beforehand, and drinking lots of water.


Try preventing over-exercising by exercising only with family members and friends who have healthy attitudes. Find something they like to do—walking, backyard sports, playing in a pool, et cetera. Try to match their pace, and stop when they stop.

, If you're used to thinking of some foods as ""bad,"" then it may be hard to start eating healthily right away. Try eating first string cheese, then pudding, then ice cream. Get comfortable with incorporating more and more into your diet.

, Learn about feminism and introduce yourself to feminist theory (if you're a girl). This will help you understand the pressures that cause women to feel like they need to be small and nonthreatening. Feminism has helped several great thinkers recover from anorexia, and go on to write important essays. Also look for support groups, and groups of eating disorder survivors.


If you started restricting because you were or are overweight, pay especial attention to the Fat Acceptance Movement. Health at Every Size can help you focus on your health instead of your weight.

, Life is about more than calories and numbers on a scale—make a commitment to do one fun thing every day. Try making art, listening to music, talking to a friend, playing with a sibling or pet, reading a good book, playing with computer code, or doing whatever you love. You deserve to feel happy.

You may go through cycles of eating too much or too little, along with having an extreme preoccupation with your body or weight. The most common eating disorders are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder.Researchers believe the roots of an eating disorder involve a intricate mixture of genetic, biological, psychological, social, and behavioral factors.;
, Warning signs may include losing weight dramatically, losing hair, not having a menstrual cycle, being overly preoccupied with calories, fat, sugar, dieting, and weight, making comments about being “fat” no matter how much weight you have lost, denying hunger, avoiding mealtimes or situations where food will be present, and working out excessively.


Anorexia nervosa restricting type is characterized by restricting foods or calories without binge eating or purging.
Anorexia nervosa binge-eating/purging type is characterized by eating large amounts of food and then purging, or vomiting, over a period of three months.

, This disorder is categorized by dangerous cycles of consuming large amounts of food then actions taken to compensate for the binge, such as vomiting or taking laxatives or diuretics. People suffering from bulimia may feel totally out of control during binges and their self-esteem is strongly linked to their perception of their bodies. There are purging and non-purging types of bulimia. Other signs may include:Swelling of the cheeks or jaw area
Stained teeth
Trips to the bathroom after meals
Disappearance of large amount of food
Calluses on hands or knuckles from self-induced vomiting.

, This condition involves consuming large amounts of food and feeling unable to stop. You may eat even when you’re already full, consume lots of food in a particular time-period (like over 2 hours), eat alone or in secret, diet consistently even if you are not losing weight, and feel depressed, ashamed or guilty about your eating habits.In comparison to a person with bulimia, those with binge-eating disorder may not attempt to compensate for overeating.

, Taking an online assessment will not provide a thorough evaluation as consulting with a specialist. However, it is a good way to understand your risk without all the pressure., If notice the signs and symptoms of an eating disorder in yourself, it’s important that you get help immediately. An eating disorder is a life-threatening condition, but proper medical help can help you recover. Are you worried about what to do next or afraid to tell a loved one? You can contact someone for support anonymously by calling the National Eating Disorder Association helpline at 1-800-931-2237., You may feel scared or embarrassed about needing help, but it can be helpful to start with someone who loves you. Reach out to one of your parents, best friends, or another trusted confidant.This person may initially express shock, anger, or disappointment. Try to be patient as they process the information and explain that you need support in seeing a doctor for help.

, The first step is meeting with your primary physician for an initial examination. Be sure to write down or be able to discuss at length all the symptoms you are experiencing. Your doctor can decide if you need immediate medical care in an inpatient center. He or she will also refer you to eating disorder specialists, such as dietitians, psychiatrists and psychologists.

, If you are worried about paying for your eating disorder recovery treatment, don't give up hope. Your insurer may deny coverage of your treatment, but you may be able to make an appeal to have it covered or receive your treatment on a sliding scale from various centers.In addition to treatment fees being charged on a sliding scale, you may also be able to receive treatment free of charge at facilities like Mercy Ministries, or you may receive assistance to help you cover the cost of treatment with major scholarships from the Kirsten Haglund Foundation, Manna Scholarship Fund and Eating Disorder Recovery, Inc., Treating an eating disorder requires a team of specialists who have a background in working with individuals with your condition. A dietitian will help diagnose the exact type of eating disorder you are experiencing. Then, this professional will work in conjunction with a mental health provider and your primary care doctor to monitor your nutrient intake, recommend food and exercise to get you back to a healthy weight, and help you develop a sustainable relationship with food., Depending on the severity of your disorder you may require pharmacological intervention, such as anti-anxiety meds or antidepressants, which can help with feelings of depression or anxiety that contribute to disorder eating. A psychiatrist can prescribe and help you manage your medications., Most people find that seeing a psychologist or psychotherapist for therapy helps them to process their thoughts and emotions associated with their eating habits. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been recognized as one of the most effective treatment approaches for eating disorders since it addresses the core issue found in all eating disorders, which is being overly concerned with one's shape and weight.Depending on your specific diagnosis, the therapist will work with you to identify irrational thought patterns you have about your body and help you monitor and overcome your tendency to restrict, binge, or purge food based on your mood.In some cases, it is helpful to conduct family-based therapy for minors so that the therapist can address how unhealthy thought patterns and behaviors are frequently reinforced by family or cultural views on body image., Another way to recover from an eating disorder is meeting regularly with others who have gone through, or are going through, the same journey. These groups offer you a safe haven to talk about what you are feeling, offer advice, and share ways to cope."

Choose nutrient-dense foods.,
Add extra calories when you can.,
Drink your calories.",How to Gain Weight as a Recovering Anorexic1," Nutrient-dense foods are foods that are calorie-heavy but also filled with nutrients our bodies need to fuel activity. These are essential for recovery, as they will help to restore normal levels of micronutrients in your body and decrease the risk for developing conditions associated with nutritional deficiencies, such as osteoporosis or hair loss. While certain foods, like empty carbs and junk food, can move the number on the scale up fast, they're not as healthy an option as going for high-calorie, nutrient-dense choices.


Nutrient-dense foods are beneficial in that you need to eat less to gain the benefits. This can be particularly helpful to people recovering from anorexia, who struggle to adjust to typical portion sizes. A small or medium serving of a nutrient-dense food provides needed calories and nutrition.A nutrient-dense meal generally includes high-protein options mixed with fruit, veggies, and healthy carbohydrates like brown rice and whole grain pasta or bread.
Some examples of nutrient dense food include salmon, chicken, walnuts, bananas, flaxseeds, shellfish, whole grain bread, olive oil, brown rice, oatmeal, yogurt, and dried fruits without added sugar.;
, When you have an opportunity to add an extra 50 or 100 calories, take it. Any amount of calories helps the process of gaining back weight.


Plant fats, such as nuts, are healthy and high in calories. Add mixed nuts to a salad. Nut-based spreads, like almond or cashew butter, can be added to toast and sandwiches. Hummus is made from chickpeas, and can be a great dip or addition to a pita wrap.Consider adding extra salad dressing to salads or pasta, ketchup or mayonnaise to grilled meat or sandwiches, sour cream to Mexican dishes.
When possible, opt for high-calorie condiments and dressings such as ranch, mayonnaise, thousand island dressing, and Caesar salad dressing.Granola, loaded with nuts and dried fruits, is a good source of nutritious calories and can be added to yogurt or eaten as a snack.Drizzle canola or olive oil, which both contain healthy fats, over salads, soups, casseroles, and whole grains.

, Many calories can be gained by drinking beverages that contain nutritious calories. Liquids aren't as filling as whole foods so you can add nutrients and calories without feeling bloated.


Good, healthy liquid choices include 100% fruit juice, kefir, skim milk or milk alternatives (such as soy or almond milk), buttermilk, and teas sweetened with natural sweeteners like honey.
Smoothies, made from fruits and veggies, are ideal. They are calorie-heavy, easy to consume, and can be bolstered with a variety of healthy additives like wheat germ, nut butter, and protein powder.Meal replacement smoothies and drinks are also a good choice, and available at most groceries stores. For optimal weight gain, however, eat them in addition to solid food snacks and bolster them with fruits, powdered milk, or soft silken tofu."

Be prepared for the physical consequences of recovery.,
Change your food attitude.,
Get counseling.,
See a doctor who specializes in nutrition.,
Follow-up with your treating medical provider.",How to Gain Weight as a Recovering Anorexic2," Many people recovering from anorexia have an unhealthy mentality about food and weight that is reinforced during the recovery process. People recovering from anorexia often feel discouraged to continue on the path to weight gain when they hit certain setbacks. Being aware of these potential physical consequence and their temporary nature can help you cope.


Abdominal weight gain is common in those recovering from anorexia. While the reasons for this are still debated, the vast majority of studies indicate any abnormal weight distribution normalizes after one year of recovery. In other words, this side effect is temporary. Many people recovering from anorexia find it helpful to look at stomach fat as a positive sign of recovery and health.Rapid weight gain, especially in the first days and weeks, is also common. Fluid between the tissues in the body's cells and glycogen stores in the liver and muscle are replenished, which leads to quick weight gain. Do not weigh yourself too often during the early period of recovery as you may become disturbed by how quickly the number on the scale moves up. This is a healthy, normal part of recovery and weight gain slows as you reach a normal, healthy weight for your body.Be aware there may be some unpleasant physical side effects. When the body has been deprived of food for so long, reintroducing normal eating habits are a shock to the system. Side effects include diarrhea, nausea, weakness, sleep disturbances, a heightened sensitivity to cold, a weak bladder, and constipation. Be aware going in such side effects may occur, but view them as signs you're on the path to a healthier, happier you., Many people recovering from anorexia see diet as a means of continual deprivation, an attitude that leads to the development of anorexia. Challenging yourself to view food as an important part of a healthy lifestyle rather than a necessary evil is a vital step to weight gain and overall recovery.


Have a good support system. Surround yourself with friends and loved ones who eat well and have a healthy body image and relationship with food and eating. It's hard to recover from anorexia if you're in the presence of a perpetual dieter or someone who binge eats and drinks. You need models for a healthy relationship with food, weight gain, and eating.
Keep a food journal. Keeping track of food intake can lead to healthier eating habits, but it can also lead to a healthier attitude overall. Track how you're feeling before and after you eat, and what kind of thoughts you're having that may affect eating habits and lead to unnecessary food restriction.Learn from others. Seek out success stories from other people recovering from anorexia, whether from local support groups or online resources, and figure out what they did to change their relationship with food and eating for the better.

, Anorexia is a particularly dangerous disorder, and if you suffer from anorexia you are unlikely to simply put weight back on without psychiatric intervention. A variety of psychotherapy approaches demonstrate effectiveness when dealing with eating disorders, and seeking out a counselor in your area can keep you on the path to gaining weight.


Select a therapist who is up to date on all the science of eating disorders. When contacting a potential therapist, ask about their training, their experience treating patients with eating disorders, what their treatment options and goals are, what certifications they hold, and whether they're part of any professional eating disorder organizations.In particular, look into cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The objective of CBT is to change faulty thought processes about food such as all-or-nothing thinking, judgmental thinking, and catastrophizing. A CB therapist will help to break the patterns of disordered eating through the use of food monitoring, thought monitoring, meal regularity and nutritional monitoring.
Family counseling is also important, especially for adolescents.
To locate a therapist in your area, you can try calling the psychiatric department at a university and asking for a list of recommendations of people trained in their program, calling a large clinic and asking for a referral, and talking to friends and family members who are receiving counseling or therapy.Do not limit your search to providers listed by your insurance company. Even providers who claim they don't accept your program may be able to make an exception or offer you a discount of some kind., Once again, anorexia is serious and you can't expect to gain weight in a healthy fashion going at it alone. Seeking professional help from a nutritional specialist is vital to gaining weight. Weight gain is important, but some side effects can be dangerous to your health. A physician should be supervising the recovery process and meeting with you in a medical office on a regular basis.

, Weekly weigh-ins, vital signs measurement, and periodic laboratory testing including CBC, serum electrolytes and serum amylase levels are important. Make follow-up appointments with your doctor and don't skip them."

Practice mindful eating.,
Eat throughout the day.,
Learn normal portion size.",How to Gain Weight as a Recovering Anorexic3," How you eat is as important to weight gain as what you eat. Mindful eating is a practice with roots in Buddhist teachings and aims to reconnect us with the experience and enjoyment of eating. The end goal is to eat based on physical cues, like the body's need for hunger, rather than for comfort or out of boredom.


Eat slower. Take time to savor each bite and chew more. This will make you realize you're full faster, which can lead to a healthier relationship with food and hunger.
Eat in silence. If you eat meals with family members or friends, this may be difficult, but suggest a period of silence to focus on the food. Turn off the TV and your cell phone as well.
Focus on the flavor, and consider how much you are enjoying the meal., Anorexia is a disease often defined by erratic eating patterns. Your body needs a continual source of energy all day, especially so if you're trying to gain back weight lost through a disorder like anorexia. Eat regular meals, spaced about three to four hours apart, to gain weight in a steady, healthy fashion.Snack more frequently. Reminding yourself to eat more often, to snack between meals, and to eat whenever you feel hungry can help you learn to follow cues from your stomach. Get into the habit of snacking throughout the day on small healthy foods. This can increase your daily calorie intake without overloading your stomach at each meal.

, Gaining weight after being anorexic is difficult because your perception of portion size is warped. Adjusting to normal portions can be a tricky part of the recovery process.


Do not skip meals. This prevents you from adapting to normal portion sizes, as you're more likely to go overboard at your next meal and end up feeling sick and discouraged. Eat three meals a day with snacks in between.
Measure and weigh your food. Humans are not good judges of size, so keep a small scale and measuring cups on hand when preparing meals. Make sure you're getting a full serving of your favorite foods.
Learn handy cheats in regards to size and weight. For example, 3 ounces of lean meat is the size of a deck of cards and 1 cup of breakfast cereal is about the size of a fist. Gather tidbits like this, from online and from friends and doctors, so you'll have a good sense of how much food is adequate.
Plan your meals beforehand, keeping in mind how many calories you'll need and what types of food you should consume for a healthy goal for that day."

Gather information.,
Confront the individual gently.,
Call your doctor or the hospital.,
Look for support groups in your area.,
Encourage the individual to see a doctor.,
Talk to the individual's loved ones.,
Step back.",How to Find Help for Someone With Bulimia," The last thing you want to do is confront or accuse someone who is not suffering from the disease. Bulimia is an eating disorder in which the person suffering frequently binge eats, and then panics about all of the food they just consumed. The binging is followed by purging, and the person suffering from bulimia may use ex-lax or other laxatives in order to purge the food they just binged upon.;
, Some signs of binge eating include: the inability to stop eating, eating large amounts of food yet gaining no weight, and eating in secret. Some signs of purging include: heading directly to the bathroom right after a meal, using laxatives, exercising constantly, and a person suffering from bulimia might try to cover the smell of vomit with mints and gum.

, Hit up your local library to read more on the eating disorder known as bulimia. Search the Internet for the latest articles about helping someone with bulimia. Your friend who is suffering from bulimia might need a different kind of help than someone else with bulimia. Many of the same things help someone with bulimia, but you may want to try a few different approaches.

, Talk to your friend, either by yourself or with a small group of other concerned friends and family. Be careful that your friend doesn't think you're attacking him or her. But be aware that he or she still might seem defensive. The individual will likely deny having a problem, so be ready for that.

, See if they know of any eating disorder programs in the area and gather information to give to your friend.

, There may be support groups outside the hospital environment that you can try to get your friend to go to. He or she may feel more comfortable in a support group that does not take place within a medical office.

, Chances are, there is already a family doctor to whom he or she can talk to. See if you can convince your friend to go see his or her doctor, as the doctor will be able to provide very detailed information about how bulimia is affecting his or her health.

, Provide support to your friend's family and other loved ones. They will need almost as much support as your friend, so they in turn can provide the support that your friend needs.

, In the end, it's up to your friend to get help for bulimia. You cannot force your friend to get help, but you can provide the information to enable him or her to get help with bulimia.

Make sure your child is mature enough to handle this topic of conversation.,
Sit down with your child in a comfortable place where you'll both find it easy to talk.,
Explain an eating disorder.,
Mention the risks that eating disorders have for any person.,
Explain to your child that an eating disorder has almost nothing to do with body image.,
Tell your child they are beautiful no matter what.",How to Discuss Eating Disorders with a Child," While you may want your children to be informed about this challenging topic at an early age, if your child isn't mature enough to comprehend what is happening and why, then wait a bit. The ideal age is around 10 to 13 years old, just when your child is starting to become more self aware and more self conscious.;
, Let your child know that you'd like to have an important conversation about what eating disorders are. Your child may be confused or concerned at first but tell them that it will only take a few minutes. Start off simple by asking your child questions such as: Do they know what anorexia/bulimia is? Do they know anyone who shows signs of having an eating disorder?

, After your child answers your questions tell your child what an eating disorder is or make any corrections if needed, to ensure that your child has an accurate understanding. Tell the child in the most simplest way possible. If you start using a bunch of big words and medical terms, your child may become confused or totally detach from the conversation.

, For example, such consequences as thinning hair, slowing of the metabolism, dry skin, red patches, bad teeth, and so forth. Making your child aware of the (unpleasant) dangers that come with having an eating disorder, will help your child to understand how grave the consequences are and it will also help your child to spot the symptoms in someone else, potentially enabling them to help another person.

, While most people with an eating disorder want to be skinny, the reality is that eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia are actually mental illnesses. They are often associated with something called body dysmorphia, whereby someone looks into the mirror and doesn't see what everyone else sees (if they're really skinny in real life, they might see a disfigured or overweight person in the mirror).

, Make it clear that you love your child unconditionally. Tell them that the scale is just a number and size isn't all that matters. Make sure your child knows that he or she is perfect in their own way and tell them that they can come talk to you about anything at anytime.

Look for prolonged expressions of “picky eating.” On the surface, SED will look like regular “picky eating,” meaning that the individual will only eat select foods and refuse all others.,
Notice if certain food groups are restricted altogether.,
Count the number of foods.",How to Diagnose Selective Eating Disorder1," If this behavior persists for more than four months, or appears to get worse, you may be dealing with more than just pickiness., Individuals with SED will often refuse entire food groups, such as vegetables, meat, or dairy. Notice if the individual has completely removed entire food groups from their diet., An individual with SED usually accepts less than 20 foods. Begin keeping track of the number of different foods the individual will accept, and if that number comes to 20 or less, you may be dealing with SED."
"
Determine the reasons for food avoidance.,
Realize that this avoidance is not based on weight.,
Look for emotional responses.",How to Diagnose Selective Eating Disorder2," Individuals with SED with typically avoid foods based on sensory qualities, such as smell, taste, or texture. They may also avoid foods that are touching each other. Additionally, a previous bad experience with a certain food (such as choking or food poisoning) could be to blame. Try to uncover the motivations for the individual’s limited diet., Unlike other eating disorders, SED involves fear or anxiety around certain foods, and is not motivated by the desire to lose weight. If food is being restricted to achieve a certain weight or body type, you may be dealing with anorexia or a related eating disorder.Even though weight may not be a problem for adults with SED, children with SED are often underweight and have diminished bone mineral density.

, When a person with SED is presented with a new food, they will likely experience fear and anxiety. This fear and/or anxiety can be quite severe, and it is noticeably different from the normal response of someone who simply does not like a food.Visible signs of fear or anxiety can include:


Tensing of the shoulders or other muscles.
Fidgeting.
Sweating.
Crying.
Shaking in the hands.
Inability to look at the food.
A need to immediately leave the table.

"
"
Look at the age of onset.,
Recognize related disorders.,
Notice the refusal food despite hunger.,
Be aware of more extreme symptoms.",How to Diagnose Selective Eating Disorder3," Occurrences of SED can begin anytime from birth to the age 4. If an adult is experiencing SED, it is likely to have started occurring during childhood.Picky eating phases are common in children between 18 months and 3 years of age, but these phases will usually pass within a few months.

, SED is often occurs alongside other medical or emotional conditions. If the individual has been diagnosed with any of these other conditions, SED is a more likely diagnosis than simple “picky eating.”Consider the possibility of:


Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

Autism (including Asperger Syndrome and PDD-NOS)
Food trauma
Oral-motor delay
Swallowing disorders
Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD)
Gastrointestinal disorders

, Most picky eaters will succumb under the weight of hunger. Individuals with SED, on the other hand, will not. The fear/anxiety of consuming a certain food will outweigh feelings of hunger in an SED individual. , If SED is left unchecked for long periods of time, it can result in lasting, long-term symptoms. These include weight loss, malnutrition, and/or lethargy. Additionally, SED can be very difficult socially, and may impair a person’s interaction with others."

Common signs of bingeing include eating large quantities of food in a short time, even when not hungry; eating alone; hoarding food; or hiding empty food containers.Don’t confuse bingeing with regular overeating. Everyone overeats sometimes, and it’s generally not considered a problem unless it is a common occurrence. Bingeing, on the other hand, is a compulsive behavior that can cause feelings of guilt, depression, or being out of control. Someone with bulimia, binge eats at least once a week and continues for months.
Binge eating usually involves elements of secrecy and shame. People who binge may only eat in private, buy food at different stores to conceal their habit, hide their empty wrappers and containers, or replace food so no one will know they ate it.;
, Many people with bulimia try to make up for the excessive amount of calories consumed during a binge by purging the food afterwards, often by vomiting. The person may also abuse laxatives .


Common signs of purging include regular bathroom visits after meals, tooth or gum damage, swollen cheeks, and scars or calluses on the knuckles. Some people with bulimia also purge by using laxatives or enemas., Instead of physically purging, some people with bulimia compensate for their binges by fasting or over-exercising. Someone with bulimia may take an all-or-nothing approach to food and severely restrict their intake when they are not bingeing.Others may spend excessive amounts of time exercising to burn off the calories they consume.


How much exercise is too much? While it’s healthy to maintain a consistent exercise routine, any type of workout can become destructive if it’s taken to an extreme. Disordered exercise patterns are often characterized by prioritizing exercise over other responsibilities, feeling restless or agitated when exercising isn’t possible, and continuing to work out even when sick., Bulimia doesn’t always cause weight loss — in fact, many people with bulimia are normal weight or slightly overweight; however, this eating disorder can cause physical symptoms other than weight changes.


Signs of purging such as swollen cheeks, scarred knuckles, or bloodshot eyes can all be giveaways of bulimia. The smell of vomit may be another sign that something is amiss., Many eating disorders stem from a negative body image. Someone with a negative body image may see themselves as overweight or unattractive, even if others don’t. Constant self-criticism, comparing one’s own body with other people’s bodies, and idealizing an unrealistic body type are also signs of negative body image issues.Someone with a negative body image is excessively concerned about the way their body looks. This can lead to the idea that attaining a “perfect” body would lead to a better life. An eating disorder is sometimes the result of this irrational belief.
Body image issues often have their roots in early childhood. Children who are criticized for their weight may develop a negative body image that persists into adulthood.
People with perfectionistic or self-critical tendencies are especially likely to have a negative body image.

, Low self-esteem is a big factor in the development of eating disorders. Someone with a low sense of self-worth may try to feel better about themselves by changing the way their body looks, which can lead to an eating disorder like bulimia.


Signs of low self-esteem may include being hypersensitive to criticism, excessively seeking approval from others, having a pattern of turbulent relationships, or habitually being unconfident and unassertive., Trauma is a major trigger for the development of eating disorders. Not everyone with bulimia has a painful past, but many people with this condition have suffered sexual abuse or another kind of trauma.


Some common symptoms of unresolved abuse or trauma include withdrawn behavior, anxiety, anger, or mood swings., For many people with bulimia, their eating disorder started as a way of coping with stressful life circumstances. Bingeing may serve as a comfort mechanism or an escape, while purging or restricting calories restores a feeling of control.


Common stressors that can cause eating disorders may include relationship problems, problems at school or work, illness, or a difficult home life., Bulimia can be dangerous or even fatal if it’s not treated. If you have bulimia or suspect that someone you know has it, it’s essential to seek medical help immediately. A doctor can perform a physical evaluation, help you come up with a plan for recovery, and refer you to a therapist to address the emotional aspects of bulimia.


If you are unable to urinate, have heart palpitations, vomit blood, or have black stools, call a doctor or visit an emergency room immediately., Bulimia can damage the body in many different ways. By performing a thorough evaluation of your health, a doctor can determine whether bulimia has caused chemical imbalances in your body or damaged your heart, bones, lungs, or mouth. A thorough physical examination can help you and your doctor determine the best path to recovery for you., Food logs are a valuable aid in diagnosing and recovering from bulimia. Writing down everything you eat, as well as your mood and thoughts at the time, helps you to stay mindful about your food choices. A food log can also help a medical professional assess your eating disorder accurately.There are many ways to keep a food log. You can jot down everything you eat in a notebook, fill out sheets prepared by a nutritionist, or even use an app on your phone.

, A mental health professional can help you break the negative thought patterns that create and reinforce disordered eating habits. Often these negative thought patterns are too unconscious or deeply ingrained to fix without professional help. A therapist can help you create healthier thought patterns and find ways to deal with your emotions without resorting to disordered eating.


Therapy can be an effective way to work through unresolved trauma, poor self-esteem, and negative body image issues, which are often at the root of bulimia and other eating disorders.

, Most people with disordered eating have a specific trigger that sets them down a destructive path. Put a finger on yours and develop an alternative plan for dealing with these triggers.For example, maybe summertime rouses your unhealthy eating behaviors. You worry about how you will look in a bathing suit or in cut-off shorts. If this is a trigger for you, you must make an extra special effort to come up with a plan to avoid relapse. Maybe you could alert your therapist and he/she could go over strategies for dealing with this trigger.

In order to receive a diagnosis of this eating disorder, you must meet the following criteria:Not taking in enough food or calories to grow and develop properly
Intense fear of gaining weight, even when underweight
Feeling like your body shape and size determine your worthiness or attractiveness to others; being in denial about weighing too little;
, An obsession with weight and body shape is one of the main signs of anorexia. If you or someone you know has anorexia, you may notice the following weight or shape-related behaviors in yourself:Losing dramatic amounts of weight
Weighing yourself excessively
Measuring your body parts or assessing yourself in the mirror
Weight changes, even slight, affect your mood and feelings of self-worth
Commenting about feeling ""fat"" despite low or average weight
Working out excessively

, People with anorexia may spend a lot of time obsessing over or thinking about food. Pay attention to warning signs associated with anorexia; however, be aware that simply wanting to lose weight, or following a diet, or restricting carbs is not necessarily a sign of anorexia. Someone with anorexia will likely display a combination of signs and symptoms, and will likely show an emotional attachment or investment in these behaviors — the person will rigidly follow these rules and be preoccupied by food and eating behaviours often excluding typical behaviours of their peer group.The following may be signs of anorexia:Following an extremely low-calorie diet
Pretending you're not hungry when you are
Refusing to eat certain foods or restricting whole food groups (for example, refusing to eat proteins or carbs because their calorie count is too high)
Counting calories or fat grams constantly
Cooking for others, but not eating
Making excuses to avoid mealtimes or events where food is present
Using laxatives, diuretics, or diet pills to lose weight and keep weight off

, Researchers have found that people with high risk of having anorexia nervosa often have high-achieving, perfectionist personalities. You may notice the following social and personality changes:Feeling irritable or moody
Withdrawing from friends and loved ones
Failing to participate in activities that were once pleasurable
Showing signs of anxiety (such as feeling nervous or tense, increased heart rate, difficulty sleeping, difficulty concentrating, feeling panicked)Showing signs of depression (such as feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, feeling guilty or worthless, loss of interest in hobbies or things you once enjoyed, feeling empty, thoughts of suicide)Spending time on internet sites or forums that promote anorexia (pro-ana)
Feeling low on energy or fatigued (which may be a result of inadequate caloric intake)
Becoming defensive when confronted about weight or eating habits

, If you are a young man, an older woman or any other person, who is showing signs of anorexia, do not overlook your symptoms. Many people mistakenly assume that eating disorders are an issue affecting only females, but researchers estimate that males make up approximately a quarter of those suffering from anorexia.Signs and symptoms may present differently in men and women. Men may experience the following:Men may be more likely to over-exercise
Men are more likely to report binge eating
Risk for mortality among men with eating disorders may be higher, because they are less likely to seek help, Your general practitioner is usually the first stop for anorexia treatment. When you see your doctor, be sure to prepare as much information about your symptoms to help them diagnose your case. It may also be a good idea to think ahead about how you will answer the following questions:Have you lost any weight lately?
Do you make yourself vomit?
Are you concerned about your weight?
Do you think you have any issues with eating
Are you still menstruating? If not, for how long has your period stopped? (for females)

, Your doctor my test for a number of possible health problems created by anorexia, as it can lead to complications such as anemia, heart problems, kidney problems, severely low potassium, and constipation.The following are not diagnostic tests to actually diagnose anorexia; but they may reveal any issues created by the disorder, or may reveal a medical condition that causes weight loss:A physical exam helps your doctor calculate your body mass index, or BMI. This number factors in your age and height to determine if you are at a healthy weight. Healthy BMIs may range from 18.5 to 24.9. Your GP may show concern for a BMI under 20 or lower.A physical exam will also give information about your vital signs, your heart and lung functioning, problems on the nails or skin, or the abdomen.
Laboratory tests may be conducted to check your complete blood count and the electrolytes and protein in your blood. The doctor may also examine a sample of your urine.
Other tests to help your doctor determine the cause of weight loss (and/or loss of menstruation) may include a bone density test, kidney and liver function tests, thyroid function tests, x-rays, or an electrocardiogram.

, Once your primary care doctor has evaluated your physical functioning and decided that you have anorexia, he or she should refer you to a mental health professional or eating disorder specialist to confirm the diagnosis and start treatment.


When you visit with this professional, they will interview you about your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. They might also conduct a series of assessments, such as psychological tests., Depending on how low your body weight is, or if you are severely malnourished, you may have to be admitted into a hospital to be fed intravenously or through a stomach tube.Other reasons for inpatient treatment may include steady weight decline despite treatment, medical complications, psychiatric disorders or suicidal ideation (i.e. thoughts of wanting to kill yourself).
Anorexia commonly occurs with other disorders, which must also be addressed. These include major depression, self-harm, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, and alcohol and drug (such as laxatives, diet pills, diuretics as well as opiates and sedatives) misuse., Both the physical and psychological aspects of anorexia must be addressed in recovery. That's why an effective treatment team will include your primary care doctor, a dietitian, and a mental health provider like a psychologist.


Your primary care doctor will continue to conduct routine tests and exams to monitor your progress.A dietitian will help you determine the right amount of food and calories your body needs to return to a healthy weight. This professional will also help you learn coping strategies to deal with triggers and develop a healthier relationship with food and your body.A psychologist or mental health therapist will help you to identify and change negative thought patterns that have influenced your eating behaviors and your body weight obsession. In therapy, you will also work to improve pre-existing emotional and social problems that contribute to your eating disorder, such as being a perfectionist., Some medications that are used to treat mental health disorders may also be useful in improving the mood and outlook of patients with anorexia. Your primary care doctor may prescribe these medications to you, or you may need to see a psychiatrist for them.When used as a part of a well-rounded treatment approach, medications such as those that decrease depressive feelings, improve your mood, reduce worrying or fear (e.g. antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics) can significantly help with treatment outcomes.
Not everyone with anorexia will require medications. This will depend on the severity of your eating disorder and any other mental health issues you are dealing with at the same time.

, Since anorexia nervosa is a complex disorder affecting many factors of your life, effective treatment should aim to improve your functioning across multiple areas.


Because anorexia can affect so many different aspects of a person's life and health, often the patient will work with a multidisciplinary treatment team. This means that not just one doctor will be able to treat you and you may have to try several different treatment approaches to see positive results.This group of health care providers can help you to overcome obsessive thoughts about your body, treat symptoms like depression or anxiety, manage your weight gain, and establish healthier eating patterns., Find a time when you both have plenty of time to talk, and get together somewhere private.You may not be able to convince him he has an eating disorder, but you can voice your concerns and let him know you support him. Say something like, ""I get concerned when I notice you skipping meals."" It may also be helpful to address some of the side effects of anorexia, rather than the eating disorder itself. Address your loved one's depression, isolation, anxiety, or other side effects — he may be more willing to be seen for these issues, which may help initiate treatment for anorexia.When you express your concerns to your loved one, be aware that he may deny he has a problem or even get angry.Try to stay calm and don't react with anger.
Remember that this is scary for the person with anorexia. The more empathy you have, the better. While you may not understand why it is difficult for the person to seek help, try to remember that it is stressful, confusing, challenging, and maybe even terrifying for him.Never say anything like ""Just do it,"" or ""Just eat."" This is not helpful and oversimplifies a very complex issue., It can be frustrating and scary to see someone you love struggle with anorexia, especially if she denies there is a problem or refuses treatment. It is absolutely necessary to encourage your loved one to seek treatment.Ask if she wants help setting up an appointment. You can offer to make the appointment for her and/or to accompany her to see the doctor.There are some cases in which a person can be treated against her will. If the person with anorexia is under 18, then it is possible to require her to receive treatment, even if she doesn't believe it is necessary. Or, if the person is at the point where her life is at risk but she is still refusing treatment, doctors may decide to admit her for compulsory treatment., The person may try to appease you by promising he will see a doctor or therapist, but never actually follow through. If the person has told you he will take these steps, follow up to make sure he is making — and attending — appointments regularly.Be careful not to make this the only thing you talk about with him, or become combative or overly insistent, or he may begin to avoid you. Just make sure you are regularly checking in and reminding him you love and care about him., The person might say she is busy, it is expensive, or that it's really not that serious.If the person says she is busy, or is reluctant to miss any school or work, remind her that school and life will still be there after treatment. She may even be able to get treatment without disrupting her life too much.You might ask that, even if she doesn't think it's that bad, she talk to a doctor just to put your worries to rest.If money is an issue, help the person look for a therapist that works on a sliding scale, or suggest she speaks to a school counselor or someone who is available to talk to for free. She may also benefit from a support group or 12-step program that doesn't cost any money.
You might also note that, if the person is diagnosed with anorexia according to the DSM-V guidelines, her insurance may help pay for treatment. Examine her insurance plan, checking through the detailed descriptions of her benefits to find out what is covered and for how long. Or, if the insurance is through work, consult with human resources."

Educate yourself about your illness.,
Know the risk factors.,
Be able to spot the symptoms.,
Recognize that the disease can be life-threatening.",How to Cope With Bulimia1," The only way you can truly understand the seriousness of bulimia is by learning more about this particular eating disorder. Bulimia nervosa is marked by excessive eating of large amounts of foods (in sometimes short amounts of time) and then later compensating for excessive calories by vomiting or taking laxatives. There are two types of bulimia nervosa:Purging bulimia involves self-induced vomiting or abusing laxatives, enemas, and diuretics to compensate for a binge.
Non-purging bulimia involves the use of other tactics to prevent weight gain such as restrictive dieting, fasting, or exercising excessively.;
, If you are suffering from bulimia nervosa, there are probably certain characteristics about you, your thought patterns, or your life history that make you more susceptible to the disease. Common risk factors for bulimia include the following:Being female
Being an adolescent or young adult
Having a family history of eating disorders
Falling into societal ideals of thinness perpetuated through the media
Dealing with psychological or emotional issues, such as poor self-esteem, poor body image, anxiety, or chronic stress; or dealing with a traumatic event
Being consistently pressured by others to perform or be perfect as in athletes, dancers, or models

, Those who suffer from bulimia, whether the purging or non-purging type, experience a unique set of symptoms. You, your family members, or close friends may have noticed some of the following signs and symptoms that you are dealing with this disorder:Having a lack of control when it comes to eating
Being secretive about your eating habits
Switching back and forth between eating too much and fasting
Noticing food disappearing
Eating enormous amounts of foods without seeing changes in body size
Going to the restroom after meals to purge
Exercising a great deal
Taking laxatives, diet pills, enemas, or diuretics
Experiencing frequent weight fluctuations
Demonstrating chipmunk cheeks due to vomiting repeatedly
Being overweight or average weight
Demonstrating discolorations on teeth from throwing up stomach acids

, There are many dangerous consequences to bulimia nervosa. Purging behaviors can result in dehydration and electrolyte imbalances that can ultimately lead to irregular heartbeats, heart failure, and even death. Regular vomiting can also rupture the esophagus.Some people with bulimia use ipecac syrup to induce vomiting. This syrup accumulates in the body and can cause cardiac arrest or death.Beyond the physical risks associated with bulimia, those who suffer from eating disorders are also at high risk of psychological problems, such as alcohol and substance abuse as well as suicide."

Use positive affirmations if you feel the anorexia creeping up.",How to Cope With Anorexia1," Keeping a recovery journal where you write down your feelings will help you maintain awareness about your condition. It will help you keep a record of how you felt throughout the day, especially when you were dealing with food issues.You can use the technique of ""unpacking"" to go deeper into your feelings. For example, if you wrote that you felt ""okay"" one day, ask yourself what you could have meant by the word ""okay."" This will help you explore your feelings in more depth.;
, Anorexia can have serious health complications such as anemia, bone loss, gastrointestinal issues, heart problems, and even death.It's important to consult a medical professional if you think you may have anorexia, so you can get the treatment you need to recover. Talk to your doctor about anorexia if you exhibit the following symptoms:Significant weight loss as a result of not eating.
Fear of being fat, even when your body appears too thin to many people.
Excessive dieting and exercise.
Anxiety, mood swings, or hyperactivity.
Difficulty sleeping.
Suppressed sexual desire.
In women, irregular or nonexistent menstruation.
In men, preoccupation with weightlifting.

, Setting unrealistic goals will cause problems, because you will have difficulty achieving them and you will want to give up early. Instead, aim smaller at first, and then ramp after you've met the early goalposts. If your goals are realistic, you will be able to balance them with other things in your life. This can be a good way to measure whether they are attainable or not. If your goal requires so much effort and time that you don't have time left for fun or other responsibilities, you may want to re-examine.For example, if you're only eating one meal a day, try adding a small snack. You don't need to go for a full three meals per day right off the bat.
For another example, if you check your weight over 10 times per day, try to get that number down to 8. Aiming for no checking may be unreasonable, but you can probably lower the number a little bit if you make an effort.
Note that if your life is in immediate danger due to anorexia, you may be hospitalized to get your weight up quickly to prevent life-threatening complications. In general, though, you can work up to a healthy weight through small, achievable goals., A trigger is anything that upsets and leads you to eating disorder behaviors.If you can identify your triggers, you can gain control over situations and people that lead you to the anorexic behaviors.

Stressful family interactions.
Stressful job situations.
Images or events that trigger your body image issues.
Specific foods that you have difficulty thinking about.

, It can help you learn to listen to your body's signals, such as when you are hungry or full. It can also help you develop alternative coping mechanisms for comforting yourself that don't involve food. Some more things intuitive eating can do:


Help you begin to appreciate eating as a pleasurable activity.
Respect your body, or your ""genetic blueprint.""
Reject the diet mentality.

, If you have difficulty accepting your body, look at all the colorful varieties of body types in the world to see just how special and unique each one of them is. You can see this diversity by going to an art museum and looking at classical paintings, where people valued different physiques than they do today. You can also read news about body diversity by clicking here.

, Whenever you feel stressed and want to turn to anorexic behaviors to cope, use a mantra or positive statement to redirect your feelings. Be your own coach.For example, you can say ""I can feel bad and still choose to take a new and healthy direction.""
You can also say ""This is difficult and uncomfortable, but it is only temporary.""

You may truly believe that if you could only get your weight or eating under control, you could be happy. However, the only way you can get better is to admit you have an unhealthy relationship with food and your body. You must open your eyes and heart to the possibility of recovery.

, To start the recovery process, you must see a doctor. Your doctor can provide a thorough exam and assess your bloodwork to determine how much damage your body has endured. He can also help you and your loved ones determine the level of care needed to help you recover., Your primary care doctor is not sufficient to treat bulimia on her own. After you get an initial evaluation, she will likely refer you to a community resource who has a special background in treating eating disorders. This professional may be a licensed therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist., An effective treatment plan for overcoming bulimia will focus on helping you identify and avoid triggers, manage stress, build a better body image, and address any psychological or emotional issues that contributed to the eating disorder.Research has shown cognitive behavioral therapy to be one of the most effective treatment approaches for bulimia.In this type of therapy, patients work with the therapist to challenge unrealistic thought patterns about their appearance and bodies and develop healthier relationships with food.Find a cognitive behavioral therapist specializing in eating disorders for the best chance at recovery.

Share your story.,

Learn alternative coping strategies.,
Avoid triggers.",How to Cope With Bulimia3," Eating disorders are frequently kept secret from those around you. Breaking out of this rut means talking to someone about what you're thinking, feeling, and doing each day. Find a good, nonjudgmental listener who is willing to offer you support and possibly be an accountability partner., Recovery from bulimia will require regularly meeting your dietitian and working at home to make sure you are meeting your nutritional needs. Learning to listen to your body to recognize what is hunger and what is an emotional need, such as loneliness or boredom, are huge aspects of nutritional therapy for bulimia. Your dietitian can also guide you in selecting foods that will satiate your hunger and prevent your need to binge., Think of your coping skills as a toolbox or arsenal - the more behaviors you pack inside, the better equipped you are at fighting bulimia. Get together with both your therapist and dietitian to brainstorm ideas for coping strategies. A few suggestions are as follows:Get involved with a hobby or passion to boost your self-esteem
Phone a friend when faced with a trigger
Connect with a friend from an online support group
Make a list of positive affirmation to read aloud
Walk or play with your pet
Start a gratitude journal
Read a book
Get a massage
Exercise, if appropriate for your treatment plan

, As you participate in therapy and support groups you will gain more insight into the things that trigger a binge cycle. Once you have identified these things, stay away from them, if at all possible.You might need to throw away your scale, toss out fashion or beauty magazines, unsubscribe from pro-mia websites or forums, and spend less time with friends or family members who regularly bad-mouth their bodies or obsess about dieting.

Exercise for an improved mood.,
Change your thoughts about dieting and weight.,
Reestablish a sense of self-worth unrelated to your body.,
Focus on self-compassion.",How to Cope With Bulimia4," Regular physical activity boasts many known benefits like greater immune functioning, improve cognitive functioning, better attention and concentration, reduce stress, boost self-esteem, and enhance mood . Some research has shown that healthy amounts of exercise can, too, be beneficial for those recovering from eating disorders, and even prevent eating disorders.Be sure to talk to your treatment team before starting an exercise regimen. For the non-purging type of bulimia, exercise may be inadvisable if it is used to work off post-binge calories. Work with your doctors to determine if exercise is a good choice for you., Having dysfunctional thoughts about your body and a negative relationship with food are two of the largest contributors to bulimia nervosa. Overcoming these thinking patterns is necessary for recovery.Instead of falling into these negative thinking patterns, try to change your responses and be kind to yourself like you would be with a friend. By changing your responses, you may start to view yourself with more compassion. Common thinking errors affecting those with eating disorders include:Jumping to conclusions: ""Today was hard; I will never overcome this eating disorder."" Expecting the worse can be destructive to all the positive changes you are making. Instead say something like this ""Today was hard, but I got through. I only need to take it one day at a time.""
Black and white thinking: ""I ate junk food today. I'm a total failure."" Thinking in extremes and believing that things are either completely right or wrong can quickly prompt a binge, if you're not careful. Instead, try telling yourself, “I ate junk food today, but that's okay. I can enjoy junk food once in a while and still eat healthfully. I will have a healthy dinner tonight.”
Personalization: ""My friends don't want to hang out with me anymore because I'm too health-conscious."" Reading into others' behavior and taking it personally is unfair to them. Your friends may just be busy or want to give you space to heal. If you miss them, reach out and say so.
Overgeneralization: ""I always need help."" Applying a negative pattern to your life is self-defeating. You can probably come up with tons of things you can do with out help. Try that now.
Shoulds, coulds, woulds, musts, have tos: ""I have to be the one with the best form in practice today."" Such rigid thinking is irrational and limiting. Even if you do not have the best form, it does not discount that your form is still great.

, It's time to rethink your belief that your worth is connected to your body shape, size, or weight. Stop tearing yourself down and build yourself up by connecting your self-worth to other characteristics.


Dig deep and look for other non-body or appearance related things that you like about yourself. List out your very best qualities.For example, you might say because ""I am smart"" or ""I am a fast-runner"" or ""I am a good friend"".
If you have trouble thinking of ideas, enlist your best friends or close family to help. Ask them to give you a few things they like about you that are unrelated to appearance.

, Over the past weeks, months, or years you have been unkind to yourself. Replace this neglect with an abundance of self-love and compassion.Give yourself a hug. Watch your favorite movie or read your favorite book. Swap out negative self-talk with positive statements about yourself. Be nice to your body by getting a massage, a facial, or a manicure. Wear clothes that you feel comfortable in and that fit you - don't hide beneath your clothing. Be gentle and nurturing by treating yourself as you would your best friend.

, Inpatient treatment involves living at a residential facility, where you can receive more serious help. This may involve doctors monitoring your nutrition levels, individual and group therapy, and psychiatric medication.


This may be especially important if you are severely malnourished and underweight.

, Out-patient care is less intense than in-patient. It involves visiting a clinic but living on your own or with family. Here are some of the benefits of out-patient treatment:


If you're in the early stages of anorexia, you can get help without compromising your independence.
You can still attend school and receive support from living with your family.
The cost is much lower for out-patient care than in-patient care.

, Although anorexia has psychological components, nutrition is equally important. In fact, some research suggests that people need to recover from malnutrition before they can fully recover from anorexia.A dietitian can help you learn about what your body needs and get you on the right track.

, Psychiatric medication can help deal with the symptoms of anorexia on a day to day basis. Antidepressants can keep your mood up and prevent you from falling into depression over the issues. Anti-anxiety medications can help you from worrying too much and engaging in compulsive behaviors.These may be especially useful if you have co-occurring anxiety or depression, which is common for many people with an eating disorder."

, Many people with eating disorders are tempted to isolate themselves from the people in their lives, usually because of the strongly held belief that there is something wrong with them.As tempting as coping via isolation may be, you should avoid it at all costs. Isolation will only make the problem worse. Allowing family and friends to be there for you is one of the keys to recovery.

, Unfortunately, there are websites out there dedicated to the spread of anorexia and other eating disorders. These websites advocate anorexia and bulimia as lifestyles.

They may be able to support you in tough times.
Refrain from telling people who will not understand, make you feel bad about yourself, or encourage you to participate in unhealthy behavior.
When you finally tell your friends, start by saying, ""I have an eating disorder. I want you to know because I trust you and want to be myself around you.""

, If you have been doing well with your eating disorder recovery, you want to make sure you keep up with your progress. You may think that you are doing okay and not realize that you are accidentally falling into unhealthy habits until it’s too late. Consider setting up regular check-ins with counselors, dietitians, or health care professionals. This can help you notice any changes before they become too serious.For example, you may be eating enough calories, only exercising during your PE class, studying, and socializing with your new group of friends. You may be limiting your portions in the dining hall and not purging. However, your weight or health may be fluctuating without you knowing.
Stress can cause health changes that may negatively affect you.
Setting up regular check-ins with your treatment team, or a local counseling center, can help you stay healthy and on a regular routine.
Any weight and health changes may cause a relapse, which can lead to severe negative consequences.

Be kind to yourself.,
View each bite as a fresh start.,
Distract yourself with another activity.,
View the urge as a wave, and instead of giving in, “surf” it.,
Ask yourself what bingeing will accomplish.,
Seek help from a third party.,
Read the success stories of others who have struggled with BED.,
Understand that there is no quick fix.,
Don’t punish yourself.",How to Control Binge Eating1," If you are struggling with the urge to binge, or if you have already begun and are trying to stop, take a moment right now to acknowledge that you are doing something good for yourself by trying to stop. Instead of feeling angry at yourself or engaging in negative self talk, allow yourself a moment to feel proud for wanting to take control of binge eating.


Part of being kind to yourself means stopping negative self talk. During a binge your mind may be racing with negative thoughts. Rather than telling those thoughts to “go away” or trying to ignore them, try to counter those thoughts with positive ones — for example, “I am strong enough to admit this is a problem” or, “I was kind to that telemarketer earlier” (if this is true, you are much stronger than most people).;
, You don’t need to wait for a new day to make a fresh start. Start fresh now. Maybe you’re already several bites in. Maybe it feels as though you can’t stop once you’ve started, but you can. Try to view each bite as a separate decision: you are deciding to take a bite, but this does not have to become a full-out binge.


You may feel like you might as well go on and just try harder next time, but this is actually a great time to practise being kinder to yourself, and to show yourself that you can stop.

, Do yoga, dance, lift weights, go for a run. The Internet is full of fun yoga, dance, and exercise videos. If you’re unable to do physical exercise, do something creative. Write, draw, do crafts, build something. Turn on you favourite album and sing along. Call someone who you enjoy talking to.

, Leslie Anderson, PhD, calls this “urge surfing” in which the urge is compared to a wave: “it goes up, up, up, and at some point it starts to go back down.” You don’t need to give in to make the wave go down. It will eventually end even if you don’t give in., The answer will likely be nothing, beyond making you feel sick and sad.If you feel emotionally able to do so, you might even try to explore why you are bingeing. Perhaps you are experiencing work or personal stress, or maybe you spent the day looking for a new bathing suit and hating what you saw in the mirror.
It could be useful to write your thoughts in a journal. It doesn’t have to be a long entry — try for three pages, no matter the size of the journal.

You don't have to wait until tomorrow to try again. Choose to be healthy now.


Ten minutes after that choice you’re bingeing again? That’s okay. Choose to be healthy again. The more you practise this, the stronger you’ll get.

, The worst thing you can do after bingeing is to punish yourself with excessive exercise or starvation the day after. Eat regular meals. Eat because it nourishes you. Exercise because it makes you feel good. You don’t deserve to suffer.

You should think about your eating habits, your triggers, and your eating routines as you decide where to live.Most colleges offer dorm living. You may also have the option of living off-campus or in campus apartments, or even living in a sorority or fraternity house. Decide how each of these will impact your eating routine and management.
Dorms usually don't have an easy way to cook your own meals, but you can eat at the dining hall or in the student center. Off-campus living allows you to be able to cook your own meals, but it may be easy to skip meals, purge, or binge eat.

To cope, you can tell your friends that talking about those things triggers your eating disorder and you would appreciate it if they did not talk about it around you. You may distance yourself from these friends and spend time with friends who don't do things that trigger you.
For those things you can’t avoid, like class, exams, or people, you should figure out how to cope with those things. For example, you may come up with a semester organizational plan to help you manage your time, or interact with people in small groups at campus activities instead of parties.

, Just because you have an eating disorder doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy your college experience. You should enjoy yourself by making friends, trying new things, and participating in activities.

Many dining hall meal plans gives you open access to all dining hall food. If you are struggling with overeating or a food addiction, this may be too much for you. You may do better with putting money on your card so you can choose what food you want and be charged for those items, which limits how much you eat.

Focus on your positive characteristics.,
Don’t isolate yourself.,
Seek healthy activity.,
Avoid letting the media get to you.,
Deal with a relapse.",How to Cope with an Eating Disorder in College4," Don’t place all your worth in your appearance.

Make a list of your positive attributes. This may be your sense of humor, your intelligence, or your caring nature. List things you are good at, like sewing, painting, or photography.

, One of the worst things you can do with your eating disorder in college is to isolate yourself. It may be easy for you to just go to class and not interact with others. This may lead to skipping meals or binge eating in private, along with obsessive exercise behavior like hours in the gym. Join campus activities, make friends, or study in the student center. Go to the dining hall and sit with people from one of your classes.
If you find that you are isolating yourself, go to a support group.

, Many people with eating disorders exercise obsessively, and college offers that opportunity. It may be easy for you to spend hours in the gym without anyone noticing. However, try to avoid isolating behaviors.For example, use your walk between classes as daily activity.
Take a physical education class. Choose an activity that you’ve never tried, like dance or tennis.
Join an intramural sports team.

, The media has a negative effect on those with eating disorders because they present an unrealistic version of the way a body should look. Work on accepting that the people you see on television, in the movies, and in the news are not realistic. Don’t hold yourself to those same standards.


Remember that many women and men in magazines have been photoshopped or photographed in certain ways to make them look “perfect.” What you see isn’t always the truth of what the person looks like.

, If you have started to relapse, you should try to figure out what has caused the relapse. Is it school stresses? Did you just have a big exam or paper due? Is it due to social pressures? Figuring out what has caused a relapse can help you deal with or remove the source, and then get back on track. A small relapse is not the end of the world. Face your relapse, try to fix any problems that caused it, and then get back on your routine.
Try not to stress too much about relapsing because that could cause additional, unneeded stress.
Relapses can happen during eating disorder recovery. It doesn’t mean you are a failure or that you will never be better. Everyone has trouble from time to time. If you relapse, try to learn from it. Think about what you could have done differently and how you can more positively react to the same situation in the future.
Remember that you should take your recovery one step at a time.

Canned lentils, chickpeas (etc) these are fantastic as they don't need soaking like many dried beans but can be used right from the can.

, This might be to freeze portions for a quick lunch to reheat which is a great time saver, particularly if you just cook for yourself.

, Quite often the best thing is to be inventive - if you find some fantastic produce in the stores, then you can always change menu plans to include those.


Avoid buying meat. This might sound obvious, but if you are only occasionally vegetarian, having a freezer containing some meat products means they have to be used, or thrown away if they cannot be given away. This simply means you are more inclined to cook non vegetarian meals if meat products are there. Its also common habit for many vegetarians who occasionally eat meat to occasionally buy meat when it is on special as it is cheaper, which means it is always there. This may or may not be within your planned diet guidelines, but if you don't buy it, its almost certain that you won't use it.

,


With the internet, many restaurants and hotels have their menu online which makes the job a lot easier, but you can also phone in advance to making a booking to find out what can the kitchen do for you and your guests. Vegetarians can be infamously difficult to cater for as most mainstream kitchen teams are not always trained to specialise in vegetarian cuisine. As vegetarians naturally also wish for something a little more special than they can cook at home, research is the key to an enjoyable evening at a restaurant.

, Some examples might be spinach and ricotta cannelloni, hearty salads, stir-fries, pasta bakes, vegetable bakes and soups. Its always easier to prepare one menu rather than two types each time. Some TVP (textured vegetable protein) manufacturers offer very good vegetarian sausages, burgers and mince products and the quality of convenience meals or lunch bar offerings are increasingly better.

, Be inventive and have fun!

A therapist can help you address what is causing you to feel anxious, stressed, sad, etc., and help you learn healthy ways to cope with those emotions.
Bring your food diary to your appointment so you can share any insights with your therapist. It may be helpful for her to look over the diary as well, as she may be able to spot some patterns or triggers you were not aware of.;
, Emotional eaters often hide their emotions and turn to food to feel better.Learning healthy ways to deal with negative emotions can have an impact on overeating — though you may feel your issue is that you have no control over how much you eat, the underlying issue is likely that you feel you feel powerless over your emotions.When you begin to feel anger, sadness, or another uncomfortable emotion, find a healthy way to express or deal with that emotion. Call a close friend, start a journal or pick up a paintbrush — do something constructive that you know leaves you feeling better, not worse.If your feelings of anger or sadness are from a past hurt, it may help to address them in the following ways:


Writing letters to those who have hurt you. You don't have to send the letters. But the act of pouring out your anger or sadness on paper can oftentimes help relieve stress.Making amends with yourself. Stand in front of a mirror and forgive yourself for anything hurtful you've done. Any self-loathing you're carrying needs to be addressed and expressed to begin the healing process., Avoid reaching for your favorite comfort foods when stressed. Identify when you're feeling overwhelmed and find other ways to let off steam. Some of these stress-relieving techniques can help:Taking a short stroll. Even a quick 15 minute walk can help release feel-good endorphins in your brain, helping the stress slip away.
Playing with your pet. Spend time lavishing love on your pooch in order to release oxytocin, the so-called cuddle chemical that boosts your sense of well being.

Breathing exercises. If your head is swimming with thoughts, take a moment to focus on something as simple as your breath. Refocusing on the moment through breathing exercises or meditation has been scientifically proven to alleviate stress and anxiety.Doing yoga.
Learning to meditate. Meditation is a stress-buster that can typically be done anywhere.

, Frequently asking yourself “Am I full?” can sometimes immediately put things into perspective. Oftentimes, we mindlessly eat without paying attention to what our body is trying to tell us. Over eaters typically keep consuming long after their stomachs are full. But they ignore the messages they bodies are sending.It may be helpful for you rate your hunger level on a scale of one to 10, with one being so hungry you feel dizzy, weak or starving and 10 being full to the point you feel sick. Five represents feeling satisfied — neither hungry nor full.Eat when your hunger is at a three or four, and try to avoid ever hitting a one or two.
Stop eating when you hit a five or six — either satisfied, or a ""pleasantly full.""Stop a quarter way through your meal and ask yourself: ""Am I still hungry?"" If you are, continue eating. Then stop again when you are halfway through and ask: ""Am I still hungry?"" Remember, you don't have to clean your plate., Many people overeat out of sheer boredom. If you feel like you have too much time on your hands, get out of the house.Find a hobby. Volunteer to help others. Go see a movie (just steer clear of the concession stand). Call a friend or take a walk and explore your neighborhood. There are numerous ways to occupy your mind that don’t involve reaching for sugary snacks.

, Binge eating involves consuming food very quickly. Slowing down and taking time to focus on the food itself, however, (how it tastes, temperature, etc.) can sometimes help calm the craving to overeat.This type of mindful eating has become a well-known technique for easing over consumption, touted by physicians, celebrities and chefs alike.Don't eat while standing up or in the car or when you're trying to do something else. Sit down for your meals. Try to avoid situations in which you feel you must ""scarf down"" your food.
Stop and put your fork down between each bite.Fully chew your food and swallow before picking up your fork again.Allow yourself to feel the texture of the food and notice its flavor and smell., It is possible that you are not eating in response to stress or any other emotion — you may simply be overeating because you are too distracted to listen to your body's signals. Avoid distractions while eating — turn off the tv and computer, put down your book — and focus on your plate and how your body feels. Researchers have discovered that eating while watching tv routinely leads to the consumption of fewer fruits and vegetables and more fast food, sodas and unhealthy snacks., We are creatures of habit. Using a different plate or sitting in a another place besides your usual spot might give you that extra boost of alertness you need to stop eating at the right time. As one registered dietitian notes, small things like altering the time you eat and reducing the size of your dinner plate can add up to big changes over time., Get up and get moving. The mood-enhancing effects of exercise are well documented.Exercise can reduce stress hormones and can boost your energy and mood.Aim for 20-30 minutes of moderate exercise every day. Some useful, uplifting forms of exercise include:


Yoga
Swimming
Hiking

, You can’t eat what isn’t there. And now that you've been keeping a food diary and know the foods you tend to you binge on, take this knowledge with you to the grocery store. If you lose yourself in cookies and chips, two of the most common trigger foods, make sure and avoid the prepackaged sweets and snacks aisles.


Stick to the perimeter of the grocery store. Cookies, chips, soda, and other unhealthy snacks are usually found in the aisles of grocery stores, while you'll find things like produce, fresh meat, and sea food around around the perimeter of the store.

, Resist the urge to pull into your favorite drive-through on the way home from work. The pressures of the day could cause you to impulsively order large quantities of high fat, sugary treats. If your willpower is still slipping and you find yourself sitting in line anyway, consider ordering a healthier salad or low-calorie menu item instead of your usual non-nutritious fare., There may be setbacks, and that's okay. Years' worth of bad habits won't be broken overnight. Try to be patient with yourself and treat yourself with kindness and forgiveness.

, Being overwhelmed by shame, anger and sadness only creates a vicious cycle that leads to more overeating.Some constructive ways to express your disappointment that don't include bingeing again include:


Saying goodbye to the past. Everything you've done is now in the past. Remind yourself that the past cannot be changed but the future can. All you can do is learn from your mistakes and move forward.
Figuring out where you went off track. Thinking and writing about what last led you astray (trigger foods, feeling a particular emotion, etc.) can help ease your guilt and bring your focus back to recovery.
Setting positive reminders. Help dissipate shame by creating tools to do better in the future. Use an app or set up calendar reminders on your computer to pop up positive messages to yourself.

, It’s tough to go it alone. Finding like-minded people can be crucial to the recovery process. There are several national organizations with state and local chapter meetings you can attend. Or, if can't wait and need to speak with someone immediately, reach out and connect with others online in a chat room or join a forum or message board. Here are some recommended resources:

, Ignorance is not always bliss. Writing down everything you eat can be an eye-opening experience, as most people tend to underestimate how much they consume.In addition, recording when you eat could help you identify trouble spots, certain times of the day when you are most likely to over consume. Or, a food diary could quickly highlight which foods you binge on most often.


When making an entry in your food diary, you should include the time you ate, what you ate, and how much. In addition, you should record what you were doing at the time, your mood, and your environment.Carry a pen and paper or use your phone to record your food intake. Don't rely on your memory — remember, most people underestimate how much they eat, and you will be more likely to do so when you are relying on your memory. You might also forget little snacks (the handful of candy from the bowl on someone's desk) or the bite of cake from your friend's plate (these all count).
Make sure you accurately record your portion sizes and things like salad dressings.
You can see a sample of a food diary here.

, By recording additional details in your food diary, such as your mood or environment, you can begin to uncover patterns and triggers for overeating.For instance, you may notice that you overeat when you feel stressed or sad, or when you are at your parents' house, or after you talk to your older sibling. This is considered stress eating or emotional eating.


Other things to look out for include waiting too long between meals (which may cause you to overeat when you finally do eat), and eating while on-the-go (like in the car or while standing and trying to do other things) or in front of the TV or computer (people tend to eat more when they are distracted and not focused on their meal).Notice the effects of smelling or seeing food. Maybe your diary will reveal that you can't help but stop for a treat when you walk past that amazing-smelling bakery on your way home. Even if you weren't even hungry before, the smell of fresh-baked bread got your stomach rumbling.

, Your food diary may reveal that you are eating to cope with difficult emotions or even just boredom. Do you reach for food each time you feel sad, stressed, angry, anxious, lonely, bored, or tired?Instead of dealing with an uncomfortable feeling, you may be trying to squash it by eating. Unfortunately, eating does not address whatever made you experience that uncomfortable feeling so, though you may feel better in the moment, the emotion will inevitably return.Stress causes your body to release cortisol, also known as the ""stress hormone,"" which can trigger your ""fight or flight"" response. This response may increase appetite, making your body crave comfort foods (usually laden with sugar and quick energy) to fuel your fight or flight.If you experience chronic stress from things like school, your job, family, or environment, you may be at higher risk to become a regular emotional eater., It may be hard at first to identify when you are actually hungry and when you want to eat because you have been triggered. Before you reach for that cookie or bag of chips, consider the following:Did the feeling of hunger come on suddenly? Physical hunger is gradual, while emotional hunger is sudden and intense.
Do you feel like you have to eat immediately? Physical hunger can usually wait. When you are hungry in response to an emotion, you will feel that you need to eat right now.
Do you only want one specific thing? If you feel open to lots of different food options, you are probably experiencing physical hunger. But if you are fixated on one particular food, you are probably feeling emotional hunger.
Do you eat beyond a feeling of fullness? If you eat until your stomach is full but still don't feel satisfied, you are probably eating emotionally and not to satisfy a physical hunger. Physical hunger stops when you are full.
Do you feel guilt, shame, powerless, or embarrassed? If you experience any of these feelings after eating, it is likely you are eating to try and meet an emotional need, not to satiate a physical hunger.

, Overeating or emotional eating does not mean you have a binge eating disorder (BED). BED is a common eating disorder. It is considered a severe, life-threatening disorder, but it is also treatable.BED can only be diagnosed by a healthcare provider, so make sure you discuss it with your doctor if you suspect you may have BED. Signs of BED include:Eating much more rapidly than normal, and eating more during a specific time period (usually less than two hours) than most people would eat during that time.
Feeling out of control when eating.
Eating in private because you feel ashamed by how much you are consuming.
Eating excessive amounts of food when you are not hungry.
Feeling ashamed, guilty, depressed, or disgusted by how much you are eating.
Lack of purging following binges, meaning you don't compensate for overeating by throwing up or overexercising.
Engaging in this type of eating at least once a week for three months.
Be aware that body weight is not necessarily connected to BED. Your body weight may be normal, or you may have mild, moderate, or severe obesity. It is important to remember that not everyone who is overweight binges or has BED.

Explain to your family and friends the reasons why you have decided to go vegan.,
Be polite and respond simply with parents who do not understand your choice.,
Try not to react defensively or with irritation when siblings tease you about your choice.,
Be strong and calm in other situations outside the home.,
Cook up a storm.,
Ask your parents and other family members to become actively involved in learning more.",How to Deal with Resistance from Family and Friends When You Become a Vegan (for Teens)," Do this calmly and with good facts supporting your defense. You don't want to argue or ram things down their throats but you do want to make it clear that you've done the research and that you are serious about your choice. In particular, get the low-down on health and veganism - this is most likely to worry parents and cause them to react in less-than-helpful ways.;
, For example, if your parents are serving dinner and they ask you if you'd like some chicken, milk, or salmon in a ""hint, hint"" way, thereby ignoring that you have told them already about your choice, simply decline. Do not whine, argue or leave the table in a huff. In merely declining, there are no strings attached.

, There is a difference between defending yourself calmly and acting defensively and rising to bite at every morsel of teasing offered to you. If siblings make fun of you and tease you with meat and other non-vegan products, you have many options. You can ignore the jibes and eventually the fun will disappear for them. You could respond by explaining that it is just a personal choice; if you say this simply, end it there. If you want to bore them, go into great details in a sort of monologue that they will be anxious to escape from. Anything you do, the goal is to get them to stop and to begin respecting you. If you have supportive parents, ask them to assist you in calming teasing siblings. Overall, a family that has respect for each other should not find it difficult to be respectful in this situation.

, If people try to anger, irritate or tease you at school, work or elsewhere about your veganism, including taunting you by saying that meat, dairy, and fish tastes so good and that you don't know what you're missing out on, you can also choose to just ignore them or you can discuss the merits of being vegan with them. It also helps to have one or two famous vegans to quote as proof of healthy vegans, for example, Moby of music fame or Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress. Wikipedia has a list of famous vegans you can learn by heart. It also helps to find famous sports people who thrive on a vegan diet, such as tri-athlete Brendan Frazier or Ed Templeton, professional skateboarder.

, If you want to impress the omnivores, give them some delicious vegan food. Not only will it prove that vegan food's all right, it'll also help to build a shared sense of understanding and enjoyment. People rarely knock back a meal or snack that has been made with love, care and attention. And one of the age-old tricks of many a vegetarian and vegan is not to reveal the ingredients until after the compliments. That way, it's a little harder for the naysayers to take back their enjoyment! Always make good use of flavors, spices and herbs when cooking for non-converts as it is taste that you are seeking to convince about here.

, If they are teasing you because they feel personally threatened by your choice or because they really fear for your health, ask for one night of their time to talk through the issues of being vegan. Use reputable websites that have information about teens and vegan diets to assist you to present your information. Perhaps do this after the meal that you have made in the step just before. Some websites are listed below. There are also some excellent feature films, documentaries and videos that your family may be willing to watch with you to get a better understanding of some of the issues involved (for example, Forks Over Knives, Earthlings or the Intelligence Squared debate that recently took place in Australia, entitled ""Should Meat Be Off the Menu?"").

Make half your plate a fruit or a vegetable.",How to Eat a Flexitarian Diet," The best part of a flexitarian diet is that you have full control over what animal products you eat and how often. But to help you follow a more structured pattern, you'll need to define moderation of animal products.Flexitarian eating patterns vary greatly. You may only eat meat or other animal products occasionally or you may eat them once a week.
Set a specific goal for yourself and your eating pattern. This will make following a flexitarian diet much easier. For example, you can set a goal like: I will include dairy products regularly and eat meat (like red meat or poultry) only twice per week.
Set specific days to go meatless. It might also be helpful to set specific days to go meatless. You can try meatless Mondays, for example.
Choose what animal products you want to include. Everyone has different preferences on what foods to include in their flexitarian diet. This again, is a decision you'll need to make. Consider whether or not dairy, eggs, or seafood will be included and how often.;
, One good trick to making this diet style feel more naturally enjoyable (instead of restricted) is by adding foods to your diet. You may be more successful this way instead of restricting a bunch of different foods.The more you restrict yourself and the more foods you don't allow, the more difficult a specific diet can be.
Instead of ruling out a bunch of different meats, dairy products, eggs or fish that you cannot eat, consider adding different types of proteins or other foods to your diet.
For example, instead of saying you won't eat beef again, say that you'll eat beef once a month and focus mainly on adding more seafood and vegetarian protein sources to your diet.

, With any new type of diet or eating pattern, it can be difficult to figure out what exactly you're supposed to eat or cook everyday. Give yourself some ideas by looking up great recipes that are flexitarian.


Consider doing some research online for flexitarian recipes. You might find some great ideas of traditional dishes that use vegetarian or vegan protein sources instead.
For example, you might find a recipe for mushroom stroganoff instead of beef stroganoff.
You may also want to consider getting some cooking magazines or cookbooks that offer some guidance on flexitarian eating and cooking.

, To go along with your goal setting and moderation, you may want to write up a meal plan. This can help put your goals into practice and allow you to follow a flexitarian diet a little more easily.


To help you stick to your goal, write up a meal plan for a week. Planning in advance can help you see what days you'll be including meat or other animal products and what days you need to stick to more vegetarian based meals.
Make sure to include all breakfast, lunches, dinners and snacks that you plan on eating for a week.
Meal plans help you stay on track, help you eat foods that you actually have at home and can help you save a little money.Plan what days or meals that you're going to be eating only vegetarian or vegan items and what days you'll include some of your animal proteins.

, If you haven't tried a vegetarian or vegan diet before, it may be a little easier to transition with meat substitutes.These foods are meant to replace certain meats so you don't miss their animal-based counterparts as much.


Many meat substitutes that you can find include: burgers, hot dogs, sausages, bacon, cheeses, chicken nuggets, chicken strips, and even ground beef.
You can find meat substitutes at your local grocery store. Many can be found in the produce section but also can be found in the freezer aisle of your store.
These are a great place to start with meatless meals. You can replace your normal Friday night burgers with veggie burgers instead.

, If you've thought about transitioning to a vegetarian or vegan diet before, you may have heard of items like tofu, tempeh, or seitan. They're great replacements for meat in many recipes.


Both tempeh and tofu are made from fermented soybeans. Tofu is a little more spongy and soft while tempeh is much more firm and chewy.
Both are very high in protein and do well in recipes as they absorb flavors of marinades and can be cooked in a wide variety of ways.Seitan may be a little less common. It's made from wheat gluten and has a similar texture to meat. It also is high in protein and is great cooked a variety of ways., If you're not a huge fan of tofu or tempeh, you can always add in more legumes to your diet. These fiber-rich foods are also high in protein and can be a great base for a vegetarian meal.


Legumes are a group of plant-based foods that are high in protein.They include items like nuts, beans and lentils. In addition, there are many types of each of these legumes.
Beans and lentils are particularly high in fiber. They're great served warm or cold as well. Served in a soup, salad or in a main dish, both beans and lentils are great options for vegetarian protein.
Nuts aren't usually cooked, but they're still a great source of protein. You can toss them into salads, on your yogurt or oatmeal, or use nut butters on whole grain bread.

, If you think it'll be hard to eat meals that are only vegetarian or vegan, you may want to make each meal flexitarian.


Try including both vegetarian or vegan proteins in addition to animal proteins in each meal or snack.For example, serve yourself half of a portion of animal-based protein and 1/2 a portion of a vegetarian protein.
Serving both allows you to enjoy the best of both worlds, but also forces you to eat a little less of the animal-based proteins.

, If one of the reasons you want to follow a flexitarian like eating pattern is because you crave meat, you might be able to manage those cravings. Serving the right types of foods can help you manage those meat cravings and stick to a flexitarian style diet more easily.Some flavors are called umami. This means they're savory and rich (unlike the other tastes of sweet, bitter, or sour).
Umami is a newer taste that has been discovered in a very specific group of foods. However, this taste can help satisfy those cravings for savory, rich meat products.
Umami is found in the following foods: tomatoes, miso, mushrooms, parmesan cheese, and soy sauce. Cooking with these foods can help satisfy cravings.

, Regardless of what type of diet or eating pattern you follow, it's important to follow a balanced diet. Flexitarian diets are easy to keep balanced since they will include a large variety of foods.


One of the main foods you want to eat adequate amounts of and have a large variety of is protein. Include servings from the legumes group, occasionally meat or poultry group, shellfish, tofu or tempeh, and meat substitute group.
Also include a food from every food group each day. Include fruits, vegetables, dairy (if you're including this in your diet), and whole grains. This helps keep your diet balanced.Vary your choices from other food groups. Choose a wide variety of grains, fruits, and vegetables. This helps ensure you're eating a wide variety of nutrients.

, When you do choose animal-based protein foods, it's important to try to include mostly lean proteins. These are low in calories and can help you meet your daily protein needs.


One benefit of vegetarian or vegan protein sources (like tofu or beans), is that these foods are naturally low in fat and calories but also high in fiber. They're very nutrient dense foods.Animal proteins - like poultry, beef, eggs, seafood or dairy - can be higher in calories and fat. In addition, some of these fats (like saturated fats) are not good for your body.
Choosing lean protein sources is your best option. They're low in saturated fats, calories and still high in protein. Try white-meat chicken, turkey, eggs, low fat dairy, unprocessed pork, seafood, and lean cuts of beef.
Regardless of what type of protein you do choose, make sure to measure out the appropriate portion. Stick to 1/2 cup or 3-4 oz per serving., The grains food group is another important food group when following a flexitarian diet. They can help provide additional nutrients and keep your diet balanced.


If you choose to include grains in your diet, try to choose 100% whole grains. These foods are less processed and are higher in fiber.
Whole grains also contain some protein. In fact, when combined with a vegetarian protein source (like beans, nuts or lentils), they make a complete protein and provide your body will all the essential nutrients it needs.Try whole grains like: quinoa, oats, brown rice, millet, farro, whole wheat bread, or whole wheat pasta.
Also measure your portions of grains. Measure out about 1/2 cup of cooked grains or about 2 oz.

, When you're following a flexitarian diet, it's very important to emphasize fruits and vegetables. These foods are really what make a flexitarian diet nutritious.


Fruits and vegetables are always going to be vegetarian or vegan so they fit in seamlessly to your diet. In addition, they provide the bulk of your fiber, vitamin, and antioxidant needs everyday.
Health professionals recommend that you aim for at least 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables everyday. Meeting this guideline helps ensure you're getting a wide variety of nutrients.Measure out the appropriate servings of these foods. Go for 1/2 cup of fruit or 1 small piece, 1 cup of vegetables, or 2 cups of leafy greens per serving.

You and your baby can get plenty of nutrition from a vegetarian diet, but your doctor may have special suggestions on getting the right balance of nutrients from your food choices.If you are a pescatarian, or eat fish on occasion, you may need to limit the types of fish you eat.For instance, you'll need to avoid the big, predatory fish like tuna and mackerel. The smaller the fish, the less mercury it will have, so choose fish like sardines and anchovies.Also avoid soft cheeses like brie and blue cheese, as these are made from unpasteurized milk. A soft cheese made with pasteurized milk is safe. Also, do not drink ""raw"" milk, which is milk that is not pasteurized.;
, Women who are pregnant have special dietary needs, and if you are a pregnant vegetarian, you will need to adjust your diet even more to keep you and your unborn baby healthy. Consult a registered dietician to discuss your specific dietary needs and how you can best get all of the vitamins and nutrients necessary to maintain your health.


Vegetarian women may lack important vitamins and minerals such as calcium, iron, Vitamin B12, and essential fatty acids. This deficit can become more acute if you are a pregnant vegetarian. A registered dietician may help you develop an eating plan that ensures you and your baby get sufficient nutrients., With your doctor or dietician, develop a sensible vegetarian meal plan that will sustain you and your baby throughout pregnancy. Keeping a food diary can help you keep track of the types of food you’re eating and ensure that you’re getting a varied range of essential nutrients.


Be sure to show your food diary to your doctor or dietician.

, As a pregnant woman, you need to make sure you are eating the proper nutrients to sustain your pregnancy. By eating a healthy, well-balanced diet you can help ensure that you and your unborn baby get the necessary vitamins and minerals from a vegetarian diet.


In addition to your regular calorie intake, you will need to factor in extra calories for sustaining your pregnancy. The first trimester you will not require extra calories. The second trimester you will need about 340 extra calories per day. The third trimester you need about 450 extra calories/day.Choose healthy and nutrient-dense foods such as: proteins, including nuts; iron-rich foods, like dark green leafy vegetables; and dairy products, like yogurt or cheese for calcium., As a vegetarian, fruits and vegetables are likely the cornerstone of your diet. Fruits and vegetables contain many important nutrients for you and your baby including Vitamin C and folic acid.Get at least two to four servings of fruit and four or more servings of vegetables daily.Eat vegetables such as broccoli, kale, sweet potatoes, and spinach to help you get iron, calcium, and Vitamin C.Eat fruits such as oranges and strawberries for Vitamin C. Prunes and dried apricots are a good source of iron.You also want to make sure you get Vitamin A in your diet from sources like carrots, beets, apricots, cantaloupe, or sweet potatoes.Fruits and vegetables will supply you fiber, which can help keep you regular during pregnancy.Make sure to not eat unwashed fruits or vegetables, which can expose you and your unborn baby to toxoplasmosis (as can cleaning out a cat litter box, so make sure someone else has that job)., The primary source of energy for pregnant women is found in breads and grains. Getting enough breads and grains every day will help you keep up your energy and can also provide additional nutrients such as iron.Eat six to 11 servings of breads and grains daily.Choose breads and grains that are fortified with iron, Vitamin B, fiber and protein.Make sure that at least half of your bread and grain consumption is from whole grains such as brown rice. Products that list whole grains, such as whole wheat flour, as their first ingredient are your best choice.You can get your daily servings of breads and grains from foods such as brown or wild rice, whole grain cereals or pastas, and whole grain toast or English muffins., Protein is an important nutrient for any pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters.While traditional sources of protein such as meat are off limits for vegetarians, you can still get enough protein to sustain your pregnancy and growing baby.


You should get three to four servings of bean or soy products and an additional one to two servings of nuts and seeds for protein.You can get protein from a wide variety of different foods including: nuts and nut butters such as almonds or peanut butter, soy products, tofu, quinoa, or legumes like lima beans.If you eat eggs, they are an excellent source of protein.If you are a pescatarian, be careful when consuming seafood or fish. Limit your cooked fish intake to 8 – 12 oz. per week and your canned intake to 6 oz. per week.Avoid tuna steaks, swordfish, mackerel, shark or any other fish with high mercury levels.If you eat sushi, ease up on the kind with raw fish, especially tuna.

, Calcium is essential for sustaining a pregnancy and helping your baby grow. Eating foods such as cheese, yogurt, and even ice cream can help ensure you get the recommended servings of dairy for a healthy pregnancy.You need at least four servings of calcium-rich foods per day.Combining calcium-rich foods with those rich in Vitamin D will help your body absorb calcium best.You can get calcium from a wide range of foods including dairy products like cheese, milk, or yogurt; leafy green vegetables such as spinach; dried beans or peas; and tofu.Sources of Vitamin D are fortified milk and eggs, if you eat them., Make sure to eat foods that are high in folic acid. Deficiencies in this nutrient can cause neural tube defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly.You can get folic acid from foods such as dark leafy-green vegetables and legumes including lima beans, black beans, and chickpeas., Consider writing daily meal plans to help ensure that you’re getting enough nutrients. Having this overview of your eating plan can help you and your doctor identify any deficiencies in your diet.


For example, for breakfast one day you might have a steel cut oatmeal cooked in one cup of milk. You can top the oatmeal with 2 cups of fresh strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. You could add two pieces of whole wheat toast topped with mashed avocado instead of butter for added nutrition.
For a mid-morning snack, have a cup of Greek yogurt with one cup of fresh fruit and some high-protein nuts such as almonds.
For lunch, you can have a large salad with a variety of vegetables such as kale, spinach, carrots, tomatoes, beets, steamed broccoli, and yellow or red peppers. Add some tofu or kidney beans for protein and some feta cheese for protein and calcium.
For a mid-afternoon snack, have cut vegetables such as carrots, zucchini, or cocktail tomatoes and a whole wheat pita with hummus. You can add some string cheese for added calcium or a hard boiled egg for extra protein.
For dinner, have fish or another protein such as a tofu steak soaked in tamari sauce. Have a large salad and a mixed medley of steamed vegetables. If you want or need another grain, make yourself a small side of whole wheat pasta or some whole wheat bread topped with low-sugar jam, real butter, or a half an avocado.
For dessert, you can “splurge” on some ice cream or a fruit tart.

, Even if you are consuming a healthy vegetarian diet, your body may need additional nutrients to support your pregnancy. Taking a prenatal vitamin every day can help you get additional nutrients you may need and might not be getting through food.


During pregnancy, the body is designed to put your child’s nutritional needs before yours.
Try to get as many nutrients as possible from healthy and whole foods.
Make sure to speak to your doctor before taking prenatal vitamins or ask them to prescribe some for you.

, It’s important to make sure that you’re drinking plenty of liquids while pregnant. You need enough liquid to avoid dehydration and support your pregnancy, and drinking enough every day will help you stay healthy.


You should drink around 13 cups (3 liters) of water a day to stay hydrated and sustain your pregnancy.Water is the best choice for your needs, but you can also drink non-caffeinated tea, and juices. Clear, non-caffeinated soft drinks such as ginger ale may help with nausea.
You may consume coffee or caffeinated teas and soft drinks in limited quantities. The recommended level of caffeine that is safe is equal to less than 3 cups (750 ml) of coffee.Consult with your doctor to make sure it’s safe to consume any of these beverages.

, You want to make sure that you and your unborn baby get plenty of nutrients and don’t feel sick. Avoiding empty calories such as junk food or foods that can cause digestive issues such as heartburn can help both you and your unborn baby.


Try to avoid unhealthy calories such as those found in sweets and junk food including potato chips, cookies, cakes, or fried foods.
You might want to avoid any foods that can cause digestive issues for you or your unborn baby, including spicy foods, eggs, wheat, corn, or peanuts.You may recognize foods that cause digestive issues for you because you feel unwell, have bloating or gas, indigestion, and heartburn after eating certain foods.You may recognize foods that cause digestive issues for your unborn baby because it may react to certain foods with increased activity in your stomach., It’s advisable to avoid all alcohol and tobacco while you’re pregnant. Using these substances can be potentially harmful to you and your unborn baby.


There is plenty of evidence about the risk of alcohol consumption for pregnant women, so consider avoiding alcohol altogether while you’re pregnant.Tobacco use can put unborn child at risk for conditions such as low-birth weight and respiratory diseases.If you smoke while pregnant, speak to your doctor about possible treatment options to help you quit and keep yourself and baby healthy."

Decide if you need outpatient treatment.,
Decide if you need intensive outpatient treatment.,
Determine if you need inpatient treatment.,
Find a treatment center based on your specific eating disorder.,
Consider the length of treatment you require.,
Consider how you will pay for treatment.",How to Choose an Eating Disorder Treatment Center1," Outpatient treatment centers is a treatment option where you visit the center to receive treatment, but return home that same day. Outpatient treatment centers provide flexible options for people, and are generally cheaper.Outpatient centers are good for those who have a job they want to continue doing, a job that fulfills them, or a job they are still able to complete.
This option is helpful for early or less serious illnesses.
You might choose this option because you need to be at home, or you have a strong family and friend support system.;
, The next level after outpatient services is a more intense and structured outpatient service. You may do Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) or Day Treatment, which is partially hospitalization treatment.An IOP treatment generally lasts three hours a few days a week. You get therapy, nutrition counseling, along with supported meals.
Day Treatment consists of treatment for six or more hours a few days a week. Day Treatment may also be done seven days a week. During this treatment, patients eat meals under supervision. This may be an option after being released from an inpatient treatment center.

, Residential, inpatient treatment is a treatment option where you go to stay at a treatment center for an extended period of time. Residential care is beneficial for people who have been battling with an eating disorder for a long time. Inpatient treatment centers are also effective for those who may self-harm or have a substance abuse problem.Inpatient treatment centers help remove the stress of daily life so you can focus on healing and recovery.These treatment centers are helpful if you feel you are unable to heal on your own. It might also help if you don’t have a support system.
Inpatient treatment centers are helpful for people who have already been through treatment once. Inpatient treatment facilities also offer personalized care around the clock., Eating disorders cover a wide range of conditions, the two most common being anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Some eating disorder centers treat both conditions while others may be specifically for anorexia or bulimia.If you don’t know what eating disorder you have, talk to your doctor to determine if you are anorexic, bulimic, or have a different form of eating disorder.
People with anorexia generally restrict the food they eat or refrain from eating at all, therefore causing themselves to be extremely thin. People with bulimia often binge eat and then either vomit, fast, use laxatives, engage in extreme exercise, or a combination. Both conditions result in fear of gaining weight and an extreme dislike of how their bodies look.

, Residential recovery treatment centers require an extended stay on site for patients. The length of stay depends on your symptoms and your financial limitations. Most residential treatment centers require a minimum of a 28-day stay.Month long programs range from 28 to 30 days. These help you learn about how to deal with your eating disorder, get counseling, and learn proper nutrition. Many of these programs are covered by insurance.
60- or 90-day programs may be needed for more severe cases. Some people may need up to six months in a center. You may be able to determine an individualized duration of treatment based on your needs., Eating disorder treatment centers can range from a few thousand dollars for a month to upwards of $50,000. You should investigate how much the treatment program will cost you before deciding on a program. After learning the cost, explore payment options.Insurance plans may cover the treatment. Contact your insurance provider to discuss if they cover an eating disorder treatment, and if they do, how much they will cover.
You may be able to check into public insurance from the state or federal government to help pay for your treatment. Discuss this option with the eating disorder center and a public insurance agency. You may also check into private or group insurance programs.Some eating disorder centers offer financing for qualifying patients. Discuss this option with the clinic to see if this is an option for you.
You may have to consider private loans or loans from friends and family, or use your savings to finance the treatment stay.

Consume adequate amounts of protein daily.,
Combine the right types of foods.,
Eat 100% whole grains.,
Eat a variety of nuts and legumes.,
Include plant-based proteins that are complete proteins.,
Consume a variety of legumes and grains throughout the day.,
Design a meal plan.",How to Combine Food to Make Complete Protein1," In general, women need to consume around 46 g daily and men need to consume around 56 g daily.Keep track of your protein intake throughout the day. You can use a journal or food tracker app on your phone to see how much more you need to eat as you progress through the day.
Some people may need more protein than others. If you're performing moderate to intense exercise for more than 45 minutes daily or trying to lose weight, the total amount of protein you should consume maybe be greater. ;
, Combining certain plant-based proteins will give you a complete protein.Aim to consume a variety of whole grains, nuts and legumes – these foods together will provide all the essential amino acids your body needs to make a complete protein.


Combine legumes and whole grains for a complete protein. Examples include: rice and beans, lentils and barley, bulgur with beans or peanut butter on 100% whole wheat bread.
Combing legumes with nuts and seeds also provides a complete protein.

, Whole grains provide an essential component to preparing complete proteins. Include a variety of whole grains each week to ensure you're eating a diverse diet. Eating 100% whole grains increases your chances of getting complete proteins in your diet.


Whole grains are unprocessed and contain all the parts of the grain – the germ, endosperm and bran. They are typically higher in nutrients like fiber and protein compared to processed grains like white flour or white rice.Examples of whole grains include: oats or oatmeal, 100% whole wheat pasta, bulgur, buckwheat, millet, quinoa or brown rice.

, Other key food groups that make up complete protein are legumes and nuts. Again, choose a variety to eat each week.


Examples of legumes include: beans, lentils, peanuts and peas. Examples of nuts/seeds includes: walnuts, almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, pistachios or pecans.
Nuts are also a great source of healthy fats. This is important to consider especially if you're following a vegetarian or vegan diet and have a limited intake of some healthy fats., There are a few plant-based proteins that are already considered a complete protein. Soy, quinoa, hemp seeds or buckwheat are great sources of complete proteins.Keep cooked quinoa or buckwheat in your refrigerator or freezer for a quick grain side dish or the base of your main dish.
Hemp seeds can be added to smoothies, sprinkled on salads or added to your morning yogurt. They also are a good source of healthy fats., It was once thought that you needed to consume a whole grain and legume at each meal in order to benefit from a complete protein. Studies have now shown that as you long as you consume both foods throughout the day, your body will be able to obtain all the amino acids needed.Food journals, apps or meal plans can help you see how you can include a variety of plant-based proteins throughout the day. Keep track to make sure you include a wide variety of proteins.
Legumes are a cornerstone of a vegetarian or vegan diet due to the lack of animal proteins consumed.

, A well-thought-out meal plan will help make sure you're eating a healthful, protein rich diet each day. When food choices are limited, you need to take extra care to ensure you are not falling short. This is especially useful if you're busy and don't have time to consider each protein source you consume each day.


Take an hour or two during your free time and develop a weekly meal plan. Make sure you account for complete proteins and include a wide variety of plant-based proteins each day.
Write up the corresponding grocery list to your meal plan so you have a list ready-to-go and you buy only what you need in the store.

Read up on which foods contain FODMAPs and which do not.,
Select low-fructose fruits.,
Supplement your diet with low-FODMAP veggies.,
Choose gluten-free products.,
Get your fats from nuts and oils.,
Select the right sweeteners for your food.,
Flavor your meals with fresh herbs.",How to Choose Low FODMAP Foods As a Vegetarian1," Before starting a low-FODMAP diet, acquaint yourself with which kinds of foods are likely to contain FODMAPs and which are good dietary choices.

You might start by consulting a general information sheet, like this one: https://med.virginia.edu/ginutrition/wp-content/uploads/sites/199/2014/04/Low-FODMAP-Diet_10_28_14.pdf

FODMAPs are sugars, including fructose, lactose, and sugar alcohols (sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, and moltitol). They tend to occur in certain types of fruits and vegetables, juices, honey, processed foods, sweeteners, and certain types of medications, like cough drops and cough syrups.
If you are a vegetarian and wish to cut FODMAPs from your diet, you should speak to a dietitian to ensure that you are getting the nutrients you need.;
, Many berries, citrus, melons, and some tropical fruits are low in fructose and therefore low FODMAP foods. Try to limit your servings of fruit to ½ cup per meal, even low-FODMAP fruit. When opting for fresh fruit, choose from the following:Bananas, kiwis, pineapple, and papaya
Blueberries, cranberries, raspberries, and strawberries
Cantaloupe and honeydew melons
Clementines, tangelos, grapefruit, lemons, limes, and oranges
Grapes and rhubarb

, Though not all vegetables are appropriate for a low-FODMAP diet, there are lots of tasty and nutritious vegetables you can eat. Regularly alternate which vegetables you eat so you have a balanced diet, and include some of these in most of your meals:Alfalfa and lettuce
Bamboo shoots, bok choy, and seaweed
Carrots, spinach, and tomatoes
Chives, leeks, and scallions
Parsnips and potatoes
Cucumber, yellow squash, zucchini, and eggplant
Green beans
Red and orange bell peppers
Pickles and radishes

, Gluten is not a FODMAP, but it’s often found in high FODMAP foods. Gluten is a protein that naturally occurs in wheat, which is also high in FODMAPs. Gluten-free options are widely available in many grocery stores and restaurants, so when possible choose gluten-free products to minimize your exposure to wheat.You can also select white or brown rice, corn chips and corn tortillas, millet, quinoa, cornmeal, and polenta.Stay away from high-FODMAP grains and grain-alternatives like barley, couscous, lentils, inulin, and rye.

, Since you don’t eat meat, you need to get your “good fats” from somewhere. Replace meat with low-FODMAP options like olive oil, nuts, and seeds. Mayonnaise, though higher in fat, is another appropriate choice.The exceptions are pistachios and cashews, which are high-FODMAP nuts.

, Splenda, Aspartame, and – in small amounts – sugar and maple syrup are low-FODMAP options to sweeten your food. Choose these over high-FODMAP sweeteners like honey, molasses, and high-fructose corn syrup.Check the ingredients lists on products you buy – many products contain high-fructose corn syrup.

Splenda and aspartame are artificial sweeteners that may pose health risks. When possible, sweeten your food with natural ingredients or avoid sweeteners altogether.Check ingredients lists and avoid sweeteners ending in “ol” like xylitol or sorbitol. Stay away from isomalt, at well.

, Add some extra nutrients to your meals with flavorful herbs. Choose low-FODMAP options like basil, coriander/cilantro, mint, marjoram, oregano, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, paprika, ginger, cumin, and rosemary.For instance, try gluten-free pasta with tomatoes, spinach, and pesto sauce!

Include plenty of dark leafy greens.,
Look for foods also rich in protein.,
Buy iron-fortified foods.,
Build your meals around soy-based meat substitutes.,
Eat at least five portions of fruits and vegetables each day.,
Check the iron content of foods before you eat them.,
Include foods rich in Vitamin C. Vitamin C significantly increases your body's absorption of iron.,
Eat potatoes and grains.",How to Choose Non‐Meat Sources of Iron1," Dark green leafy vegetables, such as kale and spinach, actually provide more iron per calorie than meats do. If you have a healthy serving of leafy greens at every meal, you typically can get sufficient iron from non-meat sources.A spinach or kale salad is a good way to incorporate these iron-rich vegetables into each meal.
You also might consider mixing them with other vegetables for variety, or munch on spinach or kale chips as an iron-rich snack between meals.;
, Many of the non-meat sources of iron also are sources of protein. If you're getting enough protein in your vegetarian or vegan diet, you're likely also getting enough iron.Peas and broccoli are two vegetables that are rich in both protein and iron.
Apart from vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds, and grains also are high in both protein and iron.
Don't just think in terms of what you eat. Drinking a glass of soy milk with every meal also gives you an additional boost of protein and iron.
Have a handful of almonds as a snack, or mix almonds and dried fruit into a morning bowl of oatmeal.

, Many breakfast cereals and oatmeals have iron added. This can be a way to get additional iron into your diet, particularly if you don't find the idea of leafy vegetables at breakfast very appealing.If you're following a vegan or gluten-free diet, read the labels carefully to make sure there aren't ingredients in the cereal or oatmeal you buy that might conflict with your dietary restrictions.
Use soy milk if you aren't consuming dairy products, which will provide an additional boost of protein and iron.

, Soy is one of the best substitutes for meat, as it includes many of the same nutrients that you would otherwise get from meat and poultry. Many soy products even can be made to taste something like meat depending on the seasonings used.You'll find many soy-based food products, such as soy burgers, that are designed to mimic common meat preparations.
Because soy is so versatile, it can be relatively easy to incorporate it into every meal. This can help ensure that you're getting the protein and iron that your body needs despite a vegan or vegetarian diet.

, You typically need to eat more fruits and vegetables to get the requisite amounts of iron and protein than if you were eating meat. Include a variety of fruits and vegetables with every meal.It may be better for you to eat a smaller meal every two or three hours than to have three larger meals each day. This makes it easier for you to include enough variety and make sure you're getting enough nutrients and that they're being absorbed properly.
A single portion of any fruit or vegetable is 80 grams (roughly 3 ounces) – about the same amount as would fit in your palm.
Keep in mind that fruits and vegetables also are good sources of fiber, which will improve your digestion.

, For foods with nutritional labels or even those without, you might consider looking up the iron content of what you eat to ensure that you are getting enough iron. For example:


One cup of cooked lentils has 36% of your daily iron intake.
Broccoli has 3% of your iron intake per cup.
Peas have 11% of your iron intake per cup.
Soy milk has 8% of your iron intake per cup.
One eggs has 3% of your iron intake.

, For best results, you should eat your iron-rich foods along with other foods that are rich in Vitamin C.For example, you might have a kale or spinach salad that includes almonds and orange slices.
A fruit smoothie made with fresh fruits and soy milk also is a good way to combine Vitamin C and iron.
Keep in mind that you also can take a Vitamin C supplement to enhance your body's absorption of iron from your food. Unlike iron supplements, there are very few risks associated with Vitamin C supplements.

, Potatoes and grains are good sources of iron, and also are a good source of other nutrients important to iron absorption. The starches and healthy carbohydrates will keep you full and give you steady energy throughout the day.Typically you want starches to make up 50% of your diet. You can easily accomplish this by including a slice of whole-wheat toast with your breakfast, and whole wheat pasta, potatoes, or beans with other meals.
If you're on a gluten-free diet, be sure to check labels and make sure the grains you're getting meet your dietary restrictions. Oats typically are gluten-free and will provide the starches and carbs you need.

Get the basic nutritional needs.,
Read the label.,
Ask them what they like.,
Buy simple ingredients.",How to Buy Food for Vegetarians,"

Proteins: Sources include, beans, legumes, nuts and grains. Dairy and egg products can also be a good source of protein. Quinoa is a complete protein, meaning it has all 8 amino acids the body needs. Other sources like beans and lentils can be paired with brown rice to make complete protein.



 


Meat Substitutes: Tofu, textured vegetable protein, tempeh, seitan and other soy-based meat substitutes are available and can be used in place of the meat in some common omnivorous recipes. Using the same spices and seasonings used on a meat-based dish is an easy way to mimic the intended flavor of the original dish.
Vitamin D: Vitamin D is commonly found in meat and other animal products and often needs to be supplemented in a vegetarian diet. Vitamin D fortified tofu, soy milk and basic cow's milk are all good sources.
Calcium: Calcium can be derived from cow's milk and cheese, but if he or she abstains from these--or prefers other sources--there are calcium fortified milk alternatives available. These include rice milk, almond milk and coconut milk. In addition, nuts and seeds such as sesame seeds are high in calcium.






Iron: Iron is commonly found in meat and is essential to good health. Sources include potatoes, spinach, tofu, watermelon, pinto beans and cashews. You should consume more vitamin C to increase the absorption of iron. Oranges and other citrus fruits can provide you with adequate amounts.
Vitamin B12: This vitamin is essential to healthy brain function and is mainly derived from animal products. Dairy products provide adequate amounts and additional sources include nutritional yeast and fortified milk alternatives.
Omega fatty-acids: Vegetarians commonly have lower fat intake than meat eaters, unless cheese and milk are a large portion of their diets. Omega fatty-acids are essential to healthy joints and brain function. Fish are traditional sources of this type of fat, but are not usually included in a vegetarian diet. Flax seeds, flax oil and walnuts can be incorporated into a recipe to provide adequate amounts of omega fatty-acids.;
,


It is essential to read the label on processed food when buying food for a vegetarian.
Many packaged foods include things like chicken broth and other meat products that might otherwise look entirely vegetarian.

,


It might be best to ask what the person prefers to eat. It is common for vegetarians to be aware of what they should and should not eat.
Make sure you are aware of their dietary restrictions. Ask if they eat fish, drink milk or eat eggs.
There are many types of vegetarians who do it for health, ethics or both. Be sure to learn as much about the person as you can.

,


Simple ideas for breakfast and snacks are bananas, apples, oranges, grapes, avocados, spinach, kale, carrots, crackers, hummus, chips and salsa.
These simple foods provide a vegetarian with adequate nutrition and are easy to prepare.

Eat a protein snack immediately after exercising.,
Consider adding a protein or meal-replacement drink.,
Include at least 10 grams of protein in your post-exercise meal.,
Follow a 4:1 or 5:1 ratio of carbohydrates to protein.,
Eat carbs during extended workouts.,
Have a carbohydrate snack within 30 minutes of exercising.,
Include at least 100 grams of carbohydrate in your post-exercise meal.,
Choose carbohydrate sources that are relatively low in fiber.,
Drink water throughout your workout.,
Include sufficient fluids with your meal.,
Consider a fluid-replacement drink.",How to Choose Vegetarian Post‐Exercise Meals," As soon as possible after your workout ends, you should eat a snack or drink a protein shake that contains at least 15 to 25 grams of protein to aid your body's recovery.Consuming enough protein is essential if you want to continue to work out at the same intensity over successive days.
Keep in mind that as you exercise, you actually are creating micro-tears in your muscles. Protein is essential for rebuilding your muscles after any amount of exercise.
If you are a lacto-ovo vegetarian, a hardboiled egg or a cup of plain yogurt can be a good protein snack after exercising.
However, if you're a vegan or do not consume dairy products, you may need to go with a protein bar or soy product to get the protein you need. A handful of almonds, edamame, or roasted chickpeas are all high-protein snacks that are easy to pack in your gym bag.;
, Particularly if you're body building or engaging in intense strength training, your body may need more protein more quickly than you can get it from food.Protein contains amino acids that your body can't produce itself, and that are essential to rebuild your muscles after exercise – particularly relatively intense exercise.
Protein powder made from whey or milk protein is the best source of complete protein.
However, if you are a vegan who does not consume dairy products, you will have to get your protein from a soy source.

, Sufficient complete proteins are essential for your post-exercise meals. Unfortunately, plant-based protein sources don't always include all the amino acids you need for muscle development.Soy and quinoa are perhaps the most common of the few plant-based protein sources that provide a complete source of protein to help repair and rebuild your muscles.
One of the simplest vegetarian post-exercise meals is a stir fry with pasta, tofu, and plenty of vegetables.
Include beans, lentils, and spinach for iron. Combine them with peppers or broccoli to enhance your body's absorption of the iron.
Broccoli also is a good source of calcium, which you need for strong bones as you recover from exercise.
Generally speaking, this meal should be the largest meal you eat all day – particularly if you're doing intense exercise such as body building or marathon running.

, Generally, you should consume four to five times more carbohydrates than protein after you exercise. For example, if you are eating four grams of protein, you should have 20 grams of carbs.As a general rule of thumb, you should generally eat around 15 to 30 grams of carbs after exercising.
To doublecheck that your meal provides this ratio, you can divide the number of carbs by the grams of protein. It should equal four or five.
Thai, Mexican, or Ethiopian food generally provide this ratio, and typically includes vegetarian options.
If you're making your own stir fry or other meal, keep in mind that 4 ounces of tofu has about 9 grams of protein. Therefore, if you needed 20 grams of protein in your post-exercise meal, you would need between 8 and 10 ounces of tofu, along with other whole foods.

, If you're participating in endurance sports such as long-distance running or biking, you should include a carbohydrate snack at some point in the middle of your workout.Consuming carbohydrates while exercising can increase both the length of time you can perform, and the intensity at which you can exercise. Between 30 and 90 grams of carbohydrates per hour while exercising can delay fatigue.
If you're a marathon runner or biker, you might try gels, which are concentrated carbohydrates. Check the ingredient labels to ensure they are plant-based rather than animal-based.
An energy bar or similar snack also can provide the carbohydrates your body needs. As with gels, check the ingredient labels carefully to make sure they fit within your diet.
Bananas also are good sources of carbohydrates and are easily portable. One banana has approximately 30 grams of carbohydrates, along with additional nutrients such as potassium that prevent cramps and fatigue in working muscles.

, Eating something rich in carbohydrates as soon as possible after exercising will give your body the energy it needs to rebuild muscles and recover.Peanut butter toast, chocolate milk, banana and peanut butter, or crackers and cheese are all great snacks to eat after a workout.
Following a more casual or low-intensity workout, a meal-replacement drink or a piece of fruit should be sufficient to provide you with the carbohydrates your body needs.
If you choose packaged recovery bars or drinks, check the ingredient labels and nutrition information carefully.
Your snack should contain around 30 grams of carbohydrates. You'll want to increase this amount if your exercise is of a longer duration or higher intensity.

, Within two hours of the end of your workout, prepare a meal with whole foods that are high in carbohydrates, including vegetables and pasta or rice.Check ingredient and nutrition labels to plan food combinations and portion sizes that will provide the amount of carbohydrates you need.
Choose foods with complex carbohydrates, such as rice and pasta. These carbohydrate forms are best for recovery, particularly after intense exercise.
If you're in heavy training or are participating in endurance sports, plan on consuming additional carbohydrate snacks every two to four hours following your meal.

, Vegetarian diets typically are also high in fiber. Unfortunately, if you eat foods with too much fiber as part of your post-exercise meal, your body may not absorb enough nutrients before the food leaves your body.Some of the foods you generally should avoid in your post-exercise meals may be foods that you're accustomed to eating regularly, such as raw fruits and vegetables or whole wheat bread.
Balance high carbs with low fiber by including white rice in your meal, rather than pasta or whole grains.

, Regardless of the level of intensity of your exercise, steadily replenishing the fluids you lose during your workout is one of the most important things you can do.Try to drink at least a half-cup of water every 10 minutes you exercise. You need up to 2 cups if you're exercising outside in a hot environment.
Consistent fluid retention is essential to ensure that your body can regulate its temperature correctly. This is another reason drinking a lot of water is important if you're exercising outside.
Adequate hydration also helps maintain adequate circulation, and can help prevent cramps and other injuries, as well as fatigue.

, Fluid replacement doesn't end when your workout ends. Fluid-rich foods such as oranges keep your body hydrated so it can recover efficiently after your workout.When you're choosing foods for snacks or meals, avoid those such as bread that absorb fluid. You also want to avoid sugars and caffeine, which can dehydrate you.
After your workout, continue to drink at least a cup of water every half hour or so to ensure your body remains well hydrated as it recovers.

, If you're engaging in body building or other intensive exercise, a sports drink may be a better choice for you to replace fluids during and after exercise than plain water.This is also true if you are exercising outside in a hot or humid environment. Heat and humidity impact your body's ability to retain water and cause you to lose fluids faster than they can be replaced by water.
However, many sports drinks include sodium that promotes water retention, which will help your body retain necessary fluids despite the weather.
If you're doing a brief, low-impact workout, sports drinks aren't necessary. Plain water should meet your hydration needs just fine.

Look at the allergen list underneath the ingredient label. If it says contains milk or dairy or made in a facility that also processes milk or dairy, this product most likely has dairy included in it or may have been contaminated with dairy products it was produced with.
Note that ""lactose-free"" doesn't mean dairy-free. Only eat a product if it specifically doesn't have dairy listed in the ingredients and says ""dairy-free.""
Look at the front-of-pack labeling for wording like ""dairy-free"" or ""made without milk."" Many vegan, vegetarian or allergy-friendly foods will have these call-outs on their foods to help consumers find dairy-free items.
Also review the ingredient list. This is important when looking for very specific ingredients. It's typically found on the back or side of an item near the nutrition fact panel. If you see any of the following ingredients, your item does contain dairy: milk (and foods made with milk like butter, cheese or yogurt), casein or caseinates, galactose, hydrolysates, lactose, lactate solids, whey, nougat, pudding and lactalbumin.;
, Whenever you're looking to avoid foods with a certain ingredient, making them from scratch at home is a great idea. You control exactly what goes into the foods and you can be confident that your homemade snacks do not contain dairy foods.To start, make a list of your favorite snacks — include foods you get from a vending machine, cafeteria, coffee shop or gas station. This will help you figure out what items you may want to consider making at home.
If you're unsure on how to make a dairy-free version of some of your favorite snacks, consider looking up vegan or ""dairy-free"" recipes of those items. There are many cookbooks and recipes online that you use to make tasty dairy-free versions of your favorite foods.
Some examples of foods you can make from scratch that are dairy-free include: pudding, snack cakes or quick breads or chocolates or candy.

, An easy way to cut out a big source of dairy from snack foods is to avoid snacking on items typically associated with the dairy food group — like cheese or milk.


The dairy food group isn't as wide or diverse as some others (like the vegetable food group). Stay away from foods that obviously contain dairy, like: milk, yogurt, cheese, cottage cheese and butter.
You can choose to avoid these foods all together and not find a substitute for them, or you can look for dairy-free cheeses, milks, or yogurts so you can enjoy these foods without worrying about consuming any form of dairy or milk.

, You might find some snacks that seem to have no identifiable sources of dairy. However, be careful as many snack foods do contain some more processed ingredients that contain dairy or other compounds found in dairy.


Some uncommon sources of dairy products include: Natural flavoring, artificial flavoring, high protein flour, lactic acid, “non-dairy” products (may contain casein), rice cheese and soy cheese.These types of additives are usually found in more processed foods and snack foods. For example, items like cookies or candy may have artificial flavorings.
Even if you're looking at vegetarian or vegan cheese, you may be surprised to find that soy and rice cheeses may actually contain some dairy components.
Be very thorough in your reading of the food label to ensure that you're not consuming dairy in the form of these uncommon additives and foods.

, If you need to avoid a particular food or food group, it's a good idea to speak to a Registered Dietitian. They will be able to teach you how to avoid the food or ingredient and make safe replacements in your diet.


Whenever you're avoiding an entire food group like dairy, it's important to find out what nutrients are common in dairy and how to replace them in your diet. A dietitian will help you find other foods that are high in calcium or Vitamin D so that you can be sure you're getting adequate amounts of these essential nutrients in your diet.
Your dietitian will also review with you how to read a food label and ingredient list so that you feel comfortable shopping for the appropriate type of snack foods.
You may also want to ask your dietitian if he or she could help you come up with a dairy-free meal plan and recipes so that you can enjoy a well-balanced and nutritious diet.

, Many dairy-based snacks are sweet — like ice cream or yogurt. Swap in a dairy alternative for a satisfying and enjoyable sweet treat. Whether its chocolate, candy, ice cream or even a yogurt, dairy is found in many sweetened treats and snacks. Try to avoid these items as they all contain dairy and dairy products.


Easy dairy-free swaps include: vegan chocolate and candies, soy or coconut based yogurts, dairy-free sorbets or sherbets or coconut or soy based ice creams.
Make dairy-free sweet treats from home as well. You can try: trail mix with dried fruit, a smoothie made with almond or soy milk and fruit, dairy-free yogurts topped with dried or fresh fruit, homemade peanut butter cups with vegan chocolate and peanut butter or chocolate pudding made with avocados and vegan chocolate.

, Outside the sweet arena, there are those salty, crunchy snacks that you may crave in the afternoon or late at night. Although many of these items (like popcorn or nuts) are naturally dairy-free, its important to be mindful of what you purchase and consume.


Some easy snacks that are naturally dairy-free include: raw veggies and hummus, celery and peanut or almond butter, roasted nuts and dried fruit, roasted soybeans or chickpeas, kale chips, and homemade granola.
If you need to purchase some quick snacks to have that are dairy-free try: fruit and nut bars, dairy-free cheese slices for deli meat and cheese roll ups, fruit and cheese or cheese and crackers and dairy-free yogurts.

, One of the nutrients most commonly found in dairy foods and snacks is calcium. If you're choosing dairy-free snack foods, make sure your diet is still providing adequate calcium.


Calcium is an essential mineral in your body. It plays an important role in muscle contraction and the formation and maintenance of your bones.If you're unable to get enough calcium in your diet, your body starts to take the stored calcium found in your bones and puts it into your bloodstream for proper muscle function.
If you're not going to consume dairy-based snack foods, find other foods that can provide adequate calcium like: fortified orange juice or soy milk, dark greens (like spinach or kale), chia seeds, almonds and broccoli.For snacks, try having a glass of orange juice fortified with calcium, making a smoothie with soy milk, dark greens, and fruit, having a handful of almonds or a nut and seed trail mix or even having a small salad made from dark greens.

, Vitamin D is another important nutrient that's found in fairly high quantities in dairy foods (especially milk). This nutrient is hard to find in other foods, so be on the lookout for Vitamin-D rich foods.


Vitamin D is an essential vitamin in your diet. It plays an important role in the function of your immune system, the health of your bones, and the function of your muscles.If you're avoiding dairy containing snacks, find Vitamin D in other foods like: fortified juices (like orange juice), fatty fish like salmon or tuna, eggs, and fortified cereals.
To make a vitamin D rich snack, try: 1/2 cup of tuna salad with whole grain crackers, a handful of fortified cereal or 1-2 hard boiled eggs.

, Besides vitamins and minerals, dairy foods are also a big source of protein in many people's diets. Although it's typically not difficult to consume adequate protein, make sure you're eating other sources of protein-rich foods.


Protein is an essential macronutrient in your diet. Your body needs relatively large amounts of it everyday. It plays an important role in the formation of enzymes, hormones and messenger chemicals, provides structure and support of all cells, supports your lean muscle mass and provides your body with a source of energy.While there are many other foods that can provide adequate protein, try to stick to leaner sources of protein. These are naturally lower in calories and fat and will support a well-balanced and nutritious diet.Other foods high in protein include: lean beef, pork, poultry, eggs, seafood, beans, lentils, nuts and tofu.
Some of these foods like eggs and fatty fish also contain other important nutrients (like Vitamin D) that are found in dairy foods. These are great to use as the basis of your snacks.

, If you're avoiding dairy-containing snack foods, but are having difficulty meeting your recommended nutritional guidelines (like your calcium or Vitamin D intake), you may want to consider taking some vitamins.


Discuss this diet with your doctor and determine if and how often you should have your nutritional laboratory values tested. For example, Vitamin D because it is common for people to be deficient in Vitamin D.
Although vitamins do not necessarily improve your health, they're a great back up if your diet doesn't provide adequate amounts of vitamins or minerals.Consider taking a calcium plus Vitamin D supplement. Depending on your age or gender, you may need about 1000-1200 mg of calcium daily.Vitamin D is often paired with your calcium supplements. However, aim to get about 800 IU of Vitamin D daily.Another great option is a multivitamin. It contains calcium, vitamin D and many other essential nutrients. Taking one daily is generally safe for most healthy adults."

Decide if you want a gender-specific program.,
Determine if you need treatment with special considerations.,
Determine how far the center is from your home.,
Decide if you want a faith-based center.",How to Choose an Eating Disorder Treatment Center2," There are different kinds of treatment centers you can check into. If you don’t feel comfortable facing your eating disorder and treating it in a co-ed situation, consider finding a gender-specific program.If you are a woman and want a female-only program, or you are a man who wants a male-only program, you can search for a program that caters to your needs.
According to the National Eating Disorders Association, gay and bisexual men face higher pressure to be thin, which leads to a higher risk of eating disorders. If you are a gay or bisexual man and would feel safer in a LGBT-friendly center, there are many centers that specialize in LGBT issues in addition to eating disorders.
Transgender people often have a higher risk for eating disorders.If you are a transgender man or woman, you can search for centers that specialize in LGBT issues as well as eating disorders. Trans Folx Fighting Eating Disorders is a good resource to check out for support and help finding a center.

, Some people who suffer from eating disorders may have specific treatment considerations. Knowing these considerations can help you find a center that is geared more specifically towards you and your needs.For example, if the treatment is for a child, teen, or adolescent, then a center that focuses on adolescent eating disorders needs to be chosen. Treatment for adolescents differs than, for instance, a woman who has been hiding an eating disorder for a decade.
Some centers help women with eating disorders who are pregnant. These centers aim to help keep the mother and baby healthy.
Eating disorders associated with weight loss surgery is a very specific problem since it is tied to obesity. Treating an eating disorder connected to a weight loss surgery requires expertise in that area.
Having diabetes and an eating disorder requires certain medical precautions. Knowledge of how to approach diabetes and eating disorders is pivotal for staying healthy and receiving proper care.
Athletes face certain struggles that need to be addressed. For an athlete with an eating disorder, coaches and trainers may be part of the treatment process.

, The location of the treatment center should be considered when choosing an eating disorder center. Some treatment centers may be in your town, others may be in nearby major cities, while others may be in a different place altogether. Figure out what is best for you and your situation before you choose.Many eating disorder treatment programs require a family therapy component. If this is something you need, you may want to choose a center closer to home and your family.
Think about whether you want to receive treatment close to your home. Some people may feel uncomfortable going to a center close by.
If you want to go to a treatment center in a specific geographical area, like in the desert, the woods, or at the beach, consider that when making your choice.

, Some centers are more specialized than others. For example, there are rehabs based around faith, spiritual, or religious beliefs. If this is something you believe will help you, talk to your spiritual leaders, search online, or discuss your beliefs with the centers you are considering.For example, you may be able to find a Christian, Jewish, or Islamic rehab program.
Some centers may have a blanket spiritual approach, but are willing to tailor the treatment program to your personal religious beliefs."

, If it is possible, you should visit the center and take a tour of it before deciding to get treated there. While touring the facility, look around the grounds and decide if it looks like a comforting, warm environment. Ask yourself if you would be comfortable there during your recovery.Look around the area and decide if this is where you want to stay. There are treatment centers in different geographic locations, such as mountains, desert, the beach, or a serene environment. Make sure the environment is somewhere you feel happy and comfortable.Meet with the doctors and other staff at the facility. Discuss their education, their experience, and their qualifications. Talk to them about how they approach treatment and recovery.
Discuss success rates with those you meet with.

, Part of the treatment of eating disorders is changing negative behaviors and learning how to deal with triggers and difficult situations after the treatment. Centers should use evidence-based behavioral treatments, like cognitive behavioral therapy, in their treatment program.


Though going through therapy to discuss the causes of the eating disorder may be therapeutic or insightful, it should only be a minor part of the treatment., Aftercare programs an integral and important part of the treatment and recovery process. Aftercare programs are geared towards providing support and help to patients after their stay in a residential center has ended.Aftercare programs may include a therapist or group therapy after you leave, telephone therapy or access to a support network via the telephone, or contact from the center.Studies have shown that patients have a greater success rate if provided with an aftercare program.

Consume meat products occasionally.,
Purchase resources about complete proteins.,
Talk with vegetarian or vegan friends or family members.",How to Combine Food to Make Complete Protein2," Dairy products and eggs are both considered complete proteins. If you are a vegetarian and consume these types of animal products, they are an easy way to add healthful complete protein to your diet and significantly improve your overall protein consumption.


Incorporate a wide variety of dairy products – cheese, yogurt, milk and cottage cheese are all fairly high in protein. Plus they contain other beneficial nutrients like calcium and potassium.Eggs are not only a great source of complete protein, but also contain healthy fats and essential minerals to your diet. Try eggs for breakfast or hard boil a few for a quick afternoon snack., Tofu, tempeh and even seitan are also considered complete proteins. They are slightly less processed than meat substitutes but make for a satisfying, protein-rich option.Tofu, tempeh and seitan can be daunting to prepare. Research recipes and tips online or in cookbooks for how to cook these unique ingredients.
Try multiple recipes that use tofu or tempeh. You may not like it at first, but after you try it prepared a few different ways, you may find a few recipes you enjoy.

, Many companies sell meat substitutes made with TVP (textured vegetable protein). Items can include hotdogs, deli meat, cheese, burgers, chicken nuggets and even bacon.


Sample a few meat substitutes. There are a variety of brands and they can be a quick and easy meat replacement.
Remember, these foods are generally highly processed in order to resemble and taste like meat. If you're trying to avoid processed foods or are maintaining a whole foods diet, it would be better to minimize these types of products in your diet.

, Not everyone has the time for a complete meal with adequate protein. Protein supplements come in the form of protein bars and shakes and can add adequate amounts of protein to your diet (especially if you're in a pinch).Choose a supplement that has an adequate amount of protein. Most bars should have at least 10 g of protein while most protein shakes should have at least 15-20 g of protein.There are hundreds of brands of protein supplements.

If so, cut the food out again. If not, feel free to reincorporate it into your diet.Add in a single food for 2 days. Wait a few days before adding in another new food.For example, try eating yogurt for a couple days in a row, and see if any symptoms develop.
Don’t try to reintroduce more than one food at a time – e.g., if you are trying out yogurt, don’t try to reintroduce wheat bread at the same time. If symptoms do develop, this will make it impossible to tell which food is causing the problem.

, Keep track of how your stomach feels with a food diary. Record what food you add or remove from your diet, if you experience symptoms, what symptoms you have (bloating, gas, pain, etc.), or if your symptoms improve. This can help you keep track of the changes you make and know which benefit you.You can also download an app to use for this purpose.

Check labels carefully.,
Avoid eating before taking your supplement.,
Have your iron levels monitored.",How to Choose Non‐Meat Sources of Iron2," Although you don't need a prescription to buy iron supplements, it can be hazardous to your health to consume too much iron. Your doctor or health care provider will be able to tell you how many iron supplement pills you should take each day, and give you instructions on when and how to take them.Even if you're trying to choose non-meat sources of iron, you should be able to consume enough iron through food in most cases. However, if you are anemic or have other medical conditions that decrease your iron levels, you may need a supplement.
Have your doctor check your iron levels before you start taking a supplement to make sure a supplement would be of benefit to you. Your doctor may recommend dietary changes rather than simply taking a supplement.

, Your doctor may recommend a particular brand of dietary supplement, or you may be on your own. Read the label to determine what is included in the supplement and how much iron each pill contains.Most adults need between 60 and 120 milligrams of iron each day. Your doctor will tell you how much you should take in supplement form. Then you want to pick the smallest pill that will provide you that amount of iron without too much difficulty.
For example, if your doctor tells you that you need to take 30 milligrams of iron a day, if you find a supplement pill that is 60 milligrams, you could cut this pill in half to get your dosage correct.
However, if you plan to take your 30 milligrams in two doses, you'd be better off trying to find a smaller pill that was only 30 milligrams, or even 15-milligram pills.

, In most cases, iron supplements are best absorbed on an empty stomach. If you have cramps or nausea when taking your supplement without food, you may be able to eat a small snack first.There are certain foods, such as whole grains or raw vegetables, that you should never take at the same time as you take your iron supplement.
You also should avoid caffeine while taking your iron supplement or within an hour or two afterward.
Take your iron supplement with a glass of orange juice, as the Vitamin C will help your body absorb more iron – but don't choose calcium-fortified orange juice.

, If your doctor tells you to take an iron supplement, you won't necessarily be taking it forever. In most cases, your doctor will want you to taper off the supplements once your body reaches healthy levels of iron.Iron supplements typically are used to correct an iron deficiency. Once the deficiency is resolved, you should be able to get the iron you need through your normal diet, even if you are a vegan or vegetarian.
Typically, when your iron levels are back to normal, your doctor will tell you to continue taking supplements for about six months while regularly monitoring your levels.
Once you're able to manage your iron levels through your diet, your doctor typically will order periodic blood tests to make sure your levels are still in the normal range.

Ask questions.",How to Become a Vegan1," Just because a vegan diet is low in calories and fats (and completely cholesterol free), that doesn't mean it's healthy. Although chances are most vegan things will be better for you than what the typical American eats. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics says a vegan diet is only healthy if it's well-rounded and planned out. If you're considering going vegan for health reasons, you might also want to consider buying organic.If it's not, you're missing out on vitamins and nutrients that your body needs to function. So do yourself a favor and do it right.


Do your homework. What foods that you like (that are vegan-friendly) do you need to start putting in your diet? Nuts? Quinoa? Beans? Be sure to consider whether or not you think it is important to cut out honey, gelatin, etc. As well as if you want to be a ""full vegan"" or just a dietary vegan. There are animal fats in soaps, there may be leather or the like in your shoes and clothes, etc. Does animal testing bother you? Some products and foods are tested on animals and that can also be something to avoid.
Get online. There are tons of websites catered to budding vegans that are full of recipes, quizzes, fun facts, and interactive tools to get you on board. They'll even do a week's worth of recipes for you!Utilize what you have at your disposal to ensure you're partaking in a balanced diet.;
, Visit your doctor and make sure you are in decent physical shape.

For example, those with anemia need to be particularly attentive to get enough iron in their vegan diet. Some doctors aren't well educated in veganism and mistakenly believe it is unhealthy or that you can't get enough protein or calcium. You only need about 50 grams of protein if you're a female, 60 if you are a male. 1000 to 1200 milligrams of calcium are needed depending on your age.

Ease into it.,
Know the difference between live foods and life-less products consumed as food.,
Learn about tofu (and soy products in general).,
Make time to cook.",How to Become a Vegan2," Make a plan to give up one kind of non-vegan food per week. Not only will this make for an easier lifestyle adjustment, but it will also help your body make the transition as smoothly as possible. Any sudden, drastic change in your diet would likely wreak havoc on your body, especially if you go from being an omnivore to being a vegan.


Listen to your body and be easy on yourself. Don't force yourself to completely change everything at once without guidance. You need to know how to properly substitute for certain elements such as protein and fats before thinking that a head of lettuce is all you need for the rest of your life. Start by removing meat, then eggs and cheese, then all dairy products, and then worry about diligence when it comes to ingredients lists (some get pretty sneaky).

, It's much trickier for vegans than for vegetarians. You already know that you can't eat cheese because cows are exploited in order to generate the milk to make cheese, but did you know that even most cheese alternatives contain casein, a milk protein? Do your homework and read ingredient labels to prevent accidental consumption of non-vegan food.


You'll soon find that vegan websites will endorse certain brand name products. Knowing what to look for in the aisles will cut down on turning grocery shopping into a tedious chore.

Maintain balance.,
Reward yourself.,
Share your delight.",How to Become a Vegan3," If you find yourself constantly fatigued or groggy, you may be missing something imperative to your diet. It can get pretty easy to eat the same things day in and day out, but with a vegan diet, that's not kosher. Make sure you're getting enough protein, calcium, iron, vitamin everything...the list could go on, but it would exceed your bandwidth usage.


Taking a supplement is a good idea. A daily multi-vitamin will ensure that you're getting everything you need. If you have questions, talk to your local pharmacist or get in a quick chat with your doctor.
There are no reliable plant sources of B12 (B12 found in plants is usually due to contamination with animal feces), which can lead to deficiency.You should take a B12 supplement. Deficiency in best cases can cause significant fatigue/debility. In worst cases, it can increase heart disease risk and anemia and may also cause severe irreversible damage to the nervous system. A good tip is to eat foods that are fortified with B12 (check the label) such as yeast flakes, cereals and nondairy milk.
If taking Omega-3 supplements, keep in mind that most are made from fish oil, and are not vegan. Vegan sources of Omega-3s include flaxseeds, flax oil, and walnuts. 1 tsp of flax oil meets your daily needs.

, After learning how to cope with the extreme makeover in your kitchen, your budget, your past time, your health, and your appearance, make it a point to treat yourself to a new wardrobe, a vacation, or a new kitchen. You've earned it!

, There is nothing more satisfying than being acknowledged for pleasing somebody else's tummy. Treat some family or friends to a gourmet meal that you yourself prepared with all the trimmings. Be a vegan evangelist through positive demonstration (not through nagging) and help others discover how they too can make that transition from eating flesh to savoring fresh, whole foods.


That being said, those around you take into account your dietary needs, so take into account theirs. Not everyone will be thrilled when presented with a tofu steak. But that doesn't mean you need to incorporate their love for eating animals in your cooking. If you go eat at someone else's house, be sure to bring your own food just in case. Thank them if they make you a dish or even try to cook something vegan, regardless of whether or not its actually vegan.

Focus on the reasons you want to make this change and use them to keep you motivated.Reducing your meat intake can help you live a longer, healthier life.
Transitioning to a semi-vegetarian diet is an excellent way to lose or manage your weight.
You may have ethical concerns regarding the way animals are treated in the meat industry and would like to reduce your involvement with it.;
, Making a dramatic change to your diet may feel productive at first, but drastic changes can often be short lived. Transitioning to a semi-vegetarian lifestyle should not be a “crash diet” but rather a lifestyle change that you want to be able to manage and sustain.Start by giving yourself short-term goals, like to reduce your meat intake significantly for ten straight days. These shorter goals will help keep you motivated.Allow yourself to cheat occasionally. Being a semi-vegetarian means allowing yourself to have some meat from time to time.

, Depending on your reasoning behind making the change to a semi-vegetarian diet, the amount and types of meat you opt to include in your diet may vary. If you are making the change for health or weight reasons, you may choose to include different meats at different frequencies than if you have an ethical issue with meat production.


Decide on which kinds of meat you would like to limit or omit from your diet. Seafood is often allowed even among people that consider themselves vegetarians, for instance, because of the health benefits and the differences in the seafood industry as compared to farms that produce poultry or red meat.
By making a decision about what meat you are willing to eat and when, you will make it easier to establish a diet that compensates for some of the nutrition lost through reducing your meat intake.
Try to establish the frequency and type of meat you will allow early to make sticking to your diet as easy as possible.

, It may be difficult for you to adapt to a new diet when your previous one had more of a focus on various forms of meat. In order to make the transition easier, phase one type of meat out at a time.Start by phasing out red meat. Red meat can be the least healthy form of meat in your diet, so eliminating it first can lead to a number of health benefits.
Then reduce your poultry intake. Reduce the amount of poultry in your diet slowly, as you find replacement protein sources to your liking.
Finally, reduce your fish intake. Fish can be an extremely healthy source of protein and other nutrients, but if you want to work toward eliminating meat completely or for the most part, you will eventually want to phase seafood out as well.

, It can be difficult to scrape together a meatless-meal at the last minute, so prevent that stress by planning out your meals ahead of time. A little prior planning can ensure you aren’t left without tasty options when hunger strikes.Find recipes for meals you’d like to eat and use them to create your grocery list.
Plan your meals ahead of time so you aren’t improvising or letting your cravings take control.

, There are many non-meat sources of protein and other nutrients available at your local supermarket and many of them are designed to serve as psychological replacements for meat as well as nutritional. In fact, with some of these meat replacements, you may find the replacement is better than the real thing!Beyond Meat is a company that sells food that looks and tastes much like real meat but is actually made of gluten-free pea protein.
Gardein offers “fishless fish” meals that are made of vegetables but replicate the taste and texture of your favorite seafoods.
Quorn is a company that offers meat substitutes that are complete proteins, meaning they have all nine of the essential amino acids you need to acquire through food and previously got through meat and fish.
Tofurky is among the most famous meat replacements thanks their holiday roasts and they also offer a full range of vegan products that replicate hamburgers, hot dogs, and even bacon.

, You may not want to purchase pre-made meatless meals and would rather do the cooking yourself. There are lots of things you can use instead of meat to ensure your meals are satisfying and nutritional. Lentils are jam packed with protein and are a great source of fiber.
Tofu is made from soy and is not only a great source of protein but can also provide various textures to your meal depending on if you purchase soft or firm tofu.
Black beans are a rich source of antioxidants as well as protein and serve as a good replacement for meat in things like burritos or chili.

, Becoming a semi-vegetarian means that you can occasionally incorporate meat into your diet, but for the most part you will want to avoid meat as the primary source of your daily protein needs.Increase your intake of vegetable proteins like nuts, seeds and beans.
Seafood may be an option as a healthier replacement for red meat if you’re willing to keep it as a part of your regular diet.

, Protein isn’t the only thing your body gets from eating meat. There are a number of other important nutrients your body needs that you will need to find alternate sources for. One such nutrient is zinc, which helps your body heal and maintain your immune system.Men should take in about 11 milligrams of zinc per day, women need about 8.
Some great sources of zinc are Crimini mushrooms, spinach, pumpkin seeds, and cashews.

, Another important nutrient you will need to replace is vitamin B-12. Your body uses vitamin B-12 to make red blood cells and maintain a healthy immune system.Vitamin B-12 is only found in meat and shellfish, so you may want to consider keeping seafood as a part of your diet plan.
Dietary supplements like daily vitamins can help prevent a vitamin B-12 deficiency.

, Iron is essential to your body’s ability to carry oxygen in your blood and the primary source of iron in most diets is red meat. As you phase red meat out of your daily intake, you will need to find an alternate source of iron.Men and women under 50 are recommended to take in 8 milligrams of iron per day. Women over 50 need 18 milligrams and men need between 19 and 50.
Great sources of iron are cooked soybeans, lentils, oatmeal, cooked spinach and pasta.

, These fatty acids are important to keeping a healthy heart, focusing your mind and even your vision. They also promote liver restoration and help convert glucose to energy.Fish oil is an excellent source of all of these fatty acids, so if fish is still a part of your diet, you won’t need to worry about maintaining healthy levels.
Fish oil supplements are another way to ensure you have the correct amount of each of these fatty acids.
Other good sources of Omega-3 fatty acids are chia seeds, flax seeds and walnuts.

, You may not feel satisfied at first after eating a meal that is extremely light on meat or lacking it entirely. This isn’t uncommon; your body will need time to adjust to your new diet. It’s important to create a distinction between whether or not you just want more food, or if you’re actually hungry.Ask yourself what exactly you’re hungry for. If you’re hungry in general, you may really need to just eat more healthy food.
Wait a few minutes after asking yourself if you’re hungry and see if the craving subsides. It often will.

, If you find yourself craving something regularly, it could be a sign that your body is deficient in a nutrient that you need. Once you have identified what you’re lacking, you can find alternate sources of that nutrient to help curb your cravings.If you are constantly craving red meat, your iron levels may be low and your body is trying to compensate. Try incorporating more oatmeal, spinach or other iron source into your diet and see if the cravings begin to subside.
Daily vitamins can help ensure you have the correct balance of nutrients so you can avoid nutrition deficit cravings., Often, cravings set in when you’re in need of a snack or haven’t had a meal in a long time. If you make sure to eat healthy foods regularly, your stomach will feel full and you’ll be less likely to suffer from sudden cravings.


Plan to eat healthy snacks throughout the day to avoid letting hunger take hold.
Don’t skip meals. It can be extremely difficult to stay on your diet when you're starving, so try not to skip meals so you never feel too hungry.

, Umami is the fifth taste after bitter, sweet, sour and salty. Umami makes foods taste complex and satisfying and can be an excellent way to reduce meat cravings in your diet.Mushrooms and tomatoes both have naturally occurring umami flavors and drying them concentrates them even more. Add them to your meals to prevent meat cravings.
Green tea also has an umami flavor and can actually help curb the appeal of the missing meat in your diet.

, The point of eating a semi-vegetarian diet is that you occasionally still get to indulge in some meat. Sometimes, the best way to overcome a craving is simply to give yourself a treat.


Red meat is the least healthy meat, but still offers a number of beneficial nutrients. Having a little red meat from time to time can help maintain a balance to your diet.
Fish and other seafood are healthy sources of many nutrients and are even considered acceptable to some vegetarian diets. Incorporating seafood could help curb cravings and keep a healthy balance to your diet.

Set realistic weight loss goals for yourself.,
Stock your kitchen with healthy foods.,
Get some small plates and bowls.,
Organize your kitchen.,
Plan your meals in advance.,
Find a workout buddy.,
Choose activities that you enjoy.,
Eat smaller portions of food.",How to Easily Lose Weight1," Setting huge goals for yourself can be a recipe for disaster. If your goals are not realistic, then you may struggle to accomplish them and eventually give up. Instead, try setting small, realistic goals that you are confident you can accomplish and then break your goal into even smaller objectives that you can work on.For example, instead of setting a goal to lose 50 pounds, set a goal to lose 5 pounds to start. Then, identify what you will need to do to lose those 5 pounds, such as getting 30 minutes of exercise five days per week and reducing your caloric intake by 500 calories per day. Use these objectives to help you work towards your goals.
Be sure to celebrate when you accomplish a goal, no matter how small it might seem. Acknowledge your success and reward yourself, such as with a small item you buy yourself or a treat like going for a pedicure.;
, It is hard to lose weight if you are surrounded by unhealthy foods. To set yourself up for success and make losing weight as easy as possible, buy lots of healthy foods to stock up your kitchen. Some good items to stock your cupboard with include:


Fresh, frozen, or canned fruits and vegetables
Lean proteins like skinless chicken breast, ground turkey, lean cuts of beef, and tuna packed in water
Whole grains like brown rice, whole wheat pasta, and whole wheat bread
Low calorie condiments such as mustard, sugar free jam, and dill relish
Low or no calorie beverages, such as sparkling water, herbal teas, and coffee

, Eating from a small plate or bowl can help to reduce your overall caloric intake. If your cupboard is filled with large plates and bowls, then replace them with some smaller plates and bowls.By using a smaller plate or bowl, you will be less likely to take more food that you should eat.

, A cluttered kitchen has been found to be connected with being overweight. Take some time to organize your kitchen, and you may be able to lose some weight in the process.Keep the counters clear so that you will always have room to prep your healthy meals. For example, make sure that all of your food is hidden away in a cupboard and not sitting on the counters.
Find a place for your kitchen tools so you will always know where to find them. For example, you could keep your spatulas, ladles, and other cooking tools in a specific drawer or in a tool holder.

, Making a daily or even weekly meal plan is a great way to simplify weight loss. It will eliminate the chance that you will make an impulse decision about a meal or snack, and it will also make choosing what to eat much less stressful.


Try sitting down and writing out all of your meals for the following day so you will have a game plan. Then, you can simply follow this menu to take the guesswork out of eating healthy.
You can also make a list of all of the healthy meals that you have ingredients to prepare for the week. Then, choose items off this list as you go through the week to ensure that you are eating healthy.

, Having someone to exercise with you can help to keep you motivated, and it can also help to make exercising more fun. Ask a friend or coworker to be your walking buddy or join a gym with your significant other and go on gym dates. Try to keep a regular schedule with your workout buddy and encourage each other.


You can share your weight loss goals with your gym buddy and ask them to help keep you accountable, such as by texting you if they have not seen you at the gym in a few days. Make sure to return the favor as well.

, Exercise is a lot more fun if you like the activity. Therefore, it is very important to choose a form of exercise that you will enjoy. Try out some different things until you find what you like.


For example, you might enjoy taking a dance class, swimming, cycling, playing a team sport, or running. Try out lots of different options to find what appeals to you.
Keep in mind that you don’t have to choose just one activity. You can include a variety of different types of exercise in your routine to keep things interesting.

, Eating less is the key to weight loss, so make sure that your portions are properly sized. Fill your small plate with half vegetables, a quarter lean protein, and no more than a quarter carbohydrates if you choose to eat them.

Try eating off of a smaller plate to make yourself feel like you're eating more food.
Minimize distractions so that you can savor your food.
Slow down your meal so that it takes you longer to eat the smaller portions.

Avoid attaching guilt or judgement to food.,
Give yourself permission to eat anything you want.,
View food as fuel.,
Concentrate on nutrition.,
Don’t be afraid to eat fat.",How to Eat the Things You Want to and Still Lose Weight1," Food is simply a source of nutrients and calories. It is not a moral entity or a thing you should feel guilty about. Stop thinking of your favorite foods as “guilty pleasures” or “weaknesses.” Replace those negative connotations with positive, encouraging ones that promote health and weight loss instead of shame and guilt.For example, instead of saying that chocolate cake is your guilty pleasure, tell yourself that you love chocolate cake because it’s delicious, and that’s okay. To lose weight, you now simply stop at a small serving of the cake rather than eating two big pieces.;
, Don’t make any foods off-limits. Instead, focus on eating foods you love in moderation. Allowing yourself moderate portions of foods and drinks that you love will stave off binges and help you feel less deprived, which in turn will help you lose weight.


Swearing off pizza or beer, for example, might sound like a good approach to weight loss for you if you love them. Unfortunately, if you deprive yourself of these treats, then you’ll likely sabotage yourself in the long run and binge on them. Instead of denying yourself the pizza, realize that it will be a part of your diet occasionally, and other foods like salad or fruit will complement that to give your body what it needs.

, Your body needs fuel to operate optimally. Food is neither your enemy nor your friend. It is there to keep you healthy and alive. Eat as much as you need to feel satisfied, and avoid severe calorie restriction as a weight loss tool, as this can lead to health problems and disordered eating.A good approach to gauging your level of fullness is to rate your hunger on a scale of 1 to 10 during your meal. If 1 means you’re extremely hungry and 10 means you’re miserably full, aim for a score of 5 or 6 when your meal is over, to ensure that you’re not overeating and slowing down your weight loss.
Try addressing your nutrition needs by eating the necessary nutrients first, then anything else after that if you are still hungry.
If you eat only until you’re not hungry, as opposed to full, then you are practicing moderation with your eating. Even if you still occasionally incorporate your favorite unhealthy foods, eating them in smaller quantities will help with weight loss.

, When we are deficient in vitamins, minerals, and fat, we develop cravings for the wrong foods. To stave off these cravings and promote weight loss, be sure to eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods and take a multivitamin supplement, if needed.


Fruits, vegetables, and other fiber-rich foods are great sources of vitamins and minerals. These foods also tend to be low in calories, so filling up on these foods will help promote weight loss.

, Your brain requires fat to function, so don’t be afraid of eating healthy fats like those found in avocados and fish. Studies have shown that very low fat diets are not ideal for weight loss or overall health because fats help with brain function, vitamin absorption, and help keep you fuller for longer.Avoid dangerous types of fat like trans fats, which have been linked to a variety of health problems like diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, and stroke.Make sure you read food labels and do not buy anything with trans fats (sometimes called partially hydrogenated oils).
If you don’t enjoy eating fat, you can try a fish oil supplement. Be sure you store these supplements in the refrigerator to preserve freshness, and choose a brand that specifies that their supplements are free from Mercury."

Include more vegetables in your cooking.,
Add fruit for sweetness.,
Cut back on the fat in baked goods.,
Use lower calorie versions of your favorite foods.,
Choose whole grain options to get more fiber.",How to Easily Lose Weight2," Vegetables add fiber, nutrients, and flavor without all the fat and calories. By including more vegetables in your meals, you will feel fuller. If the vegetables are replacing higher calorie options like, bread, pasta, and rice, then you will be cutting calories as well.Make sure to include at least two servings of non-starchy vegetables with every meal. Half your plate should be made up of vegetables.
You can also try replacing certain foods in a recipe with vegetables. For example, to cut calories at dinner you could use zucchini noodles in place of spaghetti, or you could use cauliflower rice instead of white rice in a stir fry.

, If you are looking to sweeten up your cereal, yogurt, cereal, or pancakes, then adding fruit is a great way to go. Your meal will have fewer calories as well as some added fiber and nutrients.


Try topping your pancakes with fresh berries, slice a banana onto your cereal, or dice up an apple and stir it into your yogurt.
If you are craving something sweet, then reach for a piece of fruit first and see if it conquers your craving. For example, instead of having a candy bar, have an apple or a couple of tangerines.

, Just because you are trying to lose weight doesn’t mean you have to cut out all the treats in your diet. You can lighten up recipes for muffins, cookies, and cakes by swapping the butter or oil for a lower fat and lower calorie option.For example, you can replace butter or oil in recipes with applesauce or Greek yogurt in baked goods. Use the same amount that the recipe calls for, such as ½ cup of applesauce if the recipe calls for ½ cup of oil.

, There is so much variety in the products available in supermarkets that you can probably find lower calorie versions of many of the foods you enjoy. For example, you can find diet sodas, baked potato chips, reduced fat cookies, and low fat cheeses. Start buying the lower calorie options of your favorite foods for an easy way to cut calories and lose weight., Fiber helps you to feel full for longer, so it’s important to include fiber in your diet if you are trying to lose weight. One easy way to get more fiber into your diet is to choose whole grain options of the foods you normally eat.For example, instead of a serving of white rice, have a serving of brown rice. Instead of making a sandwich with white bread, choose whole wheat bread. Instead of eating a bowl of sugary cereal, go for a bowl of whole grain cereal or oatmeal.

Have a square of dark chocolate for a treat.,
Break your exercise into small chunks throughout the day.,
Look for little ways to get more activity into your days.,
Become a fidgeter.,
Stand as much as you can.",How to Easily Lose Weight3," Drinking water throughout the day can help you to feel fuller and it can also stimulate your metabolism. Try to remember to drink 8 ounces (237 milliliters) of water before every meal and to sip on a water bottle throughout the day to ensure that you are getting enough water. This will help to reduce the chances that you will overeat and provide an easy way to boost your weight loss., Not getting enough sleep may affect your body’s metabolism and impair your body’s response to insulin, which may lead to obesity and diabetes.Make sleep a priority and aim for seven to nine hours of sleep every night.


Make your bedroom a relaxing place to help improve your sleep.
Shut off electronic devices at least 30 minute before bedtime.
Don't drink caffeinated beverages within a few hours of bedtime.

, Eating in front of the television is a common practice for many people, but it is a good way to end up eating more than you’d planned. Being mindful of what you eat can help you to eat less, so you might want to get into the habit of eating at a table.Try sitting down for each of your meals without anything in front of you to distract you from what you are eating. Turn off the TV, power down your laptop, and put away your phone. Just focus on the look, taste, and smell of your food.

, Snacking on dark chocolate has been shown to improve satiety, so you may be less inclined to overeat. Try snacking on a small piece of dark chocolate that is about the size of a quarter once per day to help yourself feel more satisfied.For example, you could have a square of dark chocolate as an afternoon snack or as your dessert for the day. Your piece should be about the size of a Dove chocolate.

, You don’t need to get in one long workout per day to reap the benefits of exercise. You can get a few smaller workouts in throughout the day, such as three 10 minute walks or three 10 minute dance sessions. Breaking your exercise into a few 10 minute sessions may even provide greater benefits to you than working out for an hour straight.Aim for a total of 30 minutes of exercise daily. For example, you could take a brisk 10 minute walk before breakfast, on your lunch break, and after dinner to get your 30 minutes of cardiovascular activity for the day.

, Little things like parking further away from the entrance at your workplace, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or using your bike instead of your car to run an errand can help you to increase the amount of calories you burn in a day. As you go through your day, be on the lookout for little ways that you can move a little more. This will help you to meet your daily activity requirement without any fuss.

, People who fidget burn more calories when they are just sitting or standing because they are constantly moving. If you are not a fidgeter, then you might consider becoming one to reap the benefits of fidgeting.To become a fidgeter, try shaking your leg slightly while working at your desk, or try shifting your weight from one leg to the other while standing.

, Standing up burns more calories than sitting down, so simply standing up can make a difference in your weight. Avoid activities that require you to sit a lot, such as watching TV and playing video games. Alternatively, try standing while you watch TV."

Satisfied may feel different to everyone. Typically signs include: a lack of hunger, a feeling that you will not get hungry again for 3–4 hours, or a disinterest in your food. You may feel a slight presence of food in your stomach. Many times satisfaction is a lack of a feeling.If you feel full, you might have eaten too much. Fullness may feel like: a stretching of your stomach, bloated or uncomfortable. When you're full, you may think ""that was a few bites too many.""

, Another hallmark of people who stay thin, rather than skinny people, is that they typically do not emotionally eat on a regular basis. Ask any skinny bulimic people you know about emotional eating.Those that have trouble managing their weight may cope with stress or other emotions with food.


Come up with a list of activities that can help you de-stress, calm down or self-soothe. This could be: listening to music, taking a hot shower, reading a good book or going for a walk.
Journaling may also help manage emotional eating as well. Spend some time journaling your thoughts and feelings down a few times a week.If emotional eating is something you struggle with significantly, try seeing a life coach or behavior therapist for additional support.

, All skinny people avoid skipping meals. By having an eating schedule your body will be more likely to stick to your eating plans. Having three meals a day with one or two healthy snacks can help regulate your eating and make you less likely to snack throughout the day. Remember, three proper balanced meals a day should mean you don't need to snack. Don't eat a snack because it's snack time, snack if you are hungry.Eating for a healthy weight does not mean eating less food or skipping meals. No skinny person, healthy or unhealthy, eats less food than they want to, apparently. You need to eat regularly and healthily so that you are able to maintain a healthy weight and metabolism.


Always eat breakfast like every skinny person on the planet does. You might think that skipping meals would make you skinny, but many times the exact opposite is true.
Also, skipping meals slows down your metabolism so you end up storing more of those calories because you're body was in ""starvation mode"" If you eat breakfast, it gets your metabolism going, then you eat smaller meals throughout the day.For the two snacks it's a good idea to have higher protein (like a hard-boiled egg and an apple) to help keep your energy up.

, Exercising isn't eating, obviously, but it ties in very closely with it, especially if you're looking to eat like a skinny person. Skinny drug addicts, cancer sufferers and anorexic exercise, probably. As do those with worms and the starving. Exercising may help keep your appetite under control and it will help you burn those extra calories that you intake.Studies have shown that people who are thin and easily manage their weight move more often than others.Exercise can be anything you like: a 30 minute walk, going for a run, doing yoga or dance, doing martial arts, etc.
Also try to include more lifestyle activity. These are activities that you do everyday — walking to and from your car, taking the stairs at work, or mowing the lawn. Increase how much you move and walk throughout the day to help increase your calorie burn.The important thing is that you exercise most days. Once you've incorporated that into your daily schedule, it will work with the healthy eating to make you healthy and help to shed any excess pounds you don't want.

, All skinny people eat enough protein. Protein takes care of things like body tissue, internal organs, and muscle as well as your immune system and hormones. People who are naturally thin consume adequate protein daily to help them maintain satisfaction throughout the day.Try to eat more lean meat rather than fatty meat since leaner proteins are lower in calories. All skinny people eat lean meat, unless they are vegetarian.The best sources of lean protein are fish, meat, poultry, eggs and low-fat dairy. You can also get protein from soy, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains.
Protein might be able to better satisfy hunger and to leave you feeling more satisfied for a longer period of time compared to other foods. It can also help you control your appetite and calorie intake.The way to calculate how much protein you should be getting in your diet is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. In general, this is about 46 g daily for women and 56 g daily for men. However, the amount will differ based upon age, gender, weight and activity levels.

, At minimum you want at least five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables every day in common with skinny people.Those people who manage their weight easily, base large quantities of their diet on fruits and vegetables.More of those servings should be veggies than fruit. This will help you get the nutrients you need to be healthy, with fewer calories.Fruits and vegetables are a frequent choice in diets eaten by thin people. These foods are high in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber. They can add bulk to meals and snacks and help make meals more satisfying.Choose whole fruits and vegetables over juice. Juices do not provide the healthy fiber found in whole, unprocessed fruits and vegetables.

, Many dieters limit or cut out carbohydrates, especially from the grain group. However, those who do not struggle with weight include grains on a daily basis. However, their choices are healthy, nutrient-dense grains.


Grains are a healthy food group that provides your body with a variety of vitamins, minerals and some fiber. In general, include five to six ounces of grains daily. This amount may be different for your age, gender or activity level.One ounce of a grain would be: one slice of bread, 1/2 of an English muffin or 1/2 cup of brown rice or pasta.It's also recommend to make half of your grain choices whole grains. Whole grains are generally higher in fiber and other nutrients compared to refined grains., People who maintain a healthy weight easily include regular sources of healthy fats in their diet. These types of fats help support your cardiovascular system and may keep you feeling satisfied longer.Get Omega-3 fats daily. These are found in fatty fish like salmon, trout, catfish, mackerel, as well as flaxseed and walnuts. It is recommended to get at least two servings of fatty fish each week.You also want monounsaturated fats such as those found in olives, avocados, hazelnuts, almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, and olive oil.While you definitely do want to have certain fats as part of your diet, there are others that you should try to avoid as much as possible. Trans fats and saturated fats are considered the unhealthiest and should be limited.These are found in fatty cuts of meat, fried foods, and processed meats.

, Eating like a thin person does not mean being overly concerned with calories or never eating any of your favorite foods. Those who do not struggle with their weight eat a healthy diet that includes the occasional treat.Don't make certain foods ""off-limits."" This may cause you to start obsessing over and craving those foods more frequently.By eating your favorite foods more mindfully you'll find that you're enjoying those foods and you'll be less likely to immediately go back for more.
If you end up eating a meal that's higher in calories (like you went out to eat, or had a bigger dessert), don't stress. Try balancing that meal or snack by eating smaller portions for the rest of the day or hit the gym a little harder.

Adding a lot of vegetables and fruits to your diet will help you. One way to add more fruits and veggies to your diet, cut calories, and still enjoy the foods you love is to add or ""hide"" veggies to dishes. Researchers have found that adding pureed vegetables to dishes (e.g., cauliflower to mac and cheese) helped people eat a few hundred calories less of the dishes.Veggies add but bulk to a dish but not really a ton of extra calories.
Get a lot of color on your plate. Make sure your meals have lots of colors; the best way to do this is by adding lots of fresh produce, from eggplant to beets to kale to yellow peppers. This color blocking usually helps you eat more produce and makes the meal look appetizing and appealing at the same time!;
, Fiber-rich foods keep you full for longer, so that you don't reach for unhealthy snacks that will only make you gain weight.


Beans, for example, are filling, high in fiber and are an excellent source of protein. They're also slow to digest, meaning that you feel satisfied for a while (which may in turn stop you from eating more!), Instead of drinking juices or smoothies, which tend to be high in calories, opt instead to eat a whole piece of fruit, like an apple.Eating a whole piece of fruit fills you up more than juice because raw fruit has more fiber. In addition, the act of chewing the fruit communicates to the brain that you've eaten something substantial., Studies have shown that people who eat foods with high water content have lower body mass indexes. The water in these foods helps keep you full for longer so you eat less overall.Watermelon and strawberries have about 92 percent water per volume. Other fruits with high water content include grapefruit, cantaloupe, and peaches. Remember, though, that many fruits are high in sugar, so try to limit how much fruit you eat daily. For vegetables, cucumber and lettuce have the highest water content at 96 percent. Zucchini, radish and celery have a water content of 95 percent.

, By choosing your foods carefully, you can drop the pounds without going hungry. Hot peppers, green tea, berries, and whole grains are all foods that improve your metabolism, meaning the rate your body burns calories.


Avoid processed foods and sugars. These cause an insulin spike, which can result in fat storage instead of fat burning.

, Monounsaturated fats have been clinically proven to help you burn fat, especially in your midsection. So, add foods like avocados, kalamata olives, olive oil, almonds, walnuts, and flaxseed to your diet, and watch the weight fall right off you., Superfood is a term sometimes used to describe food with high nutrient content that some believe confers health benefits as a result. Some superfood claims are supported with scientific evidence, while other claims make some foods hugely popular even though they have few proven benefits.Quinoa, for example, is a legitimate superfood because it is a complete protein (meaning it has all eight of the essential amino acids we need for our tissues). In addition, quinoa has more protein than most cereal grains and is higher in calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and iron than other grains like wheat and barley.Just make sure to do your research before deciding on adding certain alleged ""superfoods"" to your diet.

, ""Empty calorie"" foods are those which have calories (from sugar and/or solid fats) but little to no nutritional value. Foods and beverages that provide the most number of empty calories for Americans include cakes, cookies, pastries and donuts, sodas, energy drinks, fruit drinks, cheese, pizza, ice cream, bacon, hot dogs and sausages. With some of these, you can find alternative versions. For example, you can purchase low-fat hot dogs and low-fat cheese at grocery stores. You can also have sugar-free drinks. In other foods, like candy and regular soda, all the calories are basically empty., Soups are relatively low in calories. Moreover, if you start with a soup, you will probably eat less of the main meal.Stick to soups with a broth base and of around 100-150 calories per serving. You can choose either chunky or pureed soups, just avoid soups with added cream. , Go ahead and have the odd doughnut or slice of pizza. Indulging in occasional craving will help ward off any binging episodes. If you really feel a hankering for something, have just a little bit. Remember that the more you restrict yourself, the greater the draw to the restricted item.


Try eating a bowl of raw veggies or drinking a full glass of water before you indulge. Doing this will fill you up and leave you with less room to overindulge on your treat.

, Your brain takes around 20 minutes to register feelings of fullness, suggesting that you need to slow down so that your brain can properly communicate those feelings.


If you don't feel full immediately after a meal, wait. The chemicals your brain releases when you eat or drink take time to rise and to communicate that sense of fullness. As the chemicals increase, your hunger dissipates; this is why you should pause for a little bit after eating and before having a second helping.

, Eating with your hands will mean that you take in more food in one scoop.


Studies also show that people who eat with larger utensils eat less than those who eat with smaller utensils., When you feel comfortably satiated after eating, stop and put your utensils and napkin on the plate to signal that you're finished. This is also a signal to yourself that you're done with your meal as well as to those around you.


Remember, you don't have to eat all of your meal once you feel satisfied. Eat until you are 80% full. No one should feel stuffed and sick after eating., Often we mistake thirst for hunger which means we eat when it's not necessary. By keeping yourself well hydrated you'll feel hungry less as well as getting a clearer complexion and shinier hair.


If you're not sure what you're feeling is actually hunger, try drinking a big glass of water and then wait a few minutes. If you don't feel hungry anymore, it's because your body was actually in need of water, not food., This is a simple yet very powerful exercise to open your eyes to see whether you are keeping up with your food plan. Often, we tend to overlook the snacking we do between meals and instead really think that our diet is failing us. Most people underestimate their daily intake by about 25 percent.You might also discover useful information about your daily habits and a reality check about how many calories you actually consume. Once you know your habits and patterns better, you can begin to address problem behaviors that are hindering your progress.Keeping a journal also makes you more accountable.

, Eating in restaurants or at other people's homes can be a real challenge. You want to eat, but you also don't want to eat the wrong things and risk backtracking on your progress.Choose foods that are steamed, grilled, broiled or baked instead of fried. Avoid dishes that are labeled as ""breaded"", ""crispy"" or ""battered"" – these are code words for ""fried"".
Don't be afraid to ask for modifications. For example, ask to swap out potatoes or bread for a side salad. Request sauce on the side of chicken or other entrée, rather than smothered on top. This will enable you to still eat something delicious but without all of the extra calories.If the restaurant is known for especially large portion sizes, opt to split something with a friend.To avoid overeating when going out, eat a small and healthy snack at home beforehand. Try some carrots and hummus or an apple.This will curb off your hunger and keep your head clear while you make healthy and informed choices from the restaurant's offerings.
Pack away food. At the beginning of the meal, ask for a doggie bag, and put what you aren't going to eat in the bag.
When ordering salads, always ask for dressings and sauces on the side. Lots of dressings can be very fatty and full of calories. Your seemingly ""healthy choice"" can pack as many calories as a burger if it’s swimming in a fatty dressing. Be also wary of other high-calorie additions like bacon bits and cheese., You might overeat one night. You might have a bad day where you indulge in way too much junk food. Just don't despair when you realize you've strayed from your goals. It took you a lifetime to achieve your current weight, and it will take time to achieve your new weight and size goal.


To keep up your optimism, reward yourself for meeting smaller goals. For example, buy yourself a small token or treat every time you lose another five times. The prospect of the reward will eventually become its own form of motivation.

Know the difference between hunger and boredom.,
Identify emotional eating.,
Stay hydrated.,
Put cravings on hold.,
Avoid foods known to cause cravings.",How to Eat the Things You Want to and Still Lose Weight2," Many times when we are bored we turn to eating as a pleasurable activity to pass time; however, this can wreak havoc on our weight loss plans, especially if we choose unhealthy foods.


Avoid mindless eating in front of the TV or computer. Find other activities to keep your hands and/or mouth busy, such as knitting or chewing gum, so you don't feel compelled to mindlessly snack.When you do eat, turn off the TV and put away your laptop, smartphone, or anything else distracting. Focus on eating mindfully and paying attention to your body.

, We often eat when we are stressed, sad, happy, or angry. Before you have a meal or snack, pause and ask yourself if you are actually hungry or if you're eating because of your present feelings.Try keeping a food journal. Not only will this help you identify emotional eating, but it is also an excellent way to track your calories and plan for indulgences.
For example, if you want ice cream later in the day, you can plan ahead in your food journal to have a lighter lunch to make up for your high calorie treat. This will help you satisfy your cravings for the foods you love while still keeping you on track for your weight loss goals., It is easy to confuse thirst for hunger because the same part of our brain, the hypothalamus, regulates both hunger and thirst. To combat this confusion, try having a large glass of water and waiting fifteen minutes. If you no longer feel hungry, then you were likely just dehydrated.To avoid dehydration and help curb cravings, invest in a refillable water bottle, so you always have access to water.

, If you're craving a particular unhealthy food that you love, try to distract yourself and wait twenty minutes. Do something unrelated to food like going for a short walk or calling a friend. Have a small piece of fruit or vegetable, and then if you still want the food that you were craving, then don't deprive yourself (but limit your portion size).

, Some foods and drinks contain ingredients that make us feel hungry when we consume them. Artificial sweeteners in diet sodas and regular sugar can cause us to feel hungrier by spiking blood sugar and having little nutritional value."

Set a workout goal.,
Burn as many calories as possible.,
Add extra exercises throughout your day.,
Invest in a fitness tracker.,
Move past setbacks.",How to Eat the Things You Want to and Still Lose Weight3," Once you decide on a calorie goal for your weight loss regimen, then it’s important to create a matching workout plan. If you plan to keep incorporating your favorite foods, then you need to remain flexible with your expectations. To lose 1lb per week, you need to consume 500 fewer calories per day than you burn.

You might lose weight more slowly than those who adhere to very strict diets, but remember that your approach is more healthy and sustainable in the long-term. Crash diets and overly restrictive diets usually lead to binges and other unhealthy eating habits, and people usually gain back the weight they lost.

, When you want to lose weight and still eat your favorite foods, it’s important to exercise to offset any extra calories you might consume. Interval training in which you alternate bursts of hard cardio exercises with moderate cardio are very efficient calorie burners.For example, if you know that you will be having a high-calorie dinner, then you can help offset the calorie overload by increasing your workout for that particular day. Be sure to accurately Measure Calories Burned During Exercise.
Running interspersed with fast walking or using an elliptical machine at varying levels of difficulty are excellent ways to incorporate interval training.

, If you have an office job or are a student, you might find that you spend a majority of your day sitting and getting little to no exercise. Incorporate techniques that will help you Burn Calories at Work, such as taking the stairs to your office, stretching at your desk, and taking walks during your lunch break.If your workplace allows it, install a standing desk. We burn more calories standing than sitting, so this is an option to increase your calorie burn while at work.You might even be able to use a walking/treadmill desk, though these can be expensive.

, If you are a visual person, then a fitness tracker might be helpful for you in your weight loss goals. These trackers can track your steps, calories burned, sleep patterns, and heart rate, to give you a broad picture of your weight loss and exercise progress.Knowing your calorie burn for the day will tell you how many calories to allot at mealtimes, which will help accelerate your weight loss.

, Don’t beat yourself up if you experience a setback and binge one day or skip a week at the gym. One day of overeating will not completely sabotage your weight loss goals. Be sure to pick up the next day with your exercise routine and eating the foods you love in moderation.


Remember that 3,500 calories equals a pound, so even if you binged on your favorite unhealthy food, you probably didn't undo very much of your weight loss progress.

Opt for protein.,
Choose high fiber foods.,
Eat water-based foods.,
Measure your food.,
Read labels.,
Invest in portion control plates.,
Use tricks to gauge portion size.",How to Eat Less During a Meal1," Protein is essential to a healthy diet and leaves you feeling full faster than most foods. A solid serving of protein at meals can help you eat less, as you'll fill up faster. Make sure to opt for healthy sources of protein, like lean meats, fish, and poultry.Check serving sizes when fixing protein. Some protein foods may be high calorie, so you may want to avoid large servings.
If you're ordering at a restaurant, see if you can get half of something like, say, a steak boxed up before being served. You can take it home and eat it later. Restaurant servings tend to be larger.;
, Fiber tends to fill you up. Stock your plate with high fiber foods at meals. In addition to helping you feel full faster, fiber will keep you full long term. This will prevent you from snacking after dinner.Go for low calorie sources of fiber, like beans, vegetables, and whole grains.
When eating out, swap white grains for whole grains when you can. Ask for brown rice instead of white rice, for example.

, Water will fill you up without adding calories to your meal. Fruits and vegetables tend to have high water content, so pack your plate with plenty of produce. Go for things like grapes, cucumbers, lettuce, and tomatoes. Soups that have a lot of broth also have a high water content.When eating out, order a side salad or have a salad before your main meal.

, Invest in measuring cups or a kitchen scale at a local department store. These devices will help you correctly measure out portion size. If you're just estimating, it's easy to go overboard when preparing your food. For instance, if your can of beans says half a cup is a serving, make sure you only take half a cup of beans., Oftentimes, you accidentally consume more calories due to deceptive labeling. This can cause you to ingest larger portions that you realize. While a pre-made side salad may claim it's only 250 calories, this may be the ""per serving"" amount. The package itself may contain two servings, giving you 500 calories for a side dish.Make a habit of checking serving size each time you're preparing a meal. If a food contains multiple servings in a package, make sure to only eat that amount.
Avoid eating straight out of a package, as this makes it hard to measure how much you're eating. Instead, measure out a serving and eat only that.
If you have difficulty not eating, say, an entire package of chips, look for bags with only one serving per package. You can go for 100 calorie bags of chips as side dishes instead of larger bags that contain two or more servings.

, Portion controlled plates are plates divided into sections for starch, protein, and vegetables. You can buy portion controlled plates at some department stores or online. You can use them to eat less by filling your plate with the correct portion sizes of food at each meal., Portion size can be confusing, especially if it's explained in terms like ""ounces"" and ""cups."" There are a number of general rules of thumb you can use to remind yourself of proper portion sizes without having to stop and measure.A serving of meat is about as big as a bar of soap.
A serving of pasta should be roughly the size of your fist.
Three ounces of fish is about the size of a checkbook.
A teaspoon of oil is about the size of your tip of your thumb. A tablespoon is about the size of your whole thumb.
Servings of fruits and vegetables should be the size of a baseball or tennis ball.

Drink more water.,
Reduce your salt intake.,
Eat more fiber.,
Consume more coffee, tea, or cranberry juice.",How to Drop Water Weight1," It may seem contradictory to try to lose water by consuming water. But staying hydrated is essential to helping your body release fluids (including water) and cleanse your body of any food that may be causing bloating.
If your body is dehydrated, it will store water to compensate,
leading to more water weight. Ensure you have at least eight glasses of water a day.Try to sip, rather than chug, water. Sipping water allows your body to digest food properly. Chugging water can actually make your belly swell up.;
, Eating high amounts of sodium can cause your body to store water and lead to bloating.Your diet should include no more than 2000-2500mg of sodium a day to allow your metabolism to function properly without leading to water retention.Avoid canned soups and frozen meals as salt is used as a preservative in these foods. Go for fresh meat from the butcher over deli meats, which is full of sodium.
Use table salt sparingly in your cooking and use less spices in your food to cut back on sodium.
Avoid pre-made salad dressings and sauces, as these are often high in sodium. Cheese is also a high sodium food, so cut back on cheese if possible.

, Consuming fiber rich foods helps to cleanse your urinary tract, kidneys, and your colon, thereby releasing excess fluids.Have a breakfast high in fiber, like a bowl of whole grain cereal, or add a few tablespoons of flax seed to your breakfast cereal, your yogurt, or your morning smoothie. Flaxseed is high in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. They can be ground in a coffee grinder or a food processor to then add to foods.
Have steamed or raw vegetables as part of your lunch and dinner.
Avoid boiling or roasting your vegetables
as this removes a lot of the nutrients and healthy fiber.Be sure to snack on fruits like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, which are packed with fiber and other antioxidants.

, Coffee and tea are known diuretics, which help to release fluids from your body. Always balance your coffee and tea consumption with glasses of water to prevent dehydration.You can also drink cranberry juice, a natural diuretic that will help to flush toxins and fluids from your body."

Create a relaxing eating environment.,
Prepare your food yourself.,
Eliminate electronic distractions.,
Pay attention to tastes and textures.,
Stop eating when you are 80% full.,
Eat with other people.",How to Eat Less During a Meal2," If you want to eat more mindfully, create the right atmosphere. You're more likely to slow down and enjoy a meal if you've set up a nice atmosphere for yourself. Sit down in a dining room or kitchen and eliminate distractions before eating.Set the table. Even if you're eating alone, having the table set can set a calm environment for eating.
Dim the lights. This will help you stay relaxed and enjoy your meal.
You should also keep food out of sight to avoid eating in the kitchen between meals. Keep snacks in high cabinets so you will have to work to get them.

, If you make meals each day, this can reduce the amount you eat. Preparing food at home means you control the portion size, helping you eat less by making smaller portions for yourself. This can also help you transition into mindful eating, which slows down eating habits in general. You will learn to appreciate the food and the work it takes to prepare it, slowing you down while eating. Take time to peel, chop, and prepare your food.As you prepare your food, notice the sights, smells, sounds, and textures.

, When you sit down to eat, keep electronics out of the room. Turn your smartphone off and do not eat in front of the television. Give your full attention to the food., Eat your food slowly and focus on the tastes and textures. Chew each bite multiple times and savor the flavor. Be aware of what you're eating the entire time, focusing all your energy on your food. If you slow down the pace of your eating, you will feel full faster. This will result in you eating less overall.It can help to set down your spoon or fork between bites.

, Your stomach can take up to twenty minutes to tell you that you are full. To avoid overeating, stop when you are feeling about 80% full. This is a Japanese method known as Hara Hachi Bu., Whenever possible, eat your meals with other people around. Having company while you eat may help you maintain a healthy weight and encourage you to eat less.Sharing meals with your family can also help strengthen your relationship.
Try to eat lunch with your coworkers whenever possible.
If you live alone, try to invite your friends over for dinner.

Drink a glass of water before eating.,
Wear tighter clothing when you eat.,
Use smaller plates.,
Brush your teeth after filling up.",How to Eat Less During a Meal3," Before each meal, drink an 8 ounce glass of water. Water will fill up your stomach, but has no calories. Going into the meal somewhat full will cause you to eat less overall., Tighter clothing will feel snugger as you fill up on food. Wearing something like a form fitted jacket or blouse while eating will help you feel full faster. As your clothing gets tighter, you may feel uncomfortable and want to stop eating earlier than usual.Make sure not to wear anything so tight it's difficult to eat. You want to make sure you're still getting enough food overall.

, Cleaning your plate will make you feel like you've eaten a full meal. You can trick your brain into feeling satisfied by using smaller plates. You will not be able to fit as much food on them, and will feel full after consuming smaller portions.Make sure your plates are big enough to hold proper portions of vegetables, proteins, and grains. You want to make sure you're getting the right amount of food.

, After you finish a meal, you may have a habit of picking at food while storing leftovers or grazing from the fridge after dinner. To prevent this, brush your teeth after a meal. As food will not taste right after having brushed your teeth, this can reduce your desire to graze. You also may not want to go to the trouble of brushing your teeth again later."

Spend time in a sauna or a steam room.,
Cut back on your alcohol consumption.,
Adjust your exercise routine for the week.",How to Drop Water Weight2," Sweating out water is one of the quickest ways to drop water weight. If you have access to a sauna or a steam room, take a 30 minute soak to sweat out the fluids and toxins in your body.Spend only 30 minutes at a time in the sauna to avoid dehydration.
You will likely gain the water weight back after drinking or eating, but this is a good way to temporary shed water weight for the night.

, Drinking alcohol can lead to dehydration, which will will then force your body to store excess water to stay hydrated. Avoid that glass of wine or pint of beer before and after exercise to stay hydrated and skip alcoholic beverages for the night if you want to avoid carrying any water weight., Get your heart pounding to pump fresh blood and oxygen to all your tissues, increasing circulation of body fluid and helping the excretory system get rid of waste. Increase the frequency and intensity of your workout for the week to encourage your body to release water weight through sweat. Exercise also elevates your cortisol levels to a healthy level, which helps you work through stress and tension.



High intensity interval training (HIIT)
can help you burn fat and sweat out water weight. This type of training is structured around simple, intense exercises, followed by short bursts for recovery or rest.You can perform HIIT exercises with gym equipment, or an exercise mat and a few free weights.

However, it's generally only kept for a certain amount of days and is very detailed. A food recall is the one of the first places to start when you're not sure why you're not losing weight. Doing a 3 day food recall will help you get a really good and solid idea of what you've been eating. It can give you a lot of insight to whether or not your diet is causing your plateau.
Make sure to include every meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner), snacks (even little nibbles here and there), beverages and portion sizes of items. Try to remember everything that you eat, including sips, tastes, samplers, taste tests, etc. Sometimes the answer to weight gain can be in the small details of your eating habits.
Also note whether or not you ate out, order take out or had a portion of a higher calorie or higher fat food.
Once you've completed your food recall, you're ready to evaluate it to see if there are any issues that are causing your weight plateau.;
, Portion size is a really important issue when it comes to weight loss. Even if you feel like you're eating nutritious and healthy foods, if you're eating too much, that could hinder weight loss.


Take a look at your food recall. Did you note meals or snacks where the portions were a little large? Did you go out to eat and order an appetizer, entree or dessert?
Also note whether or not you stopped measuring portion sizes. Many times if you're following a diet or weighing foods for a diet, you may stop after awhile. This can lead to error in portion sizes and you may end up eating too much.
Be very honest regarding portion sizes. It's natural to feel like you're correct in guesstimating what portion size is correct. However, our brains are now wired for bigger portions. Restaurants serve bigger portions, we use bigger plates and even our kitchen cabinets have gotten bigger to accommodate bigger dinner plates.Make notes on your food recall where you think the portions were a little large. Noting what meals or foods you need help measuring will guide you on how to correct your mistakes later on.
Even if it might seem tedious to measure every crumb and drop, those crumbs and drops might be accounting for your weight plateau or even your weight gain.

, Another very common reason you may be hitting a weight plateau is due to increased snacks or the consumption of treats.


After a little bit of weight loss, you start to feel great. As you continue losing you may begin to feel more comfortable having an extra treat or indulging in a higher calorie food. You've earned it right?
These little slips can make a big difference by the end of a week or month. If you feel like you've been including more treats and food-related rewards for your weight loss, this may be the cause of your stall.Review your food recall to check to see if you notice some of these food treats popping up more often. You'll need to discontinue this behavior to restart your weight loss.

, A common method for weight loss is calorie counting. It helps you track exactly what you take in and what you burn through daily activities and exercise. However, your math may be wrong and be the cause of your weight plateau.Be honest with how well and how accurate your calorie counting is. Just like you may increase your food treats, you may be getting a little sloppy with calorie counting.
In addition, note that some calorie counting and fitness apps overestimate how many calories you burn during exercise or daily activities. It's typically not recommended to follow this amount as they have been found to be inaccurate.
If you use this to guide how much you're allowed to eat during the day, it could cause a plateau and even a gain eventually.

, You may also need to adjust your total calorie intake and lower how many calories you aim for every day. Over time and after weight loss, you may need less calories.


Although a certain calorie level may have resulted in weight loss initially, that same calorie level may be causing you to plateau later on. After you've lost some weight, your body doesn't need as many calories since there's less weight to move around.You'll need to lower your intake or increase exercise to help account for this adjustment. This helps offset the decrease in metabolism that you've experienced from your weight loss.
Try cutting out about 100-200 calories extra daily or increase your exercise to burn off an extra 100-200 calories daily. Reassess to see if this helps restart weight loss.

, You may be surprised that it's not just calories that are important to weight loss. Protein actually is the most essential nutrient when it comes to weight loss and if you're not eating enough you may hit a plateau.Protein is essential for the normal functioning of your body. However, it specifically helps maintain your energy levels, lean muscle mass and metabolism (your body's calorie-burning engine).
If you're cutting calories and portions, you may end up cutting out too much protein. When this happens, your metabolism may slow down and your weight loss will be slowed or halted.
Review your food recall and check for adequate protein. Are you having a source of protein at every meal? Are your snacks high protein? You want to aim to have a 3-4 oz serving of protein at every meal and snack to meet your goals.

, In addition to tracking foods and snacks on your food recall, you should also be tracking how much fluid you're drinking. Aim for a minimum of 64 oz everyday of clear and hydrating fluids.


Water is essential to your health. It helps your body function appropriately and keeps you hydrated throughout the day. If you're not drinking adequate fluids you can become dehydrated very quickly.
Even though you may not feel dehydrated, mild dehydration can affect weight loss. Thirst may be confused for feelings of hunger. This may be the cause of those extra snacks or slightly bigger portions you've been having.Also, dehydration can slow down all your metabolic processes and negatively affects your body's ability to use fat for fuel.Although 64 oz or 8 glasses is the typical recommendation, some people may need more fluids. Depending on your age, gender and activity level, you may need 13 glasses of hydrating fluids each day.
And remember, sugary or caffeinated beverages do not count towards your daily water goal., Just like your food recall, you should also consider doing an exercise recall. Being active regularly during your week plays an important role in your weight loss.Take a look back and see how often you actually exercised during the last week or so. Did you skip more often? Was it rainy and you weren't able to go out? Did work get too busy?
Many times we want to be hitting the gym or going for a run several times a week, but it may not have been realistic for you. If you skipped more often than normal, this could effect how fast you're losing weight.
In addition, as you lose weight, you may need to exercise a little more often or at higher intensities to continue weight loss. If you've been doing the minimum (or even missing a few workouts), this could be the cause of your plateau.

, Another source of activity that can affect your weight loss is daily or lifestyle activity.Think about how active you were during the day and how often you moved during the day.


Lifestyle or baseline activities are the ones you do on a regular basis or as part of your typical day. Walking to your office or taking the stairs at home are examples of lifestyle activities.
Although these activities do not burn many calories, they can add up by the end of the day and have a significant impact. If you haven't been as active or taking as many steps, this may influence your weight loss or cause a plateau.
Look back on your exercise recall and think about how often you took extra steps, took the stairs, did household chores (like vacuuming) or parked father away. If you weren't as active during the day, this is an area that you can improve on to restart weight loss., Another issue that could be affecting your weight is your stress level. It's natural to have fluctuations in stress, but if you're on the high of end of stress you may notice a weight stall.


Stress plays a big role in your weight loss. When you feel stressed, you have increased levels of stress hormones. These can increase your hunger, increase cravings for sugary sweets or high fat foods and make you more tired.These feelings can lead to you sleeping through or skipping a workout, snacking more often or reaching for those not-so-good for you foods.
Think about how stress in your life has affected your eating habits or exercise routine. If they have, you may need to make a point to manage your stress more effectively. You could incorporate yoga, breathing exercises, or something creative into your daily schedule.

, Like stress, sleep plays another big role in your weight loss. If you've been skipping those critical hours of sleep, you may notice a weight stall.


Studies have shown that those people who get less than 6 hours of rest each night are more likely to be overweight and have a much more difficult time losing weight.Think about how much you've been sleeping lately. Have you been getting the recommended 7-9 hours each night?
Also think about the quality of your sleep. You may be in bed for 8 hours, but are you actually sleeping? Do you toss and turn a lot? Are you up watching TV? Are you waking up frequently? These can all affect how much solid sleep you're getting.

, After evaluating your diet, exercise patterns and lifestyle, it'll be important to try to discern why you're not losing weight. However, if you're having difficulty figuring it out or need help to restart weight loss, talk to your doctor and dietitian.


Speak to your doctor about your weight loss efforts and how they've recently stopped. You'll need to let them know how much weight you've lost and how long you've been at a stall.
It's especially important to let your doctor know about other health changes. Are you not sleeping well? Are you having more difficulty managing stress? These are things that can affect your weight but your overall health as well.
A dietitian may be a good resource for you too. These nutrition and health experts are very familiar with weight loss. They can help you reassess your diet and lifestyle and get you back on track with healthy weight loss.

, Something that can help prevent weight plateaus or help you correct them is a food and exercise journal. These help you stay accountable and provide you with information if you need to make changes.


Studies have shown that those people who track their food and exercise more regularly are able to lose more weight and keep it off longer.Start keeping a pen and paper journal or download a journaling app on your smart phone.
Make sure to track most days. It's when you skip multiple days of tracking that you might be making more slip ups.

, Another important long-term accountability measure is portion control. Make sure to measure most of your portions to help you make sure you're eating the correct amount.


Protein is something that's essential to your weight loss. Include a 3-4 oz serving of protein at every meal or snack.Fruits and vegetables, although low in calorie, should also be measured. Measure out 1/2 cup of fruit, 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of leafy greens per serving.Also measure your grains. Each serving should be about 1/2 cup of cooked grains or about 2 oz., Regular and consistent exercise is important to weight loss. Make sure you have a regular exercise routine that you're following in addition to abiding by your weight loss diet.


Exercise, especially aerobic exercise, is great for weight loss. It helps burn calories and helps rev up your metabolism during the day.Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity every week. Walking, jogging, cycling, hiking and dancing all count towards this goal.Also include 1-2 days of strength training activities. Aim to workout for 20 minutes and work every major muscle group.

, One common area many people slip up with is through snacks and drinking too many liquid calories. Monitor these constantly to make sure they don't affect weight loss in the future.


Snacks can be appropriate when you're losing weight if they're smart, well-timed and calorie controlled.Snacks are something that should only be eaten if you're truly hungry, need a pre workout boost or won't make it to your next meal without becoming overly hungry. Make sure they're 150 calories or less per snack.
Liquid calories from sweetened beverages or alcohol can add up quickly. In addition, they don't fill you up so you will continue to eat your normal sized portion on top of this. Stick to water and other sugar-free beverages only.

Drink water.,
Eat a small piece of dark chocolate.,
Have a small snack, like almonds or an avocado.",How to Distract Yourself from Hunger1," Water can pass through your digestive system very quickly, but it can still help decrease your appetite. Sip water and stay hydrated throughout the day to keep your stomach from feeling empty and keeping your hunger levels down.You can also try drinking hot water with lemon and cayenne pepper, or hot ginger tea. Cayenne pepper can help to suppress your appetite and help your stomach stay settled and feel full.Ginger has been used for centuries as a digestive tool, and can help to settle your stomach if you are suffering from hunger pangs. Sip hot ginger tea or chew on crystallized ginger.;
, A little dark chocolate can help to lower your food cravings, as the bitter taste of the chocolate signals your body to decrease your appetite. Savor one to two pieces of dark chocolate with at least 70 percent cocoa., Eating a handful of raw almonds will fuel your body with antioxidants, vitamin E, and magnesium. Almonds have also been shown to increase feelings of fullness and help with weight management.Avocados are full of healthy monounsaturated fats, which take a long time for your body to digest and can help to suppress your appetite. They're also an excellent source of soluble fiber, which forms a thick gel as it travels through your gut, slowing your digestion. Slice up an avocado and sprinkle some honey on it if you like them sweet, or sprinkle salt and pepper, as well as a squeeze of lime for a savory snack."

Find your basal metabolic rate, which will tell you how many calories you need to consume per day.,
Choose the proper foods.,
Balance your nutrients.,
Supplement your diet to some degree to meet the demands of a healthy diet.,
Divide up your meals so that you eat 5-6 small meals a day.,
Live an active lifestyle.",How to Diet Without the Myth of Fat Burning Foods," This will take about a week. You can find your basal metabolic rate online ( http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/ ). Take 15-20% off that number and eat that number of calories instead.;
, Dieting has a tendency to cause you to lose as much muscle as fat. Consuming more protein and dieting at a steady speed (as shown in step 2) will minimize this. A woman might not care much about muscle tissue, but losing it will mean that you have to reach a lower body fat percentage to appear just as skinny as someone who kept their muscle. It also sabotages your diet because it makes your metabolism fall off. Consume 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. This is higher than the recommended daily value, but it is far from dangerous. It will help you hang onto your muscle.

, The rest of your diet should be evenly balanced between fat and carbohydrates. Fat is not the enemy, and neither are carbohydrates. Avoid trans fats and saturated fats. Avoid refined and glycemic index carbohydrates. In general, avoid processed foods altogether. Don't eat fast food or food from restaurants. Don't eat anything with high fructose corn syrup or bleached wheat flour in it. Avoid ""fake"" sugars as well. Some claim they might affect insulin levels or affect the body in other ways.

, Take a multivitamin and get lots of water. You need healthy fats. There are certain essential fatty acids that your body cannot produce; they must be consumed. The best sources of these are salmon, walnuts, flax seeds (oil or ground, as whole won't digest),avocados and fish oil caplets. Oils go rancid quickly, so be sure to refrigerate the oil and freeze any flax seeds. The best low-fat protein sources are skim milk, egg whites, and poultry. Some cuts of red meat are also very low in fat and high in protein. However, they are typically more expensive than their white counterparts. Tuna is also very good. As for carbohydrates, you can consume any low glycemic index carbohydrates you want (and some moderately high ones, too).

, Eating small meals gives your body time to digest and burn up your food or ""fuel"" at a steady rate.

, Get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day. The type of exercise you need will vary, depending on your body weight and physical health and well-being. Regardless, you should be doing a mix of both aerobic (fat-burning) exercises like jogging or interval training, and anaerobic(muscle-building) exercises like resistance or weight training. Anaerobic ensures your metabolism doesn't drop due to dieting while aerobic is best for targeting fat calories.

Calculate your fat-burning zone with a formula.,
Purchase or use a heart rate monitor.,
Take a VO2 Max test.,
Use the talk test.,
Include a variety of cardio exercises.,
Include strength training exercises.,
Meet with a personal trainer or coach.",How to Determine Your Fat Burning Zone," There's a relatively simple formula to help you determine where your fat-burning zone falls. It's not 100% accurate, but will give you a relatively reliable range to aim for.


First, find your maximum heart rate (MHR). To do this, subtract your age from 220 if you're male; subtract your age from 226 if you're female. Your fat-burning zone is between 60% and 70% of your MHR (Your MHR multiplied by .6 or .7).For example, a 40 year old man's MHR would be 180, and his fat-burning zone would be between 108 and 126 beats per minute.;
, There are a variety of heart rate monitors available— watches or wristbands, chest straps, and even built into handle bars of some cardio machines. Heart rate monitors can help you accurately see where your heart rate is and based on your age, height, and weight can also determine your fat-burning zone.


By using a heart rate monitor, you're going to get a more accurate idea of where your fat-burning zone is. This is because the heart rate monitor will calculate your heart rate as you exercise and will then use your actual heart rate information to calculate your fat-burning zone.
Many people that use a heart rate monitor for the first time realize that they may not have been working out as hard as they thought. Pay close attention and challenge yourself- safely.
Although many cardio machines—like a treadmill or elliptical—offer a built-in heart rate monitor, they are not always 100% accurate.
Heart rate monitors that use a chest strap are slightly more accurate than wristbands or watches.They are generally also slightly more expensive.

, A VO2 max test (volume per time, oxygen, and maximum) test will accurately record your body's ability to transport and use oxygen during exercise. This test requires the participant to walk on a treadmill or use a bike and breathe into a face mask that measures oxygen and carbon dioxide levels as your heart rate increases.


This information can then be used to determine at what heart rate level you are burning the most fat and calories in your fat-burning zone.
The VO2 Max test is considered one of the most accurate and reliable testing methods for cardiovascular fitness.You can take a VO2 max test at a gym, some labs, and private doctors offices.

, This is the least technical of all the ways to determine your fat-burning zone. The talk test requires to you talk during exercise and based on how winded you are, you can determine if you need to increase or decrease the intensity of your workout.For example, if you are too winded to talk then you need to decrease the intensity of your workout. If you can talk easily, then you're not working out hard enough.
You should be able to say one short sentence without a problem.

, Choosing a combination of moderate- and high- intensity cardio exercises will typically yield the best results. This will be especially true if your goal is weight loss.Include activities that are moderate-intensity and fall into your fat-burning zone about half of the time. Activities may include: slower jogging, biking or swimming. However, this will be different for everyone.
Also choose some cardio activities that fall into a high-intensity range. Although this falls out of your fat-burning zone, you burn more calories overall and increase your body's cardiovascular fitness levels.In general, you burn more calories at the zone above your fat-burning zone (the aerobic/cardio zone) which is generally at a higher intensity.However, total calories burned also depends on the duration of a workout and it may be easier to do a longer work out in the fat-burning zone as it's at a lower intensity.
Also, aim to reach 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio activity each week at a minimum., Incorporating strength or resistance training into your weekly exercise schedule is important. It helps build and tone muscle in addition to increasing your metabolism.Weight training is critical for fat loss. It is crucial to keep and gain muscle while losing fat mass.


Include strength training at least two days a week for a minimum of 20 minutes.Strength training activities include: weight lifting, isometric exercises (like push-ups or pull-ups) and Pilates.

, If you're interested in your fat-burning zone and how you can best utilize that information, meeting with a personal trainer or coach may be a good option. They can help you find your fat-burning zone and help design an appropriate workout that utilizes that information.


Talk to your trainer or coach about your goals. Is it weight loss? Increasing your muscle mass? This will help them tailor their program to meet your needs.
Also ask how you can utilize your fat-burning zone to your best advantage.

Take up a hobby.,
Socialize.,
Exercise.,
Write in your journal.,
Tackle a problem or chore.",How to Distract Yourself from Hunger2," One study found that a stationary activity, like knitting or crocheting, can help you stop obsessing about food. Focus on a simple hobby you enjoy, like gardening, sewing, or painting. Using a hobby as a distraction can lead to improvement in skill and a shift in focus., Don’t keep your hunger pangs to yourself. Instead, call up a friend and go for a walk together or go see a movie. Focus on spending time with friends or family, instead of on your hunger.Schedule a routine meet up with a friend during a diet so you have a guaranteed distraction for a certain day and time. This may help to motivate you to get through the day without succumbing to hunger and give you something to focus on instead of your grumbling stomach.

, Doing light exercise like a walk around your area or more intense exercise like running or jogging can help you unwind and re focus. According to researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, exercise strengthens your brain’s powers of executive function, including your ability to think ahead and control your inhibitions. This will then make it easier to stop thinking about your hunger pangs.Try taking up a yoga class. Yoga can help you deal with temptations and be a more mindful eater.

, Focus your thoughts on the events of the day or a list of ongoing goals you keep in your journal. You may also want to record your eating habits and the times of day when you feel hungry, as well as how you feel emotionally during these times. Writing down your eating habits will help you distinguish when you’re feeling physically hungry and when you’re feeling emotionally hungry.Physical hunger usually has symptoms like a growling stomach or lightheadedness. Emotional hunger is when you want to eat but you do not feel physically hungry. Writing down your emotions towards food will help you identify your triggers and prevent them from happening.
For example, you may find you get hungry in the afternoon, when you begin to get bored with your work and are looking for a snack. You may then want to change up your routine, like exercising or going for a walk in the afternoon, to prevent emotional eating.

, Be proactive with your time and complete one item on your to do list. Or look over any chores you can do at home and get them done. Rather than reach for food, reach for the broom, the duster, or the sponge and do your dishes or clean your bathroom."

Get eight hours of sleep a night.,
Cut down on your alcohol consumption.,
Keep snacks and other foods out of your sight.",How to Distract Yourself from Hunger3," Being sleep-deprived can lead to anxious snacking and overeating. A good night’s sleep can reduce your cortisol levels, the hormone that rises when you are anxious or stressed. Avoid stress eating by committing to eight hours of sleep a night., Most alcohol can make you hungry and lead to overeating. Enjoy a glass of wine or beer at the end of your meal, instead of before or during the meal. This way you will be drinking on a full stomach and be less likely to be hungry later or end up wanting to snack late at night., Make a rule that your kitchen is off limits after dinner, or at least two hours before bed. If you struggle with hunger during the day, avoid the kitchen or any area in your home that has food.Wrap up snacks and place them in cupboards and out of sight. Put candies or sweets in colored or covered dishes in hard to reach areas. This will help you avoid temptation and take your mind off your hunger.

Talk to your doctor.",How to Decrease Hunger at Work," One of the first methods to managing and decreasing hunger during work hours is making sure that you eat regular and consistent meals. Skipping meals or waiting too long between meals may increase your hunger.Studies have shown that regular and consistent meal consumption in addition to a small snack daily lead to decreased hunger throughout the day.It's important to eat a minimum of 3 meals daily. However, depending on your schedule and office hours, you may need to eat more meals or include a few snacks during the day.
Do not skip meals and do not leave more than 4-5 hours of time in between meals without having a planned snack.;
, One of the best foods to fight hunger during your work day is protein. Always include a source of protein at each meal and snack.


Many studies have showed that higher protein diets and higher protein meals keep you feeling more satisfied during your actual meal and for many hours after you're done eating.Including a source of protein at each meal and snack can help spread out this hunger-fighting nutrient throughout your entire day. Plan to include 1 or 2 servings (about 3-4 oz) of protein at each meal.
If you're concerned about calories or watching your waistline, go for leaner sources of protein which are naturally lower in calories and fat. Try: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, seafood or legumes.

, Another important nutrient that can help keep hunger at bay while you're at the office is fiber. Make each of your meals full of fiber to help manage your appetite.


Studies have shown that those people with higher fiber diets are more satisfied during the day and tend to eat less overall.Fiber provides physical bulk to meals and takes longer to digest.
Women should aim for 25 grams of fiber daily and men should plan on getting about 38 grams daily.Include one or two high fiber foods at each meal and snack. This will help you meet your daily goal but also keep this filling nutrient spread out during the day.
Foods that are high in fiber include: fruits, vegetables, starchy vegetables and whole grains.
Meals and snacks that are high in protein and fiber include: Greek yogurt with nuts and fruit, whole grain wrap filled with lean deli meat and cheese with a small fruit salad, a large spinach salad with raw vegetables and grilled salmon or whole wheat pasta tossed with grilled chicken and steamed vegetables.

, Another neat trick to manage hunger throughout the day is by drinking enough water. If you typically feel hungry frequently or have difficulty managing your appetite, water may be the answer.


If you're not getting enough fluids daily or are even just mildly dehydrated, your brain and body may interpret ""thirst"" as feelings of hunger. You may feel hungry and feel like you need to snack or eat more, when you just need more fluids.To ensure you're not making this mistake, make sure you're drinking adequate fluids each day. Aim for at least 8 glasses, but even up to 13 glasses daily.Also stick to calorie-free, decaf beverages. These are the best. Try: water, flavored water, sparkling water, decaf coffee and tea.

, When you're trying to decrease hunger at work while watching your waistline, you may be looking for low-calorie ways to feel more satisfied. Drinking coffee or tea might help.


Some studies in addition to many anecdotal reports, have shown that coffee helps reduce appetite.Sip on some coffee during the day, especially in between meals, to help trick your brain into thinking you're feeling satisfied and less hunger. You can choose either caffeinated or decaf - they both will have the same effect. However, decaf coffee also counts towards your total amount of hydrating fluids for the day whereas caffeinated does not.
You can also sip on hot tea - like herbal tea. Like coffee, the flavor of the tea can help calm your appetite.
Skip lots of cream and added sugars. Instead go for a splash of skim milk. Also avoid sugary, sweetened coffee beverages or blended coffees from a coffee shop as these are typically higher in calories.

, Another quick trick you can start implementing at work is chewing gum or sucking on sugar-free mints.


Studies have shown that chewing gum or sucking on mints helps you feel less hungry and increases your satiety during the day.The action of chewing and flavor of mint signal your brain that you're satisfied even when you really haven't eaten anything.Again, if you're watching your weight or total calories go for sugar-free gum or sugar-free mints. It will also benefit your teeth.

, Another thing that you can do easily at work is going for a quick walk. This is another easy thing you can do to help manage your appetite while you're at work.


Studies have shown that aerobic activity, like walking, can help reduce your overall appetite.If you're feeling hungry during the day at work, take a quick break and go for a walk. You can even run up and down the stairs a few times if you're able.

, Pack a toothbrush to bring with you to work. Brushing those pearly whites can help kill hunger and any food cravings.


Studies have shown that brushing your teeth right after a meal or snack can help signal your brain that you're done eating. The minty and fresh, clean flavor kills any remaining flavors in your mouth.Purchase a small travel sized toothbrush and toothpaste tube. Bring these to work and give your teeth a quick brush after lunch or snacks.

, Although you typically feel physically hungry at some point during your workday, you may also encounter ""head hunger"" or emotional hunger.


Learn to differentiate the difference between these two forms of hunger. This may help you realize that you may not be as hungry during your workday as previously thought.
Head hunger comes from a variety of things. It can be triggered by an afternoon lull in your work or boredom, stress from other co-workers or your boss, increased workload, or underlying emotional issues like depression.
Typically, emotional hunger comes on suddenly, provides a craving for a very specific food, and persists even after you're full.Physical hunger makes you feel empty, like a pit in your stomach and may come along with hunger pangs, a growling stomach and maybe even some irritability or fatigue., If you think that some of the ""hunger"" you experience during your workday may be emotional or head hunger, consider starting a food journal to help you out.


Begin by tracking all the foods you eat during the day. You may need to bring your journal to work with you or use a smart phone app to keep track of all the snacks or nibbles you eat while you're at work. Note your breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and beverages you eat or drink.
After a few days of this, start adding in feelings and emotions. You can do this periodically throughout the day or at the end of your day. Note if you felt stressed, got in an argument with a co-worker, have been working late hours or if there are stressful things going on at home.
Begin making associations between your eating habits and your emotions. For example, you snacked all afternoon after getting in an argument with your co-worker. This will show you the ""stressor"" and your reaction., If you feel like you're an emotional eater and much of your workday hunger is head hunger, consider building a support group to help you manage this issue.


Studies have shown that you're more likely to give into emotional eating or head hunger without a support group. This is why it's incredibly important to begin building one.Just about anybody you trust can be your support group. Family, friends or even co-workers (especially those who may also be stressed) can be your support. Tell them about your problems and how you're trying to tame your head hunger during the day.
If you find other people at work in the same boat as you, consider going for a daily walk together during lunch or taking a coffee break together to vent.

, Another option you may want to consider is seeing a behavioral specialist, life coach or therapist. These mental health professionals can give you more in-depth counseling about emotional eating.


If you're consistently overeating, snacking or eating large portions due to emotional hunger or feeling like you're hungry all during the day at work, consider seeking extra help through behavior therapy.
Look up a therapist in your area or ask your doctor for a referral. Consider seeing this type of health professional to get extra advice, support and guidance to help curb your emotional eating.

, If you continue to struggle with consistent hunger during the day and feel that dietary and lifestyle changes do not make a difference, go see your doctor for further evaluation.


It's typically not considered normal to feel physical hunger all day long. This is especially true if you're eating regular, nutritious meals and snacks.
Make an appointment with your doctor to talk about your appetite and hunger struggles. Tell him or her how long you've experienced an increase in appetite and what things you've tried to manage it.
Update your doctor regularly and keep in touch. This is important to manage any condition you may have.
Ask for a referral to see a registered dietitian if you feel like your diet could be improved.

Know your quinoa.,
Rinse your quinoa.,
Cook basic quinoa.",How to Add Flavor to Quinoa1," There are plenty of particular strands of quinoa available, and the choices you make at the supermarket will have a significant impact on the way your recipe tastes. Normally, when people mention quinoa, they are referring to the white, plain variety. Consequently, plain quinoa is the most versatile and dependable type out there. If you haven't had much experience cooking with quinoa before, it is recommended you start out with white quinoa. It's also the fastest cooking-- between ten and fifteen minutes.



Red quinoa holds its shape after cooking, so it's the best choice for salads. Its colour and vibrancy create a perfect bed for vegetables or proteins, like meat and legumes. .Red quinoa takes a little longer to cook-- around twelve to seventeen minutes.

Black quinoa is slightly sweeter and earthier than its plain counterpart. Its striking colour makes it the recommended choice if you're wanting your recipe to be visually (as well as flavourfully) memorable. However, black quinoa takes the longest time to cook in the pot-- between thirteen and eighteen minutes.;
, After you've decided what type of quinoa you want to use, it is important to give the seeds a proper rinse. Quinoa grows with a protective coating called saponin that tastes bitter when not rinsed off properly. Place the quinoa in a fine-meshed sieve and run cold water through it, making sure the water hits to every morsel. Although most storebought quinoa is already pre-rinsed, it's recommended you give it a good once-over yourself. It doesn't need to be anything drastic; a two minute rinse is more than enough to get most, if not all of the bitterness away from your quinoa. , Before moving onto adding taste and zest to your quinoa, it is important to note how to prepare it. To prepare the quinoa for your recipe, add a cup and a half of water to a pot for each cup of grain you'll be using. Wait until the water begins to boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Add the quinoa, and wait for the given amount of time listed in the examples above. Following that, you will have a supply of quinoa to use in virtually any dish.


Return the quinoa to the pan and let it rest for about fifteen minutes before using it in a recipe. It will dry out a bit and your quinoa will be light and fluffy, not soggy and clumped.Rather than a pot, you can cook quinoa using a rice maker. Although their appearance may vary, the manner in which they cook is quite similar, and using a rice maker may alleviate some of the workload for you. Keep in mind, however, that quinoa (10-20 minutes) takes considerably less time to cook than rice (40 minutes); that fact should be considered if using anything conventionally used for making rice.
For an alternative preliminary cooking method, you can put the quinoa in a skillet with a bit of oil (canola, olive, or sesame) over low to medium heat. Stir constantly for six to eight minutes, watching to make sure it does not burn. Putting the quinoa over heat will help to bring out the natural nutty flavour before you add it to your recipe. If you're strapped for time and looking for something really simple, quinoa tends to be significantly better tasting left plain than a lot of other grains. Adding some salt and pepper to plain quinoa can be an enjoyable, if somewhat Spartan meal.

Be aware of your required iodine intake, based on age and gender.,
Add table salt to your meals.,
Don't have more than 1/2 teaspoon of salt every day.,
Consume more dairy and eggs.,
Eat more seafood.,
Check for your geographical region of leaving

See whether you stay in sea region or water body region.,
Have more enriched grain products like enriched bread and pasta.,
Add more beans to your diet, especially if you are vegetarian or vegan.,
Don’t eat too much seaweed.",How to Add More Iodine to Your Diet1," Depending on your age and gender, you will need to ensure you are getting a certain amount of iodine each day.If you are 0-6 months: you need 110 micrograms per day (mcg/day) of iodine.
If you are 7-12 months: 130 mcg/day.
If you are 1-3 years old: 90 mcg/day.
If you are 4-8 years old: 90 mcg/day.
If you are 9-13 years old: 120 mcg/day.
If you are male and 14 and older: 150 mcg/day.
If you are female and 14 and older: 150 mcg/day.
Women who are pregnant or breast feeding need higher amounts of iodine. Speak to your doctor about exactly how much iodine you should be getting every day based on your age, gender, and other factors, such as pregnancy.;
, Most table salts have iodine as an added ingredient. Unless you are on a low-sodium diet, adding table salt to your meals every day is an effective way to add iodine to your diet. Most adults can get 100% of their daily intake of iodine by adding a total of just over 1/2 teaspoon of iodized table salt (approximately 3g) to their meals.You can add iodized salt when you cook and bake. For example, if a recipe calls for salt, use iodized table salt. Iodized table salt does not taste any different from normal table salt.
You can also replace your salt shaker with iodized table salt. That way, when you reach for salt during a meal, you are also adding iodine to your dish.

, A diet with too much salt could lead to the same symptoms as iodine deficiency, including goiter and hyperthyroidism., Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese are all good sources of iodine. Incorporate a variety of dairy products into your diet, as well as eggs.Start your morning with a bowl of yogurt. A single cup of plain, low-fat yogurt can provide up to 50% of your daily recommended iodine intake. Add fresh fruit, granola, and honey for flavor and more essential nutrients.Drink reduced fat milk. A single cup of skim or 1% milk can provide almost 40% of your daily recommended intake of iodine.
Have eggs for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. A single large egg can provide about 16% of your daily iodine intake; serve it on toast, in a breakfast burrito, poached with asparagus, or in a quiche.
Add goat’s cheese to your salad or to your pizza. Cheese is high in iodine and also contains essential B vitamins, calcium, and protein. One ounce of raw cheddar cheese contains around 10-15 mcg of iodine. Goat’s milk is usually easier for most people’s digestive system and contains high levels of calcium and protein., Seafood, such as cod, haddock, and shrimp, are all excellent sources of iodine. Focus on eating a variety of seafood to get the healthy fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and iodine you need to maintain a healthy concentration of iodine in your body.Go for white fish like cod, sea bass, and haddock. Bake the white fish or steam it to get the most nutritional benefits, and ⅔ of your daily recommended intake of iodine.
Have a tuna sandwich for lunch or shrimp cocktail as an appetizer or a snack. A can of tuna, about 3 ounces, can provide about ¼ of your daily iodine intake. 3 ounces of shrimp proves nearly ¼ of your daily iodine intake.
Be wary of overeating seafood as certain seafood can contain high levels of mercury, which can be toxic if they are over consumed. Seafood such as haddock, whitefish, trout, shrimp, and scallops are known to have the least amount of mercury. Avoid eating seafood such as ahi tuna, canned albacore tuna, sea bass, bluefish, and swordfish, as these are known to have higher levels of mercury.

, Because this region posses more iodine salt quantity in it naturally.
The vegetables and fruits grew in sea region having more natural iodine salt., Enriched grains are products where certain B vitamins and iron have been added to them after processing. They are also great sources of iodine.


Look for enriched bread at your grocery store. Many brands will state if they are enriched on the label.
Make whole wheat enriched pasta with cod or other seafood to have a meal rich with iodine.

, Vegetarians and vegans are at a higher risk for iodine deficiency as they do not eat iodine rich sources like seafood or dairy products. Beans, especially navy beans, are high in iodine and fiber., Seaweed is naturally concentrated with lots of iodine, but it can provide excessive amounts of iodine in your body, especially brown seaweed such as kelp. So only eat seaweed once a week (yes, the seaweed that is wrapped around your sushi counts), especially if you are pregnant.Excessive amounts of iodine can lead to serious health issues including goiter and hyperthyroidism."

Add spices and herbs to your quinoa while it’s cooking.Quinoa will absorb the flavours around it.,
Cook quinoa in broth instead of water.,
Apply an oil to the quinoa as it begins to cook.,
Add sauce to quinoa.",How to Add Flavor to Quinoa2," Once you've rinsed and prepped your quinoa, the most straightforward and commonplace manner of adding flavour to it is via adding spices, as you would a conventional grain like rice. A bay leaf, smashed garlic clove, a pinch of salt, a bit of black pepper-- all are tried-and-tested spices to combine with quinoa.


Create a spice satchel if you just desire the fragrance in your quinoa. This can be accomplished by placing your herbs into a small square of cheesecloth. Tie the cheesecloth closed with a bit of kitchen twine. Add the satchel directly to the water before the quinoa is added. Let it cook with the quinoa, then remove it after the quinoa is cooked.

, Because of quinoa's ability to soak up flavours and liquids so effectively, cooking it in a flavoured broth is a quick and easy way to make the morsels flavourful. Experimenting with different kinds of stock will yield different flavours; it's recommended you try at least a couple to get some impression of this seed's versatility.


A vegetable stock (like mushroom) or chicken stock will give it a mild flavor. Beef stock or seafood stock will give it the most distinct flavor. To tone the flavor down, use half water and half stock.
Choose low-sodium broth options for a healthier option. They will still bring a lot of flavor to your dish. To get more flavor, use bouillon cubes-- keep in mind, however, that bouillon cubes will notably increase the sodium content.

, Sesame seed oil, coconut oil, or walnut oil will give a subtle nuance to the flavour of your quinoa. Adding a tablespoon of oil per cup of quinoa is recommended if you are cooking the quinoa via saucepan. , As with a great many other dishes, sauce is a powerful way to inject some flavour into your meal. There are countless sauces to chose from, and considering how malleable quinoa is tastewise, a chosen sauce will likely have the greatest determinant effect on the dish. If you're looking for potential scenarios to combine sauce and quinoa in, think of other grains you regularly sauce. Even pasta may be reasonably substituted with quinoa. While you may want to try simmering a basic tomato sauce alongside your quinoa to start, the possibilities are virtually endless. Try searching online for a few basic recipes; with the upsurge of quinoa's recent popularity, there are plenty of cooking blogs that are more than willing to take the guesswork out of your equation.

Add fruits and vegetables to your quinoa.,
Combine meat and quinoa for a rich and hearty dish.,
Use quinoa in any place you’d use lentils, corn, millet, rice, or pasta.,
Bake a recipe with quinoa.,
Try quinoa flakes.",How to Add Flavor to Quinoa3," While quinoa will effectively soak up the flavours around it, its natural taste may go together very well with other ingredients. Throwing in seasonal fruits and vegetables to your quinoa will make a delicious meal. In particular, quinoa goes well with citrus and apples to create sweet and light dishes. It is also complementary with leafy greens and less starchy vegetables. Experiment to find what you like.


Add lime and orange juice with their accompanying zest to serve with seafood.
Add tomato, avocado, and lime for a southwest flavor.
Add squash, peppers, and corn for a delicious succotash.
Try mustard greens and garlic if you feel like spicing it up a bit.

, As beef tends to be quite juicy, it is the recommended standard in this case. In particular, ground meat complements a quinoa dish; the smaller the meat chunks, the more surface area the meat offers to disperse its flavour amidst the grains, and having the meat at a similar size to the grains will offer a much more balanced consistency, allowing the ingredients to proportion themselves evenly with each bite.

, You will enjoy a much healthier and nutritious dish. Try using quinoa in place of tortillas when you make enchiladas next! Although the cooking instructions for quinoa may vary from the ingredient it is replacing, you'll find quinoa adapts to these dishes quite well, and in some cases, may even surpass the original for taste as well as nutrition's sake!


For example: Try making quinoa like you would a risotto. Sauté a chopped onion in olive oil. Add your rinsed quinoa to the pan until it is coated with oil. Add warm liquid a bit at a time, stirring frequently, until it is creamy, cooked through, and delicious.This is especially delicious with a seafood added.

, In the case of baking, quinoa is perfectly suited to replacing other ingredients you would otherwise use as a primary base, like white flour. From healthy breakfast bars to chocolate cookies to donuts, there are many recipes available to try. Adding or substituting quinoa will make the recipe delicious and far more nutritious.Quinoa, like other grains, can be ground into a fine flour. Quinoa flour has a bit of a sour odour that works great in bread and English muffin recipes. But don’t be afraid to try it in pastries, especially in tandem with other gluten-free flours. The protein in the flour will help give your dough more structure and rise., An important side to adding flavour to quinoa is exploring the ways it can replace other ingredients. Quinoa flakes are a fine alternative to rolled oats, and serve to add more protein to your oat-based breakfasts, snacks and desserts. Just as you would with morning oatmeal, adding syrup or berries can make for a quick, delicious breakfast.They make great hot cereal, but they are a great addition to waffles, pancakes, granolas, and cookies."

Talk to your doctor before you take iodine supplements.,
Look for ‘potassium iodide’ supplements.,
Take multivitamin and mineral supplements if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.",How to Add More Iodine to Your Diet2," Most adults who follow a healthy, balanced diet that contains milk, dairy products, and fish should be able to meet their iodine requirements. But supplements containing iodine can help you meet your iodine needs if you do not or cannot consume iodine-rich foods. It’s important to speak to your doctor before you take iodine supplements to ensure you are taking the correct amount and you are taking the iodine supplement that is right for your body.If you have thyroid disease, are taking other medication, or have experienced iodine deficiency over a long period of time, you should always talk to your doctor before taking supplements.

, The capsules should not exceed the daily adult requirement of 150 mcg/day.Do not take seaweed or kelp supplements as sources of iodine. The amount of iodine in these supplements can vary and in some cases, provide excessive quantities of iodine.

, It can be difficult to meet the higher recommended iodine intake when you are pregnant or breastfeeding through just diet alone. But many multivitamin and mineral supplements contain iodine. Check the labels of these supplements to make sure they provide 140 - 150 mcg of iodine. The remainder of the required iodine intake can be met by your diet.If you consume high quantities of iodine-rich foods while pregnant, you may not need to take an iodine supplement. Check with your doctor about your iodine levels before you take any supplements.

Recognize the symptoms of an iodine deficiency.,
Get tested for an iodine deficiency.,
Be aware of the health issues associated with consuming too much iodine.",How to Add More Iodine to Your Diet3," All of the symptoms of iodine deficiency are related to its effect on your thyroid. Your thyroid is a gland in your throat that regulates your metabolic processes, such as growth and energy in your body. If you don’t have enough iodine in your diet, this can lead to iodine deficiency disorders such as:Goiter: This is when your thyroid enlarges, or develops a goiter, as it tries to keep up with the demand for thyroid hormone production in your body. Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of goiter. If you have goiter, you may experience symptoms like choking, especially when lying down, and difficulty swallowing and breathing.
Hypothyroidism: This is when you have an underactive thyroid gland, as your thyroid can’t make enough thyroid hormone to keep your body running normally. If you have hypothyroidism, your body’s processes will start to slow down. You may feel colder, tire more easily, your skin may get drier, and you may become forgetful or depressed. The symptoms for hypothyroidism are variable so the only way to confirm you have this disorder is to get a blood test. Patients with thyroid disorders should not automatically start an iodine supplement because there are certain types of thyroid disease that are contraindications for iodine supplements.
Pregnancy related issues: Severe iodine deficiency in mothers has been associated with miscarriages, stillbirth, preterm delivery, and congenital abnormalities. The children of mothers with severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy can have mental issues and problems with growth, hearing, and speech. In fact, even mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy may be associated with low intelligence in children., Iodine is released from your body when you pee. Thus, the best way to determine if you have iodine deficiency is to speak to your doctor and have her do tests on your urine.She will then be able to look at the results and check if you have an iodine deficiency based on the iodine concentration in your urine sample., If you already have thyroid problems, like hyperthyroidism, too much iodine can actually worsen your thyroid disorder. Follow the minimum amount of iodine required for you, based on your age and gender. Adults should not exceed 600 mcg/day of iodine to avoid consuming too much iodine.Some people who move from an iodine-deficient region, such as parts of Europe, to a region with higher levels of iodine, such as the United States, may also develop thyroid problems since their thyroids have gotten used to taking in small amounts of iodine. This may then put them at risk of developing hyperthyroidism."

Focus on getting better at a skill or a hobby.,
Set personal goals.,
Join a club or group where you can meet other pre-teens who share your interests or hobbies.,
Get involved in school activities or events.,
Volunteer your time with an organization you believe in.",How to Deal With Being an Overweight Preteen1," Though you may struggle with your weight, you can build your self-esteem by taking the time to focus on getting better at a skill or a hobby that you are good at and enjoy doing. This could be a love for drawing or painting, gardening, crocheting or knitting, dancing, or learning how to do woodworking. Working on getting better at a hobby or skill will help you to gain more confidence and feel good about yourself.Talk to your parents or guardians about taking a class in a certain skill or getting supplies and materials to work on a certain hobby. Look to them for support and guidance as you try to improve your self-esteem.
See if any of your friends share an interest in your hobby. If so, it might be fun to work on the hobby as a group.;
, It can also be motivating to set personal goals for yourself, where you list five to ten specific goals that you will achieve within a set period of time. These goals can be small, such as going for a walk every day for 30 minutes. You can write goals that focus on fitness, socializing, getting better at a hobby or skill, or doing better academically at school.Make sure you create goals that are specific but also realistic. You should also set a due date for each goal so you have a set time frame to check the goal off your list. This will help to motivate you to achieve the goal and feel a sense of accomplishment when you finally do check it off the list.

, Work on your self-esteem by being more social with others and getting more comfortable being around new people. Look for a club or a group in your area where you can meet other pre-teens who are also into a certain card game or a specific skill and join this club or group. A weekly club meeting will allow you to socialize with others who have common interests with you on a regular basis.Building relationships with close friends can also help you to feel more self assured and self aware.

, Rather than avoid school activities or events, focus on getting involved and connecting with your peers at school. This may mean joining the yearbook committee or participating in after school activities with other students.Focus on getting involved with people who are good for you.


Spending time with people who say and do negative things to you will not make you happy and healthy. Seek out those that are helpful and kind to you.

, Giving back to others can also be another way to build your self-esteem and allow you to connect with others in a generous and open way. Volunteer your time at a soup kitchen with your parents or invite friends to volunteer with you at the children’s hospital in your area.For example, if you like to knit or crochet, consider joining a group that makes blankets and hats for newborn babies.

Use several techniques to measure your body fat.",How to Decrease Body Fat Percentage," You've definitely heard it before: to get rid of that stubborn fat and start building muscle, you need protein. The body can burn protein to survive, but it prefers carbohydrates and fats; so when you feed it mainly protein, it will go for the carbohydrates and fats you already have stored. That and protein builds and repairs muscle!


Fish and chicken are great sources of the stuff — you generally want to stick to the lean, white meats. Low-fat dairy is good, too, and beans, soy, and eggs are efficient sources as well.A normal person should have between 10 and 25% of their daily caloric intake from protein.
We are not forgetting fiber! It's slow to digest, helps you feel full and it acts like a sponge to water and fat. So add beans, whole grains, brown rice, nuts, and berries onto that list of awesome foods to eat you have going.;
, Some people believe that a no-fat or low-fat diet automatically makes for a good diet. Well, a low-fat diet, sure, but only if you do it right. You want to stick to the good fats, such as unsaturated, omega-3s, and omega-6s.


The fats that you should keep in your diet should be from fatty fish like salmon, olive oils, avocados, and nuts. However, just because they're good doesn't mean you should overdo it. Always consume any food in moderation.
In case it needs to be said, the fats you want to avoid are the ones that come in packages. That includes the frozen ones! Stay away from cookies, cakes, potato chips, and fast and fried foods. They're just not worth the calories.
Fats that are solid at room temperature are full of saturated fat, which you should avoid. This includes butter, lard, and coconut oil.

, This is where things start to get a little confusing. There are very, very different schools of thought when it comes to carbohydrate. There's the Atkins camp which says no-carbohydrate is the way to go. Well, sure, that'll get you to burn fat, but it's totally unsustainable and anything that recommends you cut out 60% of your body's preferred energy should be questioned. Instead, let's consider some other ideas:



Carbohydrate cycling. The science behind it is that you have a couple low-carbohydrate days (about 1g per pound of body weight) that get your body into a catabolic fat burning state. But then you have a day of high-carbohydrate intake, that gets your metabolism running. Without that high-carb day, your metabolism starts shutting down.Timed intake. Complex carbohydrate (brown rice, beans, oats) can be consumed before 6 p.m. (in general, late night eating isn't advised). Simple carbohydrates (fruit, sweetened yogurt, honey), however, should only be consumed post-workout. When the body is still reviving from your sweat session, the simple carbohydrates get stored as glycogen, not fat. Otherwise, they should be primarily avoided.

, We've talked about carbohydrate cycling, but there's calorie cycling, too. And it's the same science behind it: if you don't eat enough calories, your body freaks out, starts shutting down and eats away at your muscles. Therefore, when you're on a low-calorie diet, you have to have days of higher caloric intake to keep it going and your metabolism up.


1,200 calories and under is where starvation mode generally starts. If you're interested in calorie cycling, know how many calories your body needs before you start playing around with the numbers. You can have days under this number, but make sure they're not consecutive. To determine how many calories you should be eating a day to meet your needs and goals, consult with your physician or a registered dietitian.
This method is good for those who have plateaued. If you have that last bit of fat you want to lose, give this a shot.



, Getting rid of body fat is all about the metabolism, especially when all you have to do is get rid of that last 5-10 lb. And to keep up the metabolism, you gotta be eating constantly. But hold it! You've probably heard that eating 5-6 small meals a day is key. Well, it's close. But it's not perfect. Here's the thing:


When you eat small meals all the time, your body is constantly producing insulin and never getting to a burn stage. That, and you never really feel 100% satisfied. So instead of eating 5-6 small meals a day, eat three decent ones and two snacks. It's the same idea, but refined for efficacy.Breakfast! Let's say it together: breakfast! It's so important. Your body needs to know that it can start burning calories and breakfast is exactly that flag.
There are no magic foods that will burn fat by themselves. While a healthy diet can help you lose weight, only exercise can turn your fat into muscle.

, While cardio does burn calories faster than weightlifting, if you want maximum fat burning, you need to do both. If you want to get toned, go for less weight and more repetitions when it comes to strength training. And if you're looking to bulk up, go for more weight and fewer repetitions. But anything is good!


Cardio has any number of forms — swimming, boxing, running, and cycling might be some of the most common, but don't forget basketball, chasing the kids around, walking the dog, and dancing! If it gets your heart pounding, it counts.

, There are two things you want to prepare yourself against: plateauing and boredom. They're both terrible in their own ways. And the best way to fight these (if not the only way)? Crosstraining. That basically means you're doing a bunch of different activities, switching it up on your mind and body. Your mind doesn't think, ""Aww, man, this again?!"" and your muscles don't get used to it and aren't just phoning it in.


For example, on Monday, you're hitting the pavement, Tuesday you're going for a swim, Wednesday is your day of rest, Thursday is the elliptical, and Friday is cycling. Easy! You could combine activities in one day, too.

, Alright, more controversy. There's a whole bunch of stuff out there that'll tell you so-and-so time is best for cardio and so-and-so time is best for weights and then there's others that'll tell you the time that is best is the time that feels best to you. Here's the lowdown:

Some people say that cardio on an empty stomach in the morning is best. Your body has been fasting all night and it's going straight to those fat stores. Others say nope, your body goes straight for your muscles.The verdict? Well, if it makes you feel dizzy and nauseated, we're going to go with the latter.
Some say that weights should be done before cardio. Cardio depletes your glycogen stores, so when you go to hit the weights, you can't do it. And when you can't do it, you don't build muscle. However, this is more important for the body-building types than the ""I just want to get rid of the double wave"" types.Others say that you should do them at separate times entirely (cardio and weights, that is). Some say it depends on your goal (Weight loss? Do cardio first). Some say it doesn't matter, just DO IT.In other words? Do whatever you think is best — they all have their merits.

, High-intensity interval training is all the rage nowadays. Studies have shown that it burns more fat in less time and everyone is jumping on the bandwagon. It jumps up your metabolism right away and keeps it up after, too — so much that the term ""after burn effect"" has been coined.So even if you have 15 minutes to work out, no excuses!


There's no hard-and-fast rule to HIIT. It just involves cycling between low-intensity work and high-intensity work. An example? A 1 minute walk on the treadmill followed by 30 seconds of a dead-sprint. But the ratios are up to you!

, Really. You may feel like a powerhouse that just can't be stopped, but your body needs to rest. Especially if you're lifting weights like it's your job; your muscles need time to repair themselves. So take a day to take it easy. You don't have to sit on the couch all day, but do allow your body to heal itself.


Weights should only be done back-to-back if you're working different muscle groups (i.e., legs one day, arms and shoulders the next). Cardio, however, can (and should) be done most days of the week.

, Your body needs them to function normally. Studies have shown that people that get at least 7 or 8 hours a night lose more fat than those who don't.Furthermore, people who sleep less have higher amounts of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin, which causes them to be hungrier and eat more., It's practically the easiest dieting tactic there is. When you drink more water, your body gets flushed of toxins and doesn't want to eat as much. That's aside from the benefits it has on your organs, skin, hair, and nails.


Women should aim for about three liters a day; men about four (that's including the water in food)., Studies have shown that caffeine stimulates the nervous system and increases our levels of epinephrine. That epinephrine manifests as an adrenaline rush and sends signals to our body to start breaking down fat tissue. Then those fatty acids are free to be released and used up in our blood.If you want to see if it works for you, drink a cup of coffee prior to your workout.


It's less effective if your stomach is already full of food, so keep the cup of coffee by itself or with a small snack. And, yes, it's caffeine, that does it, not coffee — but most other sources of caffeine aren't that good for you (read: soda). However, an ounce of dark chocolate wouldn't be terrible and it has caffeine, too!

, If it's anything that has an end point, it's just not that healthy. Whether you're juicing, fasting, or just cutting out one food group, if it's not sustainable, it's probably not that good. You might see some serious results initially, but in the long-run it messes with your metabolism and ultimately messes you up. So avoid them. Stay healthy and avoid them.

, There are over half a dozen ways out there to measure your body fat percentage and not all of them are 100% accurate all the time. Always measure your body fat at the same time (for example, Monday mornings) and under the same conditions (before breakfast or after drinking a glass of water). Try several different methods for the best accuracy.


Common methods include calipers, body fat scales and monitors, Bod Pods, water displacement, and DEXA scanning. Generally the more expensive it is, the more accurate it is. If you can afford it, try a couple different things to give yourself an accurate idea.A couple of percentage points is a big deal!
A personal trainer or registered dietitian may be able to help you measure and calculate your body fat using scales, tape measure, or calipers. Some health and gym facilities may offer more expensive forms of testing, such as Bod Pods, water displacement, or DEXA scanning.
A ""fit"" female has between 21-24% body fat, though acceptable is up to 31%. For men, fit is 14-17% and acceptable is up to 25%. Everyone has an essential fat level (for men it's much lower) that you can never get rid of without hurting yourself.So know what's best for you! And what's realistic.

They can also be a heart healthy snack that you can eat on the go.Almonds, cashews, pecans, peanuts and pine nuts are all high in healthy fats.
You might also want to eat more pumpkin, sunflower, and sesame seeds.
If you need a healthy snack, try an almond trail mix."

Learn about nutrition and create a meal plan.,
Cook with your parents or guardians.,
Bring healthy snacks to school.,
Join a sports team at school.,
Integrate physical activity into your daily routine.,
Focus on improving your health, rather than your weight.",How to Deal With Being an Overweight Preteen2," Adjust your diet so it is based on a healthy meal plan. Your meal plan should account for three meals a day and include the five food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, lean meat or plant based proteins (such as tofu), and dairy.Work with your parents to create a weekly meal plan for the entire household, where you all focus on healthy eating every day. Creating the meal plans together will help you feel supported.
Even if your family is not able to work with you on creating a meal plan, take the time to become an expert in nutrition. Read about it, and you will be able to help yourself and those around you who want to learn as well, such as your friends.

, Offer to help your parents prepare the meals or cook a portion of the meal together. Getting involved in the process will allow you to know every ingredient that goes into the meal and be an active part of eating healthy at home.You can also cook enough food to take leftovers to school the next day. Packing your own lunch every day will help you to stay healthy and avoid vending machine food or processed high calorie school food.
You can also cook with your friends, form a group, learn about nutrition and cooking together, and make and eat your meal together.

, Develop healthier eating habits at school by packing healthy snacks, like a ziplock bag of nuts or fresh fruit, and bringing them to school. This way, if you get hungry between classes or after school on your way home, you can pull out the healthy snacks and satisfy your hunger with food that is good for you.If you have a locker at school, you can also keep healthy snacks in your locker to pull out between periods or when you have free time between classes. Make sure you only store non perishable snacks, like nuts, protein bars, or pretzels, in your locker so they do not go bad.
It’s a lot easier to eat healthy when you plan ahead. Plan out your snacks ahead of time rather than just getting a candy bar or bag of chips from the vending machine.

, Be more physically active by joining a sports team at your school like the track and field team or the swim team. Talk to the coach beforehand if you want. The coach will most likely be very supportive and can give you tips along the way. This will allow the coach to better understand your fitness level and support you as you play on the team., This means always trying to work your body in someway as you do daily activities, such as walking home from school, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, dancing around the house, doing household chores, and going for walks with family or friends. Integrating physical activity into your daily routine can help you get into the habit of doing something physical every day.Reach out to your parents and talk about ways to get the whole family to be more physically active together. This could mean making a daylight hours policy, where your whole family plays outside together after school and on weekends, rather than stay inside and do inactive things like watch TV.

, It can be hard to feel good about yourself when you see skinny models in magazines or slim men and women on television, who are considered beautiful or desirable. Remember that the purpose of these ads on TV or in magazines is purely to sell products; it’s not the real world. Your physical beauty will naturally become more apparent to you as you work on getting fit and staying healthy.

Ask your parents or guardians for professional support.,
Talk to a school counselor.,
Reach out to a mentor or a teacher.",How to Deal With Being an Overweight Preteen3," If you are struggling with anxiety, depression, or loneliness due to your weight issues, you should consider getting professional help. Talk to your parents or guardians about scheduling a meeting with a professional therapist who specialize in eating issues for pre-teens., You can also seek professional guidance by talking to your school counselor, who should be trained at helping pre-teens with eating issues. Set up an appointment and be as honest and open as possible. Be straightforward about your struggles and listen to the counselor’s suggestions on how to cope with your weight issues.Similarly, talking to a social worker may help you.

, Though your mentor or teacher may not be a professional counselor, they can still be a good listener and offer advice. Confide in a mentor you trust at school or at home and ask them if they think you may need professional help. Sometimes it can be helpful just to talk to someone about your feelings and know that that they care about your wellbeing, even when you are dealing with issues with your weight and your body image."

Cook lean meats.,
Eat less dairy.,
Steer clear of tropical oils.,
Avoid hydrogenated oils and trans-fats.",How to Add Good Fats to Your Diet2," When you are preparing meals, choose lean meats. The solid fatty content of most meat is a saturated fat, and most meats have limited amounts of trans-fat. In order to avoid eating unhealthy fats, Cook meats that have a low-fat content or trim off excess fat.Avoid processed foods like bacon, sausage or ground beef.
Choose lean meats like white chicken meat, pork with the fat trimmed off, and lean beef.
Saturated fat increases the amount of LDL cholesterol in your system, which can lead to a buildup of plaque in the arteries.

, Almost all animal products, including dairy, are high in saturated fat. Cheese, milk, ice cream and other dairy-based foods contain fats that may increase your risk of heart disease. Try to minimize the amount of dairy based foods you eat and look for healthier substitutes, like soy products.You should also avoid using butter and lard in your cooking. Instead, use a healthy oil.

, Coconut and palm oils are high in saturated fats. These oils are often depicted as healthy alternatives to trans-fats in certain products.However, they have high levels of saturated fats and should be avoided.Try to use healthy oils instead of tropical oils.
The cultivation of these oils also results in severe deforestation, which deeply impacts tropical environments.

, Hydrogenated oils are liquid vegetable oils that have had hydrogen added to them through an industrial process. The result is a more solid fat that is inexpensive to use, easy to make, and will last a long time. However, trans-fats dramatically increase your LDL cholesterol levels, leading to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.Many processed foods contain high levels of trans-fats. Trans-fats are also common in most fast food.


Check the nutritional label on any food product to see if they contain trans-fats.
If you are at a restaurant, ask about what kinds of oils are used to prepare the food.

Use more olive oil.,
Try cooking with canola oil.,
Cook with corn oil.,
Consider other oils.,
Know your oil’s smoke point.",How to Add Good Fats to Your Diet3," When preparing foods, you may want to consider using heart-healthy olive oil. This oil is high in monounsaturated fatty acids, which are considered a healthy dietary fat, and can improve your heart health by lowering your total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels.Olive oil is best used to make salad dressings or cook foods at a low or medium heat (less than 365 degrees Fahrenheit or 185 degrees Celsius).If you cook olive oil at high heats, it will begin to burn and lose its healthy qualities. Use canola or peanut oil at higher temperatures.
Olive oil is the healthiest when it is fresh. Exposure to air and light causes the oil to lose its heart-health benefits. Be sure to store your olive oil in a cool place and away from light.

, The oil made from canola seeds is high in monounsaturated fat and is a heart-healthy choice for when you are cooking at a higher heat.It is also much cheaper than most other oils and widely available. However, depending on how the canola oil is processed, it may contain higher levels of trans-fats, which increase the risk of heart disease.Consider buying canola oil that has been cold pressed to get the oil’s healthy fats.


Avoid burning canola oil. This can cause it to lose its health benefits.
Canola oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for heart and brain health.

, Common corn oil can be a heart healthy option for cooking. This oil is high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are a healthy dietary fat linked to improved heart health.You should use corn oil when you are sautéing vegetables or searing meats at high heat.Be sure to avoid hydrogenated corn oil. This can increase the amount of LDL cholesterol in your diet. The product’s nutritional label should tell you if it is hydrogenated or not.

, If you are looking for cooking oils high in healthy fats, there are a number of different options. Peanut and sunflower oils are high in monounsaturated fats, while cottonseed and soybean oil are high in polyunsaturated fats.Specialty oils, like grapeseed, sesame or avocado, are also healthy choices. However, they can also be more expensive.In general, buy oils with less than 4 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon.
Avoid all partially hydrogenated oils or trans-fat.

, Before you cook a dish, be sure to check you oils smoke point. This is the temperature at which your oil will begin to burn and give off smoke. Once oil begins to burn, it loses many of its healthy qualities.Oils with high smoke points (over 365 degrees Fahrenheit or 185 degrees Celsius) are good for high-heat frying or stir-frying. These include corn, soybean, peanut and sesame oil.
Oils with a medium smoke point (less than 365 degrees Fahrenheit or 185 degrees Celsius) are good for sautéing over medium-high heat. These include olive, canola and grapeseed oil.
Oils with a low smoke point should generally not be heated and saved for use in salads and dips. These oils include flaxseed and walnut.

Consider the impact on your health.,
Consume 5 portions of fruit a day.,
Have fruit for breakfast.,
Use fruit for snacking.,
Be careful of fruit labels.,
Try eating 5 a day for a week.,
Eat your favorite fruit within 20 minutes of waking up.",How to Add Fruit to Your Diet," Eating fruit as part of your daily diet can help you maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of heart disease, strokes and some cancers. Also, fruit contains a great variety of vitamins and minerals, carbohydrates and fiber. So, eating the right combinations of fruit is particularly good for you. For instance, an apple is high in fiber but low in vitamin C, but if you add an orange and some strawberries, then you will get all the vitamin C you need for that day.;
, Many countries have national or regional programs in place to encourage everyone to eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day (and often more). See ""External Links"" for a guide to portion sizes. A glass of fruit juice counts as one portion, but drinking five glasses will still count as just one portion. If you aim for about a third of your diet to be made up of fruit and vegetables, then you're well on your way to a healthy diet.

, Adding sliced banana to your cereal or dried fruit to your porridge (oatmeal), or whipping up a fresh fruit salad are all brilliant ways to brighten up breakfast. Grabbing a handful of blueberries and raspberries can be extremely beneficial, as apart from the usual benefits of fruit, they also contain antioxidants which reduce DNA damage. This includes things such as slowing down the skin's aging process, and helping to prevent skin damage from the sun; a good start to any day.

, Fruit is the perfect food for on-the-go and can easily replace biscuits, cakes and chocolate as your snack of choice. Fatty and high sugar snacks are low on essential vitamins and minerals, as well as fibre and can lead to poor digestive health. So keep some fruit in your car, in your bag or on the desk at work to dip into to beat those mid-morning, or mid-afternoon energy lows.

, Lots of food manufacturers are keen to push the fruit content in their food, so as to make you think that the food is great for you. But be careful; not everything with 'fruit' in the title is as it seems. Remember to check the frozen fruit desserts for their fat and sugar contents. Canned fruit in fruit juice is usually fine, but beware of tinned fruit in syrup, as the syrup can be full of sugar.

, See just how good it makes you feel.

, Your body goes into starvation for almost 8 hours during sleep. Eating fruit within 20 minutes of waking up rehydrates your body and furnishes it with low GI carbohydrates that keep your metabolism fired up throughout the day.

Know what to purchase.,
Buy whole flaxseed.,
Buy ground flaxseed.,
Purchase flaxseed in bulk, if available.,
Buy flaxseed oil.",How to Add Flaxseed to Your Diet1," Flaxseed is a very small seed that is flat and oval shaped. The seeds are much smaller than sunflower seeds. It is found in more than one form and each has different properties.


Flaxseed comes in red to golden varieties. The color of the seed doesn’t mean the nutritional content is different, but the seeds may have a slightly different flavor. You can try the different varieties and determine which one has the most pleasing flavor. Some natural food stores may let you sample them in store so you do not have to purchase several types.;
, Whole flaxseed is the unbroken tiny seeds. The benefits of whole flaxseed are that is has more fiber and a longer shelf life. It can also be used in more applications. The negative aspect to whole flaxseed is that the body may not fully digest the seed and the nutritional components may pass through the body unabsorbed.


You can purchase whole flax seeds and grind them in your blender or coffee mill.

, Ground flaxseed, or flax meal, is the milled seeds. Ground flaxseed is slightly coarser than flour and has a nutty smell and flavor. Ground flaxseed can be purchased or it can be made at home. Ground flaxseed also allows for complete absorption of the nutritional components by the body. The drawback to purchasing ground flaxseed is the short shelf life. It doesn’t last for more than a few weeks once it has been opened and should be stored in a cool, dark place for best quality. Unless stored in special mylar packaging, ground flaxseed loses much of its nutritional potency, or active compounds, within 24 hours.If you wish to store it long-term, make sure you are keeping the flaxseed in a resealable mylar bag., Many natural food stores offer flaxseed in bulk. It is usually cheaper than the pre-packaged flaxseed and you can get as little or as much as you need. Flaxseed generally runs from US$8.00 to $12.00 per lb depending on where it is purchased.

, Flaxseed oil is an easy way to get many of the health benefits of flaxseed. Keep it refrigerated to maintain freshness.Unlike the whole and ground seeds, flaxseed oil does not contain phytoestrogens. It does contain ALA fatty acids, however, which have health benefits.

Eat three, appropriately sized well-rounded meals a day.,
Be sure to eat breakfast.,
Eat dinner later, and center your meals around foods like rice and beans, and meat.,
Eat high-protein diets to help you feel full longer.,
Try eating healthy foods that are extremely satiating.,
Choose fats that are better for your body.,
Bulk up your meals.,
Make your meals longer.",How to Stop Snacking Between Meals1," Meals that have a variety of nutrients are more likely to satisfy cravings. It is very important to make sure your meals are not balanced, so that you ensure you do have cravings for snacks.


You will not need to determine your caloric needs to determine what is an appropriately sized meal. This is a one-size-fit-all affair. In general, a meal should not be around 1/4 to 1/3 of your overall calorie consumption. If your meals are too small, you will likely be starving by the time the big meal of the day comes around.

For example, a person on a 2,000 calorie diet should aim for a meal of about 250-350 calories.
Nutritionally speaking, it does not matter when your eat your calories. However, it is harder to stick to a plan if you are hungry. Your body will typically anticipate a certain eating pattern, however, so you may be hungry for lunch at lunchtime even if you ate a big breakfast.


Make sure to consume quality proteins, fats, and complex carbohydrates at lunch. These can help carry you hunger-free throughout the day. Fast foods typically have simple carbs, high sugar, and little fiber.
Try to include foods like avocado. Avocados have been shown to help people feel full longer. Research has shown that people who eat an avocado during their lunch reported feeling nearly 25% more satiated after their meal.;
, Breakfasts that are high in protein were not only observed to increase satiety in the morning, they also helped people to feel more full in the evening. Try to eat at least 35 grams of protein with breakfast, in order to help you feel more full throughout the day.Some ways you might work protein into your breakfast:


Include an egg.
Start your day with yogurt.
Have a protein shake.

, It is very important to time your dinner well, so that you have time to digest the food, but don't end up hungry before you go to bed.


Eat soup.
Bulk up with a salad.
Add some soy. A compound in soy has been found to suppress the appetite. This can help to control your cravings., Protein takes more time to digest. This can help your meal to last in your stomach.Check the labels on your food when comparing items in the grocery store. This will allow you to select foods to stave off hunger.

, Foods that are high in fiber may enhance satiety.These are foods that help you to feel full, such as oatmeal, grapefruit, or popcorn. They can help prevent cravings in between meals.

, Such fats as those from nuts and olives can help you to feel full longer. Avoid saturated fats, as they can increase your desire to snack.Many junk food items are high in saturated fats, and they contribute to a vicious cycle of craving.


Fats have more calories per gram than any other macronutrient. That being said, they help sustain you and improve satiety greatly.

, Meals that are high-water content, and have fiber will keep you physically feeling full longer. A green salad will fill your stomach more than the same amount of calories of a croissant for example.

A lot of these foods are vegetables and fruits: potatoes, broccoli, salad greens, apples, radishes, bananas, celery, carrots, and so on.
A little bit of fat paired with these foods can be good: celery with some light ranch dressing can help your feel more satiated than celery alone. But be careful of going overboard!

, Avoid ""gobble and go"", as it takes time for your stomach to process a ""full"" feeling. If you are wolfing down food, you may bypass this signal.


Take your time to chew your food to help ease digestion. It can also give your body time to let you know that you are full. Research indicates that people who chew more slowly feel less hungry.Have a drink with your meal. Drinking water or other liquid helps make your stomach feel more full. This is especially true of warm beverages.
Increase the awareness of your surroundings. If you are solely focused on your meal, your concentration may lead you to eating too fast. Some moderate distraction can keep you from bolting down your lunch.

Take time to converse with co-workers, people at your table, your family.
Make your surroundings special. Why not light some candles, or use a tablecloth? Or on a nice day eat outside? Making the area something a little more pleasurable can help you take pleasure in it and not something just to ""get over"".

Add ground flaxseed to yogurt or smoothies.,
Bake with flaxseed.,
Make egg replacements.,
Add one or two spoonfuls into chili, spaghetti sauce, stew, or gravy.,
Add flaxseed to commonly used condiments.,
Make flax peanut butter cereal.,
Add to drinks.,
Purchase items made with flaxseed.",How to Add Flaxseed to Your Diet2," One tablespoon of ground flax will fulfill the daily omega-3 requirements and does not alter the flavor very much of the yogurt or smoothie. This will also add fiber to your yogurt or smoothie. The fiber in flaxseed has positive benefits for the elimination of waste from the body.

, Flaxseed goes well in baked goods at small or larger amounts. It imparts a toasted nut flavor that matches well in sweet or savory baked goods. Some popular baked uses of flaxseed are in breads or muffins. It has a good heat stability so all the nutrients are available after the baking process and is a good way to get extra fiber in a baked item without affecting texture and taste dramatically.


Because of its high oil content, flaxseed can replace oil in baking recipes. Use one cup of milled flaxseed to replace 1/3 cup of oil (3:1 substitution ratio).

, Flaxseed can be used to make vegan egg replacements for baking. Combine 1 tablespoon of flaxseed meal and 2.5-3 tablespoons water and allow it to sit for five minutes. This mixture can replace one egg in baking recipes.""Flax eggs"" do not work equally well in all recipes, but it is good for fluffy baked goods such as pancakes, quick breads, brownies, muffins, and cookies.Flax eggs may produce slightly gummier or chewier baked goods.

, The deep toasty flavor of flaxseed goes well in rich stews and sauces., Ground flaxseed blends well in mayonnaise, mustard and ketchup. Flaxseed also goes great in salad dressings and as a salad topping. You will not need to add very much (1 tablespoon or less will suffice).

, Grind about 1/4 cup of flax seed in coffee grinder. Add 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon and two tablespoons peanut butter. Add hot water to the flaxseed/cinnamon/PB mixture and stir. This makes a nice warm cereal.


You could also add 1/4 cup raw sunflower seeds and 1/4 cup raw sliced almonds, each ground separately, to the flax seed mixture, and increase the cinnamon to about 1/2 teaspoon.

, Using smaller amounts throughout the day in whatever you are drinking will give just as much, without the thickness from one larger dose.


Mix a little into coffee. Stir well, and put in a travel mug for people who don't want to see the flax floating in it and they won't notice.
Stir a little into juice and drink up.

, Many ready to eat foods can be found with flaxseed already added. These foods include cereal, cereal bars, muffins and breads. There can be some drawbacks to this method of adding flaxseed to your diet. These drawbacks are you do not know how much flaxseed you are actually getting and many processed foods have lots of added sugar and sodium. If you do purchase items made with flaxseed it is helpful to read the label; the higher an item is in the ingredient list, the more of that ingredient in the food.

Consider your symptoms.,
Consult your GP.,
Prepare to change your diet.",How to Start a Yeast Free Diet1," A yeast infection most commonly occurs as itching, burning and white patches either in the oral or genital area. However, some people have experienced further symptoms, including depression, headaches, fatigue, stomach pain, and indigestion.

Common, recurrent oral or genital yeast infections may be a sign of a more general yeast sensitivity. While the infection can be treated with a prescription, it is worth considering an underlying cause.
Some yeast infections will not respond well to prescriptions and you may find trying a yeast-free diet useful just to regain the a balance that has been thrown off. Since it is not a high-risk endeavor, trying a yeast-free diet is a popular method for people suffering from persistent infections.;
, You should check with your doctor to be diagnosed, as many of the symptoms suggested are general and can be due to multiple causes. Candida yeast overgrowth can often be measured, but even that may not be certain, and diagnosis by symptoms alone is disappointingly speculative.


If it is believed to be a yeast infection, you can get a prescription for antifungal medication (preferably a six week course) which you can take while on this diet as it will help kill the yeast infection. Appropriate antifungals include: Diflucan (Fluconazole), Lamisil (Terbinafine HCL), Nystatin, Sporanox
Many traditional practitioners are unconvinced that yeast-free diets are medically useful, so don't be surprised if your GP is not interested in what you choose to eat. Diet changes are difficult to measure (and could depend on individuals) so evidence may be limited for practical reasons, but nonetheless, not much exists.

, Whether you are imagining this to be simply for the next month and a half, or possibly for the foreseeable future, changing your diet can be a big undertaking if you aren't mentally prepared. Any time an elimination diet is starting, it is important to know all parameters of the diet and to be fully prepared. This is the number one key to success. Try to prepare yourself in advance, and find supportive people.


Remember that the first few days are likely to be the worst as your body transitions to a new diet. With a yeast-free diet, the physical balance in your body is thrown off even further before it rights itself, like trying to a right a boat in a rocky ocean.
Don't reward yourself with ways to cheat on the diet — instead, reward yourself with things that you love in other contexts, like being allowed to spend money or waste time on something you enjoy. Like other elimination-type diets, even the smallest ""cheat"" can cause a relapse of symptoms.

There are free online food diaries available at many websites, including www.myfitnesspal.com.

, Research shows that what a consumer defines as a snack plays a marked role inhibiting conceptualization the behavior.If you don't understand it, it becomes a lot harder to fix. Draw your boundaries. Define what you feel makes a snack.

, Specific times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with at least three to four hours in between each time you eat. Creating this schedule for your dining experiences can help you to plan around when you get hungry. Use your food journal to figure the best times for you to eat.


This is crucial, especially when starting out, to ensure that you have your meals planned out and spaced apart so that you are not left with extra food to eat at the end of the day, or worse, no food at all.

, This way you can pinpoint your targets. Few things can beat a well-thought out strategy.


Watch for patterns.
Check for variety.
Be positive. This is how you support yourself.

, You don't have to stop snacking altogether. Even if that is your eventual goal, starting small can provide goals that are easier to achieve. Think of it as a series of little battles, not an overwhelming war.


Start slow to help ease into your new habit.
Try eating half your snack, at first.
Skip eating the snack entirely for one day, and then do the same the following day. After seven days, you might begin to realize you really didn't really need to eat it. The next week, pick another food to eliminate between meals.

Carry a water bottle.
Make sure to drink a glass of water, or two, at a restaurant.
Try sparkling water.

, Smelling something you find repulsive can kill your appetite. When you find yourself craving a snack, take a big whiff of garbage or vinegar. Cleaning the litter box or the toilet is not likely to leave you salivating.

, Snap it when you have a craving. This helps develop an association between the negative sensation and the desire to snack. After building up this association over a long time, it can help you to control your desire to have a snack.

, There are a number of new diets that involve imagining away your cravings. Related to the reasons that your tenth piece of chocolate is not as satisfying as your first, it is possible to imagine you already ate nine pieces and reduce your desire overall. Try imagining that you already ate your snack, in fact, you just ate the whole box.This may, at first, cause you to salivate (the ""whetting effect""), but soon habituation will kick in, and you won't feel like eating as much of your snack as you did initially. You may not feel like snacking at all.For this to work, you must imagine yourself eating the exact food you are trying to avoid, and in a large quantity., It can be easy to forget you're hungry when you're busy doing something challenging and/or enjoyable. Try picking up a hobby, or doing something productive. Switch out your bad habits for good, new ones. This can be a great way to control unhealthy eating habits.Clean the house.
Call a friend.
Exercise

, Hypnotizing yourself, or getting hypnotized by a professional, can be an effective way to manage behaviors you wish to change. Research shows that hypnosis can provide significant benefit for those trying to reduce unhealthy eating habits.Find a hypnotherapist in your area, or look for a weight-loss hypnosis CD online.

, Choose someone you know will be there for you when you are unsure you can succeed. When you feel a craving, give them a call and let them talk you out of it. You can even share a meal together, and all the talking you do will help you to eat your meal more slowly, leaving you feeling more full.

Familiarize yourself with the foods that you can eat.,
Familiarize yourself with treats.,
Continue this diet for four to six weeks.,
Slowly add foods back into your diet over a period of a few weeks.",How to Start a Yeast Free Diet2," While you don't want to concentrate on the negative in a diet, it is important to know the boundaries as you adapt to a new set of habits.


Stay away from anything that contains yeast, like most breads, processed foods, and baked goods.
Sugar in any form (this included sucrose, glucose and fructose) is also a danger as yeast feeds and grows on sugar.
Refined grains, malted products, and fermented products (vinegar, soy, ginger, beer and wine), including all alcohol, either contain yeast or quick-acting carbohydrates which feed the growth of yeast.
Dairy products should be avoided, as with most cheese. The primary exception in this category is yogurt with living cultures.
Any mushroom or fungus is out.
It is recommended that you avoid stimulants like coffee, chocolate, black tea and so forth, as they release stored sugar into the body and so provide a breeding ground for yeast. The same applies for artificial sweeteners and spicy foods.

, Much easier than creating a list of foods you can't eat, is to create a list of foods that you can eat and stick to those. Find ways to make these foods interesting and broaden your horizons if any of these foods are ones you have yet to try. Essentially you are aiming for a diet of fresh greens and fresh proteins, with limited fresh fruits and dairy (as they are higher in sugars), and complex grains. But get to know the details so that you can make foods you enjoy! Things you can eat include:


Fresh meat, chicken and fish.
Eggs.
Garbanzo beans and lentils.
Avocado.
Walnuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamias, and coconut.
Brown rice (no white rice) and rice cakes.
All vegetables, fresh or frozen, including onions and garlic.
Fruit that is not bruised (but no melons or grapes).
Limited milk (125ml per day) or soya / rice milk.
Plain yoghurt with active cultures.
Low fat cottage cheese with no sugar.
Homemade popcorn.
Plain chips with no MSG.
Herbal teas.

, These are foods allowed weekly (only one item of each), that won't throw off your balance entirely in one serving, but will disrupt things if they become habitual. Foods like these include:Whole wheat pasta.
Tomato paste.
Cheeses such as Camembert or feta.
Tinned tuna in spring water (as opposed to fresh tuna, which is regularly acceptable).
Spices.

, At the end of this period, the system infection should be gone, and all the symptoms relieved. If you are not feeling fit and healthy after committing to the diet for this period, then a yeast infection may not be the underlying cause of your symptoms as that should be long enough for your body to retain balance


And, as with any allergy, removing the culprit from your diet for a set period is a perfect way to test for a sensitivity. The trouble can be that while some allergies have very clear, obvious reactions like a skin rash or asthma attack, you may consider the symptoms of a yeast sensitivity difficult to be sure about. It's important to remember to trust what you feel.

, If your infection has cleared up and you would like to start eating certain foods again, it is safe to do so slowly without triggering the same infection.


However, if you are sensitive to yeast infections in general your system will still react to a high level of yeast or yeast-generating environments. Therefore, it is sensible to add foods back slowly and be aware of any negative reactions. This way, you can determine whether it is a sensitivity to yeast or to something else you happened to stop eating.
You may find that you feel better on a yeast-free diet for the long-term, as some systems are prone to yeast imbalance. You can try it and see!

Change your attitude.,
Remove yeast from your diet.,
Partner up with a friend.,
Talk to a nutritionist.",How to Start a Yeast Free Diet3," The primary thing to keep in mind is that you will be focusing on eating completely fresh foods — nothing fermented, nothing baked, nothing fungal, and nothing that is likely to have attracted any growths. While there is more to it than that, this overall mental attitude can help you make decisions when you come across a new food. Don't have an ""I can't have that"" attitude; have an ""I choose not to have that"" attitude!


Think of your food not as a treat for your mouth but fuel for your entire body, and choose things that will be pleasing for every part of a healthy you. Mentally associate positive health and feeling good with the foods that are beneficial, and remember the consequences of the foods that are off-limits.

, If you think a yeast-free diet may be more healthy for your body type overall, try working toward taking yeast out of your diet for good. Rather than thinking about specific foods that are or aren't allowed, imagine creating a diet that will serve your body most effectively.


Gluten-free diets have become more popular among a wide range of people, but it has been suggested that some of those cases may actually be yeast allergies, since the two show up in many of the same places. If you have tried a gluten free diet that works some of the time but not always, it may be worth investigating where the two differ.

, Mutual support is a great way to keep a project in the air, and a healthy diet will benefit anyone. Even if you are not eating exactly the same food, congratulating one another and reminding each other what's off limits is more useful than you might think. It can keep you motivated and help you hold yourself accountable.


Planning meals in advance can keep your momentum going. Two people are better than one since there will be back-up if either of you starts to fall off the wagon, and preparing food will be a motivating force.
Eating together is a positive social interaction. Certainly not everyone will have the time to spend every meal together, but even checking in on a regular basis will make a difference. Whether it's dinner every day with a spouse or lunch once a week with a co-worker, any form of patting each other on the back is a plus.

, If you are serious about changing your relationship to food, it is worth planning meals that you like and that are good for you. A professional can help you determine the best combination to meet your needs.


Each individual will find a different arrangement of meals that works best, so talking to someone can be a useful method to make starting a new diet a good experience, rather than stressful or frustrating. Remember, eating food that is good for your body should ultimately be pleasing. It may take a period of adjustment, but don't expect to suffer endlessly. A nutritionist can help figure out what you need to be satisfied.

Create breakfast that you will eat.,
Create lunch and dinner that you'll enjoy!,
Write down ideas you come across so that you can start building up your own collection of options.",How to Start a Yeast Free Diet4," Some people think of breakfast as something they grab as they run out the door, while others believe it is the most important meal of the day, and has to have enough calories to get the day started. Recognize your own tendencies and interests, and make meals that are right for you.Consider these options when making Breakfast:


One piece of fruit.
Porridge – oats or rice cereal.
Yeast-free bread or rice cakes.
Egg with avocado and tomato.
Cottage cheese.

, Do you need to bring food with you to work? Are you cooking for two (or more) at home? Some people like to eat small amounts and just snack a lot, while others want to have a nice big plate of food at dusk. Get to know what you really want to eat. Consider these options for lunch or dinner:


Lentil soup.
Any meat with plenty of vegetables.
Vegetable stir fry with brown rice.
Cold chicken with cottage cheese.
Potato salad.
Hummus sandwich on pita bread.
Avocado sandwich on sourdough bread.

, You will start to use certain ideas regularly, and have a selection of go-to dishes, as everyone tends to on any diet (one they are watching or not), but it is always worth keeping a few possibilities nearby to mix things up now and then.


You can do a search for yeast-free meals to look for new recipes, as there are always new ideas being posted and talked about online. Sometimes you will simply be reminded of ingredients you haven't thought to use in a long time - and the same stir-fry can be a whole different meal whether you center it around bok-choy and carrots or brussels sprouts and kale.
You can also just look up a few of your favorite ingredients, and modify the results a little if it's necessary. Remember that you can usually replace regular milk with soy milk, or vinegar with lemon juice, so long as the recipe is simple.

Remove most carbohydrates.,
Add in protein.,
Increase your fat intake.,
Eliminate alcohol.,
Find sample recipes and meal plans.,
Monitor your progress.,
Consume enough vegetables.,
Count carbs properly.,
Beware of hidden carbs.,
Get enough sleep.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Beware of potential side effects.,
Focus on improving your overall health.",How to Start the Atkins Diet," The Induction phase is meant to last for 14 days and the biggest overhaul you will make is your carbohydrate intake. In this phase you are only allowed 20 grams of carbohydrates each day — 12 – 15 of those grams must be from vegetables like broccoli, asparagus and green beans.General nutritional guidelines recommend that you consume 45 – 65% of your calories from carbohydrates. During the Induction phase of Atkins, only 10% of your calories should come from carbs.You will have to remove all breads, pastas, oatmeal, cereal and sugary foods like ice cream, cookies, cakes, brownies. Fruit and starchy vegetables (like potatoes) are also off limits during this phase.;
, You are meant to supplement the lack of carbs with additional protein and fats during this phase. You can eat a variety of fish, shellfish, poultry, pork, beef, and eggs when you are in Induction.


Dairy products such as cheese, cream and sour cream are also allowed at this phase. But you should avoid other dairy products like milk and yogurt because these naturally contain carbs and sugar., It might sound strange, but Atkins is pro-fat when it comes to butter, oil, cream and mayonnaise (that doesn't have sugar). It is perfectly acceptable to prepare and dress foods with these items., If you have a happy hour to attend, then get excited for your glass of sparkling water because alcohol is not allowed during the Induction phase. The diet also recommends that you consume eight glasses of water a day., Due to the popularity of the Atkins diet, it is easy to find ideas for creating satisfying meals for Phase I. Here are some options for your different meals:


Breakfast: bacon, avocado and pepper Jack cheese omelet; Canadian bacon topped with cheddar and tomato; frittata with chorizo and green chili; scrambled eggs with cream; or dill and smoked salmon.Lunch: egg salad; chicken salad; tuna salad; or broth- or cream-based soups (except for potato or soups containing noodles).Dinner: roasted balsamic pork loin with rosemary cauliflower; beef fillet with bacon and gorgonzola butter; bratwurst with onion and sauerkraut; chicken cacciatore; Chicken breasts with tarragon cream sauce; or blackened fish (salmon, chard, halibut). , It is important to keep track of your progress so you can see how your body responds to the Induction phase. Keep a weight loss/food journal and weigh yourself daily.Note which foods you consume and how many net carbs you take in each day. Atkins has a carb calculator that can help you determine this by ingredient. You can find it here: http://sa.atkins.com/support-tools/carb-counter.html

Be sure to weigh yourself at the same time each day. Most doctors recommend weighing yourself in the morning and stepping on the scale naked so you can get the most accurate reading of your weight., Because you can only consume 12 – 15 grams of vegetable-based carbs during Induction, you might be tempted to skip them altogether. Avoid doing this as vegetables are an important source of fiber and valuable vitamins.Cucumber, cauliflower, broccoli, asparagus and leafy greens like spinach, kale and lettuce are all appropriate to consume in Phase I., In the Atkins diet, you are supposed to count the number of net carbs in an ingredient, not the total number of carbs. You can calculate the net carb amount by subtracting the grams of fiber from the total grams of carbs in the item.For example, if a half-cup of uncooked broccoli has 2.3 grams of total carbs and 1.3 grams of total fiber, then the net carb value is 1 gram.Again, use the Atkins carb counter to get an accurate reading., When you go to buy food in the grocery store, stick to the produce and meat sections. Avoid buying processed foods, which are typically found in the aisles in the middle of the store.If you do buy processed foods, make sure you check the number of calories and sugar in the ingredients list. Just because something is listed as low-calorie or organic does not mean it is suitable for an Atkins diet., Getting seven to nine hours of sleep each night is a vital part of a healthy life and a key asset to a weight loss regimen. Sleep provides improvements in our immune systems, metabolism, and strengthens the function of memory., Before you begin any diet that eliminates most of a major food group from your diet, talk to your doctor if this is a right choice for you. You should avoid Atkins if you suffer from kidney disease or are taking medications for diabetes.


Ask your doctor for a referral to a registered dietitian, who can help you make sure you are getting all the nutrients you need from your diet.
There haven't been any major studies that have shown long-term benefits in terms of weight loss and improved health from the Atkins diet.The Induction phase is also not appropriate for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding., Keep in mind that a radical change to your diet can result in some negative side effects. If you experience any of these side effects, talk to your doctor about modifying your diet or adding in healthy carbs like whole grain breads and whole wheat pasta.Some of the potential side effects of the Atkins diet include:


Nausea
Headaches
Feelings of irritability
Dizziness
Constipation

, The Atkins diet promises major results within the Induction phase. And while you might find it will help you lose weight quickly, there is no evidence that diets which eliminate entire food groups (like carbs, sugars or fat) are sustainable for long term weight loss.The Atkins diet initially suggested that exercise was not necessary for its practitioners, but now it stipulates that exercise can help you succeed in weight loss. Aim for 30 minutes of cardio exercise (like walking, running, hiking, swimming, biking), three to four times a week."

Rate your hunger level on a scale from one to 10.,
Do the apple test.,
Take a ""self scan.""",How to Know You're Hungry (and Avoid Eating when You're Not)1," Rating your hunger level on a scale may help you determine what to do — have a snack or wait for your next planned meal. Try rating your hunger from one (almost faint with hunger) to 10 (overly full, sick feeling).If you're hunger level is around a three or four, it may be time to eat. If your next planned meal isn't for another two hours or more, have a planned snack. If your next planned meal is within the next hour or so, try to wait until your meal to eat.
Ideally, do not let yourself be at either extreme — starving at a level one or so full you're at a level 10. Fluctuate between a four and seven.
It's normal and expected to be hungry prior to eating meals and even right before going to bed in the evenings.;
, This is a simple test that can help you figure out if you're experiencing physical hunger or emotional/head hunger. In general, emotional hunger is a craving or desire for a very specific group of foods (like carbs) or a specific food (like chocolate cake). Physical hunger will be satisfied with a wide array of food options.Ask yourself would you still want this snack if it were only an apple, raw carrots or a salad?
If the answer is yes, go for that apple (or other fruit or vegetable) or other healthy, planned snacks to truly nourish that physical hunger.
If the answer is no, then the hunger/craving you are experiencing is probably not a physical hunger in your stomach, but instead an emotional hunger.
If you've determined you're experiencing emotional hunger, this might be a good time to take a walk or take a 10 minute break and reflect on what may be bothering you.

, Before eating any meal or snack, take a minute or two to do a self scan. This may give you clues about your hunger level and desire to eat.Think about:


Your level of hunger. Are you starving? Are you full? Are you satisfied?
Take note of any physical signs of hunger. Your stomach may be growling, you might feel an ""emptiness"" in your stomach or you might feel hunger pangs with physical hunger. You may feel irritable or have a headache.
If you feel like you might be craving food without being physically hungry, assess your emotional status. Are you bored? Did you have a stressful day at work? Are you tired or fatigued? Many times these emotions cause us to feel ""hungry"" when in all reality, we are not."

Don't drink excessively.,
Never drink when hungry.,

One serving of wine will be around 5 fluid ounces or 148 milliliters.
A distilled spirit has the smallest serving size, only 1.5 fluid ounces or 44 milliliters.
Any increase in portion size will also increase the amount of calories being consumed.
Many restaurants and bars serve drinks that contain several servings in one glass.

, Alcohol has a dehydrating effect on the body and you will need to replenish any water that is lost when drinking. Drinking water can also help you drink less alcohol, which results in fewer calories being consumed.After you are done drinking alcoholic beverages, switch to water. Drinking water after alcohol can help immediately start rehydration.

Clean out your kitchen.,
Leave the area.,
Write a list of activities you can do instead of eating.,
Consume a small portion of the food you're craving.",How to Know You're Hungry (and Avoid Eating when You're Not)2," Aim to drink adequate fluids daily. It's generally recommended to consume around eight 8-oz glasses or 64 oz (2 liters) daily. This is just a general recommendation — you may need slightly more or less. Adequate hydration can help aid in weight loss, but can also help you manage your hunger levels throughout the day. Thirst or low-level dehydration can feel like hunger. If you're not drinking enough each day, that dehydration can cause hunger-like feelings that may be triggering you to eat more or more often than you should.Keep a water bottle close by and monitor how much you're drinking each day.
Also, drinking right before a meal can calm your hungry and decrease your overall intake at your meal.

, Emotional hunger can come on very suddenly. It's also quicker to go away compared to physical hunger.If you remove yourself from the situation for about 10 to 15 minutes, you may find that your craving or desire to eat subsides or is more easily controlled.


Waiting a few minutes might not take your cravings away completely, but they may reduce them enough for your willpower to win.
Try telling yourself that in 10 to 15 minutes, you will revisit your thoughts to eat a certain food or snack. Engage in another activity and come back to your craving if it's still there.

, Having a pantry or refrigerator full of unhealthy, tempting foods can make emotional eating easier to do.If you know you typically reach for a box of crackers or bag of chips when you're bored or stressed, not having those foods around when those emotions hit may help you decrease eating when you're not truly hungry.


Take an hour or two of your free time to survey your kitchen. Look in your pantry, freezer, refrigerator or any cabinet/area in your house where you keep food items. Place all tempting foods and snacks on a table to evaluate which foods should stay and which should go.
Donate unopened foods to a food bank or church if you do not want to throw them in the garbage.
Make a pact with yourself to not buy or purchase tempting snack foods so you can keep your kitchen and home a healthy environment.

, Sometimes, being in the same room with a favorite food or an item you're craving makes it difficult not to consume it.If you're in a spot in your home or office that's adding to your desire to eat, get out of there. Give yourself the time and space to get your mind clear of your cravings.


Take a walk for 15 minutes if you can. Clear your head and refocus your attention on other things besides your craving or desire to eat.
Many times, people crave snacks at night.Instead of staying awake and eating, go to bed. You'll be away from the kitchen and won't be tempted to eat mindlessly in front of the TV. If you're not tired, read a good book or a magazine until you're tired enough to fall asleep.

, Journaling ideas that can help distract you from cravings of the desire to eat can help you manage emotional eating.Jot down a list of activities you enjoy or that are distracting enough that they'll refocus your attention away from food. Ideas can include:


Cleaning out your closets or reorganizing a junk drawer
Going for a walk
Engaging in a favorite hobby like knitting, scrap-booking or drawing
Reading a book or magazine
Playing a game
Doing something that requires a lot of brainpower like hard, long-winded maths calculation

, Sometimes, cravings or the desire to eat is incredibly overwhelming. Even when you try to distract yourself or give your craving time to subside, it's still very intense. Some experts recommend consuming a small, portion controlled serving of the food you're craving.Eating a small portion may help the craving subside while giving you the pleasure of eating something tasty.Ensure that you follow an appropriate portion size. Check the food label and measure out your portion, put the food away and then slowly consume it so you can enjoy and savor it.

Journal.,
See a registered dietitian or therapist.,
Find a support group.",How to Know You're Hungry (and Avoid Eating when You're Not)3," A emotional eating food journal is a great tool to help you become aware of and manage your emotional eating. You can use it to see where or when you eat and what types of foods seem to be craving or comfort foods. Write down what you eat, when, and how much.


Also take note of any emotions you may be feeling when you eat. This may help you gain insight into what emotions trigger you to eat certain foods.
Purchase a journal or download a journaling app on your smartphone. Track as many days as you can — both weekday and weekend days. Many people eat differently on the weekends so including both weekend and weekdays is important., These health professionals can help you manage emotional eating. If you're having difficulty managing your eating or it's taking a toll on your health, plan to meet with both a registered dietitian and behavior therapist.


A registered dietitian is a nutrition expert that can help you understand emotional eating, talk to you about true physical hunger and provide you with alternative food choices. They can even help you create a meal plan.
A behavior therapist will help you understand why you emotionally eat and give you ideas for changing your reaction or behavior to certain emotional triggers.

Whether it's your spouse, family, friends or co-workers, a support group are your cheerleaders that will motivate and encourage through your progress.
Also try finding an online support group or a local group to meet up with. Email new friends that share your long-term goals.

Find drinks that contain fewer calories.,
Be aware of hidden calories.,
Eat a balanced diet.",How to Stay Slim and Still Drink Alcohol2," Not all alcoholic drinks have the same amount of calories. If your favorite drink has a lot of calories, consider switching to a drink that has a lower caloric content. Consider a light beer or hard liquor without mixers, which add calories and sugar. Be aware of how many calories are in your drinks to help keep within your daily allowance.An average beer has around 215 calories.
A glass of wine will generally contain 126 calories.
Moderately active males should limit caloric intake to 2,800 calories a day.Females who are moderately active should maintain a caloric intake of 2,220 calories a day., Mixed drinks and cocktails can have extra ingredients which contain calories of their own. Any drinks that have added sodas, sugars, juice, or alcohol will also have added calories. These added calories can lead to weight gain.Use calorie-free or low-calorie ingredients when making a mixed drink. Try club soda or seltzer. Ask for diet mixers, such as diet tonic water or diet ginger ale or Coke.
Combining two or more types of alcohol will also combine the amount of calories in each type.
Many drink mixers contain a large amount of sugar. Excess sugar consumption should be avoided when trying to lose or maintaining weight.

, Combining moderate alcohol consumption with a healthy diet can be a great way to enjoy food and drink while maintaining a healthy weight. Make sure your diet is nutritious and your drinks aren't contributing excess calories.


Limit sugar intake. Excess sugar in a diet can lead to weight gain and health issues. Limit your daily intake of sugar to 100 calories worth or around six to nine teaspoons.
Protein should be a critical part of your diet. Favor plant-based sources of protein such as beans or lentils. Meat- and poultry-based sources of protein should be as lean as possible.
Eat the best kinds of carbohydrates to provide energy. Try eating fruits and vegetables or beans and legumes for a great source of carbohydrates.
Fiber is another important part of any diet. Again, make sure you are eating plenty of fruits and vegetables in addition to beans and peas.
Fats are still required in a diet, although certain types are considered more healthy than others. Try to only consume fats from olive and canola oils or lean fish and poultry.

Always eat breakfast.,
Eat small, frequent meals.,
Eat healthy snacks.,
Choose your favorite foods.,
Avoid off-putting odors.,
Use herbs and spices in cooking.,
Eat less fiber.",How to Increase Your Appetite1," You've heard it before, but breakfast really is the most important meal of the day. Eating a healthy, balanced breakfast kick-starts your metabolism after a long night of not eating and gets your body ready for the day.Eating breakfast will give you more energy so you will be more active throughout the day, thus increasing your appetite further.


Some good options for healthy, balanced breakfasts include wholegrain cereals, yogurt, granola and fresh fruit, and healthy fruit smoothies.
If you're trying to increase your calorie intake, try spreading some peanut butter on a slice of wholegrain bread or toast. It's tasty and full of healthy fats.;
, Eating small, frequent meals rather than the usual three a day is a great way to build towards a healthy appetite. People with small appetites can often be turned off by the large portion sizes at regular mealtimes. Small meals, on the other hand, can be less daunting and less filling than large meals, while eating them frequently still allows you to consume the same amount of food overall.


Eating smaller meals can also help you to feel less bloated and sluggish after eating, which is the reason many people with small appetites don't enjoy large meals. Try eating 4 to 6 small meals a day to avoid feeling overly full.
Don't be afraid to break with convention and eat whenever most appeals to you. If you prefer to eat your biggest meal in the morning rather than in the evening, go for it. If you prefer to break dinner time up into two smaller meals, that's fine too.

, Eating healthy snacks can help when you have trouble eating much food at mealtimes. The small quantities can be less daunting, while frequent snacking can help get you into the correct mindset when it comes to eating. Try putting small bowls of your favorite snacks in frequently used areas around the house, like the kitchen counter or living room coffee table, to encourage snacking throughout the day.Choose foods which are high in healthy sugars and fats, such as bananas, avocados and nuts, tasty spreads and dips such as hummus or cream cheese, or salty treats such as popcorn and pretzels.
Just remember that snacks are not meant to be eaten instead of meals, but in addition to them. So avoid snacking too close to meals times, otherwise you might ruin your appetite.

, Eating more is easier when you eat foods that you actually enjoy. Put some time and preparation into buying and planning out meals and snacks that you like, that way you should never end up not eating just because there's nothing in the house that appeals to you.If you are currently under your ideal weight, you shouldn't worry too much about sticking to a purely healthy diet. If you love chocolate cake or pizza, indulge yourself a little and allow yourself to eat your favorite sweet or savory treats. However too much fatty food can cause you to feel bloated or unwell, so eat in moderation.
You can also try eating your favorite comfort foods or foods you associate with your home or childhood - think hearty beef stews or chicken pot pies. You may find foods that you associate with good memories easier to eat.

, Foods that have particularly strong smells can be overpowering and may turn you off eating a dish completely, especially if you weren't particularly hungry to begin with. Avoid foods like tuna or stinky cheese (unless you happen to love them) or anything which has a smell that doesn't appeal to you.


Remember that hot food usually has more of an aroma than cold food, so try eating more sandwiches, salads or cold cuts of meat if smells are not your thing.

, On the other hand, foods that have a very pleasant or fragrant smell can be very appealing and might be just the thing to get your tummy rumbling. Try adding herbs or spices to your favorite foods to create wonderful aromas and add interest to food. You'll no longer be put off by bland and boring foods.


Cinnamon is one spice that is often said to naturally stimulate your appetite. Add it to baked goods, sprinkle a bit on buttered toast or add a little to a hot cup of cocoa to appreciate its warm and spicy aroma and flavor.Herbs such as basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary and fennel can all add interest and flavor to a huge variety of dishes. Experiment by using these herbs in different dishes until you find a combination that you like.

, Fiber, a nutrient found in fruits, vegetables and whole grain foods, is an essential component of any healthy diet. However, fiber-rich foods can be extremely filling, so it may be best to eat such foods only in moderation when trying to increase your appetite.


It takes longer for your body to process fiber-rich foods than other types of food, which is why it's great for people who are trying to eat less while still having plenty of energy throughout the day.
But if you're trying to increase your appetite, cutting back on high fiber foods such as brown rice or pasta and wholewheat cereals can help you to feel more hungry. This should only be used as a short-term solution, however, as fiber is essential for healthy and normal body function. Talk to your doctor before you try to decrease the amount of fiber you eat.

, Another great plant source of phenolic acid is whole grains. An optimal way to get them is baking with flour made from them. However, even eating a bowl of rice or oats can also increase the amount of phenolic acid you’re getting. Whole grains and whole grain flours high in phenolic acids include:Wheat
Rice
Corn
Oats
Refined maize flourRye

, Sprinkling these on your foods can also add more phenolic acid to your diet. Nuts and seeds high in phenolic acids include:Flaxseed and flaxseed meal
Hazelnut
Pecans
Soy flour
Chestnut

, Beverages made from plant sources can also help boost your daily phenolic acid intake. Having a sensible amount of the following beverages can further your efforts to get more phenolic acid:Red wine
Tea
Coffee
Hot chocolate made from cocoa, The best way to add phenolic acids to your diet is through foods and beverages high in them. You can also try a supplement high in phenolic acids for a further boost. Phenolic acid supplements often come as grape seed or green tea extract or are marketed as antioxidants. Avoid using these in place of a proper diet high in phenolic acids because they may not have the same benefit as food sources.Follow your doctor’s or packaging instructions for proper dosage.
The FDA​ ​does​ ​not​ ​regulate supplements​ ​for​ ​content,​ ​purity,​ ​labeling,​ ​or​ ​claims.​ ​​It's best to use supplements​ ​with​ ​a​ ​third​ ​party​ ​verifier like USP (US Pharmacopeia).

Start with an open mind.,
Understand what matters when assessing the affinity of a wine with a food.,
Know how to taste food and wine together.,
Know your taste experience.,
Start pairing wine and food.,
Deepen your pairing knowledge by discovering the nuances.,
Consider pairing wine with the regional or origin of the cuisine.,
Plan the meal and wine.",How to Pair Food and Wine," Whatever you read, this article included, is guidance not a rule. If you prefer different combinations, nothing is stopping you from enjoying this. The principal purpose of guides on pairing food and wine is to enlighten your understanding on commonly agreed matches, and the reasons behind these. It's about taking some of the guesswork out of matching food and wine until you're comfortable enough to rely on your own experience. Ultimately you'll learn to tune into your own palate as the best guide to what wine works with what food.


A basic guideline is to 'Match' and 'Complement' the characteristics of food to the wine, or 'Contrast' or counterbalance overpowering characteristics. For example: Spicy foods with sweeter wine.
Be aware that some wines can be spoiled by the introduction of certain food flavors, just as they can be enhanced. If you find that a wine you've always loved suddenly tastes less desirable, track down the food you paired it with, and try drinking it without food, before dismissing the wine outright.
Know how to taste wine before embarking on the journey of pairing wine and food. Read How to taste wine to learn more.;
, It is important to seek a balance in the wine's components (fruit, acid, alcohol, sweetness, and tannin), and the food components (ingredients, manner of cooking, and the resulting tastes). It is about more than just the flavor. Also to be taken into account are the texture, weight, structure, and bouquet of both wine and food. For instance, delicate food requires a delicate wine, while richer and more robust food will match best with heavier, fuller flavored wines.


The manner in which a food is cooked will impact the appropriateness of a wine. The nature of a food changes according to whether it is roasted, baked, poached, steamed, marinated, seasoned, cooked in sauce, or left in as near to its original state as possible. This is why generalizations of suitability are too simplistic – the flavor, texture, weight, and composition of the food needs to be considered individually, regardless of the principal component of a dish.
While similarities attract, opposites can do so too. What is most important is that the food and wine complement one another in such a way that your attention can be drawn from the wine to the food and back again without losing the essence of either.
Keep the food flavors simple. If the flavors of the food are too complex, it will be hard to match it with any wine because the food becomes so dominant. If you have a particularly complex or rich food dish, it's recommended that you don't try matching your prized wines but rely on cheaper, more readily available wines in case the match is unpleasant or even terrible.

, To enable you to branch out beyond the generalities, being aware of how to taste the food and wine together is vital. It is suggested that you do the following:Take a mouthful of wine and roll it around your mouth. Swallow.
Ask yourself what you taste and smell. Look for familiar fruit, berry, and wood flavors.
Decide whether you find the wine light or heavy.
Consider the sweetness or acidity of the wine.
Take your summation of the wine and try to match it to similar characteristics in food. Find at least one aspect that corresponds with the food, such as the sweetness, the flavor, the texture, etc.
Try the food. Eat a small piece, chew, and swallow it. As with the wine, consider how it tastes, as well as the aftertaste. If it's a pleasant experience, you've hit on a winner; if not, the pairing isn't made in heaven and it's time to try a different wine.

, There four to five tastes - saltiness, bitterness, acidity, sweetness, and the Japanese umami. These are the tastes that you'll be combining together in the same way an artist combines paint on the palette:



Saltiness: This taste is the easiest to recognize and it lingers. Saltiness brings out sweetness, hides tannins and increases bitterness. Sweet dessert wines go well with salty foods, or very fruity reds.

Acidity: Highly acidic foods are not ideal with wine because they tend to cancel out the wine's flavor. As such, leave the vinegars, vinaigrettes, and dressings to a minimum when pairing food and wine. Acidity is a taste that lingers, it can hide tannin and bitterness and make wine seem sweeter. An acidic wine should be paired with a dish that is of lower acidity to prevent flattening the wine. For example, add a little sugar to take the edge off a vinaigrette.

Bitterness: Bitter foods include radicchio, olives, rocket, etc. It's a taste that outlasts all other tastes. Bitterness is able to cover up acidity in a wine, hides the tannins, and brings out the sweetness. Young red wines work well with bitter greens, wild herbs, and olives.

Sweetness: Another easy taste for many, although the ability to taste sweetness declines with age. Sweetness doesn't last long as a taste. It minimizes bitterness and acidity in a wine. Aim to partner sweet wine with food that isn't overly sweet; to have both as sweet as the other will cancel out the wine. If you have chocolate, enjoy a liqueur Tokay or a Muscat rather than a sweet wine.

Umami: This is the taste that emanates from broth style or earthy food, such as soups, miso, stock, consommé, roast meats, mushrooms, etc. Umami takes off the edge of tannins and brings out the sweetness, making it a good choice for wines high in tannin.

, It is possible to make generalities, and you'll often find suggestions for pairing food and wine at the wine store. However, as already noted, such generalities are very broad and don't necessarily account for the manner in which the food is cooked or what else is accompanying it, such as spices or a cream-based sauce. As such, while the following offers general guidance, it is still important to rely on your own palate and to continue exploring the matching process lifelong (see the following step after this section on developing nuanced approaches to these generalizations):



Beef and lamb: Select red wine for beef and lamb dishes. Usually a full-bodied red such as a shiraz or cabernet/shiraz blend works well.Suitable wines include Barbera, Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Pinot Noir, and Zinfandel.

However, if it were asparagus alone, as shown on the picture, a grassy Sauvignon Blanc would had been a sensible choice.



Chicken: White wine is the usual pick. For grilled or roast chicken, try a Chardonnay. For chicken cooked in a rich sauce, try a Shiraz or a medium-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon.

Fish and seafood: Select a white wine for fish and seafood. These wines would include Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc and Gewürztraminer. Grilled firm-flesh fish matches well with Chardonnay or an aged Semillon, while a hearty fish stew is excellent accompanied by Pinot Noir. For flaky fish, choose a dry Riesling or a Chardonnay.

Spicy: Choose Riesling and sweet Gewürztraminer if your meal is spicy. The sweetness of these wines can be drank quickly to offset the spiciness of the food. Avoid adding a Chardonnay to spicy food as it will taste bitter.Game: Choose a spicy red like Sangiovese or Shiraz for game such as venison, bison, or kangaroo.

Tomato (acidic) based meals: Serve Barbera, Sangiovese, or Zinfandel with tomato-based meals (for example, spaghetti and pizza).

Duck, quail: Try a Pinot Noir or a Shiraz.

Cheese: Full-bodied wines go well with hard cheese, such as a full-bodied Shiraz with cheddar cheese. Soft cheese partners well with dry Riesling, Marsanne, or Viognier. Sweet wine is a good match for blue cheese.

Dessert: Sweet wines are a good choice, provided that the dessert is not as sweet as the wine.

, Build on the basic understanding of what might match. It's easy enough to say that chicken goes with white wine, or beef goes with red wine but which wine exactly? And is this choice clear cut? The wine that goes with the food will depend heavily on the manner in which the food has been prepared. For example, it isn't as simple as saying that chicken goes with white wine. If, for example, the chicken has been poached, making it simple and delicate, a simple wine such as a young Semillon will be good. When roasted, the fat makes the chicken richer, thus requiring a heavier textured wine such as an aged Semillon. If barbecued, the chicken becomes smoky, and goes well with a wine aged in wood, such as a light Chardonnay. When chicken has been cooked in cream, it becomes really rich, a heavier Chardonnay will pair well. When it's made into a darker dish, such as by adding soy sauce, it can take a light red such as a Pinot Noir. Place chicken into a red wine marinade, and it makes sense to pair it with red wine.Learn the different flavors within each wine style and seek to match these to the food ingredients. For example, fruity elements and wood overtones impact the wine flavor and are important considerations when partnering the wine with food. If you can taste peaches, coconut, tropical flavors, smokiness, herbs, etc., then take those flavors and find their food equivalents.
Weight of the wine has an impact on pairing with food. Wines are light, medium or full-bodied, referring to the depth of flavor on the mid-palate. When trying to discern the weight of the wine, either ask the retailer, or check the depth of color. Apart from Pinot Noir, the darker the color, the heavier the weight.
Use your sense of smell to help you pair food and wine. The two senses are one, and you can trust your nose unless it's blocked. Wine smells can be floral, perfumed, mineral, fruity (common fruit smells are peach, melon, and fig), butter, nuts, earthy, truffle or mushroom, meaty, or even like the barnyard. If the smell is unpleasant, avoid it. An aging wine can have overtones of toast or engine fuel.

, For example, Provençal grilled lamb with garlic and rosemary with red Bandol or Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Be aware also that the same type of wine can have a very different taste when it is sourced from a different region or country. For example, an American made Sauvignon Blanc tends to have a grassier flavor than a Sauvignon Blanc produced in New Zealand. The only way you'll know this is by tasting and contrasting the wine, paying attention all the time to pairing it with the right food.

, When planning dinner, many people opt for planning the food first and adding in the wine according to the food. However, you might like to work from the other way, and plan the meal according to the wine. Either way is appropriate but will impact how you explore the flavors, and the perspective gained by looking at the wine first, then the food, can be quite a refreshing one.

Choose Ceylon Cinnamon.,
Choosing the best form of cinnamon.,
Add a teaspoon of cinnamon to warm drinks to reduce cold and flu effects.,
Try a hot cinnamon drink to dry up a runny nose.,
Add a teaspoon of cinnamon to soups.",How to Get the Health Benefits of Cinnamon1," The two major types of cinnamon are Ceylon Cinnamon and Cassia Cinnamon. Ceylon Cinnamon is sometimes known as ""true"" or ""proper"" cinnamon, but is not always as easy to find in your average supermarket as Cassia Cinnamon. Ceylon Cinnamon is, however, the best choice due to its lower coumarin content.Regular coumarin consumption can potentially cause liver problems.It can also interfere with diabetes medication, so check with your physician to ensure that it is safe for you to use cinnamon.;
, You can buy cinnamon in a powder, in sticks, as a supplement, and as cinnamon extract. Think about what you are using it for before deciding which form of cinnamon to buy. If you want to introduce some cinnamon into your normal diet you will have different requirements than if you wanted to try to take it more medicinally. Try to use a variety of sticks and powders in different foods and drinks to keep it interesting.If you are buying it to season your food, go for a powder.
Add a stick to the pan when you are cooking rice.
If your doctor has advised you to take cinnamon as part of your attempts to manage your blood sugar levels, you can buy cinnamon extract from health food stores which has had the coumarin completely removed., Cinnamon is considered to have good anti-microbial properties, which can help your immune system fight against a cold or flu. It can help to tackle the growth of bacteria and fungus.By adding a teaspoon of cinnamon to hot water, you are making a soothing drink which will won’t cure your cold but will help you feel a bit better.

, Having a hot cinnamon drink can tackle your cold and flu symptoms, and more specifically, can help to dry up an irritating runny nose.You can combine it with ginger for an extra kick.

, A lot like a hot drink, adding cinnamon to hot soup adds some flavour while also potentially bringing some relief to those under the weather.


The anti-microbial properties of cinnamon are such that it has been cited as a natural food preservative."

Serve 100% whole grains.,
Focus on higher fiber vegetables.,
Increase the amount of high-fiber fruits.,
Choose high-fiber protein sources.,
Serve fiber-fortified foods.,
Add oat or wheat bran to foods.,
Use flax and chia seeds more often.,
Blend fruits and vegetables into baked goods and casseroles.,
Pair high-fiber foods together.,
Consider a child's fiber supplement.,
Talk to your child's pediatrician.,
Monitor for any symptoms of excessive fiber intake.,
Make sure your child drinks an adequate amount of fluids.",How to Add Fiber to Your Child's Diet," One easy way to get in more fiber into your child's diet is by serving them whole grains. Items like bread, rice and pasta are usually well-received by children and can offer a valuable source of fiber.


Whole grains are a better and more nutritious food compared to refined grains. They're minimally processed which leaves the fibrous part of the grain intact.
Refined grains are much more processed and the fibrous part of the grain (the bran) is removed. This leaves items like white rice or white bread much lower in fiber.
When preparing meals or snacks for your child, provide them with a serving of 100% whole grains. Measure out 1/2 cup of cooked grains or 1 oz of grains.Whole grains to try include: brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole grain pasta, whole wheat bread, whole wheat wraps/tortillas, whole grain waffles, whole grain English muffins and popcorn.
If your child doesn't like the nutty, chewy flavor of some whole grains, consider using white whole grain. White whole grain is a different type of wheat from traditional red wheat, and it's lighter in color and milder in flavor than red wheat. You can purchase 100% white whole grain bread and pastas.;
, Another food group that provides a valuable source of fiber is vegetables. Although these might not be your child's favorite food, they can help increase their overall fiber intake.


Your child should consume a serving of vegetables two to three times a day. Measure out 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of leafy greens.The highest fiber vegetables include: artichokes, peas, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, corn, potatoes and carrots.With any vegetable, including these, leave the skins on if they're edible — like potato skins. This is where a lot of the fiber is found in many vegetables.
If your child isn't a big fan of all of the higher fiber vegetables, that's OK. All vegetables contain some fiber which will be helpful overall.

, Increasing the amount of fruit in your child's diet is another easy way to get in more fiber. Like grains, fruits are generally enjoyed by most children since they're a little sweet.


Similar to vegetables, you should aim to have your child eat about two servings of fruit every day. This might be a small piece of fruit or about 1/2 cup of chopped fruit.The highest fiber fruits include: raspberries, pears, apples, bananas, oranges, strawberries and raisins.In addition, keep the edible skins on the fruit you serve your child. Do not peel apples or pears as this is where a lot of the fiber comes from in these particular fruits.

, You may not think protein is a great source of fiber; however, some protein sources, especially vegetarian protein sources, do contain a decent amount of fiber.


Many protein sources, like chicken, fish or beef, do not contain any fiber; however, foods like beans, lentils, tempeh and nuts do contain some fiber.
Since these foods fall into the protein category, they should be measured and portioned as such. Serve 1/2 cup or about 3 – 4 oz of these fiber-rich foods.The highest fiber foods include: split peas, lentils, black beans, lima beans, baked beans, almonds, pistachios, tempeh and pecans.

, Another way you can increase your child's fiber intake is by serving them more foods fortified with fiber. Some food manufacturers are now producing foods that have added fiber.Since fiber is such a ""hot topic,"" many companies are now adding extra fiber to their foods. Foods that usually do not contain fiber or contain very low amounts now have a higher content.
Foods that are commonly fortified with fiber include: soy milk, yogurt, OJ, cereals, granola bars and protein bars.
Although not fortified with fiber, fruit juices that have pulp also have fiber. Since the pulp is the flesh of the fruit, it contains fiber which makes these drinks higher in fiber.

, If your child isn't a huge fan of fruits, vegetables or whole grains, there are other ways to add more fiber to your child's meals. Oat and wheat bran are great ingredients to use to help increase fiber.


Part of what makes a whole grain ""whole"" is that it contains the bran of the kernel. The bran is the fibrous shell of the grain. Oat and wheat bran are the fibrous content of the oat and wheat grain.
Oat and wheat bran have a slightly nutty flavor, but are a fine texture. They're easily hidden in foods and do not impart a significant flavor. This makes them a great way to bulk up the fiber of foods without your child knowing the wiser.Try adding wheat or oat bran to foods like: baked goods (like cookies, muffins or quick breads), pureed into smoothies, mixed into casseroles like lasagna or mac and cheese or into savory baked goods like meatballs or meatloaf.

, Other foods that you can sneak into your child's food are chia seeds and flaxseeds. This tiny little seeds contain a significant amount of fiber and can be easily hidden in foods.One ounce of chia seeds has about 10 g of fiber, while one ounce of flaxseeds contain about 8 g of fiber.
Both chia and flax seeds can be ground into a flour-like consistency. Like oat or wheat bran, it can be added to savory baked goods, sweet baked goods or added to your child's smoothie.
If your child enjoys nuts and seeds, you can try sprinkling chia or flax seeds onto salads, on top of yogurt or mixed into homemade granola.

, If your child doesn't enjoy eating a serving of fruit or vegetables, you may want to consider pureeing or blending them into other foods. This can help increase their fiber from a natural and nutritious source.


Try hiding fruit in baked goods. You can use applesauce in place of fat in quick breads, muffins and cookies. You can also add dried or frozen fruit to these baked goods as well.
Vegetables are also quite easy to sneak into foods. Shredded or pureed vegetables can be added to quick breads, muffins, waffles or pancakes. You can add shredded zucchini to muffins or pureed pumpkin to a waffle mix.
You can also hide vegetables in savory foods. Consider pureeing vegetables into sauces, stews, soups, casseroles or meats (like meatloaf or burgers).

, Try to make the best out of the foods your child loves and their fiber content. Pairing two high-fiber foods that your child enjoys helps maximize how much fiber your child can get at one time.For example, try:


Adding artichokes or broccoli to whole wheat pasta
Mixing pinto beans together with brown rice or quinoa.
Serving a whole grain waffle with peanut butter and sliced banana.

, Although eating foods is the best way to get in any nutrient, it may be a good back up to have your child take a fiber supplement daily.


Always talk to your pediatrician before giving your child any type of vitamin, mineral or fiber supplement. Fiber supplements are generally considered safe for children.Only give your child one fiber supplement daily. There is no need to give them multiple fiber supplements.
Remember, a fiber supplement is only a back up to your child's diet. You should still aim to provide all your child's fiber from their diet.

, If you think you need to increase your child's fiber intake, start by talking to your pediatrician. They can help provide you with methods to increase your child's fiber intake safely.


Most pediatricians and health professionals recommend that children should consume fiber daily. The latest recommendation is that kids should eat 14g of fiber for every 1,000 calories they eat. The general recommendations suggest the following:One to three-year-olds get about 19g of fiber daily
Four to eight-year-olds get about 25g of fiber daily
Nine- to 13-year-old girls get about 26g of fiber daily
Nine- to 13-year-old boys get about 31g of fiber daily
14- to 18-year-old girls get about 26g of fiber daily
14- to 18-year-old boys get about 38g of fiber daily


Talk to your pediatrician about your child's current intake and how you think additional fiber will benefit them.
Also ask if there are any precautions you and your child should take if you were to increase their fiber intake.

, Although fiber is an essential part to a healthy diet, too much fiber can be a problem. Once you've increased your child's fiber intake, monitor for any adverse symptoms.


Your child may complain of a stomach ache, feel bloated or constipation if they have too much fiber.
Always incorporate fiber slowly into your child's diet. A quick increase can cause stomach upset, gas and bloating.
Excessive fiber intake may also interfere with the absorption of some vitamins and minerals as well.To avoid any issues with excessive fiber (although rare), only have your child consume the recommended amount. There is nothing to gain by exceeding that value.

, Whenever you increase your child's fiber intake, it's also important to increase their fluid intake. Monitor how much they're drinking during the day to ensure they're getting in enough fluids.


For extra fiber to work well, you need to stay well hydrated. Fiber absorbs water through the GI system which enables it to work well in your body.Most kids only need about 5 to 7 cups (1 to 1.7 liters) of fluids daily. Have them stick to sugar-free, hydrating beverages like water or flavored waters. They can also drink milk if they'd like."

Make meal times pleasant.,
Exercise.,
Drink enough liquids.,
Keep a food diary.,
Avoid eating alone.,
Use large plates.,
See a doctor.",How to Increase Your Appetite2," Eating can be a much more enjoyable experience when you put some effort into creating a pleasant atmosphere at meal times. Light some candles, put some music on, or watch your favorite TV show while eating. Also try to avoid stressful topics of conversation at the table, especially if your poor appetite is a symptom of anxiety., Doing some light exercise can really help to stimulate your appetite. Your body is designed to crave more energy from food after burning calories, so you'll always feel hungrier after exercising.You don't need to put in a strenuous work-out at the gym for this to work, even a brisk walk outside in the fresh air half an hour before a meal can help to stimulate appetite.
If you are underweight, you should avoid any form of strenuous exercise because even though you will be hungrier after working out, the food you eat will only balance out the calories you burned while exercising, which is no good if you are trying to gain weight. Leave the strenuous exercise until your appetite has improved and weight has increased.

, You should aim to drink between 6 to 8 glasses of water or water-based drinks a day. Drinking a glass of water an hour before and an hour after a meal can help with digestion and ensure that there is not too much food in the stomach at any given time. However, you should avoid drinking too much water directly before or during a meal, as this can decrease your appetite and give you a false sense of fullness.


Certain herbal teas have also traditionally been used to increase appetite, in particular peppermint, anise and licorice teas. Try drinking a cup or two throughout the day to increase your liquid intake and potentially increase your appetite.You may want to drink water and liquids at a different time than when you eat your meals.

, Keeping a food diary is a great way to identify and understand the problems in your relationship with food, so you can attempt to overcome them. Everyday you should make notes of the times you felt hungry or of the foods that appealed to you most. This way you can identify the best times and foods for you to eat, so you can maximize your appetite.


You should also make notes foods or smells that you find unappealing, so you can try to avoid them in future.
In addition, keeping a food diary will allow you to track your progress to see how far you've come, which can be a great confidence boost.

, It is a lot easier to skip meals or avoid eating what's on your plate if you frequently eat alone. Arrange to eat family dinners or invite a friend over to eat with you. You will enjoy the experience more and may even forget that you're eating.


Having other people around is also a good idea as they can offer you encouragement and hold you accountable for the food you fail to eat, if that's what you want.
If eating with family and friends is not always an option, consider joining a business breakfast club or an interest-based social club where you can dine alongside others for a few meals a week.

, Eating food off larger plates than usual is a psychological trick which leads your brain to believe that you are eating a smaller portion of food. In this way, you can eat more than if the food was piled high on a small plate, even if it's exactly the same amount of food.


Using brightly colored plates and arranging your food in an aesthetically pleasing way has also been said to positively affect appetite.

, If your poor appetite persists you should consider seeing a doctor. If he or she feels that your appetite is negatively impacting your health, they may prescribe you with an appetite inducing medication, such as megestrol or Marinol, which should help you to develop a healthy appetite."

Increase your zinc intake.,
Eat faster.,
Take a supplement.,
Drink protein shakes.",How to Increase Your Appetite3," Zinc is a very important important mineral for bodybuilders - it strengthens the immune system and stimulates testosterone production. It may also help your body produce protein and heal wounds. Low zinc levels have also been linked with poor appetite, as zinc is needed to produce HCl which regulates digestion in the stomach. Therefore, by increasing your zinc intake you can also increase your appetite.It is recommended that beginner bodybuilders start out with 15 milligrams a day (for men) and 9 milligrams a day (for women), though this can be increased overtime.It is possible to increase your zinc intake by taking a supplement, however toxicity is a concern so it's best to get as much of your daily zinc intake from food as possible.If you do decide to take oral zinc supplements, be sure to talk to your doctor first.
Some foods which contain high levels of zinc include: oysters, chicken, beef shank, pork chops, wheat bran, cashew nuts and pumpkin seeds., When trying to consume more food at each sitting, it may help to try eating your food a little faster. Research has shown that it can take up to 20 minutes from the time you start eating for your brain to start sending out signals that it's full.By eating faster, you can trick your body into consuming more food than usual. Try eating bigger bites and avoid putting your fork down in between, just make sure you chew everything thoroughly.


Be warned that you may feel extremely full once your brain does register that you've eaten enough. However, over time your body will adjust to this feeling and your appetite should increase, especially if you are also increasing the intensity of your work-outs.

, Certain forms of B vitamins are said to help bodybuilders increase their appetite - namely, B12 and Folic acid. You can take these vitamins in tablet form or more directly, through injections which your doctor can prescribe., If you're having trouble eating the large quantities of food necessary to build muscle, you can consider drinking protein shakes. Protein shakes are essentially a type of supplement which provide high levels of protein in an easily drinkable form. They are helpful when consuming large quantities of protein-rich foods leaves you feeling bloated and overly-full.


Your body can digest, at most, 30 grams of protein per meal. Do not drink protein shakes that contain more than 30 grams in each serving."
