Identify your concentration weaknesses.,
Plan and prioritize your activities.,
Remove distractions and stress.,
Take breaks to refresh and refocus.,
Set up a flexible routine.,
Reward yourself.,
Practice, practice, practice.",How to Improve Concentration1," Consider what makes it difficult for you to concentrate or focus your energy on a particular activity, subject, or problem. Once you’re aware of your weaknesses, you’ll be able to proactively focus your energy.


There are many different factors that may affect your ability to concentrate. The Internet is a major source of distraction for many people. Other examples are email, phone calls, children, and chatty colleagues.
Poor sleep and nutrition and not getting enough exercise also affect your ability to focus on one activity. A recent study from Harvard University showed the relationship between exercise and the ability to concentrate.;
, By actively prioritizing what you need to do and forming a plan around it, you will be able to successfully focus your concentration on one task at a time.


Make a list of your activities and rank each task by its importance. This list acts as a visual cue to you and your brain on where your focus should lay at any given time. If you find your mind wandering, you can always revisit the list.
A helpful hint is to allot a specific amount of time for each activity. Every person can concentrate on one task for approximately 50 minutes.Scheduling and prioritizing your activities around this will help you to successfully concentrate on one task at a time. For example, if you need to answer emails, spend 50 minutes on the task in the morning and then move on. You can always schedule another block of time for email later in the day., Avoiding multitasking and constant sensory input will significantly help you direct your concentration to one particular activity.


Distractions come from different sources including the Internet, email, the telephone, or even other people. Shut down all non-essential electronics and, if you can, shut your door and tell family members, friends and colleagues to not disturb you unless it’s an emergency.
Eliminating anything that causes you stress and makes your mind wander is also important to focusing your energy. Stressful surroundings are one example. Make sure you are in an atmosphere conducive to concentration: find a comfortable place to sit, light your space properly to stimulate the brain, and practice good posture to keep your blood flowing. These factors will help you remain alert and focused on your task., By splitting up your tasks into workable parts, you automatically set up time for short breaks. Pauses will help you to refresh your mind and body and also prepare them to refocus on a specific activity.


A short walk is an excellent way to take a break. It gets you away from your task, circulates your blood and gets oxygen to your brain, lets your mind wander, and helps you relax.Feel free to push beyond a scheduled break if you like. It is one way to build mental stamina. But remember that you will need to take a break to successfully refresh yourself and your mind.Setting aside “worry” or “wander” time is also important. Give yourself a set time every day to let your mind deal with any problems you may have or just to do nothing. Having these types of breaks to recharge is as important as the small breaks you take between tasks.

, Having a routine that you can amend as needed is another cue to yourself and your brain to concentrate on one task or activity.


Be flexible in this routine to accommodate for changing situations and interests. Flexibility will help you relax and keep you from burning out.

, Another technique to help you concentrate is to focus is by rewarding yourself. For example, you might allow yourself to go to lunch with a friend for successfully concentrating on emails or writing four pages.

, Remember that you’re learning a new skill that requires a lot of practice to master it.


Make sure to place your full concentration on only one task at a time. If you find your mind wandering, you can use the “be here, now” technique to refocus. Whenever you find yourself focusing on more than one activity or thought, gently repeat to yourself “be here, now” until you can refocus your concentration.If you find it difficult to refocus after this, move on to another activity. Your brain may just need a change. After a certain period of time with one activity, people are better able to concentrate on a different task."

Learn about meditation.,
Prepare for meditation sessions.,
Develop your daily meditation practice.",How to Improve Concentration2," Meditation is one of the most powerful methods to improve concentration. Before you can start, it’s good to know some basic facts about meditation practice.Meditation is an active lifestyle practice that teaches you to direct your focus on one specific area.Humans have practiced different forms of meditation for thousands of years. It has had different purposes, from finding inner illumination to relaxing and learning to concentrate.
Meditation forces you to truly unplug from the world and focus internally. Having this unplugged time will teach you to concentrate. Another benefit is that it will help you relax, an important component of improving your ability to concentrate.

, A daily period of meditation offers the chance to work specifically on directing concentration on one focal point.


Set up a daily schedule to meditate. Allot time every day for meditation practice. Start with 5-10 minutes and gradually increase your time as you become more proficient at meditating.Find a quiet and comfortable place where you’ll be uninterrupted. By eliminating any distractions and sitting upright, yet comfortably, you’ll make it easier to focus your attention on your breath and let go of any thoughts or sensations that arise., Once you’ve prepared a schedule and quiet place to meditate, you’re ready to begin developing your skills. Remember that meditation is an active process and not a time to completely chill out.Sit upright and still and close your eyes. Proper posture is a vital part of meditation. It allows your breath and blood to flow, which helps your brain learn to focus on one point. Closing your eyes will help keep distractions at bay.Breathe easily and evenly. Don’t control your breath; rather, let it come and go. An excellent technique to help your concentration is to focus solely on your breath by saying “let” on the inhale and “go” on the exhale.Be aware of physical and mental sensations. Let them come and go to help you relax and go deeper into your meditation practice.
If you lose your inner concentration during your meditation session, take a deep breath and refocus your energy inwards. It’s completely normal for this to happen, especially as you develop your meditation practice.

Get up early - for many people, the first 20 minutes of their day is the most stressful, reducing their energy for the rest of the day.,
Don't skip breakfast.,
Start your day well dressed, well groomed & most of all, with a big smile.,
Arrive for work half an hour early.,
Use that half hour.,
When someone asks you to do something, take a moment and listen.,
Don't get angry or stressed, even over small things, it only makes your day unpleasant.,
Be assertive, but avoid conflict.,
Plan on going home on time.",How to Have a Good Day at Work," You will get up just one hour early, allowing you to take things slow. Aim to leave the house half an hour early.;
, Have a nice cereal and some milk, or soy or almond milk. Skipping breakfast (or any other meals) does not lead to weight loss but some assume that to be true. Don't eat a slimming cereal though - have oats with real raspberries, or perhaps slices of banana.

, Prepare, e.g. iron, your clothes the night before. Shave, or get your make up right. Days are better if people treat you better, and people treat you better if you look attractive, that you take good care of yourself.

, You left half an hour early, so you have time to get there without feeling rushed. Your boss will probably be happy to see this, and cut you some slack for the rest of the day.

, It's not your bosses time after all. Plan your day. Read company procedure for what is expected of you (your job description), or learn a new skill. If you are a software project manager, you might want to read about accounting. If you work in retail, learn about how to fix the barcode computer when it goes wrong.

, Keep a little A5 notepad, and make a note of it so you won't forget. Check about 4 times through the day to make sure you haven't missed something urgent.

, Unexpected and unwanted things happen, that's life, and the people around you understand that. The most important thing to do is manage failure. Make sure the relevant supervisor knows about the risk before it happens, and take a step back to come up with a rescue plan. Own the solution.

, By understanding peoples motives, and thinking about the reasons why they are causing conflict, you can find mutually acceptable solutions. Their reasons may seem selfish to you - they don't want a time consuming task because they want to leave early for a date say. But conflict is likely to simply entrench their position or cause resentment. Find some advantage in the situation, e.g. ""Sure, I'll do that today, and I hope it goes really well. By the way, I need to get away early on Friday, so could you help me with my stuff that day"".

, Make sure everything is done with half an hour to spare, so your last half hour is just finishing up. If you always end up staying late because there is too much work, then often you will never finish everything of an evening. That means it can wait till tomorrow. Leave on time, and don't worry about the backlog. It just means that a 2nd person is needed, and when that becomes clear, maybe you will be promoted in charge of them.

Set real goals for yourself, not just metrics to follow.,

Take breaks.",How to Have Fun at Work," One way to have more fun at work is to set tangible goals for yourself whenever you head into the office. Though metrics — believing you can write X amount of reports or talk to Y amount of clients in one week — can be a short-term motivator, having more meaningful goals, such as developing your communication skills or writing the most comprehensive report you’ve ever written on a certain subject can help you think of your job in terms of a big picture. Having long term goals that feel meaningful instead of just like you’re crunching numbers can definitely help make your workplace more fun for you.


Write down your weekly work goals before you get to work on Monday, and work on setting monthly or even yearly goals. The more you have to strive toward, the more motivated you will feel.
Believe it or not, setting goals and meeting them actually will make your work week much more fun!;
, If you want your workplace to be more fun, then you have to work on being more positive. Sure, everyone loves to complain about work, but if you get into the habit of constantly complaining about work with all of your co-workers, then you’ll be heading in a downward spiral. Though it can help to vent about the things that bother you, try talking about a new innovation or co-worker you like at work for a change, and see how much this improves your level of happiness and your overall mood.


Work on genuinely complimenting at least one of your coworkers each day. This can help set a positive tone to your day.
If you catch yourself making a negative comment, try to compensate with at least two positive comments.
When your coworkers complain about work, you don’t have to tell them to stop, but you can try to naturally change the subject to something more positive.

, If you want to have fun at work, then you have to stop thinking that being professional means being serious all the time. If you take a moment to laugh at the funny things that happen at the office, to occasionally share a funny story with a coworker, or just to read a funny comic someone put on the fridge, you’ll begin to see how much more fun you’re capable of having in the workplace. If you stop seeing work as a “no fun” zone, then you’ll open yourself to endless possibilities.If your office environment is pretty fun and open, you can even play harmless pranks on your co-workers, like placing a rubber spider on their desks, once in a while. Just make sure you know them well enough for this to not send the wrong message.
Learn to laugh at yourself, too. If you take yourself less seriously, you’ll be able to relax and have more fun.

, Being motivated to succeed can really help you have fun in the workplace. In order to be motivated, you have to not only set personal goals but to really believe in the good that your company does. (Of course, it can be a little trickier if you can’t find the good — then you may need a new strategy!) Focus on the fact that you’re helping people and producing something meaningful, and you’ll feel more motivated to work hard while having fun in the process.


Being motivated may be easier than staying motivated. One way to stay motivated is to write a to-do list at the beginning of your work day or work week and to take satisfaction in crossing each item off the list.
Talk to your coworkers about projects you’re really excited about. This will help you be motivated and to get excited about your work. You can even share your results with your coworkers, which will also make your job more fun.

, Generating a sense of purpose isn’t always easy. If you feel like you’re just doing the same thing day after day or just crunching numbers, then it can be difficult to have fun with what you’re doing. To have a sense of purpose, you have to think that no one can do your job as well as you can and that the work you do is meaningful and that you should get it done as well as you can. If you walk into the office counting down the moments until you leave instead of focusing on having a sense of meaning from the work you do, then you won’t be able to have fun at the office.Your job should help you make the most of your skills and interests. If you feel like you’re not using your interests or your best talents in the workplace, then it may be harder to have fun at work.
Your sense of purpose can lie in helping people. Whether you’re a lifestyle blogger or a grief counsellor, you can have a sense of purpose in the fact that you’re making a person’s life better and that this couldn’t happen without you.

, Though it’s important to have fun at work, some studies show that if you try too hard to have fun, you’ll actually be making yourself miserable. One study in Australia found that workers in an environment where they felt pressured to smile, look happy all the time, and participate in “fun” events actually felt stifled and stressed out by having to look happy all the time. That is to say, you should try to have more fun, but not so much that you feel like you’re putting too much pressure on yourself.If you’re having a really bad day and just want to be left alone, then don’t force yourself to plaster a fake grin on your face. Be kind but quiet to your co-workers and do your own thing until you feel better. Forcing it too much can actually make you feel worse.
Also, you shouldn’t try too hard to make everyone in the office have fun. Not everyone in the office will get wrapped up in the spirit of having fun, and you have to respect that, too.

, One way to make your work environment more fun is to bring some more fun activities to the workplace. Though you want to clear this with your boss and make sure it doesn’t lead to too much slacking off, just having some more fun things in your office can lead you and everyone else to have more fun. It’ll give you more to look forward to when you walk into the office and will allow you take short breaks that lead to higher happiness and productivity. Here are some other fun activities you can bring:


Stick some magnetic poetry on the fridge and have fun creating unique phrases with your coworkers.
As corny as it sounds, a little basketball and basketball hoop can lead to some fun activity and conversation during breaks, as would a little Koosh ball that you and your coworkers can bring around.
If you just came back from vacation, bring back some trinkets as gifts for your coworkers or some photographs to show what you’ve been up to.
Bring board games that you can play during your lunch break.

, If your workplace allows it, having a change of scenery can sometimes have a major impact on your level of happiness. Try having a walking meeting outside with one of your co-workers instead of meeting in your office. If you’re giving an informal presentation, try doing it outdoors or in a new part of the office. If you always eat lunch in the cafeteria, walk across the street to get your sandwich fix. These little changes can make a big difference to how much fun you’re having.


Of course, you should talk to your boss first to make sure this is okay. You can argue that it’ll lead to higher happiness and productivity.

, Another way to have more fun at the office is to spruce up your workplace. This can mean bringing in flowers every week, hoping that someone else will follow suit, placing funny magnets on the fridge, bringing snacks for breakfast, or even seeing if you can bring your dog to work once in a while. As long as it’s okay with your boss, making an effort to make your work environment more fun, cheery, and sunny can really make a big difference on the fun factor of going to work.You can even ask if you can spruce up the common area in your workplace. Adding some funny posters, some gorgeous paintings, or some potted plants can make the workplace seem more homey and fun.
Bring in activities that can make your office feel more communal. Bake cookies or bring in a partially-completed crossword puzzle and ask for help with it.

, If you want to have a more fun work environment, then you should participate in more events with your coworkers so that your work environment feels more fun because you’ll all be getting to know each other better. You can go to a weekly happy hour or trivia night to have some laughs with your co-workers, join a book club with some of them, or be part of a softball league. All of these activities will lead to more fun and friendly work environment.Another fun thing you can do with your coworkers is to join a volunteering organization together. This can help you contribute toward a good cause while bonding.
If people in your office seem to like each other but are hesitant to start anything, then you can take the initiative to organize some social events. You’ll be the center of the fun and your co-workers will be grateful.

, This sounds like a small thing, but it can make a huge difference. At some workplaces, people feel locked in to their computers, as if a magnetic force field is keeping them from looking up, even if Jennifer Lawrence or Ryan Gosling walked in to the office. Though it’s important to get your work done, you’ve got to get out of the mentality that you can’t give the people and things around you a moment of your time. Once you loosen up and take the time to smile at people or to look at the croissants someone brought in to the office, you’ll be on your way to having more fun.


When someone passes by, make a habit of looking up and saying hello and even having a quick conversation some of the time. This will make your work day more fun and exciting for sure.
If you start looking up from your computer more, then other co-workers will follow suit. You can start a trend of more fun and sociability in the workplace.

, Another way to make your work environment more fun is to develop positive relationships in the workplace. Though everyone loves some good office gossip, starting a trend to actually say positive things about the people you work with and to develop strong connections with them instead of bringing them down can make you much more excited to come to work. You’ll have much more fun at work if you come to think of your coworkers as your friends instead of your frenemies.


If one of your co-workers hears that you’ve been praising him or her, then he’ll like you even more for it. Everybody wins.
If you’re in a conversation that is filled with gossip, you don’t have to castigate people for it, but you can try to kindly excuse yourself, even if you just say you have to make a phone call real quick. Alternately, you can try to change the subject to something more positive.

, One of the easiest ways to have more fun at work is to make more of an effort to talk to your colleagues. Instead of rushing to your desk and spending all day hanging out with your computer, make an effort to stop and chat with your co-workers every once in a while, even if it’s a quick talk in the kitchen or in the hallway. Taking just a few minutes a day to talk to your co-workers won’t really slow down your productivity and it’ll actually make you have more fun when you come in to the office.


The more you talk to people, the more you’ll look forward to seeing friendly faces, and the more fun you’ll have in the workplace.
You don’t have to be best friends with your co-workers to laugh and joke around with them a bit.
Instead of sending an email or a Skype message to a co-worker who is working just a few feet away from you, make an effort to get up and talk to him or her in person. These small daily interactions will make for a more fun work day.

, Having strong relationships with your coworkers can not only help you advance in your career, but it can also help you have more fun at work.If you make a real effort to get to know your coworkers, to socialize with them outside of work, and to consider some of them your friends, you’ll be able to have a lot more fun in the workplace because you’ll be more excited to come in to work if you know your friends are there. Give your co-workers a chance and see which ones can be your real friends; as for the rest of them, work on building a friendly, healthy rapport with them.


Don’t make excuses for why you can’t be friends with your co-workers; if you think that one person is too old, too young, or too wrapped up in family to be your friend, then you’ll be missing out on some great friendships.
Of course, this doesn’t mean you should try to date your co-workers; romantic relationships in the office may lead to some fun initially, but will definitely lead to discomfort and awkwardness down the line.
Make an extra effort to be friendly. Your co-workers may be wishing for a more friendly relationship but they be afraid to take the first step.

, Instead of eating lunch with your coworkers, you can also try taking a yoga or a ballet class during your lunch break a few times a week. If you don’t have time to schedule this much physical activity, then just try to be as active as possible throughout your day. This can help your body feel energized while leaving your mind feeling happier. Here are some other ways to get activity during work:


Take the stairs instead of the elevator
Walk to a co-worker’s desk to have a conversation instead of sending an email
Do five minutes of basic stretching or exercising at your desk
Take breaks to walk outside, even if it’s just to get lunch or coffee

, One way to have more fun during your work day is to turn your commute into something you look forward to instead of something that you dread. A lot of people spend their commute listening to music and either dreading the workday or decompressing from it. You can do better than that. Doing something that you actually want to do on your commute will make you look forward to it instead of dreading it, which will make for a more fun day.


If you’re driving, listen to a book on tape, make a phone date with your best friend (as long as you have a headpiece), or even listen to a lecture about the fall of the Roman empire.
If you’re on a train, read a magazine, set up fun plans for your weekend, or write in a journal.

, Though a lot of people use lunch as a time to decompress, make phone calls to the repairman, or just to be left alone, making a habit of having communal lunch can make you feel more bonded to your co-workers and to have more fun during this time of the day. While you don’t have to do it every day, spending time with your coworkers at least a few times a week during lunch will help you have more fun than you would when you were alone. As long as you find time to decompress, having lunch with your coworkers will lead to a more positive work day.


Try to relax during lunch and to enjoy talking to your co-workers instead of rushing through your food to get back to your work. This social time is important for regaining your energy and it will actually allow you to have more fun when you get back to work, not to mention to have more fun while you eat.
Another way to have fun during lunch is to mix it up. If you’re in the habit of grabbing lunch with your coworkers a few times a week, try having Mexican, Indian, Italian, or Thai food throughout the week so you don’t get bored with the same old food.

, Another important thing to do if you want to have more fun at work is to take breaks from your work at least once an hour. Ideally, you should take a 10-15 minute break after an hour to an hour and a half of solid work so that you can regroup, rest your mind, and give your body a break, too. A break can mean taking a 15-minute walk, reading your favorite gossip site, closely reading a poem from a book you keep in your desk, or even drawing a quick sketch. If you get too locked into your work, you won’t be having any fun.Breaks also give you something to look forward to and keep you motivated. If you tell yourself, “Once I finish this report, I’ll check if Josh and Andi from the bachelorette are still together,” you’ll be much more motivated than if you think, “Once I finish this report...I’ll start the next report.”
Even a short break to rest your eyes to meditate, rake your Zen garden, or just to stare outside the window for a few minutes can have a big impact on your productivity as well as how much fun you’re having.

End the statement with what kind of value you bring the employer.,
Think of the skills that you gained in school.",How to Write Resume Objectives1," Finding exactly what an employer is looking for will help cater your resume objective to the specific job that you're seeking. Look for traits that the company is looking for and try to relate it to skills that you possess. Instead of copying the exact wording of the job description, think of different ways that you can explain your positive traits using different words.For example, if the job listing is looking for an IT professional ""with knowledge of multiple programming languages"" you can write that you have ""a full grasp on CSS, PHP, and Java."";
, The introduction for your resume objective should explain who you are and why you are applying for the job. Start your objective by talking about your major in school or the experience that you have.For example, a good opening would be ""Third-year law student with one year of experience working as a paralegal for Smith & Co.""

, The next part of your resume objective should be a positive characteristic that you can bring to the position you're applying to. Relate the trait to the job listing and then cite the job title itself. Think of things that set you apart from the rest and that also relates to the duties that you'd have to do if you got the job.


You can say something like, ""Looking to leverage my research and organizational skills as an associate researcher for your organization.""
Or you could say, ""Seeking to leverage my customer service and PR skills to become a account executive with your organization.""

, Locate keywords within the job listing and end your statement by emphasizing how your skills and traits match with the position. Keywords include adjectives like team player, organized, reliable, disciplined, hardworking, and dedicated.You can say something like ""I'm disciplined and hardworking and will go above and beyond on whatever I'm doing.""
The full resume objective would read, ""Third-year law student with one year of experience working as a paralegal for Smith & Co. Looking to leverage my research and organizational skills as an associate researcher for your organization. I'm disciplined and hardworking and will go above and beyond the scope of the position.""

, If you have little to no experience, you can write about how your experiences in school or clubs can translate to your new job. Think of your wok ethic or skills you gained at school, and write down a list of traits that might relate to the job.For example, if you are academically excellent you can say you are ""driven, organized, or a quick learner.""
If you were great in sports you can say that you're a ""team player, disciplined, or strategic"".
If you were part of a community drama club, you can say that you're ""creative or expressive"".

Get used to a busy schedule.,
Try to take a day for yourself each week.,
Stay connected to your family and friends.,
Sleep as much as you can.,
Treat yourself now and then.,
Keep your jobs local, if possible.",How to Handle Two or More Jobs2," Working two or more jobs means that you are going to be very busy most days. Try to start seeing this busy pace as your norm and welcome a bit of craziness into your life. Do your best to maintain a positive attitude and make the most of this chaotic period in your life., When working two or more jobs, it can be easy to forget to take time for yourself. But it is important to make sure that you have time to reconnect with friends and family, relax, and rest. If possible, set aside a day each week where you do not work any of your jobs.Plan a fun day with your family or friends, go to a museum, see a movie, or just lay around in your pajamas and read all day.

, Working two or more jobs may cause you to feel disconnected from the people you care about. Therefore, it is important to find ways to stay connected even when you can’t see people.


Call or text your friends often and use social media to update people on your whereabouts and accomplishments.
Just remember that phone calls, text messages, and social media are not equal substitutes for face-to-face interactions with your loved ones, so schedule in-person meetings as well. Try meeting a friend for lunch or a quick drink after work., Working more than two jobs can lead to exhaustion and sleep deprivation. If you are going right from one job to the next or if you are working late nights at one of your jobs, you may have an even higher risk of becoming sleep deprived or suffering from exhaustion.Go to bed early if you have a long day ahead of you and take naps whenever possible. Even a 20 minute nap before heading to your second job may help you to feel more alert and refreshed.

, Many people work more than one job for financial reasons, but if you save every penny you earn, you may start to feel like there is no benefit to working so much. While you still want to use some of the money you earn on things that will benefit your financial health, such as credit card payments and savings, you should also treat yourself every now and then.Buy yourself a new outfit, get a pedicure, or go out to a fancy dinner with your friends once in a while.

, Long commutes can make your shifts at work seem even longer and lead to burnout. Therefore, it is best if you can work jobs that do not require much of a commute. Keep both of your jobs as local as possible to help keep your stress down."
"
Choose a second job that you will enjoy and benefit from.,
Take a break in between shifts.,
Focus on one job at a time.",How to Handle Two or More Jobs3," There are lots of ways that you can work two jobs, but the ideal second job is something that you enjoy and will benefit from in the long run. Try to find a second job that allows you to indulge in one of your hobbies or that provides you with new skills that will make you more marketable in the future.

For example, if you love video games, then you might enjoy working at a retail video game store.

, Going straight from one job to the next can be depressing, so try to find a way to take a break before you go from one job to the next. The break does not have to be a long one to help ease the transition from one job to the next. Even a 30 minute break can help.For example, you could stop off at a favorite coffee shop and sit and enjoy a cup of coffee in the shop before heading to your next job.

, It can be difficult to manage two or more jobs, which may cause some people to try to do work for one job while they are on the clock for another job. However, this is a bad idea. Not only may doing work for one job while you are on the clock for another job get you into trouble, it will reduce your effectiveness.Stay focused on one job at a time to do the best work that you can at all of your jobs.

"
Keep it short and concise.,
Make your objective specific.,
Avoid writing a statement about what you're looking for in a career.,
Cater your resume objectives to different jobs.",How to Write Resume Objectives2," Long resume objectives that don't get to the point are less useful. Hiring managers often have to look through hundreds of applicants and won't have the time to read a long resume objective. Your resume objective should be kept to three sentences., A resume objective is meant to be to the point and concise. Avoid adding extra words that don't actually give any explanation to your objectives or career goals, or using words or descriptions that could be applied to virtually any job. Many times you might be tempted to list things that may not actually apply to your personality in order to impress the hiring manager. Don't do this.An example of a poor resume objective would be something like ""Looking for career advancement in a challenging and positive environment"" because these are things that most people look for in any job.

, Resume objectives inform the employer why you would be a good hire, not an explanation of what you expect from them. Avoid writing resume objectives that explain your career goals or what you hope to get out of the job.For instance, you wouldn't want to write ""2-year professional writer looking for a progressive and friendly publication.""

, If you're applying to different kinds of positions, you don't want to have just one resume objective. Change your resume objective to the different jobs that you're applying to so that it applies to that specific job description.

"
"
Write a resume objective if you are going through a career change.,
Create an objective if you're seeking an entry-level position.,
Include an objective if you are targeting a particular position.",How to Write Resume Objectives3," If you're going through a career change, the experience on your resume may not match up with the job you're applying to. In this case, a resume objective can give an explanation on how your experiences and skills can transfer to your new position, as well as the positive traits that you can bring to their company.You can start your resume objective with something like, ""Seeking to leverage my decade of experience in customer service to become an effective account executive.""

, If you have little to no experience, a resume objective can help explain how your skills or experiences in school or with extracurricular activities can translate to the job position you are applying to. Concentrate on talking about your positive traits, and how it would help you in your new role.An example would be ""A third year engineering student with proven organization and critical thinking skills. Seeking an opportunity to leverage my talents as a research assistant with your organization. I have the dedication and eye for detail that will help me aid the company in their objectives.""

, When you are writing a resume objective for a specific position, you can use it to let the employer know about your unique skills or experience that would help you in your new position. Include specific skills that would make you a good fit for the position."
"
Format your resume consistently.,
Write the institution, its location, your degree, and any honors.,
Avoid including unnecessary or obvious words.,
Place the education section near the top if you’re a recent grad.,
List your most recent degree first.,
List your high school diploma if it's your highest degree.",How to Write Your Degree on a Resume1," There’s no set way to format a resume, but the biggest rule is to format consistently.Use one font size for section headings and another for general text, and include consistent bold or italic emphases.For example, if you bold employers’ names in your experience section, write your college in bold, especially if it’s a prestigious school or one known for excellence in your field.
Use a standard sans-serif font, like Arial, for easy readability. Use a 10-12 point size for general text and 14-16 point for section headings.   ;
, Always include the name of your institution, its location, and the name of your degree. You can either write out your full degree name (like Bachelor of Arts) or use its acronym (like B.A.)  if you need to save room.Include honors you were awarded instead of your GPA, especially if you’re not a recent grad.If you’re a recent grad with a high GPA, you could opt to include your GPA. Just be sure to explain your GPA system by writing, for example, “3.92/4.0.”
You can also include your graduation year if you’re a recent grad. Otherwise, you should avoid including dates, especially if your degree is older than 15 years.An example degree listing could be:Yale University, New Haven, CT. Bachelor of Arts in English, Magna cum laude.

, Using “Education” to head the appropriate section is the only descriptive word you’ll need. Including words like “College:” or “Degree:” before the appropriate information is superfluous.Avoid unnecessary words elsewhere in your resume, too. For example, don’t write “Email:” or “Phone:” before listing your contact information. Just write your email address and phone number.

, If you’ve just graduated, you might not have substantial professional experience. Place your education section at the top of your resume, just under your contact information and, if you’ve included one, your career objective. You can also include the year you received the degree if you’ve graduated in the last one to three years.If you’re not a recent grad or have substantial professional experience, place your relevant experience section ahead of your education. In general, professional experience is more valuable information than your education.

, If you have more than one degree, list them in reverse chronological order, or the most recent degree first. In general, you should also list advanced degrees first.If you double majored, you can just list both degrees in the same section under your university:Yale University, New Haven, CT. Double major:
Bachelor of Arts, English. Bachelor of Arts, Art History.

, If you have completed work toward or have earned a college degree, you shouldn't include information about your high school. You can also skip it if you have significant work experience.If not, and if your high school diploma is your highest degree, include your high school's name and location, graduation date (if it's within the last three years), and, if it's above a 3.5/4.0, your GPA:
Nashua High School, Nashua, New Hampshire
High School Diploma, 2016. GPA: 3.8
If your highest degree is a GED diploma or state equivalent certificate, include it if you don't have substantial work experience:
Education
General Educational Development Diploma, 2016.
Education
CHSPE (Certificate of Proficiency from the State of California), 2016.

Tour your work area.,
Visit local tourist destinations.,
Start or join a craft group.,
Join an exercise class.,
Go window shopping.,
Develop a round of cafes that you enjoy in the vicinity.,
Start a book club.,
Be an artist.,
Enjoy winter outdoors too.,
Be a seasonal ""fun-hunter"".,
Be a photographer.,
Set up a games room at work.",How to Have a More Exciting Lunch Hour," If you work somewhere interesting, tour it. Even industrial zones often have spaces of interest to investigate, including river fronts, vacant lots, and curious warehouse allotments. Plan to walk to different places every lunch hour so that you get to know your work area well. Wear good walking shoes and treat it as a good chance to get in some daily exercise.;
, If you are near museums, galleries, libraries etc., go and visit them during your lunch hour. It will never be enough time to see through an entire gallery or museum, so do a floor or an exhibition every time you visit. The great thing about many of these places is that they vary their exhibits so you can always find something new to look at.

, Find other like-minded people and get knitting, quilting, stitching or cutting cards over lunch.

, Find a running club, a squash club, a swimming club etc. that meets over lunch and get actively involved.

, Catch up on the season's latest trends by window shopping in your work area. Note the things you like and what might be affordable. Consider trying things on another lunchtime.

, Take work colleagues with you on some occasions. Compare notes on the things you enjoy most about each of the cafes.

, Use those cafe meets to run a book club at lunchtimes. Some lunches can be for reading only; other lunches for getting together and talking about the books.

, If you like painting, sketching, drawing etc., get down to a park or other natural or interesting feature and set to. This will take a number of lunchtimes to complete.

, You can skate for half an hour and get a hot chocolate down all before getting back to work in time. Or you can make snow angels in the local park. If it doesn't snow where you are, put on the rain boots and slosh in puddles for a lunch. Take brisk walks to ward off the cold.

, As Christmas, Easter, Valentine's etc. draw near, go into the stores and see what gimmicks they have for sale. Set yourself a task to find the ugliest, corniest, most beautiful, sexiest etc. greeting card/ornament/toy etc. possible. This will definitely pass the time. And don't buy it - this is just a game!

, Bring your camera to work and go around making photos of things in an artistic fashion. Look for angles that other people don't see. Make a collage of photos and have people guess where you took them.

, Include both solitary games and group games, as well as a snack machine. This can be a great diversion for rainy days and cold days.

Don't use the 'standardized' resume format produced by many of the more popular online job sites (e.g.,
Don't make your resume too long.,
Do list your work experience in reverse chronological order.,
Don't include irrelevant information.,
Do use 'spell-check' before you send out your application.,
Do provide evidence of your experience.,
Don't overlook the importance of the presentation of the resume.,
Don't send your resume in Landscape format!

,
Do include a Career summary/ Introductory statement.,
Don't use personal pronouns and articles.,
Do think about the 'keyword' content of your resume.",How to Write Good Resumes to Impress the Employers," Job Top Gun). Your resume is personal and should reflect as much as possible as to who you are. By all means use the online system format in order to take advantage of the website's job matching capabilities, but make sure you attach a copy of your personalized resume to the system.;
, There is absolutely no reason for anyone's resume, irrespective of how many years of experience they may have, to cover more than three sides of A4 paper. Remember your resume is a bid to get you noticed and hopefully invited in for a face-to-face interview - reading a resume the length of a novel will not endear you to a prospective employer.

, In other words your most recent job should come first in your resume. Put simply, a potential employer does not want to have to read to the bottom of a document to find out what you are doing now.

, Irrelevant information will often prevent the reader from seeing your 'selling points'. Only include elements of your experience that you feel the hiring company will be looking for in the particular job vacancy. Additionally, don't include information about your hobbies unless relevant to the role you are applying for or are an important part of your social life. For example, knowing your blood type or that you like watching movies is highly unlikely to be a reason why someone would want to interview you.

, Misspellings will, at best, communicate poor writing skills or poor attitude and, at worst, cause big misunderstandings. For example, the executive who claimed he was ""instrumental in ruining the entire operation"" when it should have been ""instrumental in running the entire operation."" Proofread your resume and cover letter carefully and have friends or family read it as well.

, Whilst brevity is highlighted above, it is not sufficient to just provide a list of the companies you have worked for. You need to provide specific examples of how you achieved success. Resume-writing professionals recommend using the PARS formula: Describe a Problem, the Action you took, the Results you achieved and Skills you applied.

, Poor formatting, alignment, spacing, the use of bold and capitalized text, etc., can make a resume difficult to read. Though there are a number of resume layouts that are effective, the following structure is recommended: -Header (your name, address, e-mail address and phone number); -Career summary (profiling the scope of your experience and skills); -Reverse chronological employment history emphasizing achievements; -Education (usually only University level qualifications).

,, Most hiring managers or recruiters don't have time to match unspecified resumes to open positions. It is therefore important to lead off with a career summary or introductory statement that makes it clear what type of position you are seeking and why you are qualified for the role.

, With just two or three pages to sell yourself, make each word count. Write in a telegraphic style, eliminating all personal pronouns and articles like ""the,"" ""a"" and ""an."" Removing the ""I,"" ""me"" and ""my"" from your resume not only frees up space, but creates a subliminal perception of objectivity.

, More and more companies and recruiters are now using applicant tracking software. Your resume needs to contain the keywords and phrases the software is screening for. These words are not the verbs stressed in paper resumes, but nouns such as job titles and technical skills.

Use aromatic steam.,
Warm up with a shower.,
Apply a warm compress.,
Mix in honey with a drink.,
Activate a mist humidifier/vaporizer.,
Gargle with salt water.,
Squirt in a saline spray.,
Use a decongestant spray.,
Keep up with your cough syrup.,
Apply nasal strips.,
Take a pain reliever.,
Take an antiviral drug.",How to Go to Work when You Have a Severe Flu or Other Illness1," Breathing in aromatic steam can help relieve nasal congestion by thinning mucus and it can also relieve sinus pressure and headache symptoms.You can do this at at home or in your workplace’s restroom if time permits.


Add a couple of teaspoons of ginger, one teaspoon of menthol ointment (over-the-counter), or several drops of eucalyptus oil.
Go to a sink with water warm enough to form steam and fill the sink with hot water. You’ll also need a towel, so have one handy.
Drape the towel over the back of your head so the ends drop around either side of your head.
Breathe in the steam for a few minutes.;
, Taking a warm shower before work can also help to relieve some of your congestion. This is another form of steam remedy. Make sure the bathroom door is closed so the steam from the shower builds.Shower as normal with very warm water.


This is only going to be practical at home.

, If you have a throbbing and congested head compounded by difficulty breathing through the nose then a compress is one way to go. Take a thick set of paper towels or clean linen cloth and soak it in warm water. Wrench or squeeze it out so it doesn’t drip everywhere. Allow it to rest on your forehead. Don’t let the water get so hot it burns you.This can be done at home and work.

, You can try this for a throat remedy. Honey is a good soothing substance for a sore throat and cough. Mix in a teaspoon with some hot tea for a beverage.This can be done at home or work. You may want to prepare the mix at home and put the drink in an insulated thermos to take to work.

, This is one environmental solution. If you want to use this at work you will need to be in a relatively small area or it won’t be too effective. And you will need permission most likely. Clean the machine with a solution of bleach every few days to stop the growth of mold or bacteria.The humidifier moistens the air, which can ease congestion in the head and chest.

, This is one oral method you can try. Mixing in a teaspoon of salt with warm water to gargle with can be a quick way to relieve a sore throat at work.You want to do this in the bathroom of your work place.

, Remove the cap. Insert the nozzle into one of your clogged nasal passages. Squeeze in one or two drops while simultaneously clamping shut the other nostril. Inhale deeply. Release the clamped nostril. Follow the instructions on the label to be more precise.Saline or salt water sprays are simple over-the-counter nasal rinses that can thin mucus, relieve postnasal drip, and moisten dry nasal passages. These sprays also have some benefits for removing viruses and bacteria from the nose. They are not medicated so are usually very safe for adults and even kids.

, Open the cap. Insert the tip into one nostril and squirt in one or two pumps. Do the same for the other nostril. You may need to follow other instructions according to your doctor, pharmacist, and/or the label.These are medicated and relieve swollen or stuffy noses. Generally these are safe for most conditions including the flu, but if you’re using this for more than three days you need to stop and see a doctor. Using for more than three days can result in medication induced rebound congestion.
These come in pill form too. However, either the pill or spray decongestants can increase blood pressure and heart rate. Two common forms of the oral variety are pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine—both over-the-counter. If you are going to be working then your blood pressure and heart rate may fluctuate more from the daily stress. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about safety issues.

, There are several types of over-the-counter cough syrups that fight the cough by different means in the case of the flu. You’ll want to have one of these with you while at work if you have a coughing fit. You can try a suppressant or an expectorant (such as guaifenesin) to force up mucus.Cough drops and throat lozenges are a great way to treat a cough and/or sore throat at home and at work. Keep some sugar-free cough drops or throat lozenges on hand all day. Less practical for work and more for home treatment of coughs would be topical treatments like menthol rubs for your chest.

, Nasal strips can help to open your nasal passages and make breathing easier. One of these can fit on the lower third of your nose. A plastic strip under a bandage like strip springs out to gently pull open your nose and this eases your breathing. You can easily wear this at work all day., Colds and flus can be painful, so taking an over-the-counter pain reliever may help. Make sure that you follow the dosage instructions on the package. Ingest the pills with plenty of water. Place extra pills in a pill box or keep the bottle in a handy place such as a purse, bag, or desk drawer.Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or other analgesics like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve) are available over-the-counter for pain relief. These medicines also reduce fever.
Make sure that you check the ingredients on any cold or flu medicine you are taking. Many of these medicines already contain a pain reliever and it is important to avoid doubling up on these. This can cause severe problems, such as kidney damage.

, If your illness is viral, then taking an antiviral medication may help. Talk to your doctor about getting these medicines prescribed. Have the medicine administered within 48 hours of the onset of your illness.Usually these medicines such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), peramivir (Rapivab), or zanamivir (Relenza) are best if taken within 48 hours of onset of the flu, but can still work if taken later. However, these drugs can have more pronounced side effects. Consult with your doctor about these drugs or if you need medicine for another illness.

Often, executive positions are filled by boards or a group of people who want all the information in front of them.
Depending upon the size of the company, a professional resume may have to go through several levels before it makes it to the hiring group.;
,


It's not only important to communicate your abilities, but to show how those abilities fit the high-level position. If the position most likely will include travel to China and you speak fluent Chinese, this is an important attribute.

,


As the opening paragraph to an executive resume, this paragraph needs to pack a decisive punch so the reader has no doubt you're executive material.
What sets you apart from other people applying for this position?
Think of the first paragraph as advertising your abilities and a way to tell the reader that it's worth his or her time to continue reading.

, Although achievements most likely will include work experience, there may be other relevant achievements. Resume writing for achievements takes into account the position for which you're applying.


If you're applying for a Chief Financial Officer position, and you headed a volunteer group in which you increased revenues 200%, then this is an important achievement that needs to be highlighted, regardless of whether it's a paid or volunteer position.
The financial officer will focus on financial experience.
Other positions may be slanted to research or technical achievements.

,


Will the job titles or the company names be most impressive? Only you know the answer to that, but whichever is most important should be listed first.
Afterwards, emphasize the responsibilities and accomplishments of your positions.

, Where skills and experience are most important in some jobs, education tends to be quite important in the executive resume.


List the institution and degree earned.
Don't forget any honors or special achievements earned in college.

, Include offices that you've held and any specific outcomes.

, You don't want to make it difficult for a potential employer to contact you.

,


When writing resumes, it's not as important to use complete sentences as it is to be clear.
Action words make the reading more interesting and communicate your active, not passive, accomplishments.

, While the contents are important, so is the appearance.


Use quality paper with an easy-to-read font type and size.
In addition to using a spell checker, read through the resume for typos that the spell check function missed.

, Some people choose to begin their resumes with two to three sentences that sum up your education, skills and accomplishments.If you choose to include this summary, it should be placed directly beneath your contact information.

, If you are applying for an entry level position without much work experience, job recruiters will be most interested in reading about your education. Include information regarding:


The level of educational degree you have received.
Your majors and minors (if you attended college).
Relevant coursework that relates to the job you are applying for.

, The section following your education should be dedicated to honors you have obtained and achievements you have accomplished. You can also discuss certifications you have received.

Your GPA if it is above 3.5.
Honors such as Dean’s List or other honor roll positions you have held.
Achievements like serving as a student ambassador in a foreign country with an organization like People to People.
Certifications like being TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certified.

, Create a comprehensive list of the skills that you feel represent your abilities best. Take time to consider what sort of skills the company you are applying to is most likely looking for. Tailor your list to the position you are applying for.


For example, if you are applying to be a desk receptionist at a daycare, you may think about listing skills like: excellent organizer; knowledgeable about Google Docs, WordPress, and social media platforms; etc.

, This section should be devoted to discussing experience you have in an office or volunteer setting. Consider listing each experience out and then describing it briefly. Only include relevant internship and volunteer experience.


For example, if you are applying to be a facilitator at a daycare, you would include information about when you volunteered at a children’s camp in your local community. Describe the volunteer position and what tasks you had.

, This may be hard after a long night, but try to fit in as much sleep as you possibly can before work to give yourself the best shot at having a productive day.Set your alarm for the time you actually need to get up instead of setting it earlier and hitting snooze. Waking up and then going back to sleep for a few minutes disrupts your sleep cycle and will leave you feeling more tired.
If going in to work a little late is an option, you may want to consider getting some extra sleep so you will be more productive when you are there.
The quality of your sleep might not be great after a night of drinking, but don't take any sleeping aids unless you have a full night to devote to sleep.

Medicines that contain acetaminophen can be damaging to your liver when combined with alcohol, so choose another pain relieving agent, such as ibuprofen.If you decide to take medication for a stomach ache as well, carefully read the warning labels to make sure that the two medications will not interact. Some medications for nausea may also contain pain relieving ingredients, so you may not want to take additional pain relieving medications as well., Try to stick to your regular morning hygiene routine as much as possible.

Make sure to check yourself in the mirror before you leave to make sure that nothing is inside out, wrinkled, unbuttoned, or otherwise unprofessional looking.
Style your hair conservatively as well. Try a low bun or a french twist for long hair.

, You will draw less attention to yourself if you show up to work on time, so do your best to stay on schedule.


If you're going to be late, call or email your boss ahead of time.

, While you might be tempted to procrastinate, you will only get more tired and dreary as the day goes on, so take care of important tasks right away.If an important task can wait until the next day, you might want to put it off so you can take care of it when you are feeling more alert.

, As the day goes on and you get more and more tired, try to occupy yourself with tasks that don't require much skill or concentration.Take advantage of this opportunity to do things you have been putting off, like cleaning out your inbox or organizing your files.
You probably won't be able to stay focused on any one task for more than a few minutes at a time, so choose things that won't take long.

, Try to avoid contact with your boss and coworkers as much as you can without letting them know that something is going on.


If you do need to talk to your boss, keep your interactions brief.
If you can reschedule meetings, it may be best to do so. If rescheduling will cause suspicion, power through them, making sure that you take good notes and are extra personable.

, Try to avoid letting your boss or your coworkers see how tired you are.


Keeping yourself busy will make the day feel shorter, while watching the clock will make it feel longer, so do your best to actually focus on your work.
Even if you're not functioning well enough to do anything important, try to make yourself look busy.

Get up from your desk if you're feeling like you're about to fall asleep. Even a short walk to the bathroom or the water cooler can help wake you up.
Don't make any mention of your night out. If someone asks you why you look so terrible, say you have a migraine or a cold.

List minors or concentrations after your major.,
Include only industry-relevant degrees and certifications after your name.,
List only the institution that awarded you a degree.,
Include information about your incomplete degree.",How to Write Your Degree on a Resume2," You should include minors or concentrations if the information is relevant to your job application. If your minor doesn’t have anything to do with the job you’re applying for, you can skip it. If you choose to list a minor or concentration, you can include the information like this:Boston University College of Communication, Boston, MA
Bachelor of Science in Communication (concentration in Advertising)
Minor in Public Relations

, If you have a professional certification or credential, like RN or MBA, include it after your name. List details about where or how you acquired your certification in your education section.Don’t include undergraduate degree acronyms after your name. For example, never write, “Jane Smith, B.A.”

, If you studied at multiple institutions before earning your degree, you should only write the college or university that actually awarded you a degree. The important information is the degree itself, not a full account of all the schools you attended.Exceptions to this rule include study abroad programs or coursework at prestigious institutions. For example, you might include relevant information like this:University of Georgia, Athens, GA. Bachelor of Science in Biology (Marine Biology emphasis), 2016.University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand. Study abroad program with emphasis in ecological preservation.

, You should still list partial degrees if you’ve completed most of your coursework, but haven’t actually graduated. Concisely explain the circumstances and include an expected date of graduation.For example, you could describe an incomplete undergraduate degree like this:Yale University, New Haven, CT. Bachelor of Science, Biology (expected 2017)
You could describe a graduate degree like this:Yale University, New Haven, CT
Master of Business Administration degree candidateThesis under development; anticipated completion June 2018

List the most relevant degree for the job you’re applying to first.,
Include specific coursework if the information is relevant.,
Create separate sections for important skills and honors.",How to Write Your Degree on a Resume3," In general, you’d list your most recent degree first. However, make an exception to this rule if an older degree is more relevant or will make your application more competitive.For example, suppose you’re applying for an engineering job and earned an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering in 2009 and a master’s in graphic design in 2012. You should list your engineering degree first.
You might have also researched your prospective job and found that the department head who will read your resume graduated from your undergraduate university. You might then want to include your undergraduate degree first and place your education section at the top of your resume.

, You might want to include relevant coursework in some job applications. If you want to highlight particular course titles, you could add a subsection to your education listing.For example, you could structure your education section like this:B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, TX.Relevant courses: Thermodynamics, Properties of Engineering Materials, Solid Mechanics, Dynamics of Machines, Strength of Mechanical Components.

, If you include too many achievements and skills under your education heading, valuable information might get lost. Rather than include too much text under one heading, list skills and important achievements under their own headings.For example, instead of listing computer programs and other skills you learned at school in a block of text under your degree, put them in a separate section at the top of your resume. Be sure to include skills, programs, and other keywords from the job posting.

Go home when you are too sick.,
Take frequent breaks.,
Eat lighter but maintain your strength.,
Drink plenty of fluids.",How to Go to Work when You Have a Severe Flu or Other Illness2," You should go home if you are feeling nauseous or vomiting too frequently, coughing excessively, unable to fight off fatigue, or otherwise unable to maintain a reasonable level of concentration for more than a few minutes. Anything more extreme than these conditions may warrant emergency care altogether. You’re your boss you’re at your limit and you need to be excused.These conditions also greatly increase the risk of you contaminating someone else.

, The flu and other illnesses will likely leave you with less energy than you normally have during the day as your body fights the disease. So allow yourself more time to complete tasks.You should expect a lower level of productivity if you go to work while experiencing the flu or another illness.
Don’t push yourself to get as much work done as you would normally. Do what workload you can within your limits, then take a break. Take your medicine if necessary, perform one of the remedies, or just relax. You can resume working after you had a chance to recover some energy.
You might try working for one hour then take a 15 minute rest period. Repeat this throughout the day.
Make sure your boss is well informed of your condition so they can make arrangements for an area for you to rest if necessary. They will also know you are not just wasting time.

, Prepare foods to improve your immune system. Take a can of soup, vitamin c rich fruits (like oranges), and some proteins (lean meats, poultry, eggs) that you can stomach in meal containers with you to work.The flu or illness you have may upset your stomach and the medicine you take may aggravate this feeling further. However, you need to keep up your nutrients to help your recovery.
Soup is good for eating especially if it's hard to swallow without pain. Eat hot chicken soup. You can sprinkle in pepper, add garlic, add curry powder, or put in a dash of other pungent spices to thin out the mucus congesting you. The soup can also improve your white blood count in your immune system. Drink orange juice to build up your vitamin C and folic acid for your immune system. Dairy is okay unless it’s generating too much mucus or upsetting your stomach. Keep on eating good protein sources like lean meats, poultry, fish, legumes, dairy, eggs, nuts, and seeds. These have vitamins B6 and B12 which help your immune system. Selenium and zinc also help your immune system. These minerals are found in protein-rich foods too. Other immune system boosters include grapefruits, lemons, limes, watermelon, kale, collard greens, broccoli, and cabbage.

, Start slowly with 4 to 8 ounces at a time and use clear drinks at first if you’re suffering diarrhea or nausea. Especially when feeling nauseous or suffering diarrhea you can also try chipped ice, fruit juices, sports drinks, and ginger ale. Dehydration is a significant risk while suffering the flu or some other illnesses. So you want to make sure you are taking in plenty of water during the work day.If you go to work with the flu or similar illnesses then you should drink lots of liquids like water, clear soups, broth, or electrolyte replacement drinks until the fever resolves. Some other ways to get fluids in include gelatin and ice pops.

Let others know you are sick.,
Cover up your cough.,
Disinfect your hands.,
Use spray disinfectants.,
Quarantine workplace items.,
Take breaks at separate times.",How to Go to Work when You Have a Severe Flu or Other Illness3," Call ahead to your boss, supervisor, and/or coworker to let them know you are sick. Tell them what you are sick with, the flu or whatever other illness it may be. Also let them know you are intending to come to work, but will take precautions to limit spreading the disease.Letting your boss and coworkers know you are sick can also help them take measures to protect themselves.
This is also a good time to ask if you can take the day off. Try saying something like, “I don’t want to get my coworkers sick and I don’t think that I will be at my best today. Is it okay if I stay home to rest and recover from this illness?”

, If you must go to work, then it is important to cover your mouth when you cough. Turning away to avoid coughing on another worker or covering it up with your hands is a good idea. Have tissues nearby or on your person to cover up your cough. If you can get antibacterial tissues do so. Dispose of any used tissues immediately and take care they don’t come in contact with other surfaces.If you’re in close quarters try to aim your cough at empty space or a wall. The same goes for sneezing.

, Your hands are one of the easiest ways you can contaminate surfaces or other workers. You’ll need to wash your hands more frequently, and thoroughly while sick at work with the flu or similar illnesses. Go to your workplace’s bathroom or wash station and run your hands under warm water and soap for 20 seconds each time.If soap is not available then have soap-less (usually alcohol based) hand sanitizer with you at all times and use it often. Use it especially before and after making hand to hand contact with another person.

, Having a spray can of disinfectant can help protect coworkers from contamination via surfaces. Spray handles, desk areas, seats, and if safe to do so, electronic peripherals (like a keyboard or mouse) that you might share with other coworkers. Spray down restroom surfaces in the workplace you touch too.There are any number of disinfectant sprays you can get in a store. Have one at your work station, desk, and bathroom so you can spray any surfaces you touch.

, This includes tools, computers, and even food. In cases where you store food at work you might want to put a note that you are sick so others know not to make contact with your food containers or mix up items you need to help your recovery.If your boss is wary of you spraying electronics with disinfectant then you might ask if the ones you touch can be isolated. This way only you are touching potentially contaminated surfaces. This applies to any other tools you may use on the job. If you are coughing and sneezing then you might ask to be allowed to work in a separate area of the office or workplace so you aren’t in close proximity to other employees.

, Ask your boss if you can take breaks at different times or locations so you don’t expose coworkers to your germs. If you can limit the time your coworkers and you are in the same place while you are contagious then you will reduce their exposure to your illness.Avoiding contact with others is the best way to prevent your infecting them with the flu or other illness. If you must go to work then in addition to disinfecting items and quarantining them you can alter your schedule if workflow permits so your coworkers aren’t physically close to you while you are ill. This can also allow more time to disinfect break room surfaces by you or any cleaning staff. Take advantage of separate break times to recover more of the energy you might be losing due to the illness.

Think about the length of your resume.,
Keep formatting details in mind.,
Check to make sure your resume is consistent.,
Proofread your resume.",How to Write an Entry Level Resume2," Though there is no hard and fast rule about resume length, it is usually recommended to narrow it down to one page, or two pages at the most.


If your resume is longer than a page, consider cutting out information that is not relevant to the position you are applying for.

, The way that you format your resume will affect the image that your potential employer forms of you. If your resume is sloppy or unprofessional looking, the potential employer may develop a bad opinion of you. Consider things like:


Font: Use one font throughout your resume. Choose a font that is professional looking. Consider using Arial or Times New Roman.
Margins: Your margins should be 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) wide.
Font size: Try to stick to font sizes within the 10 to 12 range.
However, you could consider making each section heading of your resume bold, along with your name and contact information.

, Look at your resume. Does it look like one cohesive document? Are all of your section headings bold? Does each section include bullet points to clarify elements of the subject you are discussing?

, Your resume should be grammatically correct and punctuation error-free. Read through your resume to make sure that you don’t have any errors. Consider reading it out loud to make sure that it does not sound awkward in any sections.


Consider asking someone you trust to look over your resume.

Do not simply list your job experience.,
Avoid cliché openings.,
Try not to write too much or too little.,
Minimize the amount of personal pronouns on your resume.,
Try not to avoid including extraneous information.",How to Write an Entry Level Resume3," While listing out your job or volunteer experience, along with concrete facts about that experience like the dates you worked there, are important, you need to try to give examples of how you went the extra mile, or made yourself invaluable to the company. Some ideas include:


Discuss the challenges you faced and how you overcame them. Talk about the strategies you used to overcome the challenges.
Discuss how you benefited the company or organization.

, You want to stand out from the crowd; using a cliché opening will submerge you in it. Avoid opening lines that seem cliché, rehearsed, or common.


Consider discussing some unique skills you have or your area of specialization instead. Make sure whatever information you use relates to the job you are applying for.

, Do not try to cram a ton of information on your page, or try to fill a page with unnecessary details. Every time you add something to your resume, think about whether or not it pertains to the job you are applying for.

, Your resume is a professional document. As such, you should try to keep your use of personal pronouns to a minimum, even though the document is about yourself. Do not list each skill by saying something like “I am very organized”.


Instead, when listing your skills, keep them short and informative. List something like: 1. Exceptionally organized. 2. Competent in WordPress, Twitter, and Excel. etc.

, Your marital status, weight, or dog’s name have no place on your resume (unless, for the latter, you are applying for a position as a dog walker). Your potential employer wants to learn about your professional experience, not about your personal details.

Begin with your biographical information.,
Include your website and description if you want.,
Put your education next, especially if you're a writer.,
Add your experience next.,
Subdivide experience into types of credits.How you divide this category depends on the type of work your applying for.,
Create a skills section.,
Add awards.,
Make it relevant.,
Catch your employer's eye.,
Weed out the extra stuff.,
Don't lie.,
Avoid long or busy formatting.,
Don't send it without proofreading.",How to Write a Theater Resume," Center and bold your name at the top of the page. Below your name, add any relevant professional societies you are in; acronyms are fine.Underneath your name, add your address, phone number, and email, not bolded.Even in the theater world, it's best to use a professional email, such as your full name in email form.
Actors have two additional space limitations. It's common practice to staple the resume to the back of an 8x10 headshot. If you have an agent, you'll also need to leave room at the top for the agent's letterhead.;
, You can also include a website if you have a professional one. In addition, it used to be standard to include your eye color and hair color for acting jobs because most photos were black and white. However, these descriptions are not strictly necessary today., If you're an actor, you may want to put your experience next instead. For education, you need to include the school name, the dates you attended, the degree you were awarded, and the city and state of the school you attended.This section is especially important if you don't have much experience in the field.Don't forget to include workshops and any other formal training you've had in this area, especially if the person you studied under is well-known., As stated, you may want to put this section above education if you're an actor.That's also true for directors and stage technicians. Highlight what you've done.You don't need to include every job or role, just the ones that are most recent or that were particularly notable. When you're first starting out, you'll have some obscure roles, work in some obscure theaters, or direct some obscure plays, and that's fine. You won't be expected to have all the experience you need right away., If you're an actor, you'll divide by types of roles. If you're a technician, you'll divide by the type of work you're doing.For instance, if you're an actor, begin with your theater credits, then go to your movie credits. Television should be last. You can also include web series, voice overs, commercials, and theme park or cruise ship work. Otherwise, go in chronological order.If you're a technician, you'll divide it into categories such as ""design work"" and ""production experience."" As a stage manager, you certainly want to include your stage managing experience, but you might also want to include when you worked as a stage hand, as well as any acting jobs you had. Similarly, as a director, you need to include your directing experience, but stage management and acting roles are also relevant. As a writer, you want to include the plays produced that you wrote, but stages readings are also relevant.Make three columns in this section. Include the name of the theater, movie, or show in the first column. Next to that, you need the role you played or the job you worked. Finally, you need the name of the director, if it wasn't you. You can also include big name stars here., In this section, you list any skills you have competency at. What you list may change depending on the job.Generally, as an actor, you can include skills such as accents you know, languages you can speak, sports you can play, and musical instruments you can play.You may also want to list other special talents, such as stage combat. Also, this section is a good place to list your vocal and dancing abilities.A short bullet-point list is fine for this section.
You may not need this section for every type of resume. For instance, it makes sense to include in a resume for stage management, since you can list skills such as ""able to work with power tools."" However, it may not make as much sense to list it in a writer's resume., If you have any special awards, you can include them in a short section at the bottom. However, you can also place it under the skills section, or add it in the appropriate area with your experience. If you put it in your experience, use an asterisk to reference it, and put it at the bottom of the appropriate section., You should always tailor your resume for the job you're applying for. For instance, if the job is an action film, the casting director will likely be more interested in your film credits than your stage productions. You can still include a few stage credits, but you want to focus your resume on your film credits. If you're applying for a stage management position, you need to highlight what you've done as a stage manager and play down your acting roles., Generally, you have, at most, 20 seconds to catch anyone's eye who's reading your resume. Most of the time, your resume is skimmed to see if you seem like a good fit. Make sure the design is clean, and you use the design to highlight what's most important.For instance, if your experience is more relevant than your education, you should include that first.

, That is, your resume doesn't need to include every job you held in high school. It also doesn't need to include every high school play you had a role in. Stick to the most current roles you've played, the jobs you've had on the stage, or plays you've written; you don't want to overwhelm them with information., While it's sometimes acceptable to stretch the truth a bit, you should never out and out lie on your resume. In a digital world, you can be easily found out, and you may even be caught out in an interview when the interviewer asks you a question. Stick to the roles you've actually played, the jobs you've actually had, or the plays you've written that have been produced., It's almost always best to keep your resume to one page. In fact, it is often standard practice to staple your resume to the back of an 8-by-10-inch head shot for acting gigs, giving you even less space.Avoid patterned paper or designs that make your resume look busy or difficult to read.


You may use paper with texture., Fair or not, you will be judged on your grammar. If your resume is riddled with typos, it is likely to get tossed out. Read it over yourself before sending it, but also have someone else look at, as he or she may catch typos that you don't.Try reading it aloud. Because reading it aloud takes more time, it will help you catch any typos and grammar mistakes."

Focus only on the ones you know how to use with at least some confidence.

Write down which operating systems you know how to use comfortably.
Write down which suite(s) of office tools you use.
Review the list of programs on your computer. Write down the ones you know.
Write down any specialized software you use on the job, such as accounting, analysis, and enterprise database software.;
, That is, if you have written ""Excel"", you might fill in Microsoft Excel 2007. Include multiple versions if you have used them.

, If your advanced spreadsheet skills are important to your job, try listing the skills as well as the software.

, Remember that they can go elsewhere in the document, too. If your computer skills saved time, money, or the day, try writing a sentence about it. Also try this approach to avoid a ""laundry list"" effect if you want paragraphs rather than bullet points. Compare:

, Which one(s) are you comfortable using professionally?

, Who is reading this summary? Are they looking for an expert or someone with a working knowledge of the basics? Sometimes you may wish to say how well you know a particular program. Other times, a simple list is enough.

, As with other job and application materials, imagine that your reader is very busy and may only glance at that section for a moment. List your skills in order of importance.

, In a cover letter, you may have a choice between paragraphs and a list with bullets, but remember that your cover letter focuses on the future: what you can do for the new company rather than what you have done for the old one.

Proofread.",How to Write a Resume when You Have No Work Experience," The job posting should give a list of traits and skills that the employer is seeking. Think long and hard about what they mean and how you fulfill them. Also consider what unlisted qualifications might be useful for the job. Often postings don’t include a full or entirely accurate accounting of what skills a good employee would need.Consider searching postings for similar jobs. These might have alternative qualifications and skills that would be useful and could be highlighted in your resume.
Research the history and activities of the company to discern what unlisted skill sets might be important.
Usually the job posting will include buzz words that can be hard to decipher. Think long and hard about what they mean and frame your resume to highlight these skills. If, for example, the ad asks for good communication skills, list experience writing, speaking, and coordinating activities with coworkers. If it calls for you to be ""results oriented,"" focus on accomplishments and specific projects that you have completed.;
, In the cover letter you will want to make a sustained case for why you can perform the job better than other applicants. Your resume, on the other hand, is a relatively short, somewhat disconnected account of your qualifications. Your resume should be built to reinforce the argument of your cover letter, not the other way around.In your cover letter you should try to show why not having work experience is an asset, not a liability. Maybe you are young and ambitious. Perhaps you are coming from a different perspective that would help you approach the subject in a creative way.

, The internet is replete with sample resumes. Review the formatting and make sure that you follow the guidelines. However, as a new entry into the workforce, you will want to make some slight modifications.


Make sure that everything is in the same font, that you include clear headings and that items like dates are consistently located in the same place on the page. Employers spend thirty seconds on average reviewing each resume. You should clearly highlight relevant information so that it will be obvious even to someone making a quick survey.You will also want to organize some parts of your resume differently than someone with experience would. The most important selling points should come at the beginning of your resume where they will be most noticeable. Normally, you would highlight your job experience. In your case, however, you will want to focus on skills or objectives, placing these ahead of experience.

Monster.com posts sample resumes by field, so that you can see how people in similar fields have crafted their resumes. On the other hand, Business Insider has a superb example of what a resume for a new entry into the workforce should look like.

, The first line of the resume, after a heading that lists the job position, should be an objective statement. The objective statement tells your employer about your long-term career goals. Properly done, it will also advertise your skills. Keep the statement to two sentences.Tailor your objective statement to the job you are applying for and use it to convey your qualifications even as you write about your goals: ""Motivated and empathetic student of childhood development eager to enter the field of early childhood education. Interested in using communication skills and understanding of psychology to provide children with a firm foundation for their intellectual and emotional development in a fashion consistent with the reputation of a distinguished institution of learning."", You should always follow your objective statement with an “Education” section that lists your degrees and GPA. Consider additional sections if they are relevant. If you are applying directly out of college, feel free to cite your history all the way back to high school.Consider including sections like “Relevant College Coursework” and “Achievements and Awards.” In relevant college coursework, list only classes you took that have direct bearing on the job. You do not need to list individual grades for courses.

, You should include a section devoted to discussing skills relevant to the position. Label the section skills and place it before work experience. If possible, provide a more detailed description with each skill.In describing your skill you can discuss experience, including how you have exercised that skill in school, clubs, or your personal life. Or, if for example you are computer savvy and have experience with social media, discuss the media platforms you are familiar with or the computer programs you can use.
The skills section allows you to discuss experience you’ve had that would look flimsy in a section like “Work Experience.” You can say that you know about databases because you used them for a particularly large school project or that you have experience advertising via social media from running your own blog.
List languages that you are fluent in.

, With a heading like “Leadership Experience” mention any leadership roles you have had. This could be the vice presidency of a major school club. However, it could also be work you did as a camp counselor or as team leader in sports.

, Under work experience feel free to list any unpaid internship or volunteer experience that lasted at least three months. If you do not have any such experience, exclude the section altogether., You want your resume to look nice. It might be tempting to get artistic and try some creative fonts. However, adhering to traditional practices will make your resume look more professional.


Standard page margins of approximately one inch are typically best. If you do want to stand out and are struggling to fit all of your experience onto one page, you can consider 0.63 inch margins.
Times New Roman, 11 point font, is a good standard.
Use good, thick, white paper, 20-25 bond.
The only acceptable symbols to put on a resume are line breaks and bullet points. Avoid emoticons, emoji, and other unprofessional symbols., If you want your prospective employer to take you seriously, you should make sure that there are no typos in the resume. Verify that you aren’t changing your verb tense throughout. Your style should also be consistent and clear.

List relevant memberships in professional associations.",How to Write a Targeted Resume," A job ad should provide valuable information about the company, the job, and the qualifications that the ideal candidate possesses. You can use this information to create an effective targeted resume, so pay attention – read the entire posting carefully, and note where your skills and experience match the ad.


For example, a job posting for a marketing manager may state that the successful candidate must be able to create a marketing strategy for a new hotel. If you have experience developing and implementing new marketing strategies in the hospitality industry – and especially if you have this experience in relation to hotels – you should take note of that and plan to highlight that specific part of your background.;
, As you read a job posting, take the time to highlight important duties associated with the job. When you begin to construct your targeted resume, you will be able to go back to the ad and quickly scan for this key information.

, In addition to noting key job duties, you should also highlight or underline all required and desired qualifications, including education, skills, and experience. Successful candidates will probably meet most or all of the “desired” qualifications, so these are nearly as important as “required” qualifications for creating a strategically tailored resume.


Note that although many job ads will list required and desired qualifications in formal sections, many will scatter them throughout the posting. Be sure to read the entire ad.

, In addition to the qualifications listed specifically in the advertisement, a job may also carry implied qualifications – those that you can glean from reading other parts of the ad and thinking about the position as a whole. You should plan to include implied qualifications on your targeted resume as well.


For example, a particular job posting for a marketing manager may state that a job duty is “conducting email marketing” but include nothing related to email marketing in its required or desired qualifications. You can still conclude that skills and experience in this area are desirable; these are implied qualifications that should appear on your targeted resume.

, The first and most obvious place to tailor your resume is right at the top, with your heading and summary statement. Start by including the name of the potential job in a heading immediately underneath your contact information. Enlarge the font slightly, and put the heading in bold to separate it from the rest of the information.


If you have never held a position exactly like this one, place the words “Qualifications for” just above the heading. This explains to recruiters that although you do not hold an identical job and haven’t in the past, you intend to show that you are qualified.

, Under your new heading, list a few of your most significant skills. These should be tailored to the particular job, so think carefully about the advertisement, and decide which of your qualifications seem most crucial. Separate these skills with a slash.


For example, if you are applying for a marketing manager position, you might write: “Marketing Strategy / Customer Behavior / Search Engine Optimization”

, The next part of your resume should be a summary statement: a short paragraph that highlights your relevant skills, experience, and accomplishments. The purpose of this statement is to show the recruiter that you are an ideal candidate and persuade that person to continue reading. Keep the summary statement short; if you go much longer than five sentences, recruiters may not read it. At the same time, try to include:


relevant “soft skills” like analytical thinking or interpersonal communication
a basic outline of your relevant years of experience, job titles, and industries (such as “Ten years of experience as a marketing manager for the hospitality industry”)
notable awards and recognition (such as “Leadership of Excellence award winner”)
education and certifications
key accomplishments (such as “Developed global marketing strategy that increased sales by 50%)

, Hard skills are teachable skills required to do a job successfully. These include “email marketing,” “search engine optimization,” and “software sales,” for example.

, Soft skills are personal attributes that define how you accomplish certain tasks or hard skills. They are more difficult to teach and tend to be related to individual personalities. Examples include “great communication skills,” “analytical thinking,” and “team player.”

, Your skills section should appear after your summary statement, allowing recruiters to see quickly that you are someone worth interviewing.

, List relevant hard and soft skills on a bulleted list. Keep in professional looking: use simple bullet points, dots, or dashes.


Consider using two or three columns for your skills section. Doing so keeps the section from appearing unnecessarily lengthy.

, Whenever possible, keep your description of each skill limited to one to three words: “marketing strategy,” “communication skills,” and the like.

, You need at list five to ten skills, but try not to exceed fifteen; you’ll only overload recruiters and diminish the impact of your skills section. This section will vary from job to job (and depending on your individual background), but in general, ten carefully chosen, highly important skills are ideal.

, Beginning with your most recent position, list each company, job title, and dates of employment. You do not have to include jobs that are not relevant; marketing management recruiters are unlikely to care, for example, that you delivered pizzas part time for six months, and including this kind of work will only clutter your experience section with irrelevant information.

, The short paragraph that accompanies each job listing should also be tailored: for each past position, construct two to five sentences that explain your experience and connect it to this potential job.


For example, you might write, “Manages a global team of software sales representatives. Provides quality leads to increase sales and meet team goals.”

, Consider your most outstanding accomplishments or duties that are relevant to the potential job, and list these in bullet points to make them easily readable. This is a good place to include quantifiable results as well.


For example, you might write: “Increased sales by 30% in six months through a new customer relations strategy.”

, List your formal education – a bachelor’s degree, for example – but don’t forget to consider on-the-job training or certification as well. If any training you have completed is relevant to the potential job, include it!


For example, you may have completed a leadership training program while employed at a different company. If you are applying for a supervisory position, this training is relevant.

, Even if you have no further formal education, including your high school education is unnecessary.

, No matter what job you are applying for, a bachelor’s degree is relevant. It demonstrates a certain level of education, even if the field is far removed from the potential job. If you have a B.A., include it on every resume.

, Master’s and doctoral degrees should be included only when relevant. If you are applying for a position as a marketing director and have a doctorate in marketing, include it; if you are applying for a position as a marketing director and have a doctorate in biology, consider leaving it off.

, Awards and recognition are always relevant; they demonstrate that you are able to excel and stand out among other employees. If you have awards like “Employee of the Month” or “Leadership Excellence Award,” include them, even if they do not seem directly related to the potential job.

, If you are a member of any association that is relevant to the potential job, include that on your resume. This shows that you are already committed to the field.

Start strong and end strong.",How to Write a Resume Summary Statement," A summary statement is a brief overview that highlights the experiences you've had that are applicable to the position you're applying for. It is placed in the beginning of a resume and gives the reader an idea of who you are and why you are a strong candidate without wading through extra information.


A summary statement is the perfect opportunity to highlight relevant skills, strengths, experiences and accomplishments. It may be the difference between your resume being tossed aside and it given a second glance.;
, A good summary statement effectively uses action words to highlight the qualities you have that the hiring team is looking for. It must also describe the results of your previous work -- being fantastic isn't enough, you've got to have proof!. Writing effective sentences will do just this, giving the reader (your potential boss) a good overview and entice them to read more.


An example of an effective sentence for a summary statement is, “Developed and led operating procedures in the US and Latin America to increase efficiency by 15%."" You want concrete facts and numbers if at all possible to paint the most vivid picture possible. This is something you did (the action) followed by the result (the number). Quite the winning, incontestable combination!

, Writing “objective” at the beginning of your resume is seen as old-fashioned and does not provide much value to a recruiter or hiring manager. The phrase “to obtain a challenging position where I can....” does not say why you should be hired over others. Everyone seems to have the same objective and chances are your objective will be passed over.


This summary is not what you want to do -- it's what you've already done. Save what you want to do and what you see yourself doing for the interview process. Right now, stick to the things you've done that you're most proud of.

, The length of a good summary statement varies. It depends on your relevant experience and the job you are seeking. The summary statement, on average, should be anywhere from 3 to 5 sentences. Anything longer creates too much verbiage and takes away from the idea of a brief overview.


Keeping it relevant and simple is key. The hiring committee has piles of resumes to go through -- if you're too wordy, you could be tossed aside in a moment of human frustration. Keep it brief to keep the reader's attention.

, This is easily done by expressing your best personal qualities or “soft skills” that are relevant and essential to the job’s success. Look at the job description -- what qualities are they looking for that you can prove you have?


Don't shy away from describing yourself as a “self-motivated entrepreneur” or a “well-organized and dedicated administrator."" Even if you don't feel like the cream of the crop, go for it. Think of any buzz-word adjectives that anyone has ever used to describe you. What qualities do you seem to bring to every team?

, This should be included if significant and relevant. If you only have months of experience under your belt and not a lot of titles, don't worry about this part. They'll gather the information from the body of your resume.


“Business Development Manager with over 10 years of experience in B2B software sales for the construction industry” is a perfect example of hitting time, title, industry, and sector all in one go. Such a complete role sounds impressive!

, This is not the place to list every award; you should limit it to one or two. It's a summary, after all. Not a contest or a novel!


“Awarded Top Performer of Southeast Region two consecutive years” would be a recognition you want at the top of this paper. Choose whichever ones stand out the most to you and the ones you consider most impressive.

, It's best to emphasize key accomplishments that are most relevant. That way they know off the bat that you're more than just a suitable candidate for the job.


“MBA and Six Sigma Black Belt” would be a great combination. And for certain jobs, providing something a little outside the box wouldn't hurt either -- so long as it's equally as impressive as the rest of your accomplishments!

, As mentioned previously, it is important to write your summary statement and show your value through the use of effective sentences. Think of this in a three-part magical formula:


Place an action word at the beginning of each sentence -- “led,"" “developed,"" “coordinated,” etc.)
Then explain what you did -- “company-wide restructure,"" “implementation of new procedures,"" “communication between subcontractors” etc.
Finally, provide the result -- “to realize a cost savings of 10%,"" “increase overall efficiency,” “reduce errors by 5%” etc.

Put these three together to ensure effective sentences that are to the point, impressive, and, almost above all else, intriguing.



, This means avoiding the words “I,"" “my,"" “me,"" “we,"" “he,"" “she,"" “his,"" “her,"" “us” or your name. Get straight to the point -- start with verbs and skip out all the words that aren't necessary.


If your sentence seems bulky, it probably is. All you need are verbs, nouns, adjectives, and the occasional preposition. Try cutting it down until it's as small as possible.

, For example, “trustworthy"" and ""loyal” are two qualities that, while you may have them, don't get the job done. What's more, whose opinion are you going off of? Stick to qualities you can prove with your work history and accomplishments.


Unfortunately, this is actually overused; everyone wants to appear trustworthy and loyal, or simply appear as if they value these qualities.

, The first thing an applicant should do is read over in detail the job posting/job description. Familiarizing yourself with the job and who the employer is looking for will help form an effective summary statement. It sounds like a lot of work if you're applying for dozens of jobs, but if you don't do it, you'll be applying for dozens and dozens more.


For example, if a company is looking for someone with 5-10 years of experience in project management, and you have 10 years of experience as a project manager, it is best to write that in your summary statement. Some things seem so simple it's hard to believe they could be overlooked!

, In short, recruiters and hiring managers look at tons of resumes per day for each job posted. They look over each resume very briefly, leaving the candidate with only one quick chance to impress. It is no longer enough to say you want the job; you must explain why they should invite you for an interview by effectively stating your value. You must start out strong to grab their attention and end strong to get them thinking, ""We should call this person.""


Summary statements that can frame an individual into the ideal candidate will get the recruiter or hiring manager to read further and possibly invite you for an interview. Starting out strong is necessary, but you've got to leave them thinking you're still a good candidate by the end. Refine your whole summary to prove you're the full package.

There are over 250 different templates available.



If you have Word 2007 or later, start a new document and select ""Resumes and CVs"" from the list of document styles. You'll be able to browse between various options and download the template of your choice.

If you have an earlier version of Word, search the templates online and select the template of your choice. You can choose between templates for particular goals or careers, or a variety of basic templates.;
, There are many pages of templates, so take your time and find the right one. You can also look for specific resume types in the search field at the top of the page. You'll have the choice between the following template styles:



Basic resume templates feature simple design and basic categories of information applicable to many different career fields, and are the most useful for entry-level employees. Select the""Entry-Level Resume"" if you're just getting started or are a recent graduate, which will highlight other experience, skills, and education over previous employment.

Job-specific templates are organized to focus on specific career-centered information and experiences that wouldn't be included on other types of resumes. An academics resume, for instance, would likely have a section for teaching experience and publications, while a driver's would likely have a section for particular vehicle class certifications.

Situation-specific templates refer to different organizations of information, which may be appropriate for highlighting experience and or complicated work histories. A chronologically-organized resume, for example, would organize your recent job history in order, rather than into different categories. This is a good choice if you're switching careers.

, Once you've selected a template you like, click on the thumbnail of the template. You will see a page with a larger version of your chosen resume template. Click the green Download button on the right to Download the template to your computer and open it in Microsoft Word to edit.


Try to find the simplest, most professional-looking template that's appropriate for your job. Fonts like Times New Roman are appropriate, while fonts like Comic Sans are not if you're looking for a job. Once you find one that looks good to you, stop looking, download it, and get to work.
All of the options can be a bit overwhelming, but the look of the resume is the least important part. In general, you shouldn't have to spend more than 5 or 10 minutes at the most searching for a template that looks right. You're not going to get the job because your template was fancier than other applicants.

, Open the downloaded template file, and locate all the gray text boxes in which you can click to fill in your information.


At a quick glance, the template will appear to be already filled out. The text boxes exist to tell you what information to put where. In the top corner of most templates, for instance, will be a text box with the words ""Name"" and ""Address,"" formatted correctly for the information being asked for.

, Select the various headings you want to include on your resume, and make sure they're either already there before starting into the document and filling in your information. It's hard to make changes after you start editing the document.


On some templates, you can fill in the types of headings you want, the headings are pre-set. Common headings include, but are not limited to: work experience, school experience, special skills and other training, awards, and contacts.

, All resumes, at the top of the document, need your basic contact information: name, address, email address, and telephone number. These will be filled in with filler information, which you can highlight, and change to your own.

, Go through the document slowly, filling out all the necessary information. Take the time to double-check phone-numbers for your contacts, addresses for previous employers, and the dates of your employment. Be as specific as possible, especially when describing your duties and responsibilities as an employee.


It would look pretty foolish to turn in a resume with the default answers still filled out in one of the latter sections. Even if you think you've filled out everything, check again.

, If you've chosen a template with a specific category or blank for information that doesn't apply to the job you're applying for, you should neither try to make something up to put in it, nor should you leave it blank. Highlight the box and remove it from the document if it's not appropriate for the job.


A good example of this is something like, ""Rewards"" or ""Achievements"" on some academic resumes. It doesn't look good to have the category but leave it blank. Just delete it.

, Losing your progress can be frustrating, and it's also likely that you'll want to go back over the resume and make changes later, so be sure to save the document, even if you're planning on printing it to make copies. Make sure you have a digital copy of your resume.


When you're finished, consider saving a copy of your resume as a .pdf file under the ""Format"" list after you select ""Save As."" When you're finished, you'll be able to open the file on any computer without having to worry about formatting issues. If you're sending an electronic copy of your resume, though, make sure the company accepts .pdfs first.
Don't lose your resume! Save it somewhere you'll be able to remember, like Dropbox, or a thumb drive, and keep it on you so you won't have to go through this process again. You'll always need a resume on hand, and it's hard to tell when you'll need it again. You won't have to start form scratch next time if you save it now, and it'll be much easier to update.

, If you're starting on a large-scale job search, it would be best to make one basic resume and send that resume everywhere right? Wrong. Different places of employment will likely be looking for different things, so unless you're looking at identical positions at identical places of employment, you're probably better off doing a little bit of research first and making the best possible resume for each place, by making little changes.


Spend some time researching each prospective employer's website or hiring statement, taking time to note any special language they use in the ad. If an employer is looking for ""Someone who can follow directions explicitly"" and your resume highlights your ""Strong-minded leadership qualities,"" you might be out of line with the job.
There's a lot you can do to change the little things in the job descriptions to match the advertisement language. The more the employer thinks you've done your homework, the more you'll stand out in the crowd.

, It can get confusing quickly if you choose a template with a bunch of individual cells you'll have to figure out, and possibly reformat. Because the formatting of the templates often doesn't account for the amount of information you'll be typing into the individual boxes, the formatting can get messed up and it can be difficult to reformat the document correctly.


While tables, even invisible tables, can help to structure text, it can make customizing the document very difficult. If you're not experienced with formatting tables in word, don't get into it now.

, Highlight parts of the section titles that you don't like and rename them. If ""Work Experience"" would be more suitably-titled ""Construction Experience"" or ""Travel Experience,"" or whatever topic you'd like to highlight, highlight the offending term, change it by typing in the new heading, content, or title, and check to make sure you haven't messed up the formatting.


If changing something messes up the sizing, or the font, and you can't figure out how to change it back, you've got a couple options. It's likely the text has changed back to the Word default settings. You can either use the Style setting to make the document uniform (discussed in the following step) or go in manually.
To find what you want it to be, start by clicking elsewhere in the document, on text with the correct-looking style, and examine the toolbar at the top of the Word window to see how it's changed. Go back and highlight the text you want to change, and change it to the correct format in the toolbar, now that you know what it is.

, If making changes has messed up the formatting, sizing, or the fonts, click on the area of text that you want your messed-up text to look like. Select the entire paragraph, or group of text, right-click, select Styles, then Update style name to Match Selection. Now, highlight your messed-up text, and select ""Match Selection,"" and the text should reformat like you want it to., If you're applying for a job as a mason's apprentice, you need to highlight experience working with your hands outside, and your ability to follow instructions, not your experience as the leader of a punk band that went on tour last summer. Customize each resume to the job you're applying for, and eliminate any extra information that won't be helpful.

, It's a sad truth that the average employer looks at a resume for no more than a few seconds. Make sure that all the important information is easy to find, at right up front to give yourself the best shot at getting an interview. The best resumes are the briefest, highlighting all the necessary information in about the front side of one piece of paper, and no more than two pages.


It's a common misconception that longer resumes look better to employers. This is not the case at all. If you're worried about a lack of experience, it's better to let your resume be brief and efficient, than to pad it with desperate-looking descriptions of your leadership at a yard sale, or the obstacles you overcame as the captain of the soccer team.
Always defer to the job description. If an employer is looking specifically for something with charisma and a sense of humor, like at a web start-up or a magazine, it might be appropriate to include a witty description of your yard sale leadership, if it's appropriate. Use your best judgment.
Your resume doesn't need to ""sound smarter"" than you are. Don't waste a bunch of time looking up 20-dollar words to describe something simple. Nothing will get you the job faster than relevant experience and seriousness.

, One of the most common ways to make your resume pop is to use vibrant descriptions of your previous employment responsibilities. Your descriptions of your duties and responsibilities at your previous employers should be short and sweet. To do this, there's a particular technique of standing a sentence with an action word to give your short bullet points or descriptions the most punch. Buzz words that are always good to use include:


innovated
motivated
facilitated
organized
simplified
managed
examined

, If your template is organized into bullet points and sub-points for your description of each job, you don't need to use complete sentences for the bullets, but it does make it important to be consistent in the style. They should all have the same sentence structure, even if they're not complete sentences.


If one bullet starts with ""facilitated"" the next can't start with ""I worked to."" Instead, it should read ""worked to,"" so they'll be parallel.

, Your job descriptions are the best way to give yourself credit for things you deserve credit for, but that might not necessarily show up on a cold description of your job written by somebody else. Make yourself look good. It's not lying.


If you were the only person at your previous job to ever clean up the mess at the end of the day, you might say that you ""facilitated teamwork by organizing the work site more efficiently.""
If you organized a carpool, you might say that you ""streamlined the office commute by incorporating co-operative ride sharing.""

, Most resumes will ask for personal or employment contacts. It's a good idea to think about these seriously beforehand and talk to your contacts, coaching them slightly on the nature of the job and what it is you're applying for. It doesn't look good if an employer cold-calls your contact and they're not expecting it, not available, or unwilling to give you a glowing recommendation.


Only pick contacts who will say good things about you. If you were fired from your last job, provide personal contacts with a relevant knowledge of your work history who can vouch for your reliability and your seriousness as a candidate, and older employers. Call and ask politely if you can use them as a reference.

Determine whether you have the skills to do the job. Although you should not be afraid of reaching high in your job search, if you have never held an assistant role, you may not be qualified for an executive assistant to a high-level executive yet. Your time may be better spent looking for a job that is better suited to your experience.;
, The first essential element of any assistant resume is to include all forms of contact, including name, email address, home phone number, cell phone number and address. If you have a website that is applicable, you should include that in the header or footer of your resume as well.


For example, if you are looking to be an administrative assistant for a wedding planner, your own blog about wedding fashion may prove useful. Avoid including your website or social media links if they do not have relevance to the job at hand.

, The 2 main types of resume formats are chronological and functional. The type you choose will depend upon your past experience.


If you have been steadily moving into jobs with higher pay, more responsibility and with more prestigious companies, you should choose a chronological resume. If you do not have any gaps in your employment and you can show under each job title how you were promoted, then this will give you an advantage over less qualified candidates.
If you have just completed school, you are trying a new field or you have gaps in your employment history, choose a functional resume. Instead of listing your employment by the date and title, you will list the necessary qualifications, as written in the job description, and detail your experience under each heading.

, Under your contact information and before employment information, you should have approximately 2 to 5 sentences in prose that clarify who you are and what you want in specific terms. Many people return to the objective after having finished their educational and employment sections so that they can make a hint at topics that will be discussed in their resume.


For example, an example of a specific objective summary or statement would be, ""Executive Assistant with 7 years of experience in managing professional schedules for operations departments. Seeking a position with XYZ company that utilizes data management, customer relations and advanced problem-solving skills. Proven background of improving time and cost efficiency of office environments.""
Many job candidates make the mistake of only writing what they are looking for, instead of who they are. For example, they may write ""Looking for a position with XYZ company that involves data management, problem solving and scheduling.""

, Many people use bullet points beginning with action verbs to address the qualifications needed in the job description. If the description asks for someone who types at least 60 words per minute (WPM), include the fact that you type 90 WPM.

, Under each qualification or job heading, you must list all of your promotions, honors, pay raises and increased value for the company. If possible, quantify your accomplishments in percentages, years and added value in time or money.

, If the job says you must ""facilitate business appointments,"" add that you ""facilitate 10 to 20 business appointments per day in your current job."" Include words that show you have a working knowledge of the industry.

, Each bullet point should start with an evocative and meaningful action verb that suggests the value you create in a company. The following are action verbs to consider for administrative jobs:


Organize, arranged, composed, corresponded, developed, elicited, edited, adapted, performed, solved, planned, corrected, budgeted, researched, contributed, collaborated, guided, resolved, supported, generated, increased, strengthened, collected, reviewed, monitored, verified, standardized, filed, distributed, summarized, executed and tested.

, This short section should list any degrees you hold and the universities where you achieved them. You should also add any additional training courses, certifications or professional memberships.

, The resume should entice people to invite you to an interview, so focus on being succinct and clear. If your formatting does not fill the width of the page very well, experiment with reformatting with more information on 1 line.


Margins should be at least 1 inch (2.5cm) on all sides. You should use a popular font, such as Times New Roman, in no less than 11 point.
Research examples of other professional resumes on the Internet, if you do not like how your resume appears. You can look through templates of administrative assistant resumes that are formatted cleanly and communicate the data in a more pleasing way than a regular word processing document.

, Failing to find copy edit errors and other mistakes is likely to cost you a job opportunity. Most secretaries will be asked to create and proof documents, so yours should be as near to perfect as possible.

, Don't get up and start walking around moving tables, just pretend you are organizing your workstation.

, Start stretching, but not too long as people might get suspicious.

, If your boss does check your work, stall them and start typing to make you look busy - type something like "" The following topic of which I am about to discuss via work and documentation is..."" as it babbles on.

, Go to Google and type in ""things that make you look busy"" and you find this site, read it, put your own stuff on it.

Practicing gratitude about your job can make it easier to cope with it if you hate it, and remind you of all its excellent qualities when you are more positive towards it.


Keep a gratitude journal that is only for your job. Every day come up with at least 3 things that you are grateful for about your job. This could be something like ""sun was coming through my work window"" or ""the cute delivery girl smiled at me"" or ""I got a raise today."" Even if you aren't feeling particularly grateful for your job that day, try to find just 3 things that you can focus on.
try to come up with ways that this job is good for you. It could be that it brings you enough money to buy that new book series you wanted, or is close to your house so you don't have to commute far.;
, Even if it's an especially difficult job to like, having at least one bright spot to look forward to during your work day can make all the difference. Even if this bright spot happens to be your lunch hour.This step goes beyond simply finding things to be grateful for. If you dread going to work in the morning, focus on that bright spot so that you convince yourself into being more excited for work.
For example: before you get up in the morning (especially if it's early and your alarm has just gone off), lie there for a moment and call up that bright spot (getting to see and flirt with your cute coworker). During the day, when that bright spot happens, stop and think ""I am grateful.""

, Perhaps now you have experience dealing with a difficult boss, or you are more effective at time management because the job has forced you to be creative. There's an opportunity to gain insight in every position you have, whether that position is high or low, even if the only insight you gain is that you don't like the job.


Some people focus on the skills they develop during a job because they are beneficial in helping them climb up the career ladder. If you're stuck at a lower-level advertising job where you do all the work and get none of the credit, for example, you can take solace in the idea that the skills you're gaining now will eventually help you get a better position.
Others focus on knowledge they gain while at the job. Let's face it, a lot of jobs aren't the greatest. The pay is low, the hours are bad, and the stress is high. If the only knowledge you take away from the job is that it's not a job you want to be doing the rest of your life, that's important. Use that knowledge as motivation in finding a new job — something that you actually like doing.

, Figure out why the work you do is important and what your presence means to your place of employment. There is always something that you bring to the table, even if it's only your strong work ethic and quick sandwich making skills.


Remember, each person who is part of a workplace brings something important to their job. Focusing on what you do that is important will help you better value your job and your place in it.
Remind yourself of the importance of the job itself. Every job is important if you look at it from the right angle. If you work in a coffee shop, for example, tell yourself how the people who come in are getting a needed pick-me-up and they wouldn't get that without you and the work you do.

, You're not going to love, or even enjoy, every single second of your workday or every single task that you're asked to do. If you're pushing yourself to ""love"" your work regardless of the more difficult aspect, you'll be more likely to find yourself dwelling on the difficult aspects, instead.


Give yourself permission to have days where you simply don't want to go to work, or don't enjoy yourself there, even when you're practicing gratitude and finding bright spots. The problem is when that is the only way you look at your job. Occasional down days and irritations are bound to crop up.
When something happens that irritates or frustrates you, remind yourself that the specific situation is what is frustrating, not necessarily the job itself. This will make you less likely to descend into a downward spiral where you begin to focus only on the irritating aspects of the job.

, Sometimes you need to do something for yourself that can relate to your work. This could be anything from writing blog posts about the service industry, to developing a new way of structuring your company.Consider what might help make your job, or further marketability, better. Is there a better way to do your job? Is there a way to do things faster? Could you make the copier work better and break less often? Doing any of these things will demonstrate your creativity and your initiative and will give you a purpose.

, Sometimes there are ways to improve your job so that it goes from terrible or soul-sucking to much more manageable. This may mean having a talk with your boss, it could mean cutting down on your hours, and so on.


For example: if it's a coworker or your boss who is making your life miserable at work, you may want to have a private talk with them. They may not realize what they're doing is affecting you so negatively. Even if they do realize, calling them on their behavior (especially if you can offer reasons why they need to change) can do a lot to improving things for you.
Set boundaries. If you work too many hours (or lots of overtime for which you aren't really being paid) discuss this with your supervisor. If there is an unspoken rule that you have to work overtime, don't fall into the trap.

, Sometimes you really have to just quit the job that is sucking your soul from your body. Start quietly looking for a new job, maybe in an area that you're more suited for, or something you might prefer doing.


Decide if you really can't stay at the job you're at. This means that the job is affecting your mental or physical health, or if you're being abused by management or a coworker, etc. if you've tried to improve your situation and can't, it's probably time to move on.
Try to avoid leaving your job until you have another job, but remember, there won't always be a safety net into which you can leap. You may have to be prepared to scrape yourself off the bottom, if things really don't work out. This does not mean you should stay at a job that you truly cannot stand.

, Even if you don't always like the people with whom you work, it creates a good atmosphere when you find ways to avoid taking them for granted. Just realizing and acknowledging how each person contributes (even if it is only a little!) to the company can make a huge difference.


Say ""thank you"" to the people you work with. It can be for more general things, like they cleaned up in the kitchen after using it, or it can be for the work they've done. Say things like ""Thank you so much, John, for putting in all that extra work on our presentation. You've really make the presentation so much better,"" or ""Thank you, Jane, for fixing the copier yet again. You really know how to work that thing!""
Acknowledge each person's value. Each person who works at a place of employment has intrinsic value, as well as value to do with their job. The customer service rep who answers the phone all day is the face of the company to the customers, the dishwashers in the back kitchen is making it so that you have clean dishes to use throughout the day, the person who cleans the bathrooms makes the work environment habitable. Pay attention to all the people in your organization.

, Instead of a generic ""Hey, how ya doing?"" get in the habit of saying ""Hey, Abby, how's life treating you?"" It turns out that a part of our brains lights up when we hear our own names being spoken, increasing the warmth we feel for others.Being happy at work in large part depends on being happy with coworkers, and your relationship with coworkers can be improved simply by slipping a person's name into a sentence. So do it: Use names more often and see work get better.

, To create a more positive environment that's better to work in you have to find encouragement and support in the people with whom you work. You're going to have to see and cooperate with these people every single day, so finding ways to do that will make your life there much happier.


Foster trust by starting each interaction with the basic assumption that you can trust your coworker. This means trusting them to do their job, trusting them to work positively with you. Doing this will create the expectation of trust, and make your coworkers more likely to step up and earn your trust. Will people still fail your trust? Of course, but this way you're more likely to foster more trust, and those times when people don't follow through will be aberrations.If there are people that you don't like or who have a negative impact on you, minimize the time you spend with them as much as possible. Don't be rude. For example, if Sally, rude office gossip, comes into your workspace, give her a few minutes of your time and then say, politely, ""Hey, I really have to get this finished. I'll catch you with you later.""
Do what you want others to do. This means doing your work in a timely manner, being on time to work, and not passing around nasty or mean gossip about your coworkers. Modeling this behavior (without telling people they should act more like you, and doing stuck-up things like that) can make people more likely to want to act that way themselves., Your job might be something like cleaning hotel rooms, or serving people sandwiches, or it could be something big in banking. Whatever it is, try to find make something inspiring out it, even if it's only inspiring to you. You get to decide whether the work you do is important.


Look at the people who inspire you, including famous people. For example: you don't have to turn into Mother Theresa, but you could try giving a helping hand to some of the struggling people in your company (like offering to mentor them, or giving them positive feedback, etc.).
Start a creative project, at your job or outside of (but link to) it. A good way to keep inspiration flowing is to have a creative project that you're working on. This could be something as simple as trying new ways of doing your work (turning the sandwiches you make into works of art; improving your latte making skills until you can make coffee art; reorganizing your cubicle so it is more conducive to working).

, Even if you don't exactly enjoy what you do, finding ways to have fun with your colleagues can make the work go by much faster. You don't have to slack on your job, or be cruel, to have fun, either.


Have a whiteboard where you write down the funniest things that people have said that day (as long as you aren't repeating mean or rude things).
Start a really bad joke contest and have some sort of silly prize for the winner. Again, avoid cruel jokes (racist jokes, sexist jokes, rape jokes, etc.).

, What we do at work has meaning at home. And how we feel at home gets translated into how we feel at work. It's a cycle, where one part of the equation influences the other. Focusing on maintaining a good ""work/life balance"" will help you make both parts even better. Here are some ideas about what you can do outside of work to make the time that you do spend in the office even better.

, People have a tendency to get wrapped up in their own lives, especially in their jobs. Suddenly you find that it's been over a year since you last spoke to your friends, because all your energy and attention has been going into staying late at work to get that promotion.


Having a strong community of friends and family is incredibly important to your overall health. People who have strong connections tend to live longer and feel more fulfilled in their lives, which in turn make them happier in their work lives, as well.
Set up a time with your friends each month when you can meet. It can be something like meeting for breakfast every first Friday of the month. Then the date is on people's calendars and, as it's monthly, if they can't come that month, they can come at a later date.
Make sure you're spending time with your family (spouse, children, etc.). Even if you're tired, taking some time to ask them about their day and helping out with the household chores can make home life much happier and more fulfilling.

, Most people aren't going to find a way to incorporate their passions into their jobs. Don't let this mean your passions fall by the wayside because you're focusing exclusively on work. Find ways to pursue them outside of your job, so you don't need your job to fulfill that need.


For example, if you're really into rock climbing, you don't necessarily need to be a rock climbing instructor, or somehow do that as your job to be happy and fulfilled at work. You could do a job that helps fund your passion, or that allows you to take vacations to go on longer climbing trips.
Do something with art or something creative. Take up knitting, or participate in some free drawing classes (you can sometimes find free life drawing at colleges). This will help you feel like you're accomplishing something important, will give you a creative outlet (if you're not getting it at your job).

, Trying out new things in your life can make it easier to handle the surprises life has a way of throwing your way. It's also a great way to build inspiration in all different areas of your life, including in your life.


Doing new things doesn't necessarily mean spending piles of money on a worldwide trip, or skydiving class (although if you can do that and want to, great!). It means trying out different things in your community that challenge you: taking a cooking class, or going to free lectures at your local university, doing guerrilla gardening, and so on.
You can also do things like work at a soup kitchen or shelter. These can get you out of your comfort zone, remind of the positive things in your own life (like food, a roof over your head, your health, a job, etc.), while doing positive work in your community.

, Stresses at work and in your life can cause you to get ill, both in body and in mind. Find ways to make sure that you're getting the support and healthy practices that you need to keep going through the stress and through the potential difficulties.


Exercise is incredibly important to your health, physical and mental. It releases chemicals like endorphins which help you feel happier. Exercise can ease depression and anxiety and it can boost your energy level. Try for at least 30 minutes of exercise each day. If you are feeling sleepy during your work shift, get up and move around (walk the stairs in your building, take a walk around the block, do some jumping jacks). It will work better than an energy drink to keep you going to the end of your shift.
Eating right means you're putting food in your body that helps to fuel it and make it work at optimum levels. Frequent consumption of foods that are sugary or high in salts and saturated fats, can make your mood worse. Go for protein (meat, nuts, soy, etc.) and lots of fruits and veggies. For carbohydrates, go for the better ones (brown rice, sprouted wheat, oats).
Get enough sleep. Most people in the United States (especially those who work) are operating on a sleep deficit, which will make you less effective and happy at your work and in your life. Try for at least 8 hours each night, the more hours you get in before midnight the better rested you'll be. Turn off all electronics at least 30 minutes before bedtime.

, A lot of people never end up able to, or willing to, take their vacation days, even if their jobs offer paid vacations for their employees. Vacations give you the distance from your job that can help you decide whether it's a good fit for you, if it's really as bad as you sometimes think. Or they can simply rejuvenate you so that you can get back to work with a better attitude.If you can't really take a whole vacation, try for at least a few days off each year, where you simply allow yourself to relax and you take care of yourself.

Change the way that you work.,
Focus the positive aspects of your job.,
Practice gratitude.,
Look at the big picture.,
Improve other parts of your life.",How to Love Your Job1," Maybe you need to use a new technique or change your approach in order to love your job. When work becomes mundane, it can feel more difficult to face. In these situation, changing your approach might be helpful. This is sometimes called job enrichment.Look for little opportunities to change up your routine at work. Making small changes may make work feel more fun and help keep things fresh.
For example, if you are a teacher, try a new lesson plan now and then or test out a new teaching strategy. If you are a cashier, try asking each customer a different question to make small talk.;
, If you are not enjoying your job, then you might be focused on all of the negative aspects of it. To start loving your job, you will need to identify what you like about your job and start focusing on those positive aspects instead.Try writing down all of the things that you like about your job. These can be small or big things. For example, you might like your hours, your coworkers, your responsibilities, and the location of your workplace. Try reading through this list whenever you are feeling down about your job.

, If you find that you are having negative thoughts about going to work each day, try keeping a list of the things that you are grateful for. Practicing gratitude can help you to feel happier overall and may also help you see your job in a more positive light.Try listing three things that you are grateful for at the end of each day. For example, you might feel grateful that your boss brought doughnuts into work for everyone, or that you got to work at your favorite station that day, or simply that you have a job.

, Sometimes work may become a chore if little things start to bother you more than they should. If you find yourself focusing in on minor issues at work, such as a rude customer or making a mistake, remind yourself that these are not important in the grand scheme of things.One way to put problems into perspective is to ask yourself, “Will I be thinking about this moment while I am on my death bed?” If the answer is no, then it is not worth your mental energy now either.

, Sometimes a job can be more difficult to engage with when other parts of your life are out of balance. Consider other aspects of your life that might be making you unhappy.For example, are you having any relationship problems? Are you having financial difficulties? Do you feel depressed for no apparent reason?
If you are struggling with something, seek help from a friend or family member or talk to a therapist.

Develop friendships at work.,
Make your work space as pleasant as possible.,
Develop a daily ritual.,
Look for opportunities to be creative.",How to Love Your Job2," Getting to know the people that you work with all day long may improve your sense of happiness at work.You may even make some new friends to spend time with outside of work in the process. Try striking up a conversation with someone new every day that you are at work and try to develop good work relationships the people that you work with most often.


For example, you might strike up a conversation with someone in the elevator by saying something like, “Hi. I’m Joe. I don’t think we have met before. What’s your name?” Or, you can give a coworker a compliment to start up a conversation by saying something like “I thought that the presentation that you gave the other day was outstanding. It really gave me some great ideas. How did you come up with that?”

, You may enjoy sitting at your desk or working in your work space if the area is inviting. If you are allowed to do so, try adding a few personal touches to your desk or work space.


For example, you can place a nice photo of you and your significant other or family, a small plant, or an inspirational figurine.

, Having something that you look forward to doing every day can improve your feelings about your job. Try to develop a simple daily ritual to add to your workday.For example, you might spend your first break of the day sipping a cup of tea and listening to an audiobook. Or you might make daily ritual out of tossing a coin into a nearby water fountain on your way home from work.

, Some of the tasks that you need to accomplish each day might be mundane, but you can make them more fun by finding ways to be creative.For example, if you have to arrange clothes on a display, try to make it look as appealing as possible by arranging the colors in a pattern. Or if you have to file some documents, make a game out of it and try to see how quickly you can find each document’s file.

Talk to your boss, manager or superior about how you have been feeling.,
Ask for a raise.,
Find out if there are any opportunities for advancement or training.,
Organize with other workers.,
Consider looking for a new position.",How to Love Your Job3," If you have been struggling with some aspect of your job, then you may want to talk to your boss about how you have been feeling and ask for advice. Make sure it is someone you can trust. Some superiors may be more approachable than others. If you are unsure, ask a coworker that you trust about which supervisor they feel to be most trustworthy or approachable in this case.Clearly state what you need from them. For example, if you are struggling with some aspect of your job, try asking something like, “I am having a hard time with _______. Do you have any suggestions?”

, If you are not be enjoying your job because you feel like you deserve to be making more money, then consider asking for a raise. You will need to arrange a time to talk to your boss about getting a raise. Try asking something like, “I was hoping we could meet sometime to talk about my performance. Is that something that we could do?” To increase your chances of getting a raise, you will need to:Prepare for the conversation by gathering evidence about why you deserve a raise. For example, how have you contributed to the company’s success? What have you accomplished that is noteworthy
Practice what you plan to say. Before you meet with your boss, practice your pitch several times until it sounds natural and confident.
Avoid threatening to quit or complaining about poor work conditions. Focus on the positive things that you have done and use these things to support your request for a raise.
Have a backup plan in case you get a no answer. If your boss declines your request for a raise, try to negotiate for something else that you would like, such as stock options or more flexible work hours.

, Sometimes doing the same thing all of the time can become mundane and you might feel like you need a new challenge. If this happens, then try asking your boss if there are any opportunities for advancement or training that you can apply for. Even if nothing is available right away, asking about these opportunities will show your boss that you have ambition and you may be considered for a future opportunity.


Try saying something like, “I am interested in staying with this company for a long time and I would like to continue to grow with the company. Are there any opportunities for advancement or training that I might be eligible to apply for?”

, Sometimes attempting to get benefit or wage increase can be impossible by yourself. By organizing in groups, employees in a similar position can force employers to change. This is the principle behind a union and it can help with satisfaction when negotiating increases.Check online to see if there is already a union you can join.
Consult your local laws regarding the formation of unions if you wish to form a new union.

, Sometimes the best thing you can do is to get a new job. Before you decide to leave your current job, take some time to think about whether or not this is the right choice. There are lots of things to consider before you make the decision to quit your current job. You may want to make a list of the pros and cons of your current job to help you make your final decision. Some things to consider include:availability of other jobs
the effects of your current job on your physical and/or emotional health
feelings about your coworkers and boss
feelings about the company
sense of fulfillment in your current job

Develop relationships with your company's key players.,
Work hard.,
Make yourself available.,
Play your part on the team.,
Avoid water-cooler talk that centers on negativity.,
Give something of yourself.",How to Keep an Ace in the Hole at Work," If you want to climb the ladder at work, make an effort to develop a friendly rapport with your bosses and your boss's bosses. Get as personal as is possible for your work environment without crossing the line between professionalism and indecency.;
, However obvious this sounds, it bears mentioning that when you do well, people notice. Many people complain about their jobs and daydream about getting a job promotion when in actuality they are slacking off at the jobs they do have. Don't be one of those people.

, While working on a Saturday may not be your first choice for weekend fun, it may payoff when it comes job promotion time. If you spend your time off work sitting on the couch or watching television, then consider the benefits of giving up that lazy time in exchange for a chance to prove your worth on the job and, in turn, climb the ladder.

, Sometimes this requires being the leader and other times it requires taking orders and humbly completing tasks. Prove your adaptability and you will stand out, even if you are standing in the background.

, No one likes a complainer. Stand out from the herd and obtain job security by steering clear of griping co workers and keeping your eye on the prize.

, Bring pictures of your family to work. Talk about your personal interests. Show your sense of humor. These things will make you human and likable (and, in turn, favored) amongst your co workers.

You don’t have to be best friends with your boss — in fact, it’s better that you’re not — but you should have a warm, friendly, and respectful relationship with your boss if you want to stick around the company. Even if you don’t always see eye to eye, make an effort to be as positive and respectful around your boss at all times.


If you do have a complaint, make sure you state it respectfully and never blame your boss or seem ungrateful for your job.
Make an effort to get to know your boss a bit and to ask about his plans or his family. As long as your boss is fairly open about his life, it’s important to show an interest.;
, If you want to keep your job, then you need to have a positive attitude about the work that you do. Though not every minute of your job may be pure joy, you have to find a way to embrace the things you love about your job and to deal with the less pleasant aspects of the job. Try to minimize your complaining and talk about the things you love about the work instead; your boss will be much more likely to keep you around if you’re positive and help maintain high morale in the office.


For example, if you’re a teacher, you may not love the hours you have to spend grading each week; instead of complaining about student papers, talk about how much you love actually teaching the students.
Coworkers tend to fall into a routine of complaining to each other a lot. Try not to get sucked in to that trap and change the subject when people are being negative around you.

, If you want to keep your job, then being a team player is a must. You have to be able to communicate well to get along with others, and to work well with your co-workers, even if you have your differences. If you have a reputation of being difficult to work with, of being rude or dismissive to your co-workers, or of not taking your boss’s feedback seriously, then you’ll be the first to go when it’s time to make cuts.


You want to have the reputation of being the person who could work well with anyone on a given project; if you’re known to only get along with one or two people, then it’ll be harder for your boss to put you on a team and it will make you a liability.
Learn to disagree respectfully. Instead of name-calling, ignoring your co-workers, or being too eager to prove that you are right, you should work on listening carefully and asking your co-workers to explain their reasoning while calmly sharing your ideas.
Be friendly as much as you can. Smile and greet your co-workers and stop to make small talk; don’t act like you’re above socializing, no matter how busy you are. When the time comes to make cuts, your boss will think about the type of energy you bring to the office, and you want to bring a friendly, positive one.
In your down time, see what you can do to help someone else complete their task in the spirit of teamwork. Remember this will help your company to stay in business.
Don’t get sucked into office gossip. This won’t help you get your work done and it will give you a bad reputation.

, When it comes to being a good employee and keeping your job, this is a big no no. You don’t want your coworkers getting upset that you make more money than they do and then taking their complaints to your boss. When he finds out you’ve been wagging your tongue, he’ll be none too pleased.

, Remember that the customer is king and that he has the ability to fire everyone from the CEO to the janitor. If you don't have customers you will not have a business. If you have a customer-oriented job, then make sure you treat customers with kindness and respect at all times. If you’re up against a difficult customer, make sure to maintain your calm or even to ask for help when it’s needed. Remember that your boss will be looking for employees who do the best with customers.


You want your boss to look at you as an asset to the business, not a liability.

, Though you may have a busy family life, you should make an effort to attend company picnics, parties, seminars, happy hours, volunteering events, and any other activities when you can. This will show your boss that you care about your job even when you’re outside the office and that you truly love what you do as well as the people you work with; you don’t want to get the reputation of being the person who never goes to anything.


If you attend as many events as you can, then you will become even more of a fixture in your office. This will make it harder for your boss to fire you. If you’re never around, though, it’ll be much easier for him to picture the company without you.

, This will show your employer that he or she can depend on you being there for work. This seems simple, but a lot of people take this for granted. Don't let that be you. You want to look like you care about your job and that you want to make an effort to get there when you need to be there. Better yet, aim to get to work at least 15 minutes early each day, so if you get delayed by traffic or another unforeseen circumstance, you’ll be more likely to at least get there on time.


If you do come to work late one day, make an effort to apologize or to show it won’t happen again. If you roll in with a smug look on your face or act like it’s no big deal, then that will show that you don’t really care about your job all that much.

, If you want to keep your job, then you have to be on top of your game. You want to have an organized desk, organized computer, and to generally know where your important files, papers, phone numbers, and other work materials are at all times. You don’t want to have the reputation of being that guy who lost an important file or for taking an hour to dig an old piece of important information out of your email. Not only will being neat and organized make you a better employee, but it will make your job easier!


If you spend just 10 minutes a day making sure your workspace is organized, you’ll be in great shape.
You should also be organized in the way you do work. Keep an active appointment calendar, a to-do list, and track all of the work you’ve done and the work you have to do.

, This will give you a zest and zeal for your work that you will be excited about going to work to try out your ideas. If you’ve been at your company for a long time or even a few months, you may see that many changes are being implemented to suit the company; make sure you’re willing to change and grow along with the company and that you’re ready with fresh ideas for how you can do your work better.


You don’t want your boss to think that you’re not receptive to new ideas or that you’re not able to roll with the punches. One of the key traits of a remarkable employee is flexibility.

, If you want your boss to see you as a person who is always ready for the next challenge, then don’t be afraid to ask questions that can help you do your job even better. If you want to know how to innovate, work a new system, or how to do what you do even better, don’t be afraid to talk to your boss about ways that you can do your job better. You want your boss to think of you as a person who is inquisitive, curious, and always ready to learn.


Of course, there’s a time and a place for everything. You don’t want to flood your boss with questions when she’s rushing off to an important meeting.

, If you want to keep your job, then you have to show that you’re able to accept criticism and feedback and to use it to do your job better. If you act defensive or even angry when your boss critiques your work, then you’ll have a reputation of being stubborn and difficult to work with. You don’t want your boss to dread having to give you feedback or to struggle to have a constructive conversation with you; instead, you should thank your boss for the feedback and use it to improve.


Remind yourself that feedback can help you do even better at your job. It’s not meant to hurt you or to make you feel bad about the work that you do.

, Though it can be hard to separate your personal life from your work sometimes, if you want to be professional, then you have to make an effort to compartmentalize and to stay focused when you’re at work. If you go to work and complain about your daughter or your boyfriend, then you’ll have a reputation of not having it all together. You don’t want your boss to think that you’d be the first to go because you have so much going on at home.


Though it can be hard to completely separate yourself from your home life, especially if you’re going through a hard time, you have to work on being as focused and positive as you can. If you feel yourself getting emotional or upset, make sure to get some time alone.

, If you want to keep your job, then you have to make sure to look professional whenever you’re in the workplace. Whether this means wearing a company uniform, wearing business clothes, or just looking well-groomed for a more casual work environment, it’s important to look like you’ve put time into your appearance and to show that you really care about looking your best at work.


If you look disheveled or like you haven’t showered in a few days, then your boss will think that you don’t take your work seriously.

, If you really want to keep your job and to actually have a great attitude about the work that you do, then it’s important that you pick a job that you truly love. Though we can’t always start off in the field that we want to work in, it’s important to know what you really want and what you’re passionate about as you move forward in your career. If you find work that truly engages you, then you won’t have to work hard to keep your job, because you’ll be loving every second of it!


As the saying goes, “If you love what you do, then you won’t have to work a day in your life.” If you’re having a lot of trouble keeping your job or staying motivated, then it may mean that you’re not in the right field.

, Never get complacent when it comes to your job. You can always work smarter, faster, harder, and be more proficient in your position. Take on new projects that challenge your areas of expertise; propose new ideas to make the company thrive even if it’ll take a lot of work to carry them out. Minimize the routine tasks and opt for as many challenging and more complicated tasks as possible.


Challenging yourself to be better at your job every single day will not only make you more likely to keep your job, but it will also make your work much more fun! You’ll be much less likely to enjoy your work if you feel like you’re just doing the same task over and over without learning a thing.
If you don’t challenge yourself, your boss will think that you’re bored or uninspired by your job.
Always be willing to take the initiative. If you’ve wrapped up your project three hours early, ask what else you can do instead of leaving the office.

, Whether the mission is to help underprivileged youth or to make parenting as stress-free as possible, you have to know your company’s mission and remind yourself of why it is important as you go about your daily tasks. This will show your boss that you really do care about the larger goals of the company and that you’re not just out for yourself.


Committing to your company’s mission puts you in a win-win situation; not only will it make you look better in front of your boss, but it will make your work more meaningful. If you truly believe in the mission of the company, then you will feel excited about carrying it out.

, If you really want to keep improving at your career, then you should continue to learn as much as you can about the work that you do. Whether you take night classes, begin an extra certification program, ask a more senior employee to train you to use a complicated system, or just read all of the latest journals, articles, and literature about your field, it’s important to stay current while also learning as much as you can about your area of expertise.


You don’t need to rub your boss’s nose in it, but if all of the additional training that you’ve been doing comes up, your boss will be impressed. He or she will see how much you really care about your job.
Of course, everyone needs to relax and decompress after work. You don’t want to spend all of your “free” time learning about your job or you are likely to feel overworked and burned out.

, Though you don’t want your boss to take advantage of you, you don’t want to seem like you want to rush home the second that you’re done with work. If your boss needs you to stick around once in a while, agree to do so in a friendly, positive manner. Of course, you have to make sure that you’re appropriately compensated and that it doesn’t become a pattern.

, You don’t want to be the guy or girl who immediately checks her Facebook as soon as the boss is out of sight. If your boss is away for a week or just gone or busy for the day, you have to be able to keep working and to remind yourself that your work is important. You want your boss to know that you can work on your own and that you don’t need constant guidance. In fact, if you can even help others work on their own, then you’ll be in an even better position at the company.

Dress presentably for the interview.",How to Write a Resume for Babysitting," A summary or objective statement should be approximately 2-4 sentences long and written in paragraph form, as opposed to point form with bullets. The purpose of such a statement is to outline what it is you’re looking for in terms of work, and why you’d be an excellent choice for that work. As you are likely a student, and you might possibly have other responsibilities or engagements (e.g. chores, sports, clubs, etc.), you might want to use this statement as an opportunity to explain what days and times you’re available for babysitting.You can update your summary or objective statement as often as you want. For example, you might have different availability during school months than you do during the summer months, or during holidays. You may want to create two separate resumes - one for school months and the other for holidays. You can submit or send whichever resume is relevant when you’re job searching.;
, Most skills and abilities can be divided into three categories - technical, transferable, and personal. Technical skills are very specific skills that are needed to carry out very specific tasks. For a babysitter, a technical skill may be knowing how to perform CPR. Transferable skills are more general skills that can be used to carry out a variety of tasks. For a babysitter, a transferable skills may be the ability to be organized and plan events. Finally, personal skills are attributes that describe your work ethic and personality. For a babysitter, personal skills would include being trustworthy, honest, organized and on time.Think about the various types of skills and abilities you possess and write them down. Search for skill or ability ‘words’ online to narrow down the exact words you’d like to use to describe yourself.Write out several sentences that describe your skills and abilities as they relate to babysitting. The exact number you should include on your resume will depend on how many you’re able to come up with, and how much space you have.
Examples of skills and abilities that are relevant to babysitting are: playful, active, responsible, flexible, patient, trustworthy, punctual, calm in an emergency, persuasive., Work experience is normally any past or current experience you’ve had where you’ve been paid to do a job. Obviously, volunteer experience can be any work you did where you were not paid. Assuming you have at least two past work experiences that you want to include, create a separate section for any volunteer experience you’ve had.In normal circumstances, when you list work experience, you would include the name of the position you held, the name of the department you worked in, the name of the overall company, and the location where you worked (e.g. Customer Service Representative, Women’s Shoes, Sears, Seattle, WA).
When you’re listing prior babysitting experience you have two options: (1) include the name of the family you babysat for, or (2) list the family generically. The two examples may look like this: (1) Babysitter, The Smith Family - 6 year old & 3 year old, Los Angeles, CA, or (2) Babysitter, Family with 3 and 6 year olds, Los Angeles, CA.
Each position you list on your resume should include at least 2-3 bullet points that describe what you did at that particular job. Each of these bullet points should start with a verb in the past tense (if you are no longer working at that job) or a verb in the present tense (if you’re still currently at the job).

Some example verbs to use are: conducted, directed, planned, oversaw, monitored, arranged, coordinated, encouraged, assisted, demonstrated, motivated, supported.Some example babysitting-related descriptions are: designed creative games and activities to keep children engaged; prepared nutritious meals; escorted children on outings to the local park; oversaw completion of child’s homework.You should also list each job in chronological order - from most recent at the top of the list, to least recent at the bottom of the list.
The final result of one job entry in your work experience section should look something like this: Babysitter, The Johnson Family - two 7 year olds, Portland, ME. January 2013 to August 2013. Escorted children home from school. Prepared a nutritious after-school snack each day. Assisted children with homework assignments. Escorted children to local playground in good weather.

, If you have at least one volunteer experience, you’ll need a volunteer section in your resume. If your work experience section is really small (1-2 items) you may prefer to add your volunteer jobs to that section, instead of creating a separate section. If you combine the two sections, you can give it a label of simply “Experience.""In general, your volunteer experience section should be written in the same way you wrote your work experience section.
If you combine the volunteer and work experience sections into one, remember to list ALL experiences in chronological order - from most recent to least recent.
If you combine the volunteer and work experience sections into one, you can put the word “volunteer” in brackets after the job title you had for the volunteer job. For example, Food Server (volunteer), The Cancer Charity BBQ, New York, NY.

, Extracurricular activities can include a large variety of things that you do outside of school - sports teams, formal clubs and organizations (e.g. Girl Guides, Scouts, etc.), and information clubs (e.g. book club, gaming club, etc.). It can also include extra things you’ve done at school like being in the school play, playing on a school sports team, and being a member of school club.Listing extracurricular activities on your resume isn’t required, but it’s nice to have. Showing potential employers that you have a wide variety of skills and interests is beneficial, especially if some of those skills and interests align with the skills and interests of your potential employer!

, Your education will be fairly straight-forward as it’ll be the elementary and high schools you’ve attended so far. If you specialized in a particular subject at any of those schools, you can include that info. But you do not need to list all the courses you’ve taken. Training, however, is any type of education you’ve had outside the school environment. This may include first aid courses, sports lessons, art courses, babysitter training, animal behaviour courses, and so forth.You can tailor which training courses you include on your resume to match the type of jobs you’re applying for. For example, if you’re only using the resume to apply for babysitting jobs, listing babysitter training, first aid training and maybe art courses would be great.

, Start by looking at word processing software like MS Word, Google Docs or Pages. Many of them come with resume templates of different styles and design. You can also find many free templates available for download on the internet. You can either select a template to use “as is” and simply add your personal information, or you can select a template and alter some of the formatting to create something more unique. Or, if you’re more creative, you can create a resume template from scratch.While the resume templates that come with well-known software like MS Word are a great starting point, keep in mind that everyone who has access to MS Word can potentially use the same template. That means that employers may receive a stack of resumes from potential candidates that all look the same! Your resume will not stand out in such a situation. This may not be a problem when you’re only looking for babysitting positions, but keep it in mind as you start to apply to other types of positions like retail stores, restaurants, offices, etc., Every resume needs to contain your name, your (home) address, your phone number(s), and your email address. The best place to put these items is in the header. Having them in the header will help control the formatting and ensure these items are displayed on every page of your resume, if your resume is more than 1 page in length.Your name should be the very first thing on a resume, and it should stand out. You can make your name stand out by: using bold, using a larger font size than the rest of the document (e.g. 14-18 pt), or using a different font than the rest of your resume (e.g. use a fancy font like Copperplate for your name, but use Arial for the rest of your resume).
Your address, phone number(s) and email can be in the same font size and font as the rest of the document. Or, you can keep it the same font size as the rest of the document, but use a slightly different font.
You’ll want to use an address that is most relevant to the jobs you’re seeking. For example, if you’re looking for babysitting jobs while spending the summer at your cottage, put your cottage address on your resume.
Try to limit how many phone numbers you list on your resume. Ideally only use one phone number, but if you need to put a home and cell phone number, that’s fine. Just remember your phone etiquette for those phone numbers once you start circulating your resume!
For your first resume it is recommended that you keep it to 1 page. As you add more experience, you can expand to a second page if needed., Graphics and embellishments are not required on a resume, but if you want to add some creativity, this is one place where it’ll stand out. These graphics and embellishments should be simple, elegant and in no way overwhelming. They should work to enhance what’s on your resume, and make your resume stand out from the crowd. And it should go without saying that these graphics should never include anything obscene or anything that may be misunderstood by an adult.One possible embellishment would be to add one or more lines to the header or footer, or in between sections. The format of the line, including its width, it us to you.
Embellishments might also include small artistic symbols, webdings or wingdings.
You can even use symbols instead of standard bullets when you’re making a list.
One possible graphic idea is to add a subtle watermark to the page, using a simple graphic. The graphic could be your initial in really fancy calligraphic font, or a simple picture that you feel represents you.
If you ever expand your resume to be more than one page, put page numbers in the footer. If your resume is only one page long, do not put any page numbers.

, You will need to create headings for each major section of your resume. Which headings you need will depend on which sections you’ve decided to include in your resume. The section headings usually stand out nicely by simply bolding the font, but you can also use a slightly different font for the headings instead. The words you use in each heading should make the contents of that section obvious and should be short enough that the reader can skim through them quickly.Some possible section headings you may want to consider are: Professional Summary, Professional Objectives, Overview, Skills & Abilities, Qualifications, Work Experience, Volunteer Experience, Work & Volunteer Experience, Education, Training, Education & Training, Extra-Curricular Activities, Technical Knowledge, Technical Skills.

, Once your resume has all the content entered, and is completely formatted, read through it at least a couple of times. Look for spelling and grammar mistakes, and for any sentences or statements that don’t seem to make sense. Make any corrections or edits you want. If you find there’s a lot of white space on your resume (i.e. empty space), you may want to use this opportunity to add some more items. This could include more statements about your skills and abilities, or a couple more sentences describing the work you’ve performed for past jobs.


If your resume is longer than 1 page, reformat certain parts of the resume in order to fit it onto 1 page. You can make adjustments to the margins or font size, or remove some of your statements.
Make sure your resume is formatted to fit on a normal Letter-sized piece of paper.

, No matter how careful you are, and how many times you read over a draft of your resume, there may still be mistakes that your eyes simply do not notice. It is always a good idea to have someone review your resume and provide feedback before you consider it final. Ask them to look for spelling and grammar issues, but also ask them to let you know if any of your statements don’t make sense. From a visual perspective, as them if you’re resume is too crowded, or has too much white space. Or if any of the embellishments and graphics are too overwhelming.Don’t be offended by any of the feedback you receive, it is only going to make your resume better in the long run. And don’t feel you need to implement all the feedback you receive. If you do not agree with a specific point of feedback, don’t include it.
You might want to consider asking the following people to review your resume: parents, older sibling, teacher, guidance counsellor, coach, club leader, spiritual leader, or career centre advisor. As much as your good friends might want to help, you most likely want someone with experience creating several versions of their own resume as a reviewer.

, To save yourself time and effort in the future, keep a copy of your resume in a format that can be easily updated (i.e. doc, docx, txt, etc.) and save a FINAL version as a PDF. You might end up having multiple PDF versions of your resume over time, but only one version of the most recent editable format. Whenever you need to make a change or update to your resume, you would open the editable version, make the change, save the editable version, then also save the final version as a PDF (with the appropriate name).Depending on the reason for the various versions, you may wish to make the name of the PDF explanatory. This will help you keep them organized going forward. For example: My Resume - Summer, My Resume - School, My Resume - Oct 2014, etc.

, Getting a babysitting job via word of mouth is probably the easiest and safest method to use. Talk to your parents, teachers, coaches, neighbours, friends, fellow churchgoers, etc., about whether they know anyone who is looking for a babysitter. Also make the same people aware that you’re available for babysitting, and to share your contact info with anyone who might be looking for a babysitter. You can also try spreading the word via social media that you’re available for babysitting, assuming your social media account wouldn’t hinder you getting a job. You can also consider posting a flyer that contains limited personal information, but only post them in trusted areas like a community centres, local recreation centres, local job or career centres, libraries, churches or other religious buildings, etc., Regardless of how you found out about a specific babysitting job, you will most likely need to provide the family with a copy of your resume. You can do this one of two ways - you can print a copy of your resume to provide to the family, or you can send the PDF version of your resume via email. Which option you use should depend on what the family requests. If you aren’t sure what they’d prefer, ask.


If you do need to print your resume, you may want to consider purchasing slightly heavier paper stock from an office supply store. This type of paper feels heavier and thicker than the standard paper you use everyday in your printer. In many cases it also comes in different subtle colours that can make a nice background for your resume. Don’t go overboard with the paper, as you don’t want to detract from what’s on your resume.

, Normally you would not list a reference on a resume itself, but provide it when asked by a potential employer. You can either provide a copy of a written letter, or you can provide the name and contact info for your reference. A potential employer may simply want to read comments from former employers, or they may wish to talk to a former employer via phone or email and ask specific questions. If you’re providing a reference as just a name and contact info, you must be certain that the person whose name you’re providing actually wants to give you a positive reference. Always check with them before you give out their contact info, and if possible, tell them which positions you’re applying for.For most non-babysitting jobs you will want to avoid using a family member as a reference. But since many babysitting jobs may be found via word of mouth from your family, including a family member as a reference should be okay. If possible, limit family members to only one of your references.

, Even though a lot of information is contained on your resume, sometimes a potential employer wants to here you explain the details of your previous jobs or experiences. For babysitting jobs, it is also likely that you’ll be asked specific questions about your experience with children, and what sort of things you’re willing to do with kids. While you may know how you would answer all these questions, it doesn’t hurt to practice, or even write down your responses. There’s nothing wrong with bringing a notebook or clipboard with you to an interview. Practicing how you’d answer the questions is also important as you may be nervous during the actual interview. If you’ve repeated your answers to yourself several times before the interview, you have a better chance of remembering exactly what to say in the interview.Do a quick web search to find career sites with some commonly asked babysitter interview questions and think about how you’d answer each one.

, The employer or parents aren’t the only ones allowed to ask questions at an interview - you’re allowed to ask questions as well, and you should. In order to make sure you remember the questions you want to ask, write them down in advance and bring the list with you. Check off each question as it is answered throughout the interview. Additional questions may come to mind as you are talking during the interview, and some of your prepared questions may get answered without you needing to ask them.Some potential questions you may want to ask the parents are:How many kids will you be taking care of, and what are their ages?
Do any of the children have any medical conditions or allergies that you need to be aware of?
Does the family have any pets that will be at home while your babysitting? If so, do you need to do anything for the pets?
Are you allowed to take the children on outings? And if so, where can you go? (If you have a license and are driving, you should also ask if you’re allowed to take the children in your car.)
Will one of the parents drive or escort you home at the end of the night (if you haven’t driven yourself)?
What types of activities do the parents want you to do with the kids, if any? Do they expect you to entertain the kids while you’re there, or can the kids do what they want?



, There is no standard hourly rate for a babysitter. The amount normally depends on a number of factors, including: how much experience you have; how many children you’ll be looking after; what time of day you’ll be babysitting; what types of activities you may be required to do with the kids (e.g. take them on outing, make them dinner, help them with homework, etc.). Before you go to an interview, think about the minimum hourly rate you’d consider. Get advice from friends or family who have babysat recently and ask them what they charged.There are also online tools available that can help you determine the average hourly rate in your area based on your experience and other factors.If you take a babysitter’s training course they might provide you with some localized information pertaining to hourly rates that may be helpful.

, Babysitting isn’t a formal office job where you need to wear a suit and tie, but dressing nicely is always a plus when going for an interview. You may want to avoid clothing that has rips or tears in it, or shirts that have graphics or words that may be offensive or confusing. Wear shoes that you can easily take off, as you’ll most likely be interviewed in the family’s home. Remember that the parents who are interviewing you will probably judge you a little based on your appearance, so don’t give them anything to misjudge you by."

, Whether your boss prefers to receive the weekly progress report via e-mail, in-person or on a spreadsheet, using a popular management methodology will keep you structured and manager impressed. The PPP stands for Progress, Plans and Problems.

, Firstly, start off with a positive note and list all your weekly achievements. But remember, when it comes to reporting, less is definitely more. Your boss does not need know how many pencils you sharpened or how many useless emails you sent out.

Talk to your family and friends.,
Pitch the idea to your boss.",How to Plan a Sabbatical1," Some companies have sabbatical programs for their employees, which will determine how much time you can take off and whether you will receive pay. If your company does not have an official sabbatical policy, it will be up to you to make a case to your boss — or quit your job, if it's time for a life change.


If your company does not have an official policy, your best bet is to plan for a sabbatical that lasts six to twelve weeks.If you've been working for the company for fewer than four years, an even shorter mini-sabbatical may be more reasonable.;
, Purchase a three-ring binder with clear inserts so you can organize your sabbatical in an organized and thought-out fashion. This will keep you on track and make the trip real. You will put everything about this trip in the binder, including thoughts, lists, photos, photocopies from books, print outs from websites, and notes.

, Write down all your goals on a personal list. Keep these goals in mind while you plan the sabbatical. Here are a few examples of what you might be looking for:


Seeing new places
Relaxing, and improving physical and mental health
Doing humanitarian work
Considering a different career
Learning new skills

, This is the fun part of planning. Look at your goals and decide how you would most enjoy accomplishing them. If you have any lifelong dreams, this could be the time to accomplish them. If you're having trouble coming up with ideas, try answering these questions:


Where would you love to go on vacation?
Is there anything you've always wanted to do?
Have you ever considered alternate careers? Or are you aiming for a promotion or ""sideways"" movement to a related area? Could you learn the necessary skills if you had the spare time?
Are there any hobbies you've been interested in, but never had the time for? Are there hobbies your friends have that seem fun?

, This is the boring part of the plan, but necessary. Now that you have an idea of some of the things you might get up to, it's time to estimate the cost. Determine how much money you can spend per month during your sabbatical, and begin to research any costs associated with your tentative plans.


Ideally, save 10–20% of your available budget for unexpected expenses, especially if you are quitting your job to take the sabbatical.
Start saving money for your sabbatical early. Set aside a portion of each paycheck, try to pay off debt, and stop using credit cards while you're saving.
If you are planning a long trip abroad, look for more advice in the section on logistics.

, It's often a good idea to wait until planning is well underway before you begin this conversation. Some of the people in your life may be more risk-averse than you, or may not support the idea of a vacation. Bring it up after you have an estimate of how much the sabbatical would cost, and what you would like to do. With a more concrete understanding of the situation, you can respond to their concerns reasonably and logically. Of course, many family members and friends may fully support you already.

, Your sabbatical can be beneficial to your employer as well, especially if you need a break to regain your enthusiasm and motivation. Give him additional reasons as well, for instance:


If you are traveling abroad, consider whether your new language skills and cultural connection could be beneficial to your employer, or whether there are contacts abroad that your company does business with.
You might learn new, work-relevant skills through classes, personal projects, or visiting other organizations.
Offer to train coworkers or interns to cover any vital work that needs to be done in your absence.

Know your institution's policy.,
Plan what you would like to do.,
Investigate funding sources.,
Put the plan in writing.,
Approach the chair of your department.,
Help find replacements to teach your courses.",How to Plan a Sabbatical2," Universities and colleges often allow their faculty a regular sabbatical, but the exact requirements depend on where you are and what your position is. Sabbatical may require tenure, and is typically limited to a specific length and frequency – for example, six months of sabbatical for every three years of work.

, An academic sabbatical typically involves independent research, although there may or may not be concrete requirements for what you have to show at the end of it. Decide whether you would like to write a book, perform field research, or work on a long-term project at another institution.

, Start looking at possible sources of funding early. Some grant-giving organizations, such as the Fulbright Scholar Program for U.S. scholars, provide funding for a wide variety of research abroad. Look into these funding sources as well as those relevant in your specific field.

, Write up a proposal to demonstrate what you'll use the sabbatical for, how you'll get the funding, and how this is all related to your field of research and the goals of your department and university.


Include supporting documents if necessary, such as lists of possible funding sources.

, Bring a copy of your plan to your department chair, keeping another copy of all documents for yourself. Explain the sabbatical goals to the chair. If she seems hesitant, emphasize any exposure the research will get that may enhance the institution's reputation or bring in new contacts.

, In some departments, part of your salary during sabbatical may go toward hiring an adjunct professor or instructor to cover your coursework, while other departments may cover the cost themselves. Either way, if you have a good candidate in mind for the position, that can make your department's job much easier.

Rent out your home and car.,
Get your passports and visas.,
Find out how to access your bank account.,
Get health insurance.,
Look into schools if you have children.,
Learn the language, if necessary.,
Talk to someone who's lived there.",How to Plan a Sabbatical3," If you own your own home, or if your landlord allows subletting, renting out your living space can be a major cost-saver. If you're lucky, you can rent the use of your car as well for an extra charge.


Look into house swap arrangements for another alternative.

, Check your passport and your family's passports early to make sure they won't expire before you return from the sabbatical. Renewing them can take weeks (or expensive fees for quick service). You'll probably also need to acquire a visa for each country you visit, depending on the relations between your country of citizenship and your destination. Contact the nearest consulate representing your destination country, to apply for these visas or find out more.

, Large banks often have ""sister banks"" abroad that you can access your account from. Contact your banking representative to set this up before you leave. Let your bank and your credit card company know when you'll be abroad, if possible, as an unexpected expense in a foreign country can sometimes cause them to block the card.

, Your current health insurance most likely does not cover time spent abroad. Purchase travel insurance for you and your family, or talk to your health care provider about paying for international coverage.

, Do your research well before you leave, and compare several options for continuing your child's schooling. Young children often adapt to language changes quickly, so you do not necessarily need to limit your search to schools that teach in their native language.

, Start taking language lessons or listening to audio language lessons as soon as you can, and stick with it. Talk to native speakers or watch films with subtitles as well, since regular conversation is always faster and harder to follow than lessons.

, Every location has its quirks, dangers, and opportunities. Discovering them is part of the fun, but if you can find out some of them in advance, you can save yourself a lot of headaches. If you don't know anyone who's been personally, join an online travel forum, look for public events in the local immigrant community, or contact someone in the organization you'll be working with.

Name and date the report.,
Provide details identifying the project.,
Explain what has been accomplished.,
List what will be done during the next reporting period.,
Discuss any problems or potential problems.,
Proofread your writing and send it to whoever needs it.

",How to Write a Status Report," A name containing the date (ex. “Summary for the Week of December 1”) is an easy, efficient option. Be sure to date the report.


If this report will be an email, you can use this as the subject line.
If the report will be a standalone document, place a header with this information on top.

, These include the project/assignment title, the starting and/or ending date, and the names of the people who have worked on it.

, Use a heading such as ""Accomplishments,"" ""Completed Tasks,"" ""Completed Action Items,"" or even simply ""Done.""


Be sure to specify the reporting period (i.e. week, month, quarter, etc.).
Use active verbs to start the sentences. These include words like completed, defined, solved, designed, organized, improved, fixed, and filed, to name a few examples.
For a brief weekly report, 3 to 6 one-sentence bullet points may be enough.

, A good heading for this new section is ""Planned tasks"", ""Next Steps"", or ""To Do.""


Estimate the amount of time a task will require, if you can do so confidently. Ex. ""Document the bracket design change. (Estimated time: 2 days).""
Refer to any schedules you have been given.
Again, 3 to 6 lines should be enough for a brief report.

, This is where you should clarify any need for guidance or help. ""Open Issues"" or ""Issues and Comments"" are good headers for this section, which can be a short paragraph or two.


Perhaps you're having trouble reaching a supplier because nobody is in the office this week. Perhaps you have a suggestion on how to improve the way the business is run. These are the kinds of details you’ll want to include in this section.
If you are simply reporting the problem and don't require assistance at this point, say so. Comments such as ""We expect to solve this issue within the next 2 days"" let supervisors know that they do not need to get involved but should monitor the situation.
If a situation does not get resolved, your supervisor cannot complain that you did not inform him/her earlier.

Include different facts depending on your level of experience.,
Focus on how you would benefit the company.,
Use the right words.,
Proofread.",How to Write a Career Objective1," What you should include in a career objective depends on your level of experience. If you're a high school or college student looking for entry level work, your career objective would be much different than someone with much experience in a given field.


If you're a high school student, a career objective should focus on general traits or values you possess. You should include a self introduction, measuring your strongest qualities, information about what role in a company you're hoping to fill, and an emphasis on your reliability as a job candidate. For example, something like, ""Dedicated student with a strong GPA and high work ethic. Seeking to use my abilities as student intern. I am very dedicated and goal-oriented and can help benefit the goals of your company.""If you're a college student, you're likely looking for entry level of internship experience. Your objective should include your degree, level of experience, your strongest traits, and an emphasis that you're hardworking and reliable. Something like, ""Recent college graduate with a marketing degree and two years of social media marketing experience. Seeking further experience in the field of online marketing. A dedicated, detail-oriented worker with experience in SEO, web copy, and social media management.""If you're a professional in the field already, you usually include a career objective if you're changing careers. Mention how many years experience you have, the qualities that would make you a strong candidate for a position, and any relevant education or certifications. For example, ""Grant writer with 6+ years in the nonprofit sector. Aiming to use my written communication and fundraising skills to help your organization increase awareness of world poverty. Possess an MA in nonprofit management."";
, While a career objective should focus on your skills and accomplishments, it should not be all about you. Try to focus on how your specific skill set would benefit a company. Hiring managers are looking for someone with impressive skills that are applicable to the job advertised.Highlight relevant experience. If you're a recent college grade applying for a marketing position and you've done promotional work as an intern, talk about this. Throw something in your objective like, ""Extensive experience promoting company events to the general public during my college internship experience.""
Talk about your general skills that benefit that specific company as well. If you're applying for a position as an auditor, talk about your organizational skills, attention to detail, and strong written communication skills.Bring up relevant accomplishments. If you were salesperson of the year at your last job and are applying for a similar position, include something like, ""Macy's saleswoman of the year 2 years running at the Lancaster, PA location."", Resume buzzwords are great for highlighting your experience in an impressive manner. However, do not simply choose impress sounding words without thought. Make sure the words you pick adequately reflect your accomplishments.


Focus on words that reflect your skill set. If you primarily worked behind the scenes alone, don't call yourself ""people-oriented"" or boast of ""high verbal communication skills."" Instead, talk up your ""great attention to detail and high capacity for self-motivation.""Do not pack too many buzzwords into your objective. This can be overwhelming for readers. Strive to make yourself sound impressive, but do not awkwardly force in multiple 3 or 4 syllable words into each sentence., While it may seem unlikely that a two to three sentence statement would have errors, you would be surprised. Rewording something over and over again can increase the risk of typos. Make sure you proofread your objective before sending out your resume. Have a friend or family look it over to make sure it's typo free.

Balance the cash register.",How to Use a Cash Register," Find a hard, flat surface to set your register on. Ideally, this will be on a countertop with room for customers to place their merchandise. Plug the register directly into an outlet (do not use an extension cord).;
, Batteries provide backup memory for the cash register in case of power failure and should be installed before you program any functions in the cash register. Take off the receipt paper cover and locate the battery compartment. You may need to use a small screwdriver to unscrew the lid to this area. Install the batteries according to the directions on the machine. Put the lid back on the battery compartment.


Some battery compartments are located underneath the receipt paper area.
Change batteries once per year to ensure that they will work properly.

, Take off the cover to the receipt paper compartment. Make sure the end of your paper roll has a straight edge so it will be fed easily into the paper feeder. Feed the paper roll through so that it will run up through the front of the register where you will be able to tear off receipts for customers. Press the FEED button so that the register will catch the receipt and feed it through.

, The till drawer usually has a key that locks it up for safety. Do not lose this key. You can just leave the key in the drawer when it is unlocked so that it is easily found when you need to lock it up.

, Some cash registers have an ON/OFF switch on the back or side of the machine. Others may have a key on the front top of the machine. Turn on the machine, or turn the key to the REG (register) position.


Newer registers may have a MODE button instead of a physical key. Press the MODE button to scroll into a REG or operational mode.

, Most registers have buttons that can be programmed to categorize similar items. These categories, or departments, can also be associated with taxable or non-taxable items. You can also set the date and time.


The program function is usually accessed by either turning the key to PRG or P, or pressing the mode button to PROGRAM. Other registers may have a manual lever underneath the receipt tape cover that needs to be switched to a Program option.
Many cash registers have at least 4 tax buttons. These can be programmed at different tax rates, depending on if you have a flat sales tax as some states in the U.S. do, or if you have other types of taxes, such as GST, PST, or VAT rates (depending on your location).
Follow the specific instructions in your register’s manual to program these functions.

, Many registers will require that you enter a clerk number or other security code to use the register. Clerk numbers are useful so that each sale is attributed to a particular person. This is helpful in tracking sales and clearing up errors.


If you work in a restaurant, you may need to enter your employee code along with the table number and number of customers.Newer cash registers (such as the Square cash register) may require that you log in with an email address and password., Use the number keys to type in the exact amount of the item. Typically you do not need to add a decimal, as cash registers do this for you.


Some registers will use a scanner, rather than asking you to manually enter in item prices. The scanner will read a barcode and enter the product’s information automatically. If this is the case, you won’t need to press the department button in the next step.

, Most registers require that you hit a button after the amount that assigns that item to a category of sale (for instance, clothing, food, etc.).


Department keys can be programmed to be taxable or nontaxable. Consult your machine’s manual for instructions on programming tax rates to correspond with keys.
Looking at the receipt: press arrow or FEED key to have the register feed the receipt upwards so you can read what totals are being recorded on the receipt.
Every item you add on will be added to a running total, which is usually displayed on the cash register reader or screen.

, If an item is on sale, you may need to enter in the percentage discount. Key in the price of the item, hit the department button, key in the discount percentage number (15 for 15% off, for example), and then press the % key. This key is usually in the bank of buttons to the left of the number pad.

, Use the number keys to enter in the exact dollar amount for each remaining item. Be sure to press the corresponding department key after each item is entered.


If you have multiple copies of the same item, press the number of items, then the QTY/X-TIME button, then the price of a single item, and then the department key. For example, if you have 2 books priced at R6.99, press 2, then QTY/X-TIME, then 699, then the department key.

, This button will give the total of the merchandise rung up. It will add any necessary tax that has been pre-programmed into the department buttons.

, Customers may pay in cash, with a credit card, or with a check. You may also accept gift cards or certificates, which are most often treated as cash.



Cash: Type in amount of cash they give you and press CASH/AMT TND button (this is usually the largest wide button on the bottom right hand portion of the register’s set of keys). Many registers will tell you how much change to give the customer. Some do not, however, and you will have to do the math in your head. Once the till drawer pops open, you can place the cash or check in the drawer and count out any necessary change.

Credit card: Press CREDIT button (sometimes CR) and use credit card machine to run the credit card.

Check: Key in the exact amount of the check, press the CK or CHECK button, and put the check in the drawer.
To open the till drawer if you have not made a sale, you can press the NO SALE or NS button. This function may be protected for manager use only and may require that a manager uses a key to put the register in a different mode to access the NO SALE function.

, Always close the cash drawer immediately after you use it so that it is not left hanging open. This could put you at risk for theft.


Always empty out or remove the till drawer at the end of the business day and store it in a secure place.

, If you have mistakenly entered in the wrong price for an item, or a customer decides they do not want to purchase an item after you entered it in, you may need to void the item or sale. This will remove it from the subtotal.


Type in an amount, press department key, press VOID (sometimes VD) button to remove it from the total. You must void an item before entering in a new item. Otherwise, you will need to subtotal the items, then press VOID, then press the exact amount you’d entered by mistake, and press the department key. This will subtract the incorrect amount from the subtotal.
If you need to void the entire sale with multiple items, go through each item and void each one.

, If a customer wants to return an item, you need to account for that in the day’s cash totals before handing back money to the customer. To refund a sale, press the REF key, type in the exact amount of the item, and press the corresponding department key. Hit the subtotal button and then hit the CASH/AMT TND button. The till drawer will open and you can issue a refund to the customer.


Certain buttons and functions such as refunding money can be protected for manager use only. These might require that a manager uses a key to put the register in a different mode to use void or refund.
Check with your supervisor regarding the correct policy for handling returns and refunds.

, Some registers will beep or emit an error sound if keys are pressed in the wrong order or wrong combination. To stop the error sound, press the CLEAR or C key.

, If you have pressed the wrong numbers and have not hit the department button yet, press the CLEAR or C key to clear the numbers you’ve entered. If you already hit the department button, you will need to void the transaction.

, Some managers may want to check the sales totals periodically throughout the day. To read the running totals, turn the register key to X or press the mode button and scroll to the X option. Press the CASH/AMT TND button. Your daily sales totals thus far will print out on a receipt.


It is important to remember that X will read running totals, while Z will reset the daily totals., At minimum, this report will tell you the sales totals for the day. Many cash registers will also report hourly sales, sales by clerk number, sales by department, and other reports. To run these reports, press MODE key and scroll to the Z mode function or turn the key to Z to run report.


Remember that running the Z report will reset the cash register’s totals for the day.

, After running the sales report for the day, count out the money in the cash drawer. If you have checks or credit card receipts, add these into the total. Most credit card processing machines will also run daily total sales reports, so that you can easily reconcile your daily sales totals. Subtract your overall total from the amount of money that you started with before your first transaction of the day.Put all your cash, credit card receipts and checks into a deposit bag and take them to the bank.
Keep a written ledger of the currency, credit card transactions and checks. This will help with your overall accounting.
Replace a base amount of money to the drawer for the start of the next business day. Be sure to store the money in a safe, secure location when your business is not open.

Make sure your objective is free of any of the following common errors:


Being too vague
Longer than 3 sentences
Focusing on your skill set without explaining how its applicable to the advertised positionYou should also avoid cliches. Phrases like ""dynamic self starter with an entrepreneurial spirit"" are both incredibly vague and overused. Avoid phrasing that sounds too familiar. An employer is likely to toss out a career objective that's laden with cliches., You should never send out the same objective for multiple jobs. Always cater your objective based on the skills a job posting is asking for."

Rely on your network.",How to Volunteer to Enhance Your Career," Even if you're volunteering to enhance your career, you should still pick a place that supports a cause you're passionate about. You're much more likely to enjoy the work if you believe in what they're doing.

For example, if you love pets, volunteer at a local shelter. If you're an avid reader, volunteer at your local library. Pick something you love and care about.;
, Usually, the nonprofit will want to meet with you. Be serious, and treat it like an interview. It's also a great time to see the building and meet people. Ask for a tour while you're there, so you can see what goes on behind the scenes. You may find that you love it, or you might decide that it's not the right place for you., Anyone can hand out fliers or serve food, but only you have your specific skill set and experience. Try to find a place where you can put that to good use, as that will help you gain experience and grow your skill set.For instance, if you are into graphic design, volunteer to help an organization redesign its website and informational materials.

, Even if you can't find a volunteer position that perfectly matches your career path, you can still pick something that will grow useful skills. For instance, if you're going into or already are in business, learning how to manage people is important. Pick a position that will enable you to eventually work on management skills., If you don't know where to begin, think about causes you've supported in the past, and see if those organizations need help. You can also ask friends and family for recommendations. Another option is using a volunteer search engine that will match you with appropriate organizations in your area., Actively gain knowledge from other people you're working with by asking questions and asking for help. Also, pay attention to what they're doing and how they're doing it, so you can do it yourself in the future.If you're fresh out of school, you likely don't have the experience you need to get a job. Volunteering can be a great way to get that experience, as long as you pick something that helps grow similar skills.

, Volunteering is a great way to learn new skills. If you take on new projects, you can learn new things along the way. Once you've found an organization that can use your experience, plug in. The great thing about learning new skills is it can benefit you no matter what level you're at, whether you're just starting out in your career or are well established., Networking is just meeting people and connecting with them. So while you're volunteering, spend some time getting to know both the people you're working with and the people you're serving. You never know when a connection could lead to a job or a career advancement.Develop connections as you make them. For instance, when you're getting to know someone, ask if they want to have a drink or get dinner sometime.

, If you've gained new skills through volunteering, don't hide them under a bushel. You don't have to brag about them, but you can bring them up in casual conversation with your boss. That way, they know what skills you are developing, and they may decide to put them to use.For instance, if you worked on software for a nonprofit, you could talk about that when your boss asks what you did over the weekend.
Talking about your volunteering can also be helpful in a company that encourages giving back. By volunteering, you're showing that you care about what the company cares about, and your boss will likely see you as more of a team player., Most hiring committees like to see volunteer experience on your resume, particularly if it's career relevant. If it is career relevant, add a description of what you did so potential employers have a good idea of how your knowledge and experience can benefit their company. Volunteering looks good both when you're starting out and when you're looking for a new position in the same field.Even if you don't use exactly the same skill set, you can still highlight parts of your volunteer experience that will benefit you in a new position. For instance, maybe you had to manage people, which is almost always a useful skill to have., When you're looking for a job, don't be afraid to talk to the people you've built a network with. They may know of the perfect job for you, or they may even be willing to offer you a position themselves.When contacting the person, always remind them of who you are at the beginning of the conversation. You could say, ""Hi, Jerry Roberts here. We volunteer together at Helping Hands.""
After chatting with the person, bring up what you need: ""Well, I'm calling because I'm looking for a new job. Do you happen to know of any that would fit my skill set?""

Boredom, to occupy yourself
Tiredness, to get energy
Stress, to relax;
, Think about the ways in which you can improve the challenge facing you. Some things you can do include:



Eat a larger breakfast: make more sustaining energy food choices;

Choose healthy snacks: over sweet and salty snacks (e.g., celery and carrot sticks, sunflower seeds);

Get more sleep. Go to bed earlier;

Change your work pattern. If you need to have lunch earlier, leave work earlier? Then you probably have to get in earlier too!

Ask for more challenging work tasks, or ask for less challenging work tasks, dependent on what is stoking your stress.

Create a procrastination attacker's plan. To get yourself over the humps of work you'd rather avoid, break it down into smaller chunks and tackle in smaller lots. Reward yourself with breaks rather than snacks.

Drink water, tea, coffee, in place of snacks.
Lock the snacks cabinet/cupboard!

, Sometimes exercise will be a better answer than food at work. Instead of spending 10 minutes snacking, do 10 minutes brisk walking, even in cold weather. It'll wake you up.

,, If you're able to keep yourself hectic you may not even think about snacks. Responsibilities to complete may help keep the mind off lovely goodies.

Negotiate a contract.",How to Unionize Your Workplace," In the United States, unions are a divisive topic. Some laud them as some of the few organizations fighting for the rights of common people, while others decry them as bastions of corruption and laziness. Before trying to unionize, it's important to understand how unions function in an objective way - free of bias either in favor of or against unions.


In a union, the employees at a workplace agree to band together (either on their own or with employees from other workplaces) to collectively negotiate for any number of things - higher wages and better working conditions, for instance. If enough people in the workplace agree to join in a union and the union is made official, the employer is required by law to negotiate a contract with the union, which represents all the workers, rather than with each worker individually, as the employer normally would.
Collectively, workers in a union have greater negotiating power than they do individually. If, for instance, a worker who isn't in a union demands higher wages or better treatment, she or he can often be ignored - the worst-case scenario for the employer is the employee will quit and someone else will have to be hired. If, however, the workers band together in a union and demand better treatment, the employer has to take notice - if all the workers agree to stop working (in an action called a ""strike""), the employer has no way to run the business and is out of luck.
Finally, members of a union have to pay ""dues"" - fees that are used to run the union itself, pay pensions, pay union organizers and lawyers, lobby the government for favorable policy-making, and some use a portion of dues to a ""strike fund"" - money used to pay union members so they'll be able to support themselves during a strike. The amount of money paid as dues varies based on the decision of union members or leadership, depending on how democratically-run your union is. The goal of a union is for increased pay and better working conditions to more than outweigh the cost of membership.;
, Often, the management at a business will try to discourage employees from forming a union, as union workers usually get higher pay and better working conditions than non-union workers. It's important to know your legal rights when it comes to forming a union so you can protect yourself and, if necessary, fight back against any illegal action by your employer.


In the US, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) details the rights of union members as well as would-be union members. Most courts have decided the Section 7 of the NLRA dictates the following legal mandates:Employees may discuss the idea of forming a union and distribute union literature during non-work time and in non-work places - like, for instance, a break room. They may also display their union support through clothing, pins, jewelry, etc.
Employees can ask other employees to sign petitions regarding the formation of a union, specific employment grievances, etc. Employees can also ask employers to recognize these petitions.


Additionally, most courts agree that Section 8 of the NLRA provides the following protections:Employers cannot offer raises, promotions, or other incentives to employees if they agree not to unionize.
Employers cannot close down a work site or otherwise transfer work away from certain employees because of union affiliation.
Employers cannot fire, demote, harass, dock pay from, or otherwise punish employees because of union affiliation.
Finally, employers also cannot threaten to do any of the above acts.



, Because it's difficult for employers to legally discourage unions through direct intervention, many will resort to myths, distortions, and outright lies to dissuade employees from forming or joining a union. If your employer spreads any of the following rumors, recognize that they are inaccurate and inform your fellow workers of this fact:Union dues aren't worth it. In fact, the goal of union dues is to allow negotiation that is more effective so your increased wages and improved work conditions more than counteract the cost of membership. Additionally, its members determine a union’s dues structure, and the members must vote on any changes to it. Dues aren't paid until the union negotiates a contract that's approved by the members.
Union supporters will lose their jobs before they can form a union. It's illegal to fire or punish someone because of his or her union sympathies.
By joining a union, you'll lose the benefits you have now. It's illegal for employers to withdraw benefits because of employees' union sympathies. Besides this, your current wages and benefits stay in effect until the members of the union (that includes you) decide on a different contract.
You'll lose everything when you're forced to go on strike. Despite the popular misconception, strikes are exceedingly rare. The OPEIU (Office & Professional Employees International Union) reports that only about 1% of contract negotiations result in a strike. Additionally, if you join a larger union, rather than organizing your own, you'll likely have access to a strike fund, from which you'll be paid during the strike.
Unions are unfair to employers or take advantage of employers' kindness. The goal of a union is to negotiate an agreement between the employer and the employees - not to rob the employer or drive him or her out of business. No employment contract comes into effect until both parties agree to it. Finally, if an employer doesn't pay a reasonable wage for an employee's work and see to it that working conditions are safe and reasonable, the employer is actively doing the employee a disservice by robbing him or her of the opportunity cost of his or her time, to say nothing of his or her wellbeing.

, When it comes time to unionize, you can legally form your own independent union with members only from your workplace. This is a valid, reasonable option. However, employees at many workplaces prefer instead to join a larger union, which, owing to the fact that it has more members, will have greater resources at its disposal when it comes to representation and negotiation. You can search a complete list of unions in the U.S. at http://www.unions.org/. Additionally, local unions are usually listed in the yellow pages or other business directories under ""labor organizations.""Don't be intimidated by unions' names - unions that originally represented employees of one profession now represent many different types of professions. It's not unusual, for instance, for office workers to be a members of the United Auto Workers. Below are just a few examples of active unions in the US:

Driving and delivery (Teamsters - IBT)
Structural steel erection (Iron Workers - IABSORIW)
Electrical / Communications (Electrical Workers - IBEW / Communications Workers - CWA).
The Steelworkers Union (USW) is a good example of a multi-trade union. It counts members in the fields of nursing, police, fire, general factory, and more, but, to be clear, not all the workers in these jobs that join unions have chosen the Steelworkers., If you can, call the local union office directly - if you can't, contact the national or international office to be put in contact with the local office. Even if the union isn't interested in representing you, they may be able to recommend you to another union that is or may provide free resources to you.


Reasons why a union may not want to represent you may include the fact that your workforce is too small or that you're involved with an industry the union isn't comfortable with or isn't qualified to represent.

, If the union is interested in representing you, it is likely that you'll be put in contact with a member of the local union’s organizing committee. Different unions may employ different methods of organizing based on type of work and employer. Working with the local organizers allows you to access seasoned union personnel who have experience organizing unions and negotiating fair contracts. Many, but not all aspiring union members find this to be the best way to organize their workplace.


Provide as much information as possible. Most unions will be interested in knowing how many people work at your workplace, where they work, types of work performed and the current wage and benefit levels. Unions will also want to know specific grievances you have with your employer - for instance, pay inequality, unsafe conditions, or discrimination, so have these complaints ready.

, To put it bluntly, most employers welcome a union like the plague. This is because it will likely cost the employer more to have a unionized work force due to the increased costs of labor and benefits associated with it. These additional costs can reduce the amount of profit the employer enjoys, meaning there may be less for them to keep. Some employers will stop at nothing to prevent this from happening; some will even resort to illegal tactics. Be prepared for animosity both from your employer and from their close confidants. Experienced union organizers can tell you exactly what to expect.


One good rule is to be especially careful not to ""mess up"" on the job in any way. In other words, your employer can't legally fire or punish you for trying to form a union, but if you give them any other reason to, they may jump at the opportunity.
Remember that, if the organizing drive is successful, the employer will no longer be able to dictate the terms of employment, but will be obligated by law to negotiate in good faith with your union representatives. Also remember that, while the employer may try to fight unionization efforts, s/he cannot legally penalize you for trying to start a union, even if you're unsuccessful, provided you follow the law as outlined in the NLRA (see section 1).

, For a union to have a chance of forming, the majority of workers in your workplace will need to support it. Talk to your fellow workers - are many of them unhappy with their treatment or pay? Do any of them have reason to suspect unfairness, favoritism, or discrimination? Have many been left in dire financial straits due to cancelled benefits, etc? If most of your fellow workers seem discontented, you may have a good chance of forming a union.


However, be careful where and to whom you raise the prospect of unionizing. Members of your company's management naturally have a stake in the status quo - they stand to make less money if their employees unionize. Also beware of any ""favorite"" employees or people who have close relationships to the management, as these people may not keep your secret. At first, try to involve only people who you know and trust.

, Research your industry - are there other workers in your industry (or employed by your competitors) who are unionized? Who are your strongest allies in the workplace? Who is willing to help you in your efforts to organize? Are there any local politicians or community figures who are sympathetic to your cause? Organizing a union is hard work - not only will you have to organize the union itself, but you may also need to take part in rallies and community outreach efforts. The more friends and resources you can secure early on, the greater chance you have of succeeding.


As you gather allies and ammunition for your unionization effort, try to remain discrete. The farther you can get without your management learning about your plans to unionize, the better.

, If your union is to succeed, it needs not just the broad support of the workers in your workplace, but also a strong sense of direction provided by determined leaders. Meet with the people who have pledged their support, and, if you've appealed to a larger union, their representatives (again, you may want to do this discretely so as not to notify the management at your workplace). Decide upon a coalition of the most dedicated union supporters - in the early stages of union formation, these people will act as the leaders of the organization movement, motivating employees to take action and spearheading efforts to gain support.

, Next, you'll want to be able to show strong, broad support for you union to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), a neutral governmental agency. This usually means getting as many workers in your workplace as possible to sign special forms called ""authorization cards"" declaring their desire to be represented by a union. To get the NLRB to hold an anonymous election to determine whether your workplace will unionize, you'll need 30% of the workers to sign such cards.


Note - these authorization cards must specify that, by signing, a worker is declaring his or her intention to be represented by a union. If the card says only that, by signing, the worker is declaring his or her support for a vote on the matter of unionization, they're not valid.
Often, to garner support, organizing committees will throw rallies, host speakers, and distribute literature to educate workers about their rights and encourage union membership. Consider these tactics to increase support for your union.

, When you get at least 30% of the workers to pledge their unionization support, you can file a petition with the NLRB to hold an official election in your workplace. When it receives the petition, the NLRB will investigate to ensure the union support is genuine and wasn't coerced. If it finds that it is, the NLRB will negotiate with your employer and with your fledgling union to schedule an election. This election usually takes place at your workplace, and can take place at multiple times to ensure workers from all shifts get a chance to vote.


Note that your employer can, and often will, challenge the legitimacy of your petition and/or worker support as demonstrated by authorization cards.
Note also that this process is very complicated and the procedure in these steps are simplified. Contact the NLRB for exact, specific rules, which may vary based on your employer and state.

, If your union wins the election, it becomes officially recognized by the NLRB. At this point, your employer must negotiate a collective contract with your union by law. During your negotiations, you'll be able to address specific workplace grievances, try to introduce new working arrangements, fight for greater pay, and more. The specifics of your contract are up to your union leadership, your employer, and, of course, you, as contracts have to approved by a union vote before they go into effect.


Note that, while unions allow you to negotiate collectively, they don't guarantee your offer will be accepted by your employer. Remember that negotiation is a back-and-forth process - you may not get exactly what you want. However, rest assured that, on average, union workers make about 30% more than their non-union counterparts."

Understand the definition and purpose of a CV and a resume.,
Know when to use a CV and a resume.,
Understand that CVs and resumes have different levels of detail.,
Know that resumes and CVs are usually different lengths.,
Keep in mind that the style of writing will differ.,
Keep CVs detailed and resumes strictly relevant.",How to Understand the Difference Between a Resume and a CV1," Understanding the meanings of each word can help in defining the purpose of these similar, yet different documents.


""CV"" stands for curriculum vitae and is a Latin phrase meaning “course of life”. As the definition implies, it is a detailed account of your entire professional life thus far and will include as much information as possible, to give a full understanding of what you have accomplished.
The word “resume” has French origins and means “to sum up”. As with any summary, a resume is a shorter, more concise description of your professional career as it relates to the job you are applying for. Resumes are meant to be briefly looked over to get a general understanding of your capability. Make yourself stand out by showing them everything they would want to read and eliminating information they will not care about.;
, Knowing when to use a true CV versus a resume can be tough because many people use these terms synonymously. However, with a little information, you can decide which type of document to submit for the job you want to apply to:



CV - Use a CV when it is either directly requested by the employer, when you are applying to a position in a country that uses CVs (throughout Europe, Asia, Africa and Middle East) or when you are applying in the US and Canada for jobs in the scientific, research, academia or medical fields.

Resume - Use a resume when you are applying for jobs in the US and Canada (other than fields listed above requiring CVs) and other countries that choose to accept a resume over a CV. You can research the job application requirements for each country before submitting your application.

, CVs are more detailed than resumes. In accordance with the definition of a CV, more detail is required to inform employers of your entire history. On the other hand, a resume is a summary. While it still must provide details about your experience and education, it must be written in a concise manner with only the most relevant information presented.


For a CV, details in a CV can include exact names of courses taken while obtaining a degree, all your publications, and details about specific projects and their outcomes.
For a resume, you can choose which information is most relevant to include by reading through and understanding the job positing for the position you are seeking and then looking over your resume while asking yourself, “Is this information or experience necessary to do the job?” If the answer is “no” chances are the recruiter won’t care and you should leave it off your resume.

, With different levels of detail comes different lengths. CVs are not bound by length and can even go beyond 10 pages because they include far more sections than a resume (publications, research projects, education courses, etc.) and more details about each job task or project. Resumes, as with any summary, must be kept short and sweet while still being effective.


While there is much controversy on how short a resume should be, let’s not define the number of pages, but say it is best to keep it as short as possible while still providing all the necessary information to help you get an interview.
This means understanding the type of person the company you are applying to is looking for and only keeping information in your resume that will help you market yourself as the right person for that job.

, The sentences in CVs can be written in a more detailed and complex manner. Resumes on the other hand are most effective when written in short and effective sentencing using action words.


For example, in a a resume you could write “Increased efficiency by 25% by implementing new process procedures”.
However, in a CV you could write “Tasked with finding inefficiencies within the department to resolve and implement new process procedures. Researched and implemented new procedures over a 6 month time frame to eventually realize a 25% increase in efficiency.
These two sentences describe the same thing, but you can see how a CV would explain the situation more than a resume which focuses on what you did and the results in a brief summary.

, As mentioned previously, CVs provide the reader with the most details about your experience and education. To some extent, these details may not be exactly relevant to the job you are applying for. A resume must be limited to strictly relevant information that will help you get the job, so it is best to write your resume in a clear and concise manner that showcases why you are the best candidate for the job in the least amount of words possible.


For example, listing all your publications versus only the ones that are most eye-catching to that employer.

Make sure to include all relevant educational information.,
Provide details of your experience.,
Include creative work, publications, and presentations to provide a well-rounded picture of your academic career.,
Include supplemental information.",How to Understand the Difference Between a Resume and a CV2," This can include name, address, phone number, and email. Before applying to different countries, check personal information requirements as they may vary.


For example, you may need to provide your marital status, national origin or picture.

, You can choose to provide course names and GPA in addition to the degree, institution and dates attended. On a resume, this would be the most educational information ever needed, but on a CV you can include more, such as:



Dissertation or thesis. Describe your work and research along with names of advisors.

Awards, honors, fellowships, scholarships and grants. Provide details of each of these types of honors including what you did to achieve them.

Special training and certifications. List names, dates and institutions for training and certifications not associated with your formal education.

Academic service. This includes committees and clubs you contributed to in your university.

, You can choose to list them all chronologically or break them down into subsections such as “Academic projects”, “Field Experience”, “Research”, etc. While listing, include name of company, title, dates of employment and all tasks, projects and special accomplishments.

, List all publications and works you have either written yourself or contributed to. Add all presentations and public speaking engagements including topic, institution or event, and date. When listing, provide all authors’ names, title, journal, inclusive pages, and year.


Do not add any works that have not been accepted or were just submitted.

, Since you have almost unlimited space on a CV, include any supplemental information that paints a picture of your professional or academic life. Any additional information that could catch the ye of a recruiter or hiring manager should be included.



Memberships or professional affiliations. Any affiliations outside of a university, preferably those that are nationally or internationally recognized.

Community service/volunteerism. Show what you do in your spare time and how you choose to give back to your community.

Languages. List all languages and your proficiency in each.

References. Provide name, title, company and contact information.

Don’t short change yourself when writing your resume.",How to Understand the Difference Between a Resume and a CV3," This can include name, address, phone number, and email. Before applying to different countries, check personal information requirements as they may vary.


For example, you may need to provide your marital status, national origin or picture.

, Distinguish which position you are seeking and your intention to prove your qualifications. This will allow the recruiter to immediately know what position you are seeking.


Many large companies get a variety of applicants for every position, and they may have multiple positions open at the same time.
Providing the title of the position you are seeking will help make sure your resume gets filed in the appropriate places.

, This section is a very brief, 3 to 5 sentence paragraph that highlights your skills, experience and accomplishments as it relates to the job. Summary statements are a good way to provide the hiring individual with an idea of why you would be a good fit for the job, without requiring them to analyze your resume too deeply.

, List all relevant skills that you have and are required to do the job successfully. Listing all of these skills will enable you to sell yourself well to a potential employer, providing them with an easy to read list of your talents.


For example, Marketing Strategy, SEO, Problem Solving, Negotiations, Verbal and Nonverbal Communication Skills.

, Provide the company name, title, years of employment, and brief descriptions of tasks and accomplishments for each job held up to the last 10 years. Write each task using action verbs such as “trained” or “evaluated” followed by a brief description of what was done and what the results were.


For example, “Developed business relationships across southeast territory to increase sales by 30% in 6 months”.

, List all relevant education, training and certifications that will be helpful for you to get the job. These qualifications can be critical, depending on the industry you want to work in.


For example, if you are applying for a nursing position, list your bachelor’s degree and any certifications such as CPR. Being certified in project management (PMP) would not be relevant in this case and should not be listed in your resume.

, You can choose to include additional sections such as, significant honors and awards, memberships or professional affiliations, community service/volunteerism roles and/or language skills. As mentioned previously, you can find out if any of these sections are relevant enough to add to your resume by reviewing the job description and understanding what is truly valued by the employer.


For example, if you are applying for a role at a nonprofit organization, they may be more interested to see what community service and volunteer organizations you are involved with as opposed to a for-profit organization.

, There are many misconceptions regarding the length of a resume and what it should entail. To keep it simple, if the information is relevant to the job you are applying for (if it is in the requirements or qualifications section of the job posting) add it to your resume.


For example, as mentioned previously, a list of languages is typically written in a CV but not in a resume. However, if you are fluent in Japanese and you know the position you are applying to will have contacts in Japan, you should list your Japanese language skills in your resume.

Let everybody think that you are fond of the job you are performing by showing maximum initiative and creativity, when completing assignments you receive. Do little things to make the day more enjoyable, such as listening to music while you work.;
, However, if you are a direct person, try to smile more to your colleagues and think 5 times before you snap back. Nobody likes unhappy people and will not like to listen to your problems or come to your office just to see your serious and gloomy face.

, Try to put together a list of positive sides of your job, company, employer, and staff. While doing so, keep your mind focused on positive; remember some funny stories that have happened to you recently. This will help to concentrate your thoughts and make them positive.

, If you failed to find any positive sides, you could try to use your imagination in full and make up some positive things or even act to make changes. For instance, take one negative thing - a constant bad smell in the office. You could interpret this fact in your head, as, ""It does smell bad. But I'll buy those little funny smell improvers and hang them all over the place and encourage people to open windows more often.” And after all the actions are implemented, you will feel like a hero, who has just saved the planet and therefore you'd come to realise what a silly thing it'd have been to have left such a comfortable place like the one you have just created.

, Whenever you feel like crying, find a calculator, and work out the salary, which you will receive soon and think of shopping, visiting, going to the theatre or dancing.

, Find a task you will enjoy doing (or if not a task - an online magazine or newspaper you have always enjoyed reading). In addition, whenever you have a bad mood, or something wrong has again occurred to you at work - just keep yourself busy with what you enjoy. This is how you could distract and focus on spelling, vocabulary and other more enjoyable or enriching things.

, Imagine your colleagues in funny situations (this works with bosses), and laugh at it when you are alone remembering about them. Laughing will make you happier.

, If you are asked to complete an unwanted task, suggest an alternative way. If it is not approved, act like you were instructed. At the end, everything will happen as you had warned. Just keep this case in mind and wait for the next stupid task to follow. When it arrives, remind politely about the previous case.

, Try to go out for a lunch break, so you would feel the freedom, breathe the fresh air, and stay for a couple of minutes away from the working place.

, Find people you can at least talk to, or ask for advice in the organization, but do it with utmost care having all your wits about you. This does help a lot, when you need support and understanding. If the place is not so perfect, there will be many people supporting you because they have already gone through the same. However, do not rely on them and filter what you say in public. To be on the safe side, be a bit vague, so you will always find a way out.

, Just spend your time filling in application forms and sending out CVs. This will improve your mood greatly by distracting you and giving you something to look forward to and by increasing your chances of finding a better job.

, Put on stylish clothes and spare some of your morning time for make up and a perfect hairdo. A person makes a place, not a place makes a person.

, How long will I be able to stay here? Mark a date on your calendar, when you will leave, if nothing changes. After all, you will be able to see if you are strong enough to overcome the difficulties.

, If the money you get at this place is not the only source of income in your family, if you feel the job is no good for you and you will not reach your personal and career goals being employed by the company, look for another job and leave. You can also leave straight away. Nevertheless, be sensible; there might be some money involved whether you do things one way or another. Ask for advice before taking such a drastic step.

When you get your first assignment, it is important to be prepared, be sure to write down the following and take it with you to work:


Where will you be working?",How to Succeed As a Temporary Employee," You never know what might be useful in a given position and it pays to be thorough.;
, You want to show off your strengths, but also highlight your different experiences. This way, your agent can sell you to the maximum number of clients.

, Ask yourself:


Full-time or part-time?
How far are you willing to travel for work?
What is the minimum hourly pay you'll accept?
How much advance notice do you need?

, Typically, it is best to work with multiple agencies. This way, if one does not have an assignment for you, another might. Later you might decide to work mostly or exclusively with one agency - if they are providing you with consistent work and you have a good relationship with your agent. Some good agencies are:


Kelly Services (An excellent international agency, Kelly Services often has multiple offices in large metro-areas to serve different needs - everything from law to technical to office.)
Express Personnel (You can find Express in both the large metro areas and the smaller cities. The agencies tend to adapt to serve the primary clients of the area - so in rural areas, you'll find that they have more manual labor oriented jobs and in metros they'll have a find array, from manual labor to corporate.
Robert Half (This is a little more exclusive agency. You'll find they have specific divisions such as Robert Half Technologies & Robert Half Creative. They cater more to those who are already trained and are looking for new or contract positions in their field.)
Manpower (Manpower is much more on the manual labor side of things. You'll find jobs with construction companies and other industrial types are the general norm.)
Westaff (Westaff is an international agency and is the best choice if you are looking to receive care and consistency with your staffing provider. They also have a tendency to have higher-paying positions. Westaff specializes in clerical, industrial, and many other types of staffing. They have positions that are strictly temporary, temp to hire, and permanent placements.)
There are many others, both large corporations & small businesses. If you're calling an unfamiliar agency, be sure to ask them what type of positions they generally place people in. You can also ask them if they can tell you some of their big clients, to get a general sense of what kind of jobs they might be offering you. Be aware that the ""big client"" can vary greatly between offices in the same company. If you're looking for a specific type of job and the agency you're talking to doesn't seem to have it - don't hesitate to ask.

, Be sure to leave 3-4 hours for these interviews, as the agency will often want to test your skills to get an idea of your levels for various tasks.

, This will save you time once you get to the agency and will make you seem even more prepared and professional.
Be sure to have a complete employment history printed out that you can copy. You'll need addresses and telephone for your previous places of employment and telephone numbers and/or e-mail addresses for your supervisors, references, etc.
Dress for a professional interview. If you don't look the part, you will not get the job.

, Most agencies expect their employees to call them at the beginning of every week to let them know your current availability, especially if you're not on assignment.

, Confirm the address, reading it back to your agent.
Who will you be reporting to?
What is the dress code?
What will your hours be?

, There are commonly 2 problems groups, the people who talk negatively about work and the people who are just negative about everything in their life. If you are unsure of how to broach the subject of their unhealthy negativity, simply say, ""I need to focus on work now, let's have drinks or lunch soon to catch up.""


If your good friends are negative, then make sure to control their effect on you. One negative session is better than allowing people to visit your desk or email about their problems during the work day.

, Even if your job allows you to surf the Internet at your leisure, most of the Facebook posts are either distracting or sensational, draining your energy. You will have a harder time getting back on the phone, if you allow this to be your main interaction with other people during the day.

, Most everyone, and not just sales people, need to get their blood moving more than they do in an office environment. Take the stairs, walk around every 30 minutes to 1 hour and take a longer walk at lunch and you will have a fresh perspective when you return.

, Sales environments often encourage drinking as a stress-relief activity. However, you are more likely to become negative about work and feel tired and unmotivated the next day.

, If a sale falls through, don't bad-mouth the company; make it your goal to move past it to a new opportunity. Avoid saying the word ""hate,"" or similar words and you may start to feel more positive about the sales process.

, Remember that salespeople often have better chances for income growth, better social skills, excellent opportunities for advancement and regular incentives. Remind yourself about the positive aspects of your chosen trade regularly.

, Athletic trainers recommend that athletes do periods of hard work followed by periods of lower intensity. Take a cue from this and schedule an hour for cold calling, followed by an hour of admin.


Stick to your schedule, with at least 4 periods of intense activity per day. It is better to devote 1 hour to calling, 1 hour to emails, 1 hour for cold calling, 1 hour for research, etc. than it is to mix all of those activities. Studies have shown that multitasking results in lower levels of performance for many people.

If your company is unwilling to make incentives, or you are the only person on the sales staff, challenge someone else in the company to a competition. Place a personal bet, such as a dinner or chores, to add motivation to your day.

, Give yourself consequences and rewards. For example, if you make this season's quota, you will book a vacation, but if you do not, you must walk the flight of stairs to your office 6 times per day for 1 month.

Don't feel guilty for taking a few minutes to yourself.",How to Speed up Your Work Day," Sometimes it's not that work is terrible or terribly slow, it's just that our heads aren't in it. To make sure you start out the day with energy to power through the seconds, start with a healthy breakfast. Ditch the doughnut that will give you the sugar crash before noon and go for something protein packed, like eggs, lean meat, and whole grain bread. That morning will go by much faster when you don't have to slog through it.


Try to stay away from too much caffeine, as well. Your morning cup of joe is fine, but three cups of coffee later you could be asking for trouble come the afternoon or at night. Not sleeping is a definite way to make the work day trudge by.;
, If you have a desk job from 9-5, the time will not pass by quickly if it physically pains you to sit at your computer. The more comfortable you are; the better you'll feel, the more you'll be able to work, and the less you'll feel inclined to just tell your boss you're going home. When your body is happy, your mind is happy too.


Though an ergonomic chair and desk is a good idea, that's shoveling out money you don't necessarily have to shovel out. Aim to sit up straight and have your computer at the right height for your arms and wrists. That's half the battle won right there.

, There could be one giant reason the time isn't flying by: you have no coworkers to distract you with. Humans naturally are social creatures and exchanging a witty comment or two with those around you can make the clock tick by faster, improve your morale, and give you that boost to get your work done even faster. How could your boss argue with that?


Not convinced this is worth it? Recent studies have shown that if you're friends with your coworkers, you may live longer.The truth is that those who are happier and more relaxed (and coworkers determine a chunk of this) are healthier in general. So if you don't want to laugh at Rich's joke just for the sake of being friendly, at least do it for your health.

, Work being just work is a recipe for disaster. You'll burn yourself out in no time (though it will feel like years). We all need a few things throughout the day to look forward to or just to mix things up. This could be something as simple as a cup of tea at 3 PM or a walk around the building at 11 AM.


Cultivate some 'stress buster' techniques. These are not only great for your physical health, but also, great for your mental health; your morale gets uplifted, you relax, time flies by, and you end up resenting work a little less. Just make sure you're choosing positive routines, not trash talking your coworkers or scarfing down a bowl of sugar.

, You know those people that are super charged at work and probably all the time? They're probably not only bursting with positivism at work; it's a lifestyle choice they've made. To be at your best at work, you've gotta be your best at home, too. That means eating healthy, exercising, relaxing, and getting enough sleep. If you don't take care of yourself, it's going to become all too clear why they call it ""work.""


In fact, a recent study equated not getting enough sleep to being drunk on the job.Can you imagine how slowly the seconds would tick by if you had to spend the next 8 hours feeling drunk and yet still working?

, Though it may sound a bit cheesy, a lot of how we think about time and work is our mindset. If you're thinking to yourself, ""This is the 35,098,509th sandwich I've had to make today,"" work is going to stink. Those seconds will feel like they're ticking through molasses in January. But instead, imagine thinking, ""This is the 35,098,509th person I've fed today."" Way better, huh?


Though it'll take definite focus and concentration, think about the good you're doing, and the good job you're doing; take pride in your work. Even if it's on a minuscule scale, your work matters. It matters to someone, even if that person's not you. With a more positive attitude, that clock can be on your side.

, There's a reason the term ""go postal"" exists. A while back, there were a series of murders by postal workers. One of the arguments is that the monotony of the job caused the workers to ""go postal."" Why is this a factor? Everyone needs goals and something to work toward. If you're making your umpteenth sandwich or delivering your umpteenth piece of mail, it's easy to feel like you're floundering, getting nothing done. Your boss may not give goals to you, but you can make them. What's your goal for the day?


If it's easiest, just think for today. Once you get the hang of it, set a goal for the week. This can give you drive to get things done. And the more you get things done and are kept busy and distracted, the more quickly time will pass.

, In your job, you probably have a series of duties you have to complete. More than likely there are some you like and some you don't. There might even be some you dread. Do yourself a favor and ask your boss if you can concentrate on the tasks you enjoy. Time will go by much more effortlessly when you're having a bit more fun.


This is good for your boss, too. A happier worker who enjoys what he or she is doing gets more done and is more likely to stick around for the long-term, too.

, You may think it's slacking, but it's just the opposite: taking breaks can up your brain's ability to focus and get more done.If your boss gives you guff, show him the light with scientific data. It says that humans perform best when given a 5 or 10 minute break around every hour. Your brain needs that time to recharge; why not take it?


If you sit during the day, make sure to get up and moving during your break. Go to the bathroom, visit the watercooler, or just stretch. It'll get your blood flowing, and your blood flowing to your brain, too.

, At the beginning of each day, make a to-do list. Write down which tasks are hard and which ones are easy. Once that's done, think about your body. When are you the most energetic and when do you wish you could just take a nap? Aim to do the hard tasks at your peak and the easy tasks when you're just dying to go home. With this method, time will be more on your side.


This will be different for everyone. Some people need 4 hours to really wake up, while others start out energized and it's all downhill from there. Only you know when you are at your best.

, If you can, listen to music while you work to help keep yourself distracted and pass the time more quickly. This will also help you engage more parts of your brain. Just make sure you're listening to music that matches the mood; too slow and it might lull you to sleep.


Every person has their own get-jazzed kind of music. Do some experimenting with Internet radio; you may find that in-the-zone-work-music is different than the music you prefer to listen to in your free time.

, If possible, get out of the office. Take a short walk or drive to get food, and eat out instead of in the conference room. Getting others to come with you is another good idea. That long, social break may be what you need to power through the afternoon.


Avoid going to the bathroom or doing other things that can be done before/after your lunch in order to get the most time out of your lunch.
Try going to a new place for lunch every once in a while, and recruit co-workers. This way there is something to look forward to during the morning.

, A cluttered area is a cluttered mind. A cluttered mind leads to slower and poorer decision making. Take five minutes to just organize whatever's at your desk or in your space. When it's cleaner, you've not only killed a bit of time, but you've also made it easier to breathe.


On a slow day, it's all about keeping yourself busy. If you don't have your own area to clean, consider organizing a community area. How could your boss say no?

, When we get home from work, it's all too easy to plop down in front of the TV for hours on end and go on autopilot. This is great in theory, but then when work rolls around the next morning, it's like it never happened. This is even worse when it takes up your entire weekend. In your downtime at work, make a plan. If your boss asks, you're just practicing time management.


This not only keeps you busy now, but it gives you something to look forward to. And then when that time does roll around, it'll be time well-spent. You'll be recharged and work won't seem so bad since you had quality time off., If it's a slow day at work, you may just need another new task to take care of. And the fact that it's new will make the time go by much faster. Ask your boss if you can go get everyone lunch or take care of the inside of the microwave that everyone knows about but no one acknowledges openly.


If you're feeling particularly ambitious, start on a project that isn't due for a while. That way when the time comes, that day in the future will go by much faster. You're using right now to take care of future you, which is a win-win.

, There's tons of scientific data that say breaks are good for you and for your work performance. In fact, just a two-minutes break can increase your productivity by 11%. It can literally keep you on schedule.So don't feel guilty about taking a second to browse Facebook, check your email, or send that text or Tweet. In the long run, it'll make you perform better.


Just make sure it doesn't start to negatively affect your performance. A few minutes on Facebook is good, but an hour is not. Breaks are only breaks when they're sandwiched between periods of working hours!

Schedule 2 to 4 email sessions per day.,
Work on marketing daily.",How to Spend Your Workday as a Commercial Lines Insurance Broker," Note any meetings or phone calls you have scheduled for the day. These appointment-based tasks form the backbone of an insurance broker's business, and take maximum priority over other scheduled items.;
, Do not include drive time or other preparations in this window. Your livelihood rests on how well prepared you are.


The bulk of your appointments will be with either commercial insurance providers, potential clients or existing clients. Each requires a different kind of preparation, but all require extensive prep.

, As an insurance broker, it's your business to stay ahead -- or at least abreast -- of what's going on.


This is especially important in the current economic climate. The 2010 Health Care Reform Act mandated many changes, and has created a climate of aggressive change, in health insurance and insurance in general.

, If you do only 1, you might miss opportunities, but more than 4 sessions per day results in wasted time that won't enrich your career or your bottom line.

, This could be organizing or contacting your renewal or lapsed customer list, reviewing an advertising campaign or writing an entry into your blog. If you have to miss a day because it's packed with actual customers, that's fine -- so long as your habit of daily marketing provides a good stream of new customers.


Some brokers devote a set time -- say, 20 daily minutes -- toward marketing. Others use an ""acts of marketing"" model, where they commit to 1, 2 or more specific actions intended to bring in new customers.

Search for yourself.,
Check your social network.,
Evaluate your privacy settings.,
Create a new image for yourself online.",How to Sanitize Your Web Presence Before Applying for a Job," Instead of just looking in the “usual” places (such as your Facebook profile), find out what appears when you do an Internet search for your name.


Look under “everything” first. Try several search engines, but consider looking for “everything” which includes all web sites, news articles, images, videos, blogs and reviews. You may have no idea that a friend snapped an “incriminating” photo of you during that crazy drunken night and somehow it ends up online.
Check for your name under other aliases. Especially if you have changed your name after getting married or if you have a nickname, make sure you leave no stone unturned. Conduct the same search as you did under your proper name to ensure you’ve covered your basis.
Seek out reviews. If you provide any type of service there’s a good chance someone has written a review about the work you’ve done. Consider Yelp, Google Groups, Urban Spoon (if you work in the food industry) or possible industry based forums. While there may be nothing you can do about negative comments, you can add positive entries under another alias to hopefully offset anything negative.;
, After you’ve explored the “unknown” by searching for yourself, check your “known” aspect and dig deeply into what you’ve done on social networks.


Stop by your Facebook and Twitter profile to examine comments and photos. This may mean that you have to go back into your history to ensure nothing terrible was written about you or that you didn't write something highly inappropriate. Follow links to friend’s pages where you commented in addition to reviewing your “info” page. You want to make sure that your presence would be appealing and acceptable to anyone who reads it. That means no religion, politics or inappropriate comments (basically anything that would be considered to be inappropriate for a child to read should be removed).
Visit friends or family member profiles who may have tagged or referenced you in posts. Unfortunately its not just what you’ve posted, but what others have posted about you too. It may be an arduous process, but go through your friend list and conduct a quick check of your friend’s profiles and search for any references (visual or verbal) about you. If you find a detrimental comment or image, send your friend a private message and ask if that comment could be removed. Let the friend know why so he/she understands the importance.
Consider “check ins” as possible problems. If your friend recently “checked in” at the local strip club and said he/she was with you that could be a problem to a potential employer.

, Don’t allow your pages to be accessible to everyone on the social network. Carefully review your settings and all privacy controls.


Don’t allow others to see your friend lists. People can glean a lot of knowledge about who you are based on your friends. If you have some immature or inappropriate friends on your friend list, you may not want potential employers seeing this. Block the ability for others to view your friend list to eliminate that problem.
Only share photos and comments with a certain group of people. Enact full controls on photos and only allow for family friendly photos to be viewed by all.
Only allow friends or family members to see any activity on your profile. If you enact full privacy settings, outsiders should not be able to see activity on your profile.

, Once you’ve sanitized what was on the Internet, it’s time to build a new image that employers will appreciate and will add credibility to your interview.


Be proactive with sites like LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a well traveled site for many employers and human resources professionals. Be sure you upload your resume and include new kudos or accolades to your LinkedIn profile. Consider this network to be your online portfolio and invest time into making your profile outstanding.
Consider “re-doing” your Facebook or Twitter profile. If your Facebook or Twitter accounts are a mess, consider closing your pages and re-opening a new account. Starting fresh will also give your prospective employer little to go on and see you as you’d like them to see you--a professional.
Evaluate your friends or network. Be cautious about who you “friend” or “follow” when it comes to making an impression on a potential employer. If your immature cousin insists on making jokes about boogers on your page you may want to leave him off your list.

Understand Supply and Demand.,
Know how to calculate Price Elasticity.,
Know how to calculate Marginal Revenue.,
Be able to find Marginal Revenue Product.,
Understand the financial definition of Equity.,
Know how to define Debt.",How to Review Basic Economics for a Consulting Interview," The law of supply and demand defines the effect that the availability of a particular product and the desire (or demand) for that product have on price. Generally, if there is a low supply and a high demand, the price will be high. In contrast, the greater the supply and the lower the demand, the lower the price will be.;
, Price Elasticity measures the effect of a product price change on the quantity demanded of the product. It is calculated as: % Change in Quantity Demanded / % Change in Price.

, Marginal Revenue is the increase in revenue that results from the sale of one additional unit of output. It is calculated by dividing the change in total revenue by the change in output quantity. While marginal revenue can remain constant over a certain level of output, it follows the law of diminishing returns and will eventually slow down as the output level increases.



Law of diminishing marginal returns: There is a set number of employees needed to maximize output. In other words, at some point any additional employee hired will produce less output than the previous employee hired. After this, the amount of output will decrease as the number of employees increases. , Marginal Revenue Product is the change in revenue that results from the addition of one extra unit, provided that all other factors are kept equal. It is used in marginal analysis to examine the effect of variable outputs, such as labor, and follows the law of diminishing marginal returns. As the number of units of a variable input increase, the revenue generated by each additional unit decreases at a certain point. It is calculated by taking the marginal product of labor and multiplying it by the marginal revenue of a firm.

, Think of equity as ownership in any asset after all associated debts are paid off. For example, a house with no outstanding debt is considered the owner's equity because he or she can readily sell the time for cash. Stocks are equity because they represent ownership in a company.

, Debt is an amount of money borrowed by one party from another. Many corporations/individuals use debt as a method for making large purchases that they could not afford under normal circumstances. A debt arrangement gives the borrowing party permission to borrow money under the condition that it is to be paid back at a later date, usually with interest.

Determine how many laborers you need.,
Check labor laws for minimum pay.,
Settle on a rate of pay.,
Use a temp agency.,
Look for community day laborer programs.,
Communicate with employees.,
Be flexible.,
Know your laborers' rights.,
Pay in cash.,
Keep written records.,
Fill out an I-9 form.",How to Pay a Day Laborer," Depending on the work you need done and how quickly you want it to be finished, you may find yourself needing more than one laborer. This is important to consider because it may influence the pay rate you are willing to offer.


If your project requires lots of heavy lifting and/or moving large items, hire at least two workers. This will make the work go faster and will prevent a single laborer from becoming exhausted.
Try to figure out what your total cost will be for hiring one versus several day laborers for your project. You will have to estimate the time required to complete the job, but this will help you decide how to proceed.;
, Even though day laborers are usually not members of employee organizations or unions, you are still bound by federal, state, and local laws to offer them fair pay and working conditions. Check the Department of Labor website(for the U.S.) in order to make sure your pay rate meets or exceeds the national minimum wage.


Keep in mind that you must pay a day laborer for the work he does, whether you approved of it or not. Failing to do so is a violation of federal labor laws.If training or extensive travel is required for the day laborer to complete the job, legally you must compensate the worker for his time.

, Before you hire a day laborer, have a specific rate of pay in mind. This can be an hourly rate, a daily rate, or a per-project flat fee. Before making a decision to work for you, many laborers will want to know what the job entails and how much they will be paid.


Factor in the amount of time you expect the job to take. In order to avoid getting stuck with a slow or inefficient worker, you might want to consider offering a flat fee for the job you need done.
Consider the work being done. Extremely difficult manual labor probably warrants a higher rate of pay than some easier tasks, especially since it may be harder to find a willing and able laborer who can do the job right.
Make sure the person you hire understands and agrees to the rate so there are no disagreements later about pay.
You are legally required to pay overtime for work exceeding 40 hours within one seven-day work week; this is typically the original agreed upon rate plus 50 percent., Many employment agencies hire temporary workers who they can match with day labor projects. These are good options if you would rather not handle the hiring and payment tasks yourself. Hiring through an agency means you will pay the agency instead of paying the laborer directly.You can usually pay labor agencies by check or credit card, though some may require that you set up an account first in case you need additional help in the future.
Check the labor agency's fees before deciding to hire through them. You may find that the extra expense of using an agency is not worth the convenience.

, In many cities, such as Los Angeles, day laborer programs are popping up in an effort to coordinate the matching of day laborers to employers. These programs also seek to make the process legal and safe for everyone involved.These operate much like labor agencies, but are usually government-affiliated and may or may not include fees.


These city or municipal programs may have requirements for payment methods, schedules, and even rates. Check with program officials to learn about their policies before going this route.
One benefit to employers in using a program like this one is that day laborers will be part of a database which can be used to hold them accountable for any misconduct (such as theft or property damage).

, Clearly explain to your day laborer(s) what you need done and how you want it done. As the work progresses, check in on your employees and make sure they are doing the job properly. Take this opportunity to also ask the laborers whether they have any questions about the work. By maintaining frequent communication, you reduce the chance that either party will become dissatisfied with the situation.


Be clear upfront about how much work you expect your laborer(s) to complete in a given day, including start and stop times.
Don't forget to schedule breaks for your worker(s) and tell them when they can stop working to eat lunch, rest, or get something to drink. This will keep them from having to guess as to your expectations.

, Recognize that sometimes a job turns out to be more difficult or time consuming than originally expected. If this turns out to be the case for your project, consider whether a pay raise or extended period of employment is warranted. Your laborers will be more likely to want to work for you again if you act fairly and reasonably.


In some cases, you may realize part way through a project that you need more laborers to complete it effectively. If this happens, you should not lower the pay of the original employee(s); the pay rate you promise upfront is what you should stick to.
If harsh weather conditions slow the progress of an outdoor project, consider delaying things until a later date, when your laborer can work more effectively. In such a situation, consider paying your laborer for the work he has already done, especially if the break will exceed 1 day.

, You should be aware of and comply with the various legal rights that protect day laborers. If you have questions about what day laborers are legally entitled to, check the U.S. Department of Labor website.Laborers' rights include (but are not limited to) the following:Right to organize.
Right to be paid a fair wage.
Right to be free from discrimination.
Right to safe working conditions.
Right to remain silent regarding immigration status.

, At the end of the day (or project, if you choose to pay that way), pay your day laborer in cash. This saves the worker from the hassle of trying to cash a check if he doesn't have a bank account. This is just a general courtesy that will make your laborer's life a bit easier.


Remember that you have to pay a laborer for his work, even if the work is not done exactly the way you wanted.
If you hired the laborer through an agency or work program, you will have to pay the agency (probably by check or credit card) and not the worker directly. Tips, on the other hand, should be paid directly to the laborer in cash.

, You should have a written record for every day laborer you hire that details how much was paid, on what date, for what services, and to whom. You may need this for your own business or personal tax records, and it is a good way to keep track of your finances.This is especially important if you hire day laborers on a regular basis.


Maintain a database of day laborers and their contact information. It might be a good idea to include personal notes describing your overall satisfaction with each particular worker. This will help you avoid hiring someone who doesn't do good work.
Give a 'receipt' to each laborer you pay so that he also has a record of his work and payment.

, This is a U.S. federal employment form that needs to be filled out for each employee who works for you (even a day laborer). While you do not have to submit this form to anyone, it can be requested at any time by the U.S. government and will protect you in the event you are audited by government officials for any reason.You can obtain I-9 forms from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration office. Visit their website at ].
The I-9 form includes sections to be filled out by both you and your laborer. If you wish to fill out the entire form yourself, you will need to get all the appropriate information from your day laborer.

, This can mean skipping your morning poppy-seed bagel, or opting to pass on any over-the-counter medications that can affect your test. But, it is a lot easier to prevent a false positive than it is to contest.


Athletes should know that certain substances have been banned for use while competing, but are actually allowed during training.

, When you go in for your drug test, you will be asked to complete a list of all the foods, vitamins, medications, or other supplements that you have been taking. This will help the screening facility determine a false-positive from an actual positive test, and could be the difference between losing and keeping your job.


Athletes who test positive for a banned substance--regardless of its legality--may face punitive action.

, Increasing your fluid intake will help flush any of the substances that may produce a false positive (such as poppy-seed), so be sure to increase your fluid intake at least 24-hours before your scheduled examination., You want to give the cleanest urine you can to avoid any false positives, so make sure that you do not provide your first urine of the day as a sample.

, Depending on your state of residency and the time of the drug test, your rights can vary drastically. For example, random drug testing in California is not considered legally valid because of its discriminatory basis. Pre-employment testing, however, is entirely valid.


An employer can terminate your employment, or restrict any promotions for ""positive"" results.Depending on your location, the state can deny you unemployment benefits, working compensation, and disability benefits., This is the first step to formally contesting your results. The human resources department will be able to inform you about any re-testing procedures; and will provide you with the paperwork that is required to proceed.

Know how drug tests work.,
Identify what drugs you may have in your system and research how long each one remains.,
Abstain from usage.,
Delay the testing, if possible.,
Understand that cheating a drug test may be against the law.",How to Pass a Drug Test for a Job3," Drug tests are designed to locate specific chemical compositions in the bodies blood, urine or saliva that are thought to associated with a narcotic substance. Each of these tests is unique and is designed to screen for a specific drug or drug combination. For example, when being tested for marijuana laboratories will look specifically for the chemical THC.The more residual chemistry that you can flush from your system, the better your chances of avoiding a positive result.
The length of time a drug remains in your system depends mainly on the drug itself.
Detoxifying and flushing agents claim to wash your system free of the chemicals that will trigger a positive result, but since drug tests are constantly evolving and becoming more advanced--looking for different chemical compositions in the body--these products remain unreliable.

, Knowing how long a drug may remain in your system is absolutely crucial to reducing the chances of testing positive.


Marijuana can remain in your system for as long as eight-weeks, stored in your fat and hair cells.Cocaine, on the other hand, is typically flushed from the body within four days.Identify any drugs that you may have taken in the past six months.

, The best way to pass a drug test is to allow sufficient time for any narcotic to be fully flushed from your system. But this can only happen if you abstain and give your body the proper amount of time that it needs to flush.

, Do your best to re-schedule or avoid being drug tested for as long as needed. Although this is more than likely not a possibility, it may be the only (legal) chance that you have to avoid a positive result.

, While detoxifying and flushing agents are not against the law, there are several other methods and products that have recently come to market that require performing an illegal act. These products include:


Chemical spikes, which are sold legally in small vials, are added to the urine sample at the time of testing.Owning or purchasing the spike is not illegal, but adding it to your urine during your examination may violate local or state laws.
Prosthetic penises are now available and are designed to not only store a clean urine sample, but also fool the watchful eye of any observer.Urine that is not your own.

Shut your computer.,
Decide on a destination.,
Embark.",How to Slack Off at Work1," Before you embark on your trip to the bakery down the street or the bathroom on the opposite end of the building, you must disconnect yourself from whatever sense of productivity you previously had.;
, Maybe you are hungry and feel like taking a second lunch at a restaurant within walking distance of your office. Maybe there are places in your office that you haven't yet explored. Maybe you just feel like wandering for a while, and letting your now empty mind take you where it will. Whatever you do, it is important that you keep the end goal in mind: wasting as much time as possible.

, This is the most exciting part! Now that you have shut your computer and chosen your destination (or not), you are ready to depart on the enlightening journey that is freedom. Enjoy your freedom!

Enjoy!",How to Slack Off at Work2," Before even considering the more dangerous option of playing games at your desk, you must teach your mind and your body to quickly switch between computer windows, specifically from games to email, or do anything else that looks like work. Only once you are confident in your ability to switch tabs at a moment's notice can you move on to the next step.

, This can be a very hard decision, but is very important in the following steps. If you can't decide on one specific game, perhaps try to settle on a category of game that you wish to play, such as flash games.

, If you want to try flash games, make sure you have the correct version of Flash installed on your computer. You can even download a free trial of some games like Roller Coaster Tycoon with ease.

, Once you start playing the game you have chosen, you will likely lose your sense of the people around you and who may be watching over your shoulder. It is important that you keep a watchful eye behind you every once in a while to avoid any potential repercussions from your superiors.

It is a good idea to take a quick walk around the office to see if anyone you know (or don't!) is clearly in the same boat as you, and needs to pass some time.

, The best way to determine who you should chat with is to pick someone who you may already get along with, but don't know a lot about. If no one matches this description, you may try narrowing it down to the person who you feel you could best hold a long, comfortable conversation with.

, Keep in mind that even while they appeared to not be working, you can't be sure that they will be so willing to participate in time wasting with you. If they seem like they may need some warming up, start by faking some ""productive talk"" about some work-related things, and slowly change the subject later.

, Now you and your slacking buddy are on the same page. Just be sure that if anyone with authority walks by, you are ready to quickly change the subject to something more acceptable in your work environment. Try using the words ""report"" and ""memo"" or ""email"" with frequency. Godspeed!

,How to Negotiate Pay1,
,How to Negotiate Pay2,
"
Research the position you are applying for.,
Know what you're worth.,
Find out how the company is doing financially.,
Know your limits and shoot a little high.,
During the interview, if asked, let it be clear that salary is negotiable to you.,
If your potential employer asks you how much you made during your previous job, do not give them a firm number.,
Once you land the job and have been offered a salary, give your initial offer.,
Wait for the counteroffer.,
If salary negotiations stall, get creative.,
Once you reach a deal with your new employer, get it in writing.",How to Negotiate Pay3," Craft your resume and interview to highlight the skills you have that the employer needs. Making an employer realize you are the perfect candidate for the job is the first step.

, Start researching the most recent salary data for the job position, location and experience.


You can find this information online at websites like Vault, PayScale, and Glassdoor. Search for comparable positions in your area, with your level of experience.
To get a feel for what you are worth at a regional level, you can access employment surveys from a local library, or look at numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
You can also get firsthand accounts from contacts you have in professional organizations or peers who work in the same field. Don't ask them directly how much they make — that's may be perceived as rude — but instead ask something along the lines of ""What do you think someone in your line of work would make, on average?""

, Public companies must disclose their financial standings, so you can easily look up this information. Access news about the company through newspaper archives.


Know that companies that are doing relatively well will probably be in a better position to negotiate than companies that aren't doing very well. Use this information to your advantage.

, You should have an idea of a salary range that would fit your needs. Craft a rate that you'd ideally want to get and then think about the absolute minimum you'd be willing to take. To give you a little bit of wiggle room, you're going to be asking for slightly more than your ideal rate to start off the negotiation

, Don't discuss a specific salary until you are formally offered the job.

, Not giving them a firm number will make them guess about how much they think you're worth; often, this will produce a higher starting salary than if you provided them with a hard number straight off the bat.


If they ask you how much you made, say something like: ""My compensation was competitive in the market and in line with my skills, performance history, and experience. I trust it will be too in your organization.""

, If the salary your potential employer started off with is lower than expected, reach for your ideal salary plus a little extra to create room for compromise. You'll most likely lower your rate during negotiation, so be prepared to step down a little bit from your initial offer.


Say something like: ""I appreciate the offer of $38,500, but I believe that my skills, performance history, and competitive drive merit something more along the lines of $45,000. Is it possible to look at a salary of $45,000 for this position?""

, The person you're negotiating with may stick with her original offer. If they do, politely reiterate what you think you're worth: ""I really think that $45,000 is a more reasonable figure, given the job responsibilities and my proven track record.""


The person negotiating will either continue to toe the line at the original offer, or will come back with a compromise, somewhere between your high offer and her low offer. At this point, you have two options:
Don't budge until you get exactly the salary you want. Reiterate what you think you're worth. This is dangerous: if your potential employers cannot afford you, you may lose the position.
Accept the compromise number. Since what you asked for was a little high, this number should be around what you'd ideally want. That's a great thing; you've successfully negotiated your salary.



, Think about other perks that may be just as beneficial as money like a mileage allowance, a company vehicle, extra vacation days or stock options.

, Failure to get the offer in writing may result in some selective amnesia. Make sure you review the document carefully before signing off. You can always re-negotiate if you see any glaring errors.

"
"
Become familiar with your company's compensation policy.,
Prior to a job performance evaluation, schedule a meeting with your direct supervisor or boss.,
Increase your leverage by finding another job with higher pay.,
Make your case.,
Stand your ground.,
If all fails, keep smiling and thank your supervisor for his or her time.",How to Negotiate Pay4," Find out if your job performance is evaluated regularly, and if so, when. Your company could enforce a maximum raise; they could also award raises to everybody at a particular time, or base them on merit.

, Be prepared to discuss your specific achievements and accomplishments from the past year.


Evaluate your worth again. Has the market in salary compensation for your particular job changed? Have you stepped out of your job description and taken on additional duties? Mention these things at your meeting.
Practice what you will say. Don't focus on why you need the money but why you deserve the extra pay.

, You don't have to be serious at first about accepting it; but having another job offer, with higher pay, that you can point to during salary negotiations, is a powerful way to leverage your case. It's always best to look for a job when you already have a job, not the other way around.


If you start looking for a different job, you might find an environment and offer that's better suited for you. It always helps to be on the lookout. You don't have to accept the offer, but you might find an offer that's good to pass up.

, Describe the specific business reasons why you deserve a raise. Is it because you're underpaid compared to the rest of the market? It is because your performance is above-average and you contribute significantly to the company's bottom line? Whatever it is, make your case in easy-to-follow language that's persistent but persuasive.

, If you've been denied a raise, ask why and how you can secure a raise in the future. Suggest an alternative, such as a bonus or some kind of incentive or perk. Ask if there's money for additional training to show you're still committed to the job.

, It never helps to get sour or aggressive when things don't go your way. If you feel like your services are being underappreciated, it's in your best interest to start seriously looking for a new job, where your pay is more in line with your production, and your production is valued by the rest of the company.

Provide a complete new recruit package from the start.,
Take them around to meet their fellow staff members.,
Give them a brief rundown on the most important things in the policies and guidelines of the company.,
Be available.,
Explain the work to them.,
Mentor the newcomer.,
Stay in touch.,
Make it clear that your organisation is happy to have the new person on board.",How to Make New Staff Members Feel They Belong," That way, the employee can read all the relevant documentation immediately in their own time and can raise questions about things they need to know more about.


Include personnel forms
Include employment policies and guidelines
Take time to talk through these items (see below).;
, This includes the people that they won't have much to do with but they should still be aware of. In fact, new recruits should know who is in the organisation and what each person is responsible for. You never know the day when they might need to connect with a person they normally don't work to or with, for one reason or other. This includes field workers, virtual workers, and part-timers.


Meet both formally and informally. Show the new recruit around the office and meet them in person as they do their work. Then, hold a get-together to welcome the new recruit, such as a morning tea, or drinks after work.

, Ask them if they have any questions and take the time to talk them through this. Clarify such things as vacation leave, sick leave, pay schedules, and any other immediate relevance.


Alleviate any concerns they have. Doing this now can save a lot of supposition and errant ideas from the outset.
Introduce them to Human Resources.

, Make it known that you're available, as are any other relevant persons, to ask questions of. Let them know that no question is too small or too strange to be asked, and let them feel comfortable when asking by listening and not belittling their knowledge. Nerves can make even the smartest person forget simple things.


Show from the outset that you expect to take this person into the collegiate and collaborative atmosphere of your organisation, and that they're viewed with equal importance as all other staff members.

, Don't expect them to shuffle back to their desk or forklift and know what to do. Walk them through everything, including where to find files and tools, where the tearoom is, and when they can take legitimate breaks. Ask them if there is anything they're unsure about.


At this stage, if it becomes clear there is a knowledge gap, perhaps consider getting training organised quickly. Hiring smart people means they will learn fast, especially if they know you don't have misgivings about what they don't know but simply expect them to learn it, fast.

, Either do this yourself or find someone else who is suitable. It is important that they feel there is at least one person to whom they can go when they don't know what to do or decide about workplace issues and work.


Choose someone who is very experienced, calm, and resourceful for this role. It should be a person who isn't easily flustered by an extra ""responsibility"".
Ask the mentor to guide, counsel, role model, validate, and protect the new recruit. In addition, ask the mentor to encourage and motivate.

, If you are their first point of contact or the person in charge of ensuring the new recruit succeeds, make an effort to check in on them regularly to see how they're going and to provide reassurance.


Give feedback both through formal processes of progress review and through regular informal catch-ups. Be sensitive to their concerns and if there are problems, find positive, constructive solutions rather than coming across negatively.
Address any concerns that they feel about not knowing things that are relevant to their job. It may be as simple as misunderstanding how the information flow proceeds or it could be as serious as misunderstanding the company's role itself. Be sure to alleviate all misunderstandings before they turn into points of conflict with coworkers and bosses.

, Reassure the new employee that the right decision was made and that their presence is greatly appreciated. Be sincere when you express your happiness at their joining your organisation.


If you get feedback from the new recruit months after employing them that they still do not feel a part of the organisation, take this very seriously. It may be that you have missed warning signals or overlooked things that they have said in passing to you. It may be that they don't feel there have been things done for them that were done for other employees. Or, they may have missed out on vital training or recruitment procedures necessary to do the job well; sometimes these things can be overlooked if the employee starts during a really busy part of the year.

Tuck in your shirt.",How to Look Presentable While Working in a Restaurant," Customers want to feel like they are eating in a clean and tidy environment and that includes you. Always shower and brush your teeth before going to work. Make sure that your fingernails are clean. Men should shave or trim facial hair neatly.Brush your teeth rather than chewing gum, which is considered unprofessional and can be unappealing to the customer.Trim your nails and clean underneath them with a pick.;
, Part of a dining experience is the smell of the food you will be eating. Too much personal fragrance can get in the way or mix with the smell of the food creating an unpleasant odor.


This also applies to smokers. Avoid smoking in your work clothes, so the smell doesn’t follow you into the restaurant.

, If you injure yourself while on the job, you want to take care of it right away for your own sake and that of the customers. It is also upsetting to some customers to see bandages on the hands of the people who are serving them.


If the injury is bad, ask to be sent home or to the doctor to fix it.
Invest in clear bandages to avoid unsightly, obvious ones.
Use a triple-antibiotic to help cuts heal more quickly and stay clean.

, Men and women should get regular hair cuts to keep their hair tidy and healthy. Brush it regularly and style it in a classic fashion for work.


If your hair is long enough to be gathered into a ponytail, it should be secured and kept out of the way of the food when you are serving it or carrying it on a tray.
People working in the kitchen should wear hair nets or hats to keep hair from falling into the food as it is prepared.

, Dirty hands can spread viruses and diseases to your customers. Your hands should be clean when you are handling their food, menus, money and utensils. Also acknowledge that handling pens, trays, rags, money and other things leaves you constantly exposed to bacteria. Wash your hands as often as possible, especially if they appear dirty or get sticky.Always wash your hands before returning to work after using the restroom. Not washing your hands before returning to work is a health code violation.

, When you are hired at a restaurant, be sure that you are familiar with the expectations as far as what you should wear. Similar to being invited to an event or party, you will want to have an idea of the dress code and level of formality.


Ask the management what their expectations are regarding your uniform. They will likely have a dress code in writing, which they can share with you.
If the restaurant has branded uniform pieces, like hats or aprons, you may be required to purchase them for a small fee, which could be paid up front or taken out of your check. This amount is usually returned to you when you return the items.
Visit the restaurant or similar restaurants to see what other servers are wearing.
Black dress pants and a denim shirt would be an example of a more casual, but still professional look.
A formal uniform might include dress pants, button-up shirt and a vest, or a skirt or shift dress for women.

, Whether you provide the shirt, or your employer does, have several of them in your closet. You will not likely be able to do laundry every day when you are working, so it is best to have some back-up options.Choose a nice shirt with sleeves (no tank tops). Avoid shirts with designs and logos.
Working at a restaurant could lead to spills and stains. If a shirt is dirty, stained or smells bad, be sure to wear another shirt until you can wash the dirty one.
Throw a shirt away if it is worn out. Once a shirt is torn or frayed, you will need to replace it.

, Some restaurants will allow jeans as part of the uniform. If so, still choose jeans which fit well and do not have holes in them. Shop for a classic style which does not include a lot of decoration.If you are wearing dress pants, be sure that they are clean and ironed.

, Darker clothing often looks sharper. It also has the ability to hide stains. Working around food and drinks leads to spills along the way, which will be less obvious on dark or black clothing.


If your restaurant encourages patterns in your clothing, choose patterns which match the look of the restaurant and aren't too busy or outlandish. An example would be checkered shirts for a country-style restaurant.

, You are likely going to be on your feet all day, so choose shoes which are comfortable. On the other hand, you want them to look professional and not too casual.Choose shoes with a rubber sole for good grip in case there are spills or the kitchen floor is wet.
Go for close-toed flats, nice single-color tennis shoes or shoes with a low heel, depending on the level of formality at your restaurant.
Choose a leather shoe which you can polish to keep it looking clean and new.

, Cumbersome bracelets, necklaces and rings can get in the way of doing your job. Don’t wear any jewelry which could drape into someone’s food or drink. Simple jewelry like a wedding band or a small necklace on a short chain should be fine.


Even though facial piercings may not drape into food, they could be disturbing to some customers. It is best to remove facial piercings before working at a restaurant.

, This is a simple step to looking professional. Clothes which are too big can be baggy and look sloppy. Clothes which are too tight will be uncomfortable and could be considered risqué., You want your clothes to look and smell fresh. Be sure that you keep them clean and tidy by washing them as often as possible. If you don’t have a lot of time to wash your clothes, consider using a drop-off service or a dry cleaner.

, You will likely only have one apron assigned to you. It is important to wash this along with your clothes, but you will also want to keep it clean between washes.


Resist the urge to wipe your hands on your apron. Wash your hands or carry a towel to wipe them on if you need to.
If your apron gets dirty between washed, dab the stains with a damp towel. Try using soda water to scrub stains out.

, Tucking your shirt gives you a more professional look. Beyond that, it is important to keep your shirt secured so that it doesn’t accidentally get on the table or in someone’s meal."

If they are, press EFT TENDER twice (or, you can instead touch the EFT button and then OK on the screen). The customer then has to enter their information on the PIN pad.
If the customer has a credit card, tell them to press Cancel on the PIN pad when the PIN number prompt appears.
If the customer tells you they made a mistake on the PIN pad, press CLEAR on your keypad. Press TOTAL and press EFT TENDER twice again.
If a customer wants to put a certain amount on one card and the remaining balance on another, type the amount to put on the first card (with no decimals) before pressing EFT TENDER. When that card has finished processing, you can select EFT TENDER twice again to run the second card.
If a customer is using a Canadian credit card in the U.S., the screen may prompt you to input more information from the customer's identification.

, If they aren't, skip this step.


If they are, press CHECK TENDER twice (or, you can instead touch the Check button and then OK on the screen). Select the check type on the screen.
Insert the check into the check reader, face down, with the ""Endorse Here"" side at the top. If the customer provided a blank check, press 1 and then ENTER to print the total onto the check. If the customer filled the checkout, press 2 and then ENTER to bypass the printing.
Some customers will be asked to provide driver's license information. Type their license number, press ENTER, type the two-letter state code for the license (e.g. Illinois is IL), ENTER, and then type the customer's date of birth on the keypad (do not type slashes or dashes). Then press ENTER.
The register will automatically print a slip that the customer must sign. When the customer has signed, touch ""Yes"" on the screen and a second slip will print. Put the signed slip into the cash drawer. Then wait for the register to finish processing the check. Once it has, a pop-up will appear on the screen. Touch ""OK"" and then give the second slip and the check back to the customer. For some checks, the screen may prompt you to place the check in the cash drawer instead of returning it to the customer.

, If they cannot, call a manager to see if the transaction can be saved. If not, you may have to void the entire transaction.

,


The receipt may automatically print along with some coupons.
The customer will be asked to select how they'd like their receipt on the PIN pad. If this happens, only touch the ""Print"" button on the screen if the customer asks you to.

,


Press 8, then OPERATOR to print a copy of the receipt from the most recent transaction.
On the back of the receipt, write a note explaining what happened. For example, if you accidentally valued a coupon at $5 instead of $3, write that down.
Place the receipt in your cash drawer.

, Then touch ""Lookup/Enrollment"".

, If the customer is not already a member, a new screen will appear and the customer will have to confirm that their email address is spelled correctly on the PIN pad.

, It isn't required, but it is the easiest way to look up a customer's account, so it's highly recommended. Once you're done, the customer will need to confirm that as well.

, Then, touch the ""Cardless"" button. If the customer is also a Kmart employee, touch ""Non-Associate"" to change it to ""Associate"".

,, Tell them that they will need to use it to redeem more than ten dollars off their account at a time and that they will need to type it in twice.

, If an error message appears, the phone number(s) or email address could be invalid.

Be aware of the symptoms of workplace stress.,
Watch out for common causes of workplace stress.,
Talk to people you trust about how you are feeling.,
Take care of your health and personal life.,
Avoid stress eating.,
Schedule breaks throughout the day.,
Manage your time wisely.,
Manage your tasks.,
Break your self-defeating habits.",How to Manage Workplace Stress1," When you ignore workplace stress, it can make you less effective at your job. But sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between workplace stress and other issues. These are the signs of workplace stress:


Stomach problems
Loss of interest in work
Anxiety or depression
Loss of sleep
Fatigue
Trouble in concentrating on official tasks
Muscle tensions
Frequent headaches
Social withdrawals etc.
You might not show all the stress signs, but you will surely identify with certain symptoms and when you figure them out, you can address them.;
, If any of the following have occurred recently, you may be dealing with workplace stress:


Increased overtime due to layoffs
Fear of being laid off from your job
Pressure to always meet expectations with zero tolerance for mistakes
No increase in job satisfaction but extensive pressure to exceed expectations

, Admitting that you are feeling really stressed out can help you to begin figuring out how to overcome this stress. Talk to your friends and family; find out if they have experienced similar feelings of stress, and how they dealt with that stress.

, Increased stress may interfere with your life outside of work. When you are constantly stressed, you may be distracted or may decrease the amount of time you spend with family and friends. Take some time to spend quality time with the people you love; you may find that this really helps to make you feel more grounded.Stress can also adversely affect your health. Being really stressed can affect your sleeping patterns and lower your immunity.
Make sure to get plenty of sleep, eat healthy meals, and exercise regularly.
Yoga and Meditation are great forms of exercise that help reduce built up stress, both mentally and physically.

, Some people find that when they are stressed, they crave sweets. Steer clear of stress eating and make sure to eat balanced meals. A high-protein and low-sugar diet may help to combat the amount of sugar you intake when eating sweets.

, Plowing through an 8 to 10 hour day without a single break will leave you feeling exhausted by the end of the day, and may affect the quality of your work. Your body needs to take breaks in order to stay focused and energized when you do your work.Plan to take breaks and power naps throughout the day. After 90 minutes of intense concentration, take a brief break to recover and release the stress you have built up over the last hour and a half.
Take a walk around the building and get some fresh air regularly.
Consider doing breathing exercises or stretching at your desk to lower your stress levels during these breaks.

, Focusing all of your time and energy on one task, only to realize you still need to finish up a different task, will ultimately stress you out. Time management is key to managing your workplace stress.Things to keep in mind include:


Analyze your current schedule and daily tasks. Create separate time slots for work, family, social activities and solitude. Remember that continuous work is a recipe for burnout.
Don’t reschedule tasks again-and-again to accommodate more responsibilities in any given day. Commit yourself to only tasks that are realistically doable and schedule others for later.
Reach your office at least 15 minutes earlier than the official time to avoid stress levels caused by frantically rushing to your desk.
Plan regular breaks as described in the previous step.

, While managing your time is very important, managing each individual task will also help to keep your stress levels down. Staying organized while in the heat of the assignment will help to keep you on track. Things to consider include:


Tackle tasks in order of importance; do high-priority items first. Finish boring tasks early, so that rest of your day is spent as pleasantly as possible.
Break big projects and even routine tasks into small components and work on them step-by-step.
Don’t do all tasks by yourself; delegate responsibility if you work in a team.
Be willing to compromise or return the favor in terms of revising deadlines, changing behavior etc. Being flexible will reduce stress levels for everyone.

, Thinking negative thoughts can ultimately slow down your work and cause more stress because the energy you put into those thoughts could actually be put into finishing a task. Instead, think positively about the situation and set realistic goals.


Resist perfectionism which makes you set unrealistic goals. Aim to do your best and don’t seek to be perfect. It will only add unnecessary stress to your work day.
Stay on top of things by cleaning your desk, create to-do lists and check off tasks when you complete them
Practice gratitude by writing down at least 5 positive things that happened during your workday. Seeing the negative aspects of work, co-workers and other elements at your workplace only tend to drain your energy and motivation.

Handle mistakes calmly.,
Use different methods to collect feedback regarding workplace stress.,
Try to take an analytic approach to a problem, rather than leading with your emotions.",How to Manage Workplace Stress2," Create an open environment where issues can be discussed effectively. An open environment means that problems should be discussed, rather than dealt with passive aggressively or overly dramatically. If someone makes a small mistake, tell the person about it, but do not dwell on the situation.


As a manager, it is your job to create an environment where employees can easily accept and fix their mistakes without fear of losing their jobs. If you do not create this environment, employees will continue to hide their mistakes and problems will not get fixed.

, This will help you to figure out what is causing your employees to feel so stressed out, without having to put anyone on the spot.When employees are allowed to give feedback anonymously, they are generally much more willing to do so. Forms of feedback can include:


Suggestion and complaint boxes.
Online anonymous polls.
Working with a third party to meet with employees without disclosing which employee said certain things.

, Consider all of the factors for why a problem arose, and subsequently led to stressed employees. Perhaps a deadline was missed. Take a look at when the work was issued, how much work the assignment entailed (was the employee overburdened?), whether the work was on par with the employee’s skill level, and if they employee has done similar assignments before.


Taking a look at all of these factors can help you to figure out why the deadline was missed, and what is causing the stress. Perhaps the employee had never done an assignment like that, or had been sick or dealing with a family emergency at the time.

"
"
Try to be flexible when interacting with your employees.,
Assign tasks according to specialization.,
Diversify tasks to break up monotony.,
Let your employees be part of the decision making process.,
Show your employees the bigger picture.,
Break down tasks into stages.,
Create a tracking system.",How to Manage Workplace Stress3," This means being flexible in everything you do, from making business decisions to assigning job tasks. A manager can lead to very stressed employees. Try to be innovative and consider what will work best for you and your team.


If you assign a task to an employee, and they come to you asking to trade assignments with another employee who is also willing to trade, consider the proposition before simply saying no.
However, there are some things, like office rules that you should inform everyone of your view on, so that they know how you will react if someone breaks one of those rules.

, If someone likes designing brochures then don’t assign him to gathering data for the brochure instead of designing the layout. Employees are generally less stressed when they know they can accomplish goals they have been assigned and enjoy the work in the process.


Consider directly asking your employees which tasks they feel they will do well with, and which ones they would rather avoid. Try to stick to these preferences as much as possible, while also keeping in mind that it is inevitable that you will also have to set these preferences aside on occasion to keep your company functioning smoothly.

, Instead of having an employee stamp letters all day, have her assist with proofreading the letters for part of the day. Repetition can be stressful and boring.


Have your employees trade duties regularly, so long as doing so does not affect workflow.

, Make your employees feel like their ideas are valued by asking for their opinions and thoughts on different projects. Listen to their suggestions, and work with them if you think the suggestions could turn into something that would be beneficial for the company.

, Sometimes, having an end goal can help to promote workflow and lower stress. While an employee’s assignment may seem isolated, show the employee how the assignment will ultimately help to obtain a larger goal. Often, having the ‘Finish Line’ in sight can help to keep employees motivated and less stressed.


Consider explaining why each aspect of the project is important. Employees may feel confused or frustrated if they don’t understand why they are doing a task. Take the time to answer their questions.

, To keep your employees’ stress levels down, create a list of things that need to be done to reach the next phase of the project or assignment your employees are working on. Give your employees goals along the way to finishing a larger project in order to keep positivity up, and thus stress levels down.


For example, don’t just tell an employee to make a brochure. Specify that they have to collect data from different departments in the form of pictures and text, sort through the data, prepare a draft and then send it over for finalizing.

, Keeping track of the progress your employees have made can serve to motivate them further. A tracking system can also help to point out strengths and areas that need to be improved on.


For example, have an employee keep track of all of the customers she dealt with and helped each day.

Stop trying to impress the managers.,
Don't just stand there quietly.,
Do your job.,
Ask questions.,
Be conscientious.,
Be punctual.,
Be a team player.,
Accept advice as readily as giving advice.,
Help others perform their tasks.,
Learn how to do all the jobs.,
Be flexible.,
Limit talk about work in casual conversation if you can avoid it.,
Take pride in your appearance.,
Listen.",How to Make a Manager Notice You in the Fast Food Industry," That is the most important step of them all. They know that you are the way you are because their little name tag says ""manager"" in cold black. Instead of working harder when the manager is around, work harder when there is a more experienced worker with you. Any person who has a relation with the manager will let the manager know you've done a good job. Word of mouth is extremely powerful. If you do a job better then the other new people, the supervisor will be sure to note it in reports. The manager will eventually find out.;
, Say something funny, informative, or even just ""hello"" to people. Greet customers and coworkers alike when you enter your station. Being friendly invites people to talk to you, and being able to hold a good conversation is vital.

, Properly. Mistakes happen. When they do, be sure to learn from them. If you are doing something and someone suggests a better way, do it. McDonald's didn't become a world-wide multi-million dollar company by not knowing what they are doing! If someone suggests a better way of doing something and you feel slightly foolish because it was obvious, laugh and thank them for the insight. If another co-worker gives you good advice, follow it.

, If you don't understand something or need to find something, ask someone for help. Figuring it out on your own may make you look good if you're lucky, but in the end it can slow you down too much to be efficient, or make you look foolish if you screw up. Don't be afraid to ask the same question twice or have someone demonstrate.

, Everyone drops and breaks things or puts ketchup on something that is not supposed to get ketchup. It's life. Apologize and learn not to do it again. If someone was hurt as a result of your actions, be concerned and don't lay blame. Report all accidents and incidents to the supervisor or manager as soon as possible. If a supervisor or manager asks you to do something, let them know you will do it after you finish what you are currently doing, within reason. ""Just one second, I have to clean the grill off"" works wonders. ""Let me go wash my hands first"" is a plus, but be sure you use that with all other employees too, or else the manager will catch on to you being a suck up.

, Show up to work when scheduled. Phone if you will be delayed.

, Skip breaks to assist your coworkers during unusual work hours. Managers appreciate teamwork.

, No one likes a know-it-all.

, If someone isn't doing their job right, inform them. If they don't improve, speak with the manager about it.

, In times of worker shortage, knowledge of all stations will become a valuable asset.

, Agree to work late or extra shifts whenever possible.

, Most people already know or have heard all about how much extra work is involved with closing, they don't want to hear about it again. You don't want people to hate you.

, Wear a clean uniform. Always wear your hat, even when you don't need to. If some uniform rules, like black shoes are not actively enforced, still follow it. It shows you care.

, If a person talks to you about your co-workers, they will talk about you. Be sure they have something good to talk about, word spreads upwards.

Let people know you are looking for a job.
Ask friends and former colleagues to keep you posted if they hear of anything.
If you are currently working and need an additional job you should speak with your current supervisor. Let him/her know you are looking to find a part-time job for extra income. Let them know you won't let it conflict with your primary job. You don't want them assuming you are looking to leave should the grapevine make it back to them. They may know of a solution inside your company or they may be able to help you bring in some additional money without finding another job.;
, Now is an excellent time to review your resume', make changes, revamp the format, etc.


Consider getting a good friend or two together and have a resume' session. It's great to have someone there to bounce ideas and wording around. Have them bring their resumes and everyone can benefit. This is especially helpful if your friends have excellent resumes and write well.
Resume' examples are available online but you may also find books available in the library or book store with more examples.
Take your time and really look at ways to improve it. By setting time aside you can make it your primary focus.
Break your resume' down. Evaluate every word, every phrase and every section. Make your resume' the very best it can be.

, Your unique combination of skills make you more versatile than you may give yourself credit. Think about other jobs, career fields, industries that use similar skill sets. You may be narrowing your search to a familiar industry but could increase your options by focusing on your skills rather than your work history.

, It may not be in the same field you were in but in a field that interacted with your former job. Think of vendors or other companies that worked with or competed with your former job. You may have worked for a mortgage company before but those same skills could do well selling insurance or working in the financial department of a hospital.


Some companies find employees by looking at the competition. If you're out of work and there is no immediate conflict you should look at your former competition. They'll appreciate your knowledge of the industry.

, You'll need to actively apply for jobs.


Realize that some companies with high turnovers send interview request emails to most everyone. Don't waste your time with employers who seem to spam you. These sometimes take advantage of desperate people looking for jobs. It may be best to not waste your time, money or energy. If it seems too good to be true it usually is. Don't drive 400 miles (640 km) for an interview in a hotel conference room for a company that has never had a conversation with you.
There are several reputable online job search engines. Post your resume' to several and make your information public to employers. With reputable sites your information will be searchable by employers looking to hire but won't be seen by the general public.
Don't forget to look for city based job search sites. Larger cities may offer sites specific for finding jobs in that area.
Make sure you are using key phrases in your resume. This will help your resume to show up in more queries. Leave out salary information. It may disqualify you for certain jobs. In a poor economy it's better to leave yourself open to negotiate.

,, Smaller towns are often hard hit by business closures. It may be time to look to the nearest large town. There may be fewer people with your skills looking there.


You may need to commute and invest in a more affordable car but you could have a steady job.
Talk to your spouse or partner about relocating.

, Many fields have sites dedicated to the industry and you may find a classified section. If your field has been hard hit by the economy you could be facing even more competition. You may need to look into other industries.

, Since the online sits often charge the employers many companies set up their own job websites. Look at the companies you'd like to work for and check their websites for job pages.

, Job searches are easy and you can do them in your pajamas but they may not be as effective. Many people look for a job in a slow economy so the sites are inundated with job seekers.


Print up your resume and go cold calling. Visit or call businesses and inquire if they're hiring. Find out the name of the hiring manager and send or deliver a resume' locally to his/her attention.
Avoid Mondays. These are usually hectic days.
It takes initiative to stop by or hand deliver a resume'. It stands a good chance of making it to someone's desk. With so many people looking for work you need to do what you can to stand out and give yourself an edge.

, It saves them time and you seem more forthcoming. Many hiring managers prefer the path of least resistance. It is also a good way to ""name drop"" without name dropping in conversation. If you have great references you can earn some instant credibility.

,


Call every one of your references. Ask if you can list them as a reference. (You should have asked them before you listed them.)
Not all people like being listed or want to give references.
Verify the address and phone number are still current. Some may have had a change in title or may have moved on.

In addition to making sure the information is correct you can inform them of your job search. They may know if something and can help put you in touch with other people. (Remember your networking skills!)
By letting them know they will also be prepared and not caught off guard by a potential reference check. They can answer those questions more appropriately than if they'd been caught off guard.
By letting them know you can also hope they'd be more inclined to return a reference call more promptly. They'll be inclined to ""watch out"" for the call when they understand the urgency involved.



, If your resume' has been securing interviews but potential employers can't seem to make an offer there may be something fishy with one of your references. You may need to do some discrete detective work to flush out a bad reference.


Have a mature adult friend or family member call your references. They should sound professional and unbiased. They shouldn't mention they know you but should position themselves as someone from a ""potential employer"" who is calling to check your references. (See tips.)
Have them ask the most basic questions: ""I'm calling to check the references for potential employee. I'm calling to check the references for ""Your Name""...would you recommend this person for a (marketing, sales, administrative, retail, etc.) position?"" ""Why?"" Follow up questions can include: ""Would you re-hire this person if you could?"" ""Is this person responsible and dependable?""
Most companies can only verify your employment dates and can't get into specific details. If they start dishing rumors or personal information you should notify someone higher up with the company. Personal references can reveal as much as they'd like.
Verify all of your references are giving positive reference information. If someone is too hard to contact, won't return calls, or sound negative or less than thrilled to be a reference you should consider removing them as a reference. People have often listed someone as a reference (even with permission) only to have that reference provide negative feedback to the potential employer.

, Try a color other than white. A busy manager may have a lot of paper on their desk and you don't want your resume' to get mixed up in the stack of standard white copy paper. You want your resume' to stand out even if it's on an ivory or grey tinted resume paper. If you must use white invest in quality paper with texture and thickness. Do everything you can to make it easy for them to find it, read it and act on it.


Try your local discount store's office supply section for resume' paper. It will probably be more affordable than office supply stores.
Resume' quality paper does cost more but it is a justified investment.

, Make a plan before you leave the house to make the driving as efficient as you can. A dollar saved on gas and an hour of time saved on driving can add up.


Get out early and don't wait until 3 or 4 in the afternoon (unless your career field justifies later calls). By late in the afternoon people have checked out mentally, have gotten busy, left for the day, etc. By stopping in early there's a better chance of your resume' ending up on the right desk by days end.

, It's free and can save you some embarrassment or miscommunication.


""Beerdrinkinggurl@..."" may have been cool in college but you should really use something more professional.
Using your name is a good bet. Not only is it logical but it's also easy to spot your emails in their in-box later. Try yourname@... or something similar. Adding weird symbols may cause an error when they send you an email and you may never get it. Keep it simple.

, You never know if the hiring manager may be able to meet with you immediately or just see you in the lobby.

, Some companies use other office workers for coverage when the receptionist steps away from the desk. You never know who you are talking to and it could be someone important. They will be the one to pass your resume' on. You don't want them to stick a note to it telling the hiring manager you were a jerk. Say please and thank you.


If the lobby is packed you can wait until the bulk of the people have passed through. Allow people to go ahead of you if necessary. You may be looking for information and that could take more than a minute. You want to confirm spellings and titles to address your information correctly.
Make a note of the receptionist's name while you are there. You can say hello to him/her by name when you drop off your information once the cover letter, etc. are personalized for the company and hiring manager. Remember, this is the person that will pass your information along. It doesn't cost a thing to make a good impression and be polite. Building a rapport can go a long way especially when the market is tough. A smile and a kind word could land your resume' on top of the stack.
Try to find out the name of the department manager and direct your information to them. Sometimes the human resource manager sits on resumes until the managers ask. By sending it directly to the department manager you can cut out the middleman and get an advantage.
You probably won't be able to speak to someone at that time. If it's a large company they may have a human resources department. These people are busy and probably don't see people on a walk-in basis. Regardless, you should be able to discuss your goals should you run into the person while you are there.

, You can schedule a meeting on-site if the opportunity arises, you can take notes and you will also look prepared and professional.


Don't leave it in the car but carry it with you at all times.
A good day planner size will also allow you to insert your resume' without folding it and provide pockets for additional information.
Many have business card slots. When you have the opportunity to pick up someone's business card (they sometimes have them setting out) you should hang on to it.
A planner is a good organizational investment. Record your stops, contact information and follow up details. Staying organized will allow you to make the most of your time. It would be a shame to lose out on an opportunity because you didn't call to follow up on a certain day or you got confused or overwhelmed. Think of your planner as your mobile office and be diligent about keeping it updated.
Look back through your notes every week. You'll appreciate your progress and efforts more when you seem them listed.
Keeping your job search efficient will be good for morale and more cost effective. Every cent counts during tough times. Designate an area in your day planner to keep your receipts and other expense information for tax purposes.

, A business suit is appropriate for almost all interviews. Most hiring managers will not fault you for being over dressed when in a business suit. Dressing too professional won't hurt your chances of getting a job. Being to casual or under dressed could cost you a job. You need to be as competitive as you can. Remember, there are lots of people looking for jobs and you need to give yourself every advantage.


If times are particularly tough you can ask a friend to borrow a suit or check local thrift stores. Some charities specialize in work clothes for people needing help. You can always check deep discount stores. Buying black, navy, grey or brown will give you more versatility. You can change up the whole look with different shirts and accessories.

, If your town is smaller you should check the nearest large city. The opportunity to meet company representatives face to face could be worth the trip.


Dress your best
Bring copies of your resume' and references
Bring your notebook and calendar

, Chances are they will. Again, this doesn't cost you anything but a few minutes.


If any blogs, forums, etc. show up in the search you can go to that site and change your user name for the duration of your job search. This is especially important if you make hostile posts or participate in discussion on forums that could be political, risque' or anything other than professional.

, Even if they can't see your page your photo may show up.

, Looking for a job and having a job are not the same thing. Don't charge expensive suits to a credit card you have no way of paying. It's tough out there but you need to be smart.


Remember to keep track of all your receipts and expenses. Many job hunting expenses and mileage are tax deductible.

, A disconnected mobile number or a bounced back email will not send a good message about your attention to detail or reliability.


You may need to decrease your minutes to keep your bill under control but avoid a plan that will disconnect service for going over your minutes. If you need to switch providers make sure you can keep your old number before you start applying for work using the old number. Think ahead before you use your current number for any job search. If you anticipate changing numbers in the next 3-6 months you should secure a land line or go ahead with the change.
Consider using a free web mail service (Gmail, Yahoo mail, etc.) for listing on your job search materials. This is especially important if your current email is through your cable provider. If you stay unemployed you'll likely need to cancel your cable. By keeping a free email address your job search won't be affected.
Most employers won't try again tomorrow or later today. Once you've missed the call or email the opportunity is lost. Remember there is lots of competition with so many people looking for jobs. Stay on the ball.

, You will need to start the day early on job hunting days and you may have employers calling you in the mornings.


Resist the urge to stay up late and sleep until noon.

, Keep checking job sites daily. Your dream job may get posted and filled in one week. The few jobs available aren't staying unfilled long.


Follow up with people you've met or interviewed with. Sometimes the follow up is what gets you the job.
Send a thank you card to any hiring manager who interviews you in person. Again, sometimes it is the follow up and attention to service that gets you the job.

, Job searches are taking longer and you may need to look longer to find the right opportunity. Cut out anything unnecessary.


Limit meals out with friends so you have the funds to attend networking luncheons instead.
Avoid buying any clothing that can't be worn for an interview or a new job unless it's an absolute need. You'll wish you hadn't bought that ski jacket when you are scraping funds together to buy trousers for an interview. Avoid buying any luxury items for leisure when you could be investing that money in resume' improvement, gas money for job hunting or keeping your internet service up to date.
Don't charge everything assuming you'll have a job next month to pay it off. You should avoid charging anything on credit cards while you are unemployed.

, Don't go nuts once you get a new job. Remember, the last person hired is usually the first person fired.


Even though you get hired the company may also have lay offs. Save everything you can just in case the new job isn't as permanent as you'd hoped. When you do spend you should spend wisely.
Put money away every week towards a savings and catch up on any bills. It may be a while before you really have expendable income once you are employed. If you do find yourself laid off again soon you may have enough in savings to sustain your next job search.

Send a thank-you note.",How to Find a Job As a Shy Person," Taking the time to think about your personality and evaluate your shyness can help you gain the self awareness necessary to market yourself effectively. Once you know how shy you are and which situations seem to exacerbate the problem, you can prepare yourself to handle challenges. Ask yourself:


Have I always been shy?
Am I shy both at work and away from work?
Is my shyness related mostly to the job search itself?
Was I considered a shy person in my last position?;
, If your answers to the questions above suggest that most of your shyness is related to finding a job – marketing yourself, handling interviews, meeting potential employers and colleagues, and the like – then understand that preparing for these specific situations can help you overcome the problem.

, If your shyness seems to be a generalized personality trait, not a manifestation of anxiety about the job search, then you’ll have to think about your strengths and weaknesses and decide how to proceed. You do not need to become an extrovert to find a job. You can work to step outside of your comfort zone while focusing on finding a job that fits your strengths and weaknesses.

, By understanding your abilities, you can determine which jobs might be a good match for your skills. Consider your strongest personality traits and your most relevant work-related skills, and go from there. If, for example, you are an extremely detail-oriented person and an analytical thinker, and you have experience preparing complete financial reports, you might decide that a financial analyst position is right for you.

, In order for you to feel capable and successful, you need to find a job that plays to your strengths. Make a list of your skills, experience, and other qualifications, and look for jobs that match.

, If you are a very shy and introverted person, you may never feel comfortable working as a motivational speaker or a sales professional. Focus on jobs that require a bit less in terms of assertiveness and interpersonal communication. Examples of jobs that are best for shy people include:


programmer
financial clerk
scientist
writer
manager of web content

, Remember that the job itself is only part of the equation; ideally, you also want to find a work environment in which you’ll feel comfortable. For any job posting you see, try to find out what the company culture is like. If, for example, you’re interested in a programmer position but find that the company in question is very fast paced and stresses collaboration and frequent meetings, you may decide not to apply. The company website is a good place to start; read its “about us” and “careers” pages to glean what the company is, how it operates, and what it expects from its employees. In addition, try:


conducting a keyword search of the company on the internet. Doing so will help you uncover reviews and articles about a particular company. You may wind up with a better understanding of how a company runs and whether its employees are happy.
viewing company and employee social media pages. The company’s social media profiles may provide additional information about the company. Employees’ profiles can be especially helpful, as they may suggest whether the company attracts people with similar personalities, interests, and abilities. Ask yourself whether you would feel comfortable working with those people.

, Once you have determined which potential jobs you might feel happy at, apply! Do not pass up an opportunity because you lack confidence or are worried you will come across as shy and introverted in interviews. Take the first step, and send in your application. If you target the right jobs, you may be pleasantly surprised to find that you get called for interviews.

, Start small – you do not have to go to a big event and speak to everyone present. Target one or two employees, and contact them by phone or email, whichever you are more comfortable with. Just make the initial contact and express your interest in a company or job; doing so can be extremely beneficial as you search for employment.

, Going into an interview can be scary, and it’s fine to feel anxious – there are so many unknowns that most people get nervous in these situations. The best way to prepare, however, is to review your resume and practice what to say when asked standard questions like “Tell me about yourself.” Knowing how you will explain your experience, education, skills, and career objectives will help you answer tough questions with confidence and poise.

, It is crucial to be able to illustrate your strengths by giving examples of past successes and accomplishments. For example, if you have decided that high attention to detail is one of your strengths, you should be prepared to provide an example: perhaps you reviewed prepared reports and discovered inefficiencies, saving your previous company money.

, Eye contact, good posture, and firm handshakes are important elements of an interview situation. Everyone needs to practice these kinds of nonverbal communication, but shy people may need to be particularly attentive to the issue. Practice! Try, for example:


holding a conversation with someone you know while maintaining constant eye contact.
sitting up in a chair with good posture for 30 minutes.
practicing firm handshakes.

, Remember: you would not have gotten the interview if you were not qualified to do the job. At this point, you just need to express yourself confidently and focus on your strengths. Stay positive throughout the interviewer, and try to express your confidence and enthusiasm verbally and non-verbally.

, After your interview, send a brief note thanking the potential employer for his or her time. If you want to clarify a point or two that you made during the interview, you can do so at this time, but don’t say more than one or two things, and don’t apologize or characterize your interview negatively. Focus on your enthusiasm about the job.

Look for industries on the rise.,
Target a company before you target a job.,
Tailor your resume to the specific job you’re applying for.,
Show them what you can deliver.",How to Find a Great Job During a Recession1," Although the economy as a whole suffers during a recession, there are always exceptions to the trend. When you are looking to change jobs, try to target industries on the rise. Every industry requires a wide range of skills; chances are that you can find a fit for your skills somewhere.For instance, even though most attorneys work at law firms, almost all large companies employ lawyers as well. An attorney looking to changes jobs in a poor job market should target in-house counsel positions at companies in growth industries.;
, Since you should be looking to find positions in growth industries, you should target specific companies in those industries. Different applicants have different needs, so there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to finding which companies an applicant should target. Instead, think of what you want out of the job and find companies which can offer you those things.For example, you may be looking for an employer who can offer stability and security, and should therefore target large, well established companies. If you are looking to quickly advance your position within a company, target start-ups and other aggressively expanding enterprises.

, One of the most common mistakes applicants make is having a one-size-fits-all resume. Accurately or not, companies don’t look at themselves as interchangeable. Each feels they bring a unique value to the marketplace. In order to stand out, you need to try and recognize what they feel is unique and play to those qualities.For example, large, established companies have more elements that need to work in sync with one another in order for the whole to be successful. If you were applying to a company like that, you should make you resume highlight things like reliability and the ability to work as a part of a team. A start-up might be looking for an employee who is creative, multi-talented, and able to switch gears at the drop of a hat.

, No matter what job you apply for, you should talk about accomplishments in concrete terms instead of giving a job description. This is even truer during a recession, when companies are even more focused on revenue than they are normally.


For instance, instead of saying that you “sold houses in an upscale market for a new home construction firm,” say that you were “ a multi-million dollar producer, landing in the 90th percentile of aggregate sales each year.”

Also, having a current job means having a current, relevant reference for your prospective employer to call. If you work well, you may get a raise and will be able to put that on your resumé.;
, Sometimes you find yourself right where you started. Grit your teeth, keep possible rage to yourself, take your money and wait for the end of your shift.

, Even when you’re in a job you feel comfortable in, there’s always someone looking out for a person like you, and there’s always a way for you to cash in those experience chips you’ve been earning to get something better.

,, If you find yourself on the dole twice in one year, just forget about it and look to the next opportunity. At least you’ve got more experience to fill your resumé., What would make it look better and fuller? What could go on there that your dream employer would think was really useful to their business? It could be worth putting in some hours working for no pay if it gets you a job in the end. Sound weird? It probably makes no sense whatsoever to your head.

Sometimes you have to do whatever it takes to get paid work in the end. Beware that job-seekers and benefits look suspiciously on people who claim to be doing unpaid work while getting allowance. It’s probably better in the long run to tell them first before you do any volunteer work, in case they want to check it out. If you don’t say anything, there’s a risk you might lose some benefits or job-seekers allowance.







, Smile and nod, keep your head down and your mouth shut. Take the initiative when it presents itself and keep your mind fixed on a better result after this job. Professionalism and perseverance are the keys. Sulking, grumbling, whining and doing sloppy work will probably keep you in the job you hate for years.

, Study books at your local library about your dream job. Always be looking for something better. Remember that no one owes you anything, especially not a living. It all has to come from you.

You must continually change your resume to meet the expectations of each hiring manager for every position for which you apply. At the same time, it must also be an entirely honest document., Objectives are rarely read by employers. Sometimes they are even viewed to be an annoying filler. Instead of creating an objective, let your skills and experiences drive your resume.The layout of your resume should reflect importance. Put the most critical information first. Spend the most space talking about job-related skills and experiences. Keep any accountable results that directly relate to the job you desire., To keep your resume readable, avoid complicated designs and fonts. You may have to upload your resume to an applicant tracking system and sometimes more complex elements can’t be deciphered. This means your painstakingly-crafted resume won’t be seen by anyone at all.When keeping it simple, also keep it short. Don’t allow your resume to go longer than one or two pages. Recruiters will often become bored and stop reading early on., After your updated resume sits for a few days, reread it. Check for errors, typos, and formatting issues. Allowing it to sit unchecked for a period is vital; if you reread instantly after completion, you’ll often miss apparent mistakes. Let someone you trust read over your resume and give feedback. The more people you have reading your resume, the better chance you have at catching a mistake. One simple mistake could cost you an offer.Always remove any controversial or unnecessary information. This includes, but is not limited to, political stance, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs., By understanding how headhunters operate, you can make yourself easy prey. The best way to start is by searching for a local headhunting company in your area and contacting them. A simple phone call and introduction will allow them to insert you into their database of appropriate candidates., Social media is everything these days. Recruiters are constantly looking for good profiles and will reach out to candidates directly. Treat your online profiles just like a resume by keeping them current and updated. , Recruiters often attend professional networking events to meet clients and candidates. If you want to be found, you have to show up and take part. Don’t limit yourself only to recruiting workshops. Check local newspapers and recruiting sites for networking opportunities and open houses at local companies. Getting yourself out there helps to keep you relevant and your network expanding.Be visible and build your professional network. By being visible, you are more likely to make connections as people begin to associate your name with your work. Making connections will allow you to be headhunted. Purchase a simple pack of business cards and hand them out everywhere you go. Out for lunch? Leave a business card. Meeting an acquaintance? Leave a business card. The more you give out, the more likely you are to be discovered., Once you’ve found a headhunter, you may want to determine if they are useful to you, rather than signing on to the first one you find. Complete a list of objectives and questions. Be upfront in communicating your needs and don’t hesitate to ask questions.


When thinking of objectives, analyze your endgame. Determine your ideal job, salary, hours, field, and commute time. Knowing your “needs” “wants” and “do not wants” will help you communicate.In the list of questions, don’t be afraid to get into the nitty gritty. You want to be able to determine if this is the right person to be working with you. Ask about their credentials, placement success, any charges or fees, and their background.Never forget to listen to your gut. If the headhunter feels off, they probably are. If they are asking for money or endless amounts of your time, it is likely a scam.

, Whether it’s a message board you’ve found through a search engine, or it is attached to a career or networking site, check it. Headhunters often make posts regarding open positions and qualifying candidates. Sometimes headhunters will trade information and resumes.Even if you are unable to partake in the conversation, you may be able to find insider information that can help you pick or find the right headhunter.


Try checking recruiting, university alma mater or professional union websites for discussion boards., Recruiter directories are exactly what they sound like; directories where recruiters are able to register their own personal and business profiles, to help find candidates. Watch these sites regularly but don’t hesitate to contact a headhunter directly to start building rapport.Too many membership fees? If you’ve hit roadblocks in the finances department because of sites requiring payment to view, try your local library. Many libraries allow free access to recruiter websites., Once you’ve spent a few years working in your industry, you’ll have developed your own small network. Use this to your advantage. Call any mentors or bosses and ask them for a referral. Many headhunters will know the higher-ups in a particular field, since they will have years of experience.If there is a recruiter in your network, keep them in your pocket. Even when a headhunter doesn’t have a position for you, one can always come up. Help keep yourself in the forefront of their mind by referring candidates for positions that you are unsuitable for. Keep in mind, only refer trustworthy and quality candidates to prevent this tactic from backfiring and ruining your reputation., Sign up for any and every career website you can find, but be prepared to pay any associated fees. Many recruiters will frequent job sites to look for candidates. These sites will also have an overwhelming amount of traffic and profile. Pay a small amount of cash to cover membership fees.This will give your profile perks and allow you stand out against various competition with features like priority listing in search results.

, To open the advanced search on LinkedIn, make sure you are logged in. Then click the plus icon within the magnifying glass on the search bar., In the “Title” field, begin entering recruiter-related terms. For example, try searching “diversity OR employee referral OR recruiting OR recruitment OR staffing OR talent”. Keep in mind, the “OR” will separate the terms, so any new term should have an “OR” between it and the last term. The longer your search the better, as it will pull up any related profiles.If you have any local terms or slang used for recruiters, be sure to enter those as well.

, The “Industry” field allows you to search for people in a specific industry or area. Most recruiters select either “Staffing and Selection” or “Human Resources” for themselves. For extra coverage, also select “Other Industry Terms”. This will allow you to view any recruiters that go by their own categories., The “Relationship” field determines how the search network relates to you. If you select “1st connections” only people you know will be searched. “2nd connections” will search through your connection’s connections. Select all the possible options to ensure the network search is as wide as possible., Once you see the “Keyword” field, you want to type in any field-related terms. This allows you to search for recruiters who may not list that they are headhunters on their profile, but who work in your industry. This is where you want to enter in any key terms directly related to your career. For example, if you work in the banking sector, enter “bank OR banking OR accounting OR finance”. Again, the more terms you can enter, the better your result will be., Once you’re ready, hit the “Search” button. This will search LinkedIn using all your terms and selections. Now simply look through the results to find and contact your headhunters.

Be flexible.,
Remember, competition is stiff.,
Show you can have an immediate impact.,
Keep on looking.",How to Find a Great Job During a Recession2," Even though there’s always work to be found, job-hunting during a recession in going to be more difficult. The economy is shrinking and there is less of a need for labor. If you want to find a job, you’ll probably have to be willing to accept a broader range of options than you would otherwise have to accept. While it’s always hard to make an adjustment, you can acquire new sets of skills and broaden your network of professional colleagues by accepting positions with slightly different skillsets than you already have., When there are fewer jobs to be had, more people are going to be applying for each opening, meaning employers will have their pick of more highly qualified candidates than they would have during stronger economic times. Therefore, make every effort to be the perfect candidate. Do your best to analyze the needs of that particular company and what they need in that position and present your experience, temperament, education and accomplishments in a light consistent with those needs.Forget about the fact that there’s no such thing as a “perfect” applicant. Each time a company has a job opening in a recession, they are swamped with dozens, if not hundreds, of applications. In the first round, resumes are only given very superficial consideration. There’s a good chance that applicants that don’t seem to check all the right boxes won’t be given a second or third look, much less get an interview. It’s better to “fudge” the truth a little bit and explain it in the interview than it is to not get an interview at all.

, When the economy shrinks, businesses are more reliant on temporary hires, contractors, and consultants. One of the advantages these types of employees bring to a company is their ability to perform the work with minimal training. Nonetheless, a long term employee is generally of more value to a company than a temporary worker. They generally have more expertise, produce higher quality work, and are more motivated than temps or contractors. Show the company you can hit the ground running, and you’ll be in a much stronger position relative to a consultant or contractor than you might otherwise have been., It isn’t uncommon for employers to evaluate a new employee more stringently during the first few months of employment—and you should be evaluating them as well. It’s best to keep your options open, even after you’ve started your new position. Most of the time, the defects in a job don’t make themselves apparent until a few weeks into the position. It’s in your best interest to keep interviewing, even after you’ve started your new job.This can have benefits even if you decide to keep your new job, as you may be able to leverage a better paying job offer into higher pay in the position you have.

Look at the dental and vision/eye insurance.,
Note any accidental death and business travel insurance.,
Check for life insurance and disability insurance coverage.",How to Evaluate Employee Benefits of a Potential Job1," Start by looking at the general coverage for healthcare noted in the benefits package. Check if there are any monthly or per-pay-period costs for the overall benefits plan. If there is, it will usually be deducted from your take-home pay, often as a pre-tax deduction. Make sure the cost is reasonable and not something that will make a significant dent in your take-home pay.You should also notice who is covered as part of your benefits. Is it just you? Family members? Future family members, such as children? Make sure you know the limits and restrictions around your healthcare coverage.
Notice when each component of the benefit begins, such as the first day of work, thirty days after your start date, or a year into your employment.
Check if the general benefits can be taxed, where you will have to pay taxes on them at the end of the year. Often, life insurance is taxable.;
, Look at the type of medical insurance plan offered in the package. You may be covered under a preferred provider option, where you can pick your healthcare provider. Or you have a health maintenance organization option or another specific healthcare provider, such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Note which of your medical expenses are covered as part of your company health plan, such as preventative care like massage or acupuncture. Some plans will cover preventative care and some will not.You should also look at any deductibles offered, such as annual deductibles or per-office-visit deductibles.
Look for a list of co-pays, where your insurance pays a percentage of the medical costs and you pay a percentage of the cost out of pocket.
Notice if there are any exclusions or preexisting conditions, such as a health problem you had before you were covered by the insurance company. Some healthcare plans will disqualify you from certain services if you have a preexisting condition.
Some companies offer a Health Savings Account (HSA) as part of their employee's healthcare benefits. This is a tax-advantaged medical savings account that you can use to pay for your health needs.

, Read over what you are covered for in terms of dental care. Some benefits packages will cover dental preventative care like exams, X-rays, and teeth cleanings as well as surgical care like root canals. Note if the plan covers orthodontic care like braces. There may be deductibles, co-pay, and annual limits attached to your dental care under the package.You should also read over the benefit listed for vision and eye care. Some plans will cover expenses up to a certain amount for eye exams, eyeglasses, and contact lenses.

, As part of your benefits package, you may be covered up to a certain amount if your death is ruled accidental. The company may also provide business travel insurance, where you are covered if you are injured or have an accidental death while traveling on business.If this is offered for free as part of the benefits package, definitely opted in. You do not need to purchase additional coverage for accidental death or business travel as part of accepting the benefits package, unless you want to be covered more in this area.

, The benefits may cover the basic expenses in the event you pass away unexpectedly. Life insurance may be more beneficial the older you get, especially if you have children or a spouse. You can also often buy additional blocks of term insurance at the market rate if you want to be covered for more money upon your death.You should also check if there is disability insurance as part of the benefits package. There may be short-term disability options, which will cover sick pay and disability coverage for 90 days to a year. There may also be long-term disability, which will kick in after 90 days to a year.

Take your time.,
Consider the salary.,
Consider the benefits.,
Consider your title.,
Determine the quality of life the job is likely to offer.,
Find out about expenses.,
Consider your career path.",How to Evaluate a Job Offer," Ask for at least 48 hours of time. This will give you the opportunity to take a clear-eyed look at the offer, evaluate it, and weigh your new employer against the current.


You can also assess the various aspects of the job that you had overlooked till now in the race of getting selected. This time will serve you well, as you can find whether the job is a right fit for your long term career.;
, Your number one consideration would be the direct income being offered during the job. The base salary and other compensations should play an important role in deciding whether you want to pursue the new job or not.


Use salary comparison sites to get an idea about the existing salary trends in your industry and judge the offer in that light. Does your CTC consists more of base salary or does it comprise of variables as the larger share?
Think about when will you receive your paycheck. What will be the timings of your salary review? These are some of the most important salary related questions that one must ask before considering the job offer.

, Determine the different types of insurances that the company is willing to offer and the coverage details. In addition, make sure to clarify the new employer on retirement benefits being offered, if any.


The list of benefits that come with a job can be endless and varies from organization to organization as well as within industries. For example, joining a high growth startup will surely land you with some stock options along with a monthly salary. On the other hand joining an established organization may or may not come with any stock options.
If there is any doubt regarding the benefits, it is probably better to ask the HR person about it rather than make your own assumptions.

, Know what the company thinks of you. Wouldn’t you be surprised to know that while you considered yourself a fit for a senior role, the company is now offering you the position of a junior executive? And by chance, if you do accept such a role, it would put you push back your career timeline by at least a year or so. Therefore, make sure to read the title of the position being offered, and if there is any discrepancy between your expectations and the company’s offer, state it in clear words.

, Think about travel demands. What if your new job requires you to travel often, and forces you to lead a lifestyle where you literally are living out of a suitcase? A family person would certainly avoid such a lifestyle and job.


Know the work hours. Is the new job is a regular 9 to 5 work hours or does it offers you the flexibility of choosing the time of your work? Such factors are significant for some, while others simply don’t care. Nevertheless, it's better being cautious than feel sorry later on.

, A major consideration before settling for any new job is the expenses that you will be incurring in making yourself physically and mentally available for that job.


Know the location of your workplace. If the new office takes longer commuting than it would add to your monthly expense. Similarly, if your new job requires you to relocate to another city or country, make sure either you get the costs covered in your final CTC or be ready to make a huge dent in your savings.
If you are a family person, moving to a new country could be especially tricky as you would have to calculate your own cost of living in a foreign location, and also manage the costs for your family residing in the home country.

, Every time you get a new job offer it helps to do a little introspection on how it would affect your career path because ultimately it’s a successful career that you want and not just another job that helps you pay your bills.


If the role being offered is natural progression to what you have done earlier, it makes sense to accept the offer letter. However, if the offer adds little value to your CV or is just a lateral move from your previous roles, then it is better to let it go.

, This is often listed as high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree, certification or another form of qualification. Decide if you qualify based on the education level.


If you have the equivalent of an education level, such as a GED, instead of a high school diploma, you should qualify for the job based on education. If you are studying for a degree in the field, you may also qualify. For example, libraries often hire people who are studying for a master's degree in library science.

Be careful what you promise.",How to Earn a Living As a Professional Psychic," What are your qualifications? Here is a list of some ideas to add to your bio, or strive for to add in the future:


Your name and where you are from.
Your story of your first psychic experience. Keep this short, sweet and interesting.
Your past professional speaking engagements.
Any notable clients who don't mind you sharing their name.
How you are engaged in your gift. Do you also write, blog, or publish your experiences?
How you can be reached: website, phone number, social media.;
, Make sure they are consistent. It is not professional when you suddenly clam up when someone asks you how much your services cost, or if you make up rates on the fly. You may be asking too much or not enough which will also affect your reputation.


Look up competitors rates. Since you are just starting out it is not typical for you to charge the same as a psychic who has been building a reputation for 10 or 20 years. Undercut these rates a little.
Clearly write what each service offers and provide the price.

, Start doing full readings for friends and family, and in exchange request a written referral that you can share by publishing on your website or in advertising materials.


Also, ask if the friend or family member you are providing a reading for would allow it to be video taped. This will help any prospective clients get a better idea for what to expect from a reading.

, It isn't necessary to pay for a website, since there are free ones available that have the domain carriers name in your website title. Although, if you pay for the site you come across as more professional. Be careful when choosing a website provider. There are companies that charge an intro rate and then charge a lot the following year and some force you to pay for 3 years up front. Shop around for the right website provider for you. These are some (but not all) of the info that you should have on your website;


A home page. Usually this will have some graphics
An about page with your bio (see step 1)
A services page and rates (see step 2)
A contact page
Link to your blog
A mailing list option
A picture of you, if you feel comfortable
Images that make people feel like you're a serious psychic
An FAQ page (frequently asked questions)
Referrals and written praise  (often on your home page)
Link to YouTube videos of your readings
Link to your social media pages

, You are now a professional psychic. Professionals share their craft with others in many ways. Before, it was the days of trade magazines; now serious entrepreneurs opt to reach out to others in their field, those who hope to be in their field and perspective clients with professional blogs.


Unlike a website, it isn't necessarily unprofessional to blog using a free provider; however, if you already pay for a website domain name, you can easily fit your blog on its own page. Additionally, if you focus on keywords in your blog your site will appear higher on Google results, which will help build your reputation.

, Social media will add to your opportunity to show up on web searches and create an opportunity to network and become well known. You may want this professional social media to be separate from your personal social media. Social media like Facebook and LinkedIn will help you build your reputation as a serious psychic and not someone who is toying with the idea.


Make sure your photos are professionally focused and cropped from mid-arm. Dress in a suit or a professional style dress with hair done in a kept manner.
Choose network connections or friends which are supportive of your business and take you seriously. Use your social media to give tips and offer specials. Also use this opportunity to thank your clients for a good reading; however, only tag or use names with their permission of course.
Don't forget to post your YouTube videos to be shared with friends of friends and so on!

, Experts are often guest speakers. There are some places that will let you participate. For example, offer an entertaining session of your experiences as a psychic at the library, or a question and answer segment at a mystic store. Although you hope to make a living with your craft all year round, Halloween is the time that people are more likely to go to see a psychic speak. This is a good time to offer your speaking services.

, It can focus on your experiences, act as a “how to,"" answer questions, or be a combination of the three. You can charge for it or make it free. You can also run a free special on it to participate in free ebook mailing lists or even give it out on your website in exchange for them joining your mailing list!

, If you do not feel comfortable providing your home phone number or primary cell phone, there are other options available to you.


Download a free app on your cell phone which gives you a local phone number to use for free. Sometimes the number of minutes you can talk is limited so it is important to compare the options.
You can also purchase an internet phone number with a low monthly or yearly fee.
You can use the phone number that you were forced to pay for in a cable television/internet bundle. If you are concerned for privacy, make sure you know what comes up on the caller ID or if the number is connected to your address in the white pages.
You can purchase a disposable cell phone and only purchase minutes as you use them or pay a low monthly fee by not purchasing data or texting.
You can use a free answering service like Google Voice. However, this does not come across as professional when the caller can hear that you are using a free service.

, This is essential for building your reputation as a serious psychic. Give these out during any opportunity to help build your name and associate it with this field.

, This will help to build your reputation and help you to be taken more seriously. Ask around you may know many bloggers and not even realize it!


Also, if you contact the local newspapers and magazine (don't forget the free ones) around the time when they are planning out their Halloween editions they may be more likely to ask you to aid in an article.

, If you go to their house you can leave whenever you are ready. If they come over, expect to entertain them with food or beverages afterwards.

, Brick and mortar options which are safer for strangers or referrals of people you have never met.


At least one of your local libraries may have a room you can request often for free which are private.
If your business is growing you can rent a store front.
You can rent a space just when needed by looking for offices which are available for traveling professionals.
Offer a small percentage to your local mystic store. They might even make a sale if you are bringing people who are normally not in that store in for the first time or the first time in a while.

, Collect payment online or through your website.

, Once you have offered free readings to friends and family, ask them if they know anyone who might be interested in getting a reading or getting a reading for someone else. People often just think about the people closest to them, but they may be missing someone who is merely an acquaintance but would truly benefit. Try asking whether anyone they know is:


Getting married? This is a unique wedding gift and they may want to connect with someone close to them before the big day!
Graduating from college? Also a unique gift for a very confusing time in life.
Having a baby?
Celebrating a birthday around Halloween?
Recovering from grief?
Going through a break-up?
Having a big birthday party and might want an interesting attraction at the party?
Getting a booth at a fair and might be willing to split the cost?

,


Parents at your children's school or parents of your friends
Co-workers
Your bosses (be careful about conflict of interest)
Door men and maintenance people you run into everyday
Your waiter, waitress, hostess or bartender at every restaurant you go to
The valet
Your retail cashier
Your neighbors
People you went to school with
People from your book club, writing club, genealogical club, etc.
People on your sports, debate, team
Your pet's vet, the technicians, desk associates, etc

, Groupon and LivingSocial for example allow you to set your own price for services. You can offer them local/ meet in-person services as well as Skype services. You can offer a variety of specials in one advertisement. For example, you can offer a discount on one reading, three reading packages and five at the same time. Be sure to offer the best deal on the largest so that you can create a habit of consistent readings.

, Here are some suggestions:


Florist
Cafe/ coffee shop community boards
Library community boards
At your speaking events
At your local college community board
At wedding dress stores
Tanning salons
Bars
Liquor store counter

, Running specials or introductory readings can get extended business You might consider offering:


Bachelor/ bachelorette party group specials
Birthday party- each guest gets a 5 minute reading.
Office Christmas party specials
Mother's Day, mother/ daughter two for one specials
First reading can be half the usual price.
A special where they pay full price for the first but get another free reading. Specials like this create the experience that a reading isn't just a one time thing.

, For example, you might:


Offer your services at a non-profit raffle.
Find an independent sales representative who does make-up parties and offer to come at the expense of the representative to help attract more people to his/ her parties.
Create a “customer appreciation day” with your local mystic/ psychic store to offer free 5 minute readings at the expense of the store owner.

, Don't feel shy to place an ad online like Craigslist asking someone to help find clients for you. Provide cards with his or her very own discount code.


Also you may know a person who isn't afraid to hear the word “no.” This kind of personality is perfect for getting your referrals. Make sure you hold up your end of the bargain so he or she will be motivated to continue you helping you get more clients. Something is better than nothing especially in a business which has very low overhead.

, If so it is very easy today. Consider looking into companies which allow you to take payment online or through your cell phone or tablet. Fees vary, so compare.

, Some people won't use this, but it's an easy link from your website to collect payments without you needing to be present. You decide if this method works for you.

, When you collect cash, it is necessary to provide a receipt for services. These can be as complicated as a computer generated invoice or a carbon-copy pad from a dollar-store.

, Checks are slowly becoming a thing of the past with online credit processing and the inability for the receiver to know if there will be deficient funds until the check-writer is long gone. It is up to you whether you accept this form of payment.

, If you take your business seriously so will the IRS. Keep track of every reading and how much was charged. To offset your income, keep track of every bit of expense. Look up or contact an accountant about how to pay taxes and opportunities for write-offs.


For example, look up laws about how if your office is in your house.. Additionally, don't forget any expense like your business cards, fee for using space for readings, festival booths, website, giving referral money, office/ store front rental, phone number, Groupon/ LivingSocial fees etc all count against your income.

, You are allowed to do business as a sole proprietor and you are even allowed to use a “DBA” (or Doing Business As) name that you can get at your town or city hall for a fee of around $10.


If you want more protection, you can set up a limited liability company. This is more complicated and you may need help for this. The fee is higher too, but if you get sued your belongings in your name will not be effected. Only the belongings in your businesses name.

, Nowadays with all of the legal commercials people seem to think they have a right to sue about everything.

, Even though your services are very real, it is legally advisable to proclaim that your services are for “entertainment purposes only.” This gives you the right to exchange your product for money but protects you from having to refund the customer if the customer decides that it wasn't real. Consult a lawyer to discover if you should have a signed waiver before performing your psychic services.

Check if your costs were reimbursed.,
Avoid claiming a deduction if you’re unemployed a long time.,

Find tax help, if necessary.",How to Deduct Job Hunting Expenses," The IRS won’t let you claim a deduction if you’re trying to switch up careers. For example, you can’t work as a waitress and deduct expenses when hunting for a job as a secretary. Instead, you can only deduct expenses if you’re searching for a job in the same occupation.


You also can’t deduct expenses for your first job.;
, You also can’t claim a deduction if someone reimbursed you for the costs already.For example, the company you interviewed with might have reimbursed the cost of your airline ticket. In that situation, you can’t claim a deduction for the ticket.

, You can’t claim a deduction if there has been a substantial break since your last job.The IRS doesn’t define “substantial,” but use your best judgment. For example, if you’ve been unemployed for a long time, you probably shouldn’t try to claim the deduction., Some job hunting expenses are fairly common, and you can generally deduct for them:


You can deduct for the costs of preparing and mailing your resume.You can deduct employment and placement agency fees.
You can deduct long distance phone calls and faxes to potential employers.
You might be able to deduct travel expenses if the primary purpose of the trip is to look for a new job. If so, you can deduct for mileage, gasoline, and tolls.

, You can’t deduct all of your job hunting expenses. Instead, you can only deduct those that, when added up with your other miscellaneous deductions, total more than 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI).For example, your adjusted gross income might be $25,000. Your job hunting expenses are $750 and you have no other miscellaneous expenses. In this situation, your total miscellaneous expenses are 3% of your income. You can’t claim the first 2%, but you can claim the remaining 1%, or $250.
If your AGI was $25,000 but your miscellaneous expenses were only $500, you couldn’t claim any of your job hunting expenses.

, The IRS won’t automatically disallow a deduction without a receipt, but you’ll make things easier on yourself if you have one.

, Avoid paying with cash and instead put any expense on your credit card. Save your itemized bills that show how much you spent, the person you paid, and the date. You can use these as proof at tax time., If you travel as part of a job hunt, keep detailed notes about how much time you spend on the search versus time you spend on personal interests. Keep a journal and be as detailed as possible.


You might not be able to claim travel deductions if the primary purpose of your trip was not job related. However, your travel once you reach the destination is deductible.For example, you might fly to Florida for a vacation. While there, you take a taxi to a job interview. You can deduct the amount of the taxi.

, To see how much you can deduct, you should fill out Form 1040. Your adjusted gross income will appear on line 38.Adjusted gross income includes income from all sources, including:


Wages, salary, and tips
Alimony received
Ordinary and qualified dividends
IRA distributions
Unemployment compensation
Social Security benefits

, You report your job hunting expenses as a miscellaneous deduction on Schedule A. Complete lines 21 to 27 to see how much you can deduct from your taxes.You can find this schedule online at the IRS website. It is updated every year, so make sure to get the most recent version.

, In order to deduct job hunting expenses, you’ll need to itemize your deductions. However, check whether or not you’ll be better off taking the standard deduction. The current standard deduction for single or married filing single is $6,300. This is probably more than you spent on a job search.

, On Form 1040, you’ll enter your miscellaneous deductions on line 40., You might have questions about whether to itemize or whether you can deduct certain expenses. Meet with a qualified tax professional who can analyze your situation and offer tailored advice.


The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program might be able to help you. They provide free help to people who make $54,000 or less and to people with disabilities.

A person who works in your field can clearly explain the type of work you’ll perform. They can tell you what a typical day at your job will be like.
The individual who works in the industry may know about open positions that you can pursue. When you start to target specific companies, they may know people at those firms. Nearly all jobs will ask for references. Your contact can provide a reference for you.
People in your network can help you prepare for answers to interview questions. To find out more about interviewing skills, see: Prepare for a Job Interview.

, Put together the criteria you will use to look for attractive job opportunities. You can consider the type of position, the industry, the size of the company and the geographic location of the job.Say, for example, that you want to work as a marketing professional in the financial services field. You want to work for a mid-size company and you’d prefer to work in the Midwest.
Start with a simple Google search and identify some companies. You could, for example, Google “mid-size financial firms Midwest” and look at the results.
Reach out to your network and let them know about your job search criteria. They may be able to suggest some companies for you to consider.

, Use a company’s name to perform a keyword search. You should be able to access reviews, articles, books, papers, and other publications related to the company. Read these items to get more information about the company.Use social media to browse company profiles. If a company has a social media profile, read through the information and see who else is following the company. Evaluate this information to see if the company seems like a good fit for you. Do you believe in the company’s message?
See how the company treats its employees. Some companies, such as Zappos, focus so heavily on customer service that they will actually offer employees a bonus every year to quit. The idea is that employees who take the quitting bonus wouldn't be a good fit for the company to start with.Understanding the business's culture can go a long way to helping you decide if you'd be a good fit for it.
Read the company website. You can gain essential information about a company by reviewing the website. Start with the “about us” page. That page should give a brief history of the company and state its mission, vision, and philosophy. This information may help you determine if the company would be a good fit for you. Do you share their philosophy?
Do a quick search for available jobs. If the company website lists many job openings, that could indicate either high turnover or recent growth. Look for other clues as to which is the more likely explanation. Noting the length of time each job is posted may also be illuminating. If jobs remain open for weeks or months, the company may be struggling to find qualified applicants.

, Based on your research, create a target list of companies you would like to investigate. For now, don’t worry about whether these companies have jobs available; simply make a list of the best matches. You can refer to this list periodically, searching for any new job openings.Conduct company-specific Internet job searches. For each company, conduct periodic searches for job openings, using both the company’s website and broader employment websites. If you are actively looking for employment, run these searches every few days.
Perform searches on larger employment websites, such as Monster.com. You can narrow your results by adding keywords to the name of the company. For example, do a more defined search using “XYZ Company, project manager.”
Pursue each job lead that is a fit for your background and skill set. It may take months or years for you to find the right job opening at one of your target companies. If you’re willing to wait, you may be rewarded with an opportunity to find a job with your employer of choice.

Become involved in your community.",How to Start a Law Practice in the U.S.," If you intend to practice in an extremely small town, it may be necessary to be something of a generalist. However, in most cases, you'll build a stronger business if you specialize in one or two areas where your skills are strongest.


If you try to do everything, you run the risk that every other attorney will view you as a competitor, and this can make it difficult to build up a referral network. When you're just starting out, your referral network is crucial, because people often ask attorneys to refer them to an attorney in another practice area.For example, suppose you meet a family law attorney at a local bar association meeting. You intend to practice wills and trusts. Since people often create new wills or revise existing ones after divorce, the family law attorney offers to refer some of her clients to you when they need wills drawn up.
Consider focusing your practice in personal injury, criminal defense, family law, or the like. Your clients will be regular people who rarely if ever work with lawyers, and they won't be judgmental or expect you to work miracles. Instead, they tend to hire lawyers who they can relate to, and who they feel care about them and their case.;
, From the outset, decide whether you want to grow big and powerful or stay small. This will help you establish your goals and desired rate of growth.


If you want to start your own firm because you want a better work-life balance and you want to spend more time with your family, for example, you are going to build a different practice than someone who wants to be a major player in their field of law.

, You need to be able to identify possible difficulties before they become insurmountable problems. For example, if you know you have trouble with finances, consider hiring an accountant for your law firm rather than trying to handle it yourself.

, Writing down your ideas and understanding where you want to be can help you focus your efforts in the right direction.Your business plan will project three to five years into the future, so it's important to realistically assess your goals so you can stay on track to grow., Think about what kind of client you want to attract. Figuring out what they look like, how they behave, where they live, and even where they shop can help you make a lot of business decisions such as where to open an office and how to decorate it.For example, if you plan to open up an intellectual property boutique catering to up-and-coming musicians and independent record labels, you might not get as much benefit out of an office across from the county courthouse full of heavy mahogany furniture as you would a casual office in a dual-zoned residential neighborhood overflowing with young people.

, Informational interviews with local attorneys can help you gain business advice and learn planning and marketing strategies.

, Your ideal office location has a lot to do with the practice areas in which you've chosen to specialize.


For example, if you plan to be a civil litigator and spend most of your time in court, you would benefit from having an office within walking distance of the courthouse. You won't have to worry about traffic or finding parking when you can just walk to court.
Keep in mind how much space you'll need. For example, if you plan to meet often with clients in your office, you may need a dedicated conference room.Study the real estate market in the areas where you'd like to lease office space so you have a good idea of the market value of any available offices you visit. Set priorities for various property features so you know what you can't live without and what you can compromise on. Paying the lowest rent, for example, might not be of much benefit to you if you don't have adequate space.

, Depending on the area of law you intend to practice, you may be able to work from home for at least a short period of time while you're getting your law firm off the ground.


If you absolutely must have a separate office, consider using an office share company or leasing a suite of rooms from another firm., You need to plan for employee expenses, including payroll, health insurance, and worker's compensation insurance.


Early on, you should focus your staffing needs on legal assistants and paralegals who have experience. If they have too much experience, you may not be able to afford to hire them, but you also can't afford to hire someone who requires a lot of training. You need staff members who already understand the basics of working in a law office.
If your office is located near a law school, contact the school's career services office and see if you can get a law student to intern.

, You won't inspire much confidence if you open your doors to clients and your desk consists of 2x4s propped up on milk crates.


Whether you decide to start a high-tech paperless office or use the traditional paper file method of organization also will have an impact on the type of office space you need and how big your office will need to be.
When you budget your start-up costs for furniture and equipment, talk to your tax advisor to determine how those expenses can be deducted. Some equipment you can deduct the full cost of all at once, while other items have to be depreciated over a number of years., At a minimum, you need computer programs to manage your calendar and contacts, track your billing, and organize your digital files.


You also may want to subscribe to an online legal research system such as LexisNexis or Westlaw. These companies have different subscription levels so you can balance access to the information you need with a price you can afford.

, If you're going to focus on internet presence, you may want to hire a web designer or a social networking expert, at least on a freelance or temporary basis to get your accounts set up.


You also might consider hiring a copywriter or blogger to create informative copy for your website.
Depending on your practice area, you might consider targeted advertising online or in local publications that cater to your ideal client base.

, Your executive summary describes the founding of your firm, where it's located, and the focus of its practice, as well as goals and objectives for the future.You also should include a mission statement explaining what your firm is all about and why you're doing what you're doing.For example, suppose you want to provide low-cost legal services to a struggling neighborhood. Your mission statement would include details about your commitment to the community and your desire to see its residents prosper.

, Your business description should include the nature of your business and the specific marketplace needs you are trying to satisfy.


Explain your competitive advantage, whether it comes from your reputation and expertise, friendly staff, or ideal location.Your firm description also will include information on the ownership of your firm, how it is organized, and a brief summary of start-up costs. You'll want to include your assets, liabilities, and any existing funding or need for investment.Discuss your services in detail, your prospective clients, and who you think will benefit from your expertise., You're a lawyer, but if you're opening your own law practice you're also a business owner. Before you start your law practice, you need to study the area and find out how viable your plans are.


The market analysis report in your business plan should summarize where you expect your clients to come from and how they will find you. In other words, you need to develop and describe a marketing strategy that will attract all of those ideal clients you identified.
Use your market analysis to project your firm's growth over the next three to five years based on the success of your marketing strategy.Since the practice of law is a highly regulated profession, make sure you include practice restrictions and professional regulations as a factor in your market analysis.In addition to being a highly regulated profession, legal billing is an area in constant turmoil. It's important early on that you decide your firm's fee structure so you can have more confidence in your cashflow projections., If you plan on starting your practice as a sole practitioner, this might not be a very lengthy section of your business plan, but it still needs to be there.What type of business entity you choose initially depends primarily on whether you intend to go it alone or want to start out with a partner. Your state's laws or rules of professional responsibility may include restrictions against attorneys partnering with non-entities.
Keep in mind that some states don't allow attorneys to form LLCs or the like to shield themselves from personal liability.In this section of your business plan, you also may want to list the staff you plan on hiring, how much they will cost, and when you will expand your staff over time.For example, you may want to start out by hiring a paralegal part-time because you need someone who already knows basic court procedure and how to format a legal document. As the firm grows more established, you may be able to take on a couple of legal assistants who will need more training to be effective employees.

, The next section of your business plan needs to summarize all the important financial information, including analysis and projections for the next three to five years.If financial planning is not your strong suit, consider working with a financial advisor to plan your practice's finances.
Creditors and potential investors typically want to see projections at least five years out so they can assess the risk in providing money to you for your business., An appendix isn't necessary, but could be helpful especially if you are seeking funding. It would include documents such as your resume, credit history, licenses, and letters of recommendation., Call on some of the contacts you've made and ask them to read and critique your business plan. Their feedback can be crucial in developing a strong plan., Some states such as Wisconsin and Oregon require you to join the state bar association or legal society.


Even if your state doesn't require you to join the bar association, you still must maintain your license, which means paying whatever registration fees and privilege taxes are required, as well as completing the required number of hours of continuing legal education each year., Most states don't require law firms to have malpractice insurance, but it's still a good investment, and many states do require attorneys to disclose whether they have malpractice insurance.


Many states do require malpractice insurance for attorneys in firms organized as limited-liability business structures such as LLCs., An Interest on Lawyers Trust Account, or IOLTA, allows you to accept and hold funds for advanced fees or costs that belong to someone other than yourself. If your practice will require you to hold money for someone else, check your local rules to find out how to set up a trust account., Your city or county may require you to buy a business license, and maintain premises liability or other property insurance for your office. Check the applicable laws and make sure you're operating within the law.Particularly if you're working from a house or in a residential area, check the zoning ordinance and make sure you can operate a business from that location.

, Even if you are a sole practitioner, you need to get an employer identification number from the IRS for tax purposes, so you can file a separate tax return for your firm., Most people hit the internet rather than the phone book when they're looking for a lawyer, so building up your web presence is crucial to growing your business.Have a professional website that's pleasant to look at and easy to navigate. You can build your own website using a hosting company, or hire a professional web designer to build your site. Consider including informational articles or linking to a blog where you write about news and issues that affect your practice area.
Establish a social media network so you can interact with past and potential clients. Be careful with social media, though, as the Model Rules prohibit real-time contact with a prospective client.For example, if you're a family law attorney, it is not okay for you to reply to a tweet from someone who says she just caught her husband cheating and tell her you are a divorce attorney and can help her get a divorce.
Pick a domain name for your website that's simple and easy to remember, and use it for all your social media accounts. This helps you establish name recognition for your brand across the internet. Make sure the name is available everywhere before you lock it in. For example, suppose your name is Atticus Finch and you practice criminal defense. You might choose ""mockingbirdlaw.com"" as the domain name for your website. From there, you can create pages or accounts on social media networks such as Facebook or Twitter with the user name ""mockingbirdlaw."" This helps ensure you have a consistent presence on the internet and can be easily found by potential clients.
Monitor your internet presence carefully or consider paying for a service to do this for you. If you discover complaints or negative comments about you on the internet, respond to them promptly and do what you can to mitigate the damage.

, These organizations can connect you with more experienced attorneys in your practice area who can mentor you and help show you the ropes.


Ask if you can sit in on a planning session, an interview, or even a trial to learn how they work.
See if more established attorneys have any form documents or other resources they would be willing to share with you.
Talk to other attorneys when you attend seminars or other classes to fulfill your bar's continuing legal education requirement.

, Make connections not just with attorneys in your own practice area, but in other areas as well. This can help you gain referrals.

, In some practice areas, doing pro bono work can provide you with significant experience and get your name out there in the legal community.


For example, if you practice family law, consider volunteering at your local domestic abuse shelter to draft and file restraining orders for domestic abuse victims. Not only are you providing a valuable and beneficial service, but these women also may return to you as paying clients later on, simply because they know you and trust you.

, Being connected to the people in your neighborhood can be some of your best advertising. If people know you and like you, they'll be more likely to think of you when they need legal services, or to recommend you to friends.


Participate in activities you love and feel passionate about, regardless of whether they have anything to do with practicing law. Listing these interests in your bio on your website allows potential clients to get to know you a little as a person. For example, if you loved softball and played all through high school and college, see if there's an adult softball league in your community that you can join.

"
"
Discover (or re-discover) what you're really passionate about.,
Get feedback from family and friends.,
Do some soul searching.,
Visualize your perfect day.,
Consider what people ask you about on a consistent basis.,
Focus on what you want, not what you don't want.,
Don't forget to take a break.",How to Discover What You Really Want from a New Career," If your new career isn't something you could feel passionate about, then it's probably not the right choice for you. Think about what you enjoy doing in your spare time: your hobbies, what you like to watch on TV, what you like to read and study, and what you like to discuss with family and friends.;
, Talk to the people you trust, and ask them to give you an honest assessment of where they see you going in life (but be prepared; you might not like the answers you get). Also ask them what they think you'd be good at, what you'd be happy doing, and why. But be careful when asking people you work with these questions, especially if you plan on staying at your current job for awhile.

, Think back through your career and identify times when you felt really excited and happy with what you were doing. Times when you were energized by your work, and could hardly wait to get back to the office the next day. What was it about those times that made your work fulfilling? What would it take to recapture that feeling in your new career?

, This is a technique used by self-help gurus like Tony Robbins to help people focus on what they really want in life. Find a quiet place where you can be alone for 30 minutes or so, and then close your eyes and picture what your perfect day would look like, from the time you wake up to the time you went to bed. Who would you be with? What work would you be doing? What activities would you find stimulating and fulfilling? Be as detailed and specific as you can. Then write it all down in a notebook or journal.

, This is another clue as to what you're good at, and what you might find fulfilling in a new career (as long as it's something you enjoy doing). What things do you consider yourself an expert in, either at work or at home? If you could become a teacher in one topic, what would that topic be? Many people have turned their hobbies and part-time pursuits into successful careers.

, Too many people get caught up in what they don't like about their current job or career -- it's boring, they hate their boss, there's no room for growth, etc -- instead of focusing on what they do want out of a new career. It's been said more than once that positive thoughts lead to positive change.

, If you're upset or frustrated by your inability to pinpoint your ideal career, give yourself a break. Spend some quality time with your family or friends, take a long weekend trip, take a walk on the beach. You'll probably find your frustrations melting away, and often the answers to your questions will come to you at the most unexpected times.

Skilled workers and professionals: Who can apply;
,
Skilled workers are people who are selected as permanent residents based on their ability to become economically established in Canada.

,
Federal skilled worker applications received on or after February 27, 2008 are now assessed for eligibility according to a set of instructions issued by the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism.

,
You can find out more about the instructions in the Learn about section at the bottom of this page.

,
Your application will be reviewed in three steps.

,
According to the Minister’s instructions, your application is eligible for processing if:


you have an offer of arranged employment, OR
you are a foreign national who has been living legally in Canada for one year as a temporary foreign worker or an international student, OR
you are a skilled worker who has at least one year of experience in one or more of the occupations listed here.

,
If your application is eligible for processing, you must also meet the following minimum requirements to qualify as a skilled worker:


you have at least one year of continuous full-time paid work experience or the equivalent in part-time continuous employment, AND
your work experience must be Skill Type 0 (managerial occupations) or Skill Level A (professional occupations) or B (technical occupations and skilled trades) on the Canadian National Occupational Classification list, AND

Use family surnames.,
Use partner surnames.,
Choose more interesting surnames over plainer surnames.,
Consider the order of multiple names.,
Keep the firm’s name brief.,
Leave out surnames that are hard to pronounce or spell.,
Check your law firm’s initials.,
Discuss any potential names with your law partners.",How to Choose a Name for a Law Firm1," If you have a law firm with a family member, you might consider doubling the name to give a name to your law firm.


For example, Morgan and Morgan would make a good name for a law firm with parents and children or two siblings, or even husband and wife practicing together.;
, If you are staring your law firm with a few partners, use everyone’s last name to acknowledge all the partners.


Blandino, Smith, White and Edwards would work for a firm founded by 4 partners.

, If you have some partners with plain names like Smith or Jones, these names might not stand out to your clients. Names like Sugarman and Hoopendahl are more memorable. These might be a better choice for the first name in a series of partner names.

, Often, if you are using partner names for the firm, each attorney would like their name to be listed first. Obviously, only one name can go first, so the partners will have to agree on whose name is first.


Remember that if you have more than two names in your firm’s name, people will be most likely to use the first two names to describe your firm.
Because the first two names will be the most often used, these names need to be the most memorable, distinctive and easy to remember.

, If you are using names, try to limit the number of names you include. This will help people remember you.


Shorter or fewer names will be easier to include on signs, business cards and email addresses.

, A name such as Oleskewicz might not be the best choice for a law firm name. Your clients might not be able to pronounce this name easily.

, If you use a few partner names or a combination of words, be sure to check what the initials spell. You might not like the abbreviation for something like Peterson, Edwards and Edgemont.

, You may have to carefully negotiate with your law partners about which name to use for your firm. Make sure that you include your partners in the name choosing process and come to a decision about a name that everyone is reasonably happy with.

"
"
Do not use non-lawyers as partners.,
Don’t choose a name that implies a connection with a public agency.,
Do not use the name of any lawyer holding a public office.,
Do not falsely claim a partnership.,
Include names of retired or deceased law firm members.,
Check business name restrictions in your state.",How to Choose a Name for a Law Firm2," Under the Rules of Professional Responsibility,lawyers are not permitted to form a law firm with any non-lawyers acting as partners.


A law firm can employ lawyers and professional staff (such as paralegals and secretaries), as long as the professional staff does not own any interest in the firm.

, The Rules of Professional Responsibility states that false or misleading names for law firms are prohibited.Your firm’s name should not imply that you have a connection with a government agency. Likewise, don’t imply a connection with a public or charitable legal services organization.


For example, a law firm located in Denver could not be named “Denver Legal Clinic” because that name implies that the firm is actually a public legal aid agency.

, The name of a lawyer who holds a public office may not be used in a law firm name during any time that the lawyer is not actively practicing with the firm.


For example, the law firm name “Obama & Associates” would be considered false and misleading during the years of 2008-2016 because President Obama did not practice at the firm during his presidential terms.

, Lawyers cannot state or imply that they practice in a partnership or other organization when they do not.


For example, two lawyers, Clarence Smith and Stephanie Jones, may share office space, but they may not in fact have formed a law firm together. Therefore, they cannot use the name “Smith and Jones,” because that name suggests that they are practicing law together in a firm when they really are not.

, It is not considered false or misleading to use the names of retired or deceased partners. Just make sure that these individuals did in fact practice in the law firm.

, When registering the name of your law firm, check if your state has any further restrictions on business names.


For example, in Texas, no business may register a name that is the same as another business’s registered name.

"
"
Include your specialty in your law firm name.,
Think about branding when choosing a name for your law firm.,
Consider trademarking your firm’s name.",How to Choose a Name for a Law Firm3," If you specialize in criminal law, family law, tax law or other areas, consider choosing a name that reflects your area of legal expertise.


For example, The Davis Family Law Group signals that your firm specializes in family law.

, A long name might be used professionally, and then shortened when used in marketing and advertising materials.


For example, a firm legally called Legacy Tax & Trust could simply be called Legacy by its clients and partners.

, If the branding associated with your firm name is extremely distinctive, you may consider trademarking the firm name and the brand.


To trademark your business name, simply visit the United States Patent and Trademark Office website. There is a form available online that will register your trademark. Download this form and fill it out.
The form will require you to provide information about your business.
Additionally, the fee to trademark a business name is between $275 and $325.

Get feedback from trustworthy sources.,
Be aware of negative associations.,
Keep the name professional.,
Make sure the name makes sense.,
Consider names of other law firms in your area.,
Avoid alliteration.,
Anticipate growth.",How to Choose a Name for a Law Firm4," Ask a few close friends or business associates to give you feedback on your list of possible names. Give them at least 3-5 names to choose from. Ask for honest opinions and reasons for why they like or dislike certain names you propose.

, Your community’s population will be the ones to use your service. Make sure you get feedback from a few members of the community to understand if there are any negative associations with your firm’s name.

, Creative names can work in your favor, but remember that you are providing a professional service, and clients need to take you seriously.

, Don’t just make up a word or name. This will probably confuse people.


If your firm’s name is not immediately obvious to people (such as using your last name), you should be able to explain why you chose the name.

, You do not want to name your own law firm something that is too similar to a competing firm. Choose something original that will stand apart from your competition.

, Lewis Legal Lords may sound cute, but people rarely look for that quality in their attorneys, and having a silly name may hurt your business.


People want an attorney who takes the practice of law seriously. They also want someone who maintain a professional business, rather than someone who jokes around a lot.

, Make sure your name is broad enough to include areas your law firm might grow into.


For example, if you are currently specializing in divorce, rather than naming your firm Davis Divorce Law, consider using Davis Family Law.

Torts class is a required first-year law class, but if you plan to practice personal injury law you should take courses in your second and third years on insurance, medical malpractice, products liability, and workers' compensation law, as well as courses such as evidence and trial practice that focus on litigation.Since you want to open your own law firm, you may want to take some business law classes.If you don't have a business background, you also might want to take some classes at a nearby business school.;
, Before you take your bar exam, you must complete the bar exam along with any other state requirements.


Since these requirements vary from state to state, you should check with the board of bar examiners in the jurisdiction where you want to practice. Get a copy of the application and read through it well in advance of the deadline to register, so you have a sense of the questions asked and have time to gather the information you'll need to complete it.Most states also require you to take the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam, a multiple-choice test that measures your understanding of the model code of professional ethics.In addition, your bar application asks a number of questions about your background so the application examiners can review your character and fitness for the practice of law. You must provide information yourself, and typically include both personal and professional references., The bar exam is a two- or three-day test measuring your knowledge and understanding of basic legal concepts.


Most commonly, you will spend one day taking the Multistate Bar Examination, a 200-question multiple choice test standardized for all states. The second day, you will take essay tests focused primarily on the law in the state where you've applied to practice.A passing score on the bar exam is essential to being licensed to practice law in your state., Your local bar association and other groups related specifically to personal injury law can provide valuable resources as you start your law firm.


Professional associations can connect you with experienced attorneys who can give you advice when you have a particularly tricky case. Additionally, many practice areas have group listservs you can send questions to and get multiple answers from attorneys in your community with experience., Particularly if you intend to apply for small business loans to start your law firm, you must have a solid business plan that outlines your assets, projected expenses, and marketing and growth plans for the first five years of operation.


Generally, your business plan should include an outline of the structure of your firm, the services you plan to offer, administrative functions such as personnel, accounting, and payroll, a marketing plan, and projections for income and growth.Your state or local bar association may have more information on how to build your business plan, or you can talk to established solo practitioners or even friends you have who went to business school.As part of your business plan, you should decide how you're going to organize your law firm and include those costs in your start-up expenses. For example, if you want to establish an LLC, you will have to register with your state, pay registration fees, and file organizational documents.You also might consider having your plan critiqued by other lawyers who have started their own firm. They can point out expenses or issues you might have missed., When you're starting out, it may be tempting to take any business that comes your way, but the best plan for solid growth is to focus on one or two specific areas where you can specialize and become an expert.Even personal injury law is a rather broad area. There are personal injury lawyers, for example, who only take medical malpractice cases, or who specialize in auto accidents. Picking a particular specialty enables you to learn more detailed information and come to understand the subtle nuances of certain cases.

, Generally you should make sure you have at least enough to keep yourself and your business running for at least a year while you build your practice.Generally, how much money you will need depends on your personal expenses as well as the projected expenses of running your firm.
As a personal injury attorney, you probably will be handling most of your cases on a contingency fee basis. Since you might not see any income from these cases for awhile, it's good to have operating funds available for a longer period of time.Make sure you include the costs of maintaining your license in your start-up costs. Most states have minimum hours of continuing legal education that must be completed each year, as well as bar dues and licensing or privilege taxes. If you are a member of various professional organizations, you also may have annual dues you must pay to keep that membership., For a personal injury law practice, having a location that is accessible to clients is far more important than your office's size or whether you have a prestigious address.


If you are a personal injury attorney, you should assume that a large percentage of your clients will be disabled. Look for an office space that has ample parking and not a lot of sharp corners, narrow hallways, or stairs. For example, while many solo attorneys and small firms use houses to set up their office, this may not be the best option if the only parking is on the curb of a residential street, and clients must climb the porch stairs to reach the front door.
Since you also want an inexpensive location, you might be able to find an existing law firm that's willing to rent a few rooms for you to use as your office. Another option would be to get together with a few other attorneys starting a solo practice. The benefits include shared utility and building costs as well as the ability to share basic personnel such as receptionists and legal assistants.If you're able to lease space from an existing practice, it could eliminate or substantially lessen the cost of buying or renting furniture for your office., In addition to malpractice insurance, consider buying renter's insurance and business interruption insurance to protect your investment.


Since you'll be dealing with potentially litigious plaintiffs, the need for malpractice insurance is obvious – not to mention the fact that a growing number of states require law firms to carry it.Business interruption insurance will save you from financial ruin if there is a catastrophic event, and renter's insurance will protect your business assets from water damage, fire, or theft., Your website probably will be the first thing potential clients see, so it should be informative and easy to navigate.


Choose a domain registration service and register a domain that's intuitive and easy to both communicate and remember. Avoid a domain name with a bunch of hyphens or other special characters, as these can be confusing when people see them in print and easy to forget.
Keep your name simple and unique to you rather than trying to make it creative or fancy. For example, if your last name is Sullivan, ""Sullivanlaw.com"" or ""Sullivanlawfirm.com"" would be potential domain names that are simple and easy to communicate and remember.If you don't have the resources to hire a full-service firm to design your website, you can use the hosting and design services available through the company from which you buy your domain name.
Once you've set up your website, make sure it's being indexed by the major search firms so potential clients can find you., Outfit your office space with the pieces necessary for you to work there efficiently and effectively.


Make sure you have a server with enough capacity to handle the documents you will amass during discovery for your cases. You also need at least one desktop computer that you can rely on for several years, as well as other computers as necessary for whatever staff you may want to hire.You also should consider investing in case management software that will enable you to manage all your documents, organize your cases, and keep track of your deadlines and court dates.This is especially true if you don't anticipate having the means to hire a paralegal at start up who would be able to take care of these tasks for you.
Avoid spending money if you don't have to spend it. For example, the email client that came with your computer probably will suit your needs and won't cost you any additional money. Paying for additional applications or software just to organize your email only bloats your start-up costs. Learn how to use the applications you have before you decide you need to buy something different., Before your first clients step through the door, make sure your phones are working and you have a secure internet network to protect your information.


High-speed internet is a must, as is a private network behind a firewall with adequate virus protection.
You also might consider setting up a dedicated cell phone for your work that you can synch with your office calendars and your office's phone system., Social media networks, if used properly, can provide your firm with valuable networking opportunities and free advertising.


Keep in mind that there are a lot of lawyers out there. Use your social media accounts to emphasize your personality and differentiate yourself from the masses.You also can use social media to share practice news such as big wins and educate people on their rights and the legal options available to them if they are in an accident.

, Making connections as a trusted member of your community can help ensure that people will come to you when they need a lawyer.Networking with people in your community, such as through volunteer services or other events, can be more beneficial than spending money on splashy marketing campaigns. Especially when people have had their lives torn apart by a recent accident or injury, they are more likely to call on someone they already know and trust than a flashy attorney they only know from TV commercials.

, Many local and state bar associations have referral networks you can join so other attorneys can help you build your practice.


Referrals from other attorneys can bring in stronger cases and enable you to spend less time and money on advertising and marketing. Becoming active in your local bar association or your state trial lawyers' association will help you make connections with other attorneys. If they have a client with a case for which they think you are better suited, they will send the client your way.Paying a referral fee can be a good way to boost the number of referrals you get, but make sure you check your state's ethics rules first so you know what you're legally allowed to do., Search services such as Martindale Hubbell allow people who need an attorney to find someone local who best suits their needs.Additionally, having a high rating on Martindale Hubbell can help boost your reputation, bringing you more referrals.Other associations and interest groups such as AARP also have legal search and referral networks that can bring you business if their members have a need for the services you offer., Providing information and explaining complex legal topics in layman's terms can help people understand their case and determine whether they need a lawyer's assistance.


Building a successful blog not only gets your name out there, but can help you establish credibility as an expert in your field. You can write posts ahead of time and queue them to run on a daily or even weekly basis. Then set up your Twitter, Facebook, or other social media accounts to share a link to your blog post."

Become a teacher for a local community college or lifelong learning center.",How to Market a Law Firm1," Give more than 1 card if you believe the client may recommend you to a friend or family member. Use the card when you are networking.;
, The legal profession requires you to maintain a high level of integrity and some community involvement. You will meet other professionals that may be in need of your services or can recommend someone who is.


Popular choices for community networking are the chamber of commerce, rotary clubs and other non-profit boards. Holding the position of chairman, secretary or treasurer will give you increased recognition in the community; however, it can produce substantial work in addition to your practice.

, Many of these papers hire columnists to answer questions or articles about popular law subjects. Working as an expert will raise your community profile and refer readers or viewers to your firm.

, Speaking engagements are an excellent way to recommend yourself while giving excellent advice. Consider speaking to senior citizen groups, high schools, library events and serving as an expert on panels.

, Send birthday cards or notes of congratulations to other lawyers and business people who are in the news.

, Informal partnerships with other lawyers can be an extremely effective way of getting new clients. If you specialize in patent law, trade referrals with family lawyers, immigration lawyers and bankruptcy lawyers in case their clients need a new someone who specializes in a different type of law.

, Give them extra business cards and free legal help. If they have websites or blogs, ask them to link to your websites.

, Your customer service skills, knowledge and hard work will be the best legal marketing tool you have. Go the extra step to make sure you are someone a client will recommend.

, Although these are usually low-paying positions, they give you access to people in the community who might not have heard of you. You will be able to show your expertise and earn potential new clients every time you teach a new class.

Invest in the workplace.",How to Market a Law Firm2," This job should be in the hands of a professional who understands what demographics you are trying to reach and what you want to project to the public. Once you have your logo, ask the designer to create signage, business cards, letterhead, envelopes, brochures and pricing sheets.


Produce business cards for every member of your staff. The more business cards that get passed out with your logo, the more brand recognition you will have.

, Include a handwritten note to all current clients. Consider sending them to organizations with donations or to prospective clients.

, Your ad can easily get lost in a large daily newspaper, but it will be easy to find in a church or hospital bulletin. These ads cost far less than those in major publications.

, A visual of your logo or your face in the legal section of the yellow pages will make a bigger impression than a text listing.

, Pay for website analytics that track where people are finding your website name. Ask new clients where they heard of you, so you can focus on repeating successful legal marketing tactics.

, Gather emails from all your clients, friends, co-workers and more. Offer a free consultation to encourage new clients, and send up quarterly firm updates with expert tips that clients can use.


Take extra precautions to keep your client's emails confidential. If your website does not offer a newsletter service, you can pay for a low-cost newsletter service like Vertical Response or Constant Contact. This service allows you to upload email addresses but does not list them on the emails themselves.

, Few social media accounts are a good place for professional contact with the community. LinkedIn provides the exception because it allows you to interact while sharing professional information with others.

Put it in writing.,
Be appreciative.,
Highlight the positives.,
Give a simple, solid reason.",How to Deny a Job Offer1," A letter lends formality and grace to your interaction. Thank the potential employer for the opportunity. Then, tell the truth about why you accepted another offer.It may be tempting to deny the offer verbally. However, a letter or email is usually more professional.


Write an email or a typed letter. Do not send a text message or instant message. Do not give the employer a handwritten note. Be professional.;
, Personally thank the recruiter for the offer. If you've gotten far along in the interview process, then the recruiter has likely spent at least a few hours considering your application, your references, and your resume. If you want to be polite, make sure to acknowledge this effort.Say, ""Thank you so much for offering me the position. I truly appreciate the time and energy that you've put into explaining the role and answering my questions.""
Say, ""Thank you for the interview and the offer. I appreciate that you've been so helpful and honest about the realities of this role and the inner workings of this company. I know that you've put a lot of work into guiding me through the process.""

, Begin with a cordial introduction. Then, follow up by mentioning the positive aspects of the position you are declining. You might talk about the smooth process, the well-crafted interview questions, and the generous offer. This may leave the hiring manager feeling a bit better about the situation., Keep it short and sweet. In one or two sentences, explain the honest reason that you're declining the job. This applies whether you are taking a job somewhere else, or you just don't feel that this job is right for you right now. If you've put a lot of time into this interview process, consider giving a more in-depth reason.Say, ""After a lot of thought, I've decided to take a job at another company,"" or ""Your company seems like a lovely place to work, but I don't think that it will take me exactly where I want to be professionally."" You can say, simply, ""I don't think that this job is the right choice for my career goals at this time.""
Don't get into the gritty details of why you don't want to work at this company. There's no need to explain the things that you found off-putting about the job. Don't talk about the exciting job you're taking at another company.

In some states, you might be limited as to what structure you can form. Come up with your checklist for deciding your business structure:Find state requirements, if any
Analyze the benefits and costs of each potential business structure: sole proprietorships, partnerships, professional corporations, limited liability companies
Discuss benefits of each structure with a certified professional accountant
Choose your firm name
Gather forms to create business structure
Find the fee to file forms
Obtain a federal Employer Identification NumberRegister with your state Supreme Court (if necessary)
Obtain necessary business licenses;
, You’ll also want to include on your checklist the steps necessary for financially operating your law firm.You should consider including the following on your checklist:


Consider funding needs
Locate sources of credit (credit unions, banks, personal or business loans, etc.)
Open a bank account
Review ethical rules on safekeeping client property
Create a trust account for client funds
Enroll your trust account with your state’s bar
Draft a budget for the law firm
Research malpractice insurance

, After you create your legal structure, you’ll need equipment to get off the ground and start running your firm. Think about what you’ll need to buy. If you’ve worked at another firm, then identify the equipment you used regularly. Your checklist might read something like this:Locate acceptable office space
Consider office sharing
Purchase computer and printer
Research costs of Westlaw or LexisNexis

, If you’ve never run a business before, you might be surprised at how much you will rely on computer office systems to make everything run smoothly. You will want to find providers for the following:


Email
Calendaring systems
Accounting software
Billing and time tracking software
Filing system
Conflicts checking system
Payroll service (if you have employees)

, To start your law firm, you’ll need some basic forms. You should draft these ahead of time so that you can devote more time to actually serving clients once you open. Consider the following:Engagement and non-engagement letters
Fee agreements
Client intake sheets
Client survey forms
General client correspondence forms and notices

, You’ll want actionable steps to take regarding your advertising.Of course, the type of advertising you use will depend on how much money you have, as well as your practice area. But you should include the following on your checklist at a minimum:


Research cost of website creation
Have business cards made
Design flyers
Research paid advertising, such as Google Adwords, Yellow Pages ads, radio ads, etc.
Join lawyer referral services (both bar and private referral services)
Draft blogs or articles
Give speeches

, You might need staff—or not. Some lawyers who started their own firms swear that staff is an unnecessary expense, especially when starting out.However, assessing your staffing needs should be on your checklist. As your firm grows, you’ll definitely feel the need for help.


Contact staffing agencies
Advertise for staff
Reassess staffing needs periodically

, Opening a firm is a great accomplishment. But you’ll need to continue to invest time and money to stay credentialed as a lawyer. You should map out the different steps you’ll need to take. Include the following on your checklist:


Satisfy Continuing Legal Education (CLE) courses
File required corporate forms with your state
Renew law license annually

, Find someone who started their own law firm a year or so ago. Ask them to lunch and pick their brain about what steps you’ll need to take in order to open your new law firm. Take a rough draft of your checklist and revise it as necessary.


Ideally, you should meet with several people. Not everyone’s experience is the same.
You can find new lawyers by asking around or by going onto your local bar association’s listserv. Introduce yourself and ask if they can spend some time talking to you.
Get their business card so that you can reach out to them in the future. If you need to hire temporary staff or find administrative office software, they will be a handy source of information.

, You can easily create your business entity by completing some forms with your state’s Secretary of State office. To form a personal corporation, you’ll file Articles of Incorporation. To create an LLC, file Articles of Organization.


States regulate what form a law firm can take. For example, some states won’t allow you to form a regular corporation. Instead, you must form a “professional corporation.” Read your state’s ethics rules to find out how your firm can form and what kind of business name you can use.
If you are forming a partnership, then you should really consult with a business lawyer. You’ll need a partnership agreement in place before you even open your law firm.

, Get your federal tax identification number from the IRS at this website: https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online. You’ll need this number to open bank accounts and file your taxes.

, You’ll need a business license from your state tax collector’s office. Depending on where you are located, you’ll also need to get a license from your county or city government. You should call and check.


If you want to advertise your legal services, some states might require that you register with your state’s Supreme Court. For example, Illinois has this requirement., Lenders will want to see a business plan before extending any credit. However, a business plan also helps you stay on track and reassess your business strategy. The Florida Bar Association has a simple business plan for law firms available here: http://www.floridabar.org/TFB/TFBResources.nsf/Attachments/82B1FA3C594FD03D85257C210053623C/$FILE/LOMAS%20Sample%20Business%20Plan.pdf?OpenElement. You can use this as a guide when drafting your own. Include the following in your business plan:A general description of your law firm. This will help you focus on what kind of law you will practice and who your clients will be.
Your financial plan. As best as you can, project your gross receipts and estimate your overhead costs.
Partnership or management agreements. If you’re a solo, you won’t need this. Instead, you’ll simply describe how you manage your firm. However, larger firms need to lay out the management structure.
Your marketing plan. Here you’ll identify your client base, your methods of advertising, and how you will increase your profile.

, Once you have your tax ID, go to a bank and ask if you can open a business account. They will want to see your business documents (such as Articles of Organization) as well as your tax ID.Don’t forget to create a separate client trust account. You must deposit retainers and client property in this account. Commingling client assets with your own business or personal assets is an ethics violation, and state bars have begun to crack down on this.
Your client trust account must be an IOLTA account, which stands for “interest on lawyer trust account.” Only certain banks have these accounts, so check ahead of time before opening it.
In many states, you need to enrolled your client trust account with your state bar association. Typically, you have to fill out a form and mail it to your state’s bar., Working from home is cheaper than renting, but it isn’t an ideal setup for everyone. It can be awkward inviting a client into your home, and zoning might not let you run a home office out of a residential area.If you want a home office, think about the following:


Is your office secure? Many home offices have a door that leads directly into the office. You probably don't want people walking throughout your home.
Can clients move around your office? Is it really accessible?
Is there a bathroom clients can use? Think about any office you’ve visited—the dentist’s, the doctor’s, etc. There’s usually a bathroom. Where will your clients go as they wait for you?

, Another great option is to share an office with another lawyer. Sometimes lawyers advertise on Craigslist or on a state bar association listserv. It's often cheaper to rent space with someone else.


If you share office space, then appreciate the dangers. You must ensure that the public understands that you are not in a partnership with the other lawyer. For example, don’t use the same letterhead or signage.You must also pay heightened attention to potential conflicts. Specifically, you shouldn’t represent clients opposed to clients represented by the other lawyer.
Also be careful about sharing support staff. This can create conflicts issues as well.
Your state bar association may have published ethics opinions on sharing office space with other lawyers. You should find them and read them before entering this arrangement.

, If you choose to rent an office space yourself, then come up with your list of requirements first. This will save you time by eliminating unacceptable office spaces. Consider your needs:location and proximity to parking
size
janitorial services
cost
reputation of landlord
location of other attorneys

, You can find detailed checklists online listing dozens of hardware you’ll supposedly need to start your law firm. Many of these checklists seem to describe the hardware needs of large law firms. If you’re starting out small, then buy “all in one” printer systems that combine printing and photocopying.


You can also skip the fax machine.Instead, use a service like RingCentral, which allows you to receive and send faxes by email.

, Your budget will drive your purchasing decisions. If you are opening a new firm with fifteen employees, then you’ll probably want landline phone numbers for all lawyers and assistants. You will also need voicemail or messaging services.


If you're a solo, then you can use a cellphone. Make sure to get a separate cell phone for your business use. You don't want to answer the phone thinking it's your mother when it's really a client.

, It’s best to buy a laptop when starting out. You can use it in the office and also carry it with you when you go to court or travel. If you buy a desktop, you’ll also need a laptop, so it’s cheaper to go with the laptop.


You should also dedicate a laptop to your firm and not use it as a personal laptop. You don’t want to accidentally email confidential information or accidentally host something on Google Docs that shouldn’t be shared. You’ll reduce the likelihood of divulging something if you dedicate one laptop solely to work.
Remember you need a way to backup client files. Popular backup services include Mozy and Carbonite., As a law student, you probably used Westlaw or Lexis, which provides their services to law students for free. If you went to a firm, you probably continued using them without thinking of the costs. As a law firm owner, you now need to consider the costs of buying these subscriptions. Contact a representative and discuss.


Pricing information is hard to find online. As of 2015, Lexis provided a teaser rate of about $50 for a solo practitioner to access their state's decisions. This increased in the second year (by about $100) and then increased in the third year to several hundred dollars a month.
If you don’t want to buy a subscription, then there are free alternatives. However, you need to research them thoroughly. For example, you can find cases on Google Scholar, but it doesn’t provide anything like the service Westlaw or Lexis. Many bar associations also offer Fastcase. You should use it first to see if it’s acceptable.
You can also locate your office near a law library. However, the library might only have leather bound Reporters.

, There are some “all in one” systems that will handle billing, timekeeping, and conflicts checks. Contact your state’s bar association, which might recommend packages. You also could qualify for a discount if you belong to the bar association.


Some of the more popular timekeeping, billing, and invoicing products include Chrometa and Bill4Time., You can design your own website using basic templates. If you can afford to hire a designer, then do so. The more professional your website looks, the better.


You can buy domain names from companies like GoDaddy. They also have packages that include email addresses.
It's better to have an email that goes to your firm than to a Gmail or Yahoo account. The address michael.jones@joneslaw.com looks more professional than MikeJ12344@gmail.com.

This person could be a friend, a co-worker, or a family member. Make sure, however, that he or she would actually be a good fit for the job.


If you recommend someone who would be a good fit for the position, you are proving that you are willing to go beyond a job description. This is something that hiring managers remember.

, Ask the client about long-term goals and make sure that your website design facilitates expansion as necessary over the years to come.

Highlight items that you would like to mention specifically or summarize in your introduction. , Identify the most important skills that the employer is looking for and make notes of these so that you can incorporate them into your introduction. Mentioning these things will remind employers of why they selected your resume and it will help intensify their sense that you are a good fit for the job., Be honest and be yourself, but there is nothing wrong with highlighting the aspects of your professional experience that your potential employers will be most interested in. Thinking about what your potential employer will want to hear will also help you to decide what to leave out or minimize in your introduction., To develop your introduction and figure out what you should include, ask yourself some questions. Who are you? Why do you want to work for this company? What skills and professional experiences do you have that qualify you to work here? What do you hope to accomplish in your career? Write out your answers to these questions and use them to help craft your introduction.You might start with something like, ""I recently graduated from ____ with a degree in ____"" If you have any honors, slip those into this opening line as well. If you are a seasoned professional, you might try ""I have been working as a ____ for ___ years."" You could also provide a little personal information in your introduction, such as ""I am an avid ____ musician and music lover.""After your opening, talk about your skills. Say something like, ""I excel at ____ and ____."" And then, offer an example of a project you worked on that demonstrates your skills in this area. Finally, mention your career goals and offer a transition into the conversation about how you might work on those goals within the company. Say ""My goal is to ____ and I am excited to discuss how your company might offer me opportunities to ____."" , Get creative and think of a way to start your introduction that will help your interviewers remember you. Choose something that fits who you are. For example, if you love to read you might start by saying that you identify with a famous literary character and then explain why by listing your skills. Or if you are extremely tech savvy and want to highlight that aspect of your skill set, you might begin by mentioning what comes up when you Google yourself and use then provide more details about yourself and your skill set., To make sure that you will remember all of your key points, turn your notes into a paragraph long (3-5 sentences) introduction. Write your introduction out exactly how you plan to say it. Start by providing basic details about yourself (who are you?), then move into details about your professional skills and experiences, and then finish by briefly stating your major career goals. This last part is especially important because it is your opportunity to tell your interviewer why you’d be a good fit for the job without saying it so explicitly., Revise your introduction paragraph to see what might need simplification or clarification. Your introduction should be concise, yet thorough. Remember, your potential employer is not looking for a ten minute presentation about you, just a quick overview of who you are. , Reading your introduction out loud will help you to prepare to introduce yourself as well as check for any minor inconsistencies or things you forgot to mention. , While you do not need to memorize what you have written word-for-word, you should at least memorize your key points and the order in which you want to give them. , Practice make perfect! Practice giving your introduction several times until it does not sound rehearsed anymore. You may also want to enlist the help of a friend to listen to you and provide feedback on how your introduction sounds. , Even though it might make you feel a little odd to watch yourself, you will benefit from hearing what you sound like and seeing how you look when you are giving your introduction. , Write down your main talking points on an index card and keep it with you so that you can easily refresh your memory before an interview. Having this card with you will help you to feel more secure as well, since you can always glance down at the card if you get nervous. , Take a deep breath and head to the interview. You’ve prepared extremely well for the introduction part of the interview, so you can rest easy that you are set up to make a great first impression. But keep in mind that even if you are a bit nervous, it’s okay. It will only show your potential employer that you really want the job., Don’t hesitate or stand around when your interviewer invites you in. Simply walk confidently into the room and sit across from your interviewer unless he/she directs you to do otherwise. While you are sitting, do not fidget with your hands or shake your leg. Fidgeting sends a clear message to your potential employer that you are nervous. , Make sure your handshake is firm (but not hand crushing) and keep it short. Two or three shakes is sufficient. Also, try to warm up and dry your hands before the interview so that your interview is not shocked by freezing cold or sweaty hands. , Your interviewer may want to engage in a bit of small talk before the interview begins. Just smile and be yourself. Don’t worry about discussing your skills until the interview officially begins. , Even if you are very nervous, making and keeping eye contact with your interviewer will make you seem more confident. Don’t stare, but look your interviewer in the eyes when he/she is talking to you. Looking around the room or looking down are obvious signs that you are nervous. , When your interviewer asks you to introduce yourself, don’t hesitate. While it is fine to pause when your interviewer asks other more difficult questions or to collect your thoughts while providing an answer, pausing during the “tell me about yourself” portion of an interview is a bad idea. Pausing during this early stage of the interview process may give your interviewer the impression that you are unprepared or that you simply don’t know your strengths very well.

, Don’t ramble or add onto the introduction that you so carefully crafted before your interview. You may end up sounding repetitive or nervous if you talk for too long. Just say what you have planned and rehearsed and then stop talking. Your interviewer will ask you if he/she wants to know more or if you need to clarify something., Even if you feel like your introduction didn’t sound as good as when you practice at home, keep in mind that you have been offered an interview because you are qualified for the job. Don’t beat yourself up for something small you did or said, focus on what you did well instead. "

Write down a list of everything you want in your next job.Limit yourself to everything you can write on one page, and try to list at least one quality or characteristic you want in relation to salary expectations, supervisor characteristics, advancement, and the content of the job.,
Decide what you want to be doing at your next job.,
Set salary expectations.,
Determine supervisor characteristics.,
Research advancement opportunities.,
Search for companies that value the qualities you are looking for.Using the list of qualities and characteristics you have created, limit your job search to positions that have at least a good number of the qualities you desire.,
Figure out whether the corporate culture is a good fit for you.,
Read about the company on review websites.,
Look on their social media pages.,
Look for people who work at the company.",How to Decide if a Job Is a Good Fit for You1," You can rank the relative importance of each job characteristic by using a scale from one (highest priority) to ten (lowest priority).


If your list has more than ten characteristics, you can continue ranking in ascending order from highest to lowest priority.
For instance, you could write the number one beside the salary range you decide upon to indicate this characteristic as your number one priority.;
, Consider whether you want to be doing the same type of work you are currently doing or something a little different. If you are a carpenter and spent most of your time in your last position doing framing, consider whether you would like to be framing at your next job or if you would prefer to spend more time on finishing work, cabinetry, or other types of carpentry.

, Reflect on the salary you want to be earning at your next job. Consider the salary you made in your last few positions and whether you want to be earning a similar or a higher salary., Think about the qualities you want to see in your next boss. Reflect on the qualities of your last supervisor and which of those qualities you would hope to find (or not) in your next supervisor.


If your last supervisor offered little or poor feedback about your performance, consider whether you want your next supervisor to be more proficient in offering constructive feedback.

, Think about the opportunities for advancement or professional development you hope to see in your next position. Ponder whether there are specific areas of professional development that you would hope find at your next position, such as funding for professional conferences.

, You can search for corporate values by looking at mission statements and “about us” pages on company websites or by talking to former or current employees at professional conferences and events.


For example, you can look at mission statements on company websites. Reading the mission statements, search for keywords that relate to the values you are looking for such as “personal growth” or “professional development.”
For example, if you want a job that values professional development opportunities, you should look for one that promotes this on their website.
If you want one that values work-life balance, you should look for this quality on their website. , Whereas some companies do a lot to promote social relationships in the workplace with perks like weekend retreats, others have a more hands off approach. You should make sure the corporate culture is a good fit for what you want in your career and whether it fits your lifestyle.


Explore the ‘About us’ or ‘Values’ pages of the company website. This should give you an initial sense of whether they value things that you are looking for in a company.Explore the ‘Careers’ page on the organization website. This can help you figure out if the culture is a good fit for you.
Set up a Google news alert for the company. This will help you get a sense of the values the company promotes to the public and how it is perceived in the news media.
Think about the kind of work-life balance you need and whether the corporate culture will support that balance in your life.Consider your current and future plans. For example, if you plan on having a child in the near future, then you might consider whether the company allows for telecommuting or flexible hours.

, Common review websites include Glassdoor and Vault.If you find trends in the reviews that raise red flags for you, you might want to look elsewhere. At the same time, remember to take the reviews with a grain of salt. Many reviews may be written by either disgruntled or new employees.Company review websites also often include information about similar companies that you might be interested in applying to.

, Observe the values promoted in their Facebook posts and whether they align with your values. Next, look at profiles of people who work at the company on Linkedin. Decide whether these are people you would like to work with.If you place a high value on work-life balance and you find a lot of posts that indicate the company values workhorse or nose to the grindstone type employees who work every weekend, perhaps the company values do not align with yours.
If you value social and environmental sustainability and you cannot find any posts relating to sustainability, perhaps the company does not have the same values as you.

, Talking with other people who work at the company is one of the best ways to determine if it is a good place to work. Talk to them about the company to figure out if it is a good fit for you. If it seems like a good fit, you can use the contact to help you get ready for the big interview.Ask them about what it’s like to work there, such as whether it is expected to work late and whether they give you free meals or other fringe benefits.You might ask: How do you feel about the company? Do you feel like it offers good opportunities for advancement? Are you happy with how they treat you?

Decide on a layout.,
Look at other firms’ brochures.,
Come up with a budget.,
Begin with an explanation of your philosophy.,
Highlight your practice areas.,
Include information about pro bono experience.,
List awards or citations.,
Avoid including information that will change.,
Choose appropriate images.,
Buy software.,
Hire a graphic designer.,
Distribute your brochure.,
Read your professional rules of responsibility.,
Avoid false or misleading advertisements.,
Be careful when claiming to be a specialist.,
Don’t falsely claim to be in a partnership.,
Consult an attorney with questions.",How to Make a Lawyer's Brochure," The standard lawyer’s brochure is a tri-fold brochure. Take a piece of paper and fold it into thirds. There are basically six panels that can contain information.The tri-fold is basic, so you have other options if you want to be more sophisticated. You can also create a small booklet containing information on multiple pages.;
, Stop in to talk to other lawyers and pick up one of their brochures. You’ll want to see what kinds of information your competitors include in their brochures.


The brochure may also be posted online as a PDF. You can read it or download it.
Online brochures tend to be longer than what you will find printed out on paper. In a way, online brochures are like PDF web pages.

, Unless you are computer savvy, you should hire someone to design your brochure. You’ll also have to pay for printing costs. You should estimate these expenses.


You can find designers and printers in your phone book. Call them up and ask how much they charge.
If you have to choose between creating a brochure and doing other forms of marketing, you should probably prioritize other marketing. For example, you need a professional website before you need a brochure.

, You can include a few sentences or more on your law firm’s overarching philosophy or approach to law. Remember your target audience. Your philosophy should address their needs.


You’ll probably want to emphasize that you are cost-effective. Price is very important for all but the very rich. For example, you could state your philosophy is something like this: “At ABC law firm, we use our deep experience in trust and estates to provide cost-effective solutions to retirees and those planning for their futures.”
Also emphasize the quality of your work. If you are a national or international firm, then say you are committed to providing “world-class legal services.”, You want to provide a general summary of your services.For example, include information about your major practice areas. This information will help prospective clients discover whether you can help them.


If you are a litigation firm, explain that you handle litigation at all stages. This lets potential clients know they can approach you at any point in the dispute.
Also identify which courts you practice in. For example, you can say, “We regularly try cases in state and federal courts, as well as before private arbitration tribunals and administrative hearings.”
If you help with deals, explain the size of companies you work with. For example: “We help start-ups and small businesses incorporate and find funding.”

, Always highlight your pro bono experience, which helps show that you are an upstanding member of the community and not focused solely on making money. Include a general description of some of the cases you have handled.


For example, if you have volunteered to help immigrants in immigration proceedings, you can say something like: “With our pro bono experience, we’ve helped dozens of people achieve the American Dream, by representing them before immigration tribunals.”
You can also mention other community service activity. For example, you might encourage attorneys in your firm to volunteer in the community., Consumers have a hard time distinguishing lawyers from each other. To help stand out, include a list of awards or citations you have received.For example, you might have been named a “Super Lawyer” in your state.
You can also include select quotes from satisfied clients.

, Unless you want to constantly redo your brochure, you should keep the information generic. Don’t include information that will change frequently. For example, don’t include the following:


Profiles of lawyers, unless you are a sole practitioner. Your partner or associates could leave at any moment, and you can’t hold them out as attorneys working at your firm when they no longer do.
How much you charge. This information can change year to year and from client to client.

, Your designer might help you find images. However, you can also search for those on your own. When choosing images, remember your audience. You want images that convey what your firm is about.


If you are a litigator, you might want images of lawyers walking into a courthouse, such as the Supreme Court.Your clients assume litigation lawyers spend a lot of time in court, even though this isn’t true.
If you help people with adoptions, you will want pictures of smiling families. This creates the right impression by putting potential clients at ease about the adoption process.
Lawyers who help businesses with deals can include pictures of people in a conference room. This type of image shows you are collaborative.

, You might try to make a basic brochure on your own. For example, you can use Microsoft Word to make a brochure. You also can use other software:


Use Adobe Illustrator to create a brochure. You can make tri-fold, bi-fold, and z-fold brochures using Illustrator.
You can also use Adobe InDesign to make a professional brochure.

, For best results, you should hire a professional who can design the brochure and select appropriate pictures. Look in your phone book for a graphic designer. You can also ask other lawyers who they worked with to design their brochure.


When talking with a designer, ask to see samples of work they have done. Try to see a diverse range of materials, not simply lawyers’ brochures.

, You should have brochures available for office visitors to take. You should also upload a PDF to your website so that people can see it when they research your firm online. However, you can also distribute the brochure to other people:


If you work in divorce law, you can give your brochure to therapists, clergy, and anyone else who works with married couples.
If you work in adoption law, distribute your brochure to adoption agencies.
If you handle business litigation, you can send the brochure through the mail to target businesses.

, Each state has ethics rules that limit how an attorney can advertise their services. These rules apply to any brochure you create and distribute to clients or the public at large. Make sure to read your state’s rules.


Every state adopts its own rules. However, most states base their rules on the ABA’s Model Rules.Find your state rules by searching online. Your state’s Supreme Court website might have a copy of the rules. Also check with your state’s disciplinary commission.
If you practice in more than one state, your brochure needs to conform to the ethical rules in all states.

, Everything in your brochure should be accurate. If it isn’t, then you could face an ethics investigation. You also can’t include any information that is misleading.For example, if one lawyer at your firm did estate planning but has now left, your brochure shouldn’t continue to state you have experience in estate planning.
Also avoid making promises. You can’t guarantee results as a lawyer.

, In some states, you can become a certified specialist in a given field of law. Generally, you have to spend a certain amount of your practice in the field, take continuing legal education courses, and pass an exam. If so, you can list that you are a specialist in the field. Remember to identify the organization that has certified you.The organization that gave you the specialist credential should be accredited by your state bar association or the American Bar Association.
Avoid calling yourself a “specialist” simply because you have a lot of experience in an area. Your ethics rules probably prohibit that.
Don’t imply you are a specialist, either. For example, you shouldn’t include a quote from a client stating, “Doug is the best specialist in divorce law that I know!”

, Your state’s ethics rules will also limit what you call yourself. You can’t suggest you’re part of a partnership or other organization unless that is actually true.For example, you should probably avoid saying something like, “Mrs. Jones frequently partners with other attorneys in her area to provide the best criminal defense in Michigan.” This kind of statement suggests you are a partner with these other lawyers.
Also, don’t use an “LLP” designation, which stands for “limited liability partnership,” unless you are in a partnership.

, When in doubt, find a lawyer who specializes in professional responsibility. Run any advertising ideas you have by them and ask if they think you have broken any ethics rules. It’s better to be safe than sorry.

Ask questions during the interview.,
Figure out whether the job is a good fit for your motivational type.,
Look at your surroundings during the interview.,
Assess your experience of the interview.,
Be wary of companies that use another company to do their hiring.",How to Decide if a Job Is a Good Fit for You2," Remember that you can also ask questions during an interview. In particular, ask about who is successful at the company, and how you can gain access to the information that will allow you to be successful. Also ask them to describe their corporate culture for you.At the interview, you might ask: Can you give an example of an especially successful employee at your company?
You might also ask: What kind of corporate culture do you try to create here? What kinds of social supports do you offer employees? For instance, do you offer daycare?

, If you are mostly motivated by opportunities to move up in the organization, you should find out what kinds of rewards are offered for entrepreneurial employees. If you are motivated by a job with security, you should find out what the job offers in terms of long term benefits.At the interview, you might ask: What kind of pension plan is offered with this position? What benefits are offered?
You might also ask: What rewards do you offer for people who go above and beyond the weekly quota? What opportunities exist for professional development within the company?

, Observe how people relate to one another and how they express themselves or not at the workplace.Specifically, look to see if people are smiling at one another, listening to one another and respecting one another.


Think about whether you see people being friendly to one another in the waiting room.
Observe the demeanor of people you meet during the interview process. Reflect on whether you would see yourself as being happy in this environment.
Even the layout of the furniture can give you an indication of the work culture. For example, if you see a lot of common areas with chairs and sofas for employees to gather, then the company likely values collaboration among its employees. However, if you see mostly cubicles, then the company likely values individual effort and does not encourage collaboration.

, Think about how you were treated throughout the interview process and whether that treatment indicates that the company is a good fit for you.You might ask yourself: Did the employer show respect for my time by starting the interview on time and notifying me of any changes or delays to the interview schedule?
You might ask yourself: Did the employer show genuine interest in my responses and my experience?
You might consider: Did the employer seem genuinely interested in my career goals and aspirations or were they just asking rote questions?

, Some companies use job placement agencies to get the majority of their employees and this may indicate that the company has a high turnover rate. If the turnover rate is high, then the company may not be a pleasant place to work.

Even if the company does its own hiring, you may want to ask about the typical length of time that people stay with the company.

Reflect on whether you feel you are doing well at your job.,
Review the feedback that you have received at your current position.,
Examine whether the job allows you to be yourself.,
Talk to friends and family about your job.,
Ponder whether you are doing it for the money.",How to Decide if a Job Is a Good Fit for You3," If you feel like you are good at doing your job, this is a sign that it is at least partially a good fit. However, if you feel like nothing comes naturally to you at work, you may be in the wrong job.Consider whether the tasks that you have to complete for your current job remain very difficult despite having had to complete them for many months or years.
If you are a carpenter and find framing very difficult after many years of doing it, perhaps this job is not ideally suited to you. Perhaps other kinds of carpentry would be more rewarding.
You can also check in with yourself every day before you go to work to see how you are feeling about it. For example, if you dread going to work every day, then this is a good indication that you should look for something different.

, If you have received some positive feedback recently, this may be a sign that the job is a good fit for you. However, if you are constantly getting negative feedback at your position and experiencing very few rewards, the position may not be a good fit for you.If you receive feedback from your boss orally, try to write down the feedback that you receive for a few months. At the end of a few months, review your notes and make a list of all of the areas needing improvement and all of the positive feedback. If the feedback is mostly negative or in the needing improvement area, you may need to consider other work.

, If you feel like you can be yourself at your job, this is a sign of a good fit. If you feel like you can’t be yourself at the workplace or your identity is marginalized, the job might not be a good fit.If you are differently abled, consider whether your employer takes steps to make this job and the workplace more accessible.
If you are out in the workplace as part of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning (i.e., LGBTQ+) community, consider whether your employer has a LGBTQ+ employee resource group. LGBTQ+ resource groups share information on LGBTQ+ issues and events at the company and help connect LGBTQ+ identified people in the company., If you enjoy chatting with your friends and family about your work and feel a spark of passion about work related subjects, this can be a sign of a positive match. If you really don’t like talking about your work, this may be an indication that your passion for the position has dwindled or was never there.Bring up the subject of work at your next family event. If you find yourself enjoying the experience of talking about your current job, perhaps you are happy in your current position. However, if you find it painful or stressful to talk about, you should consider why the subject is so difficult to talk about.

, It is fine if you are partly motivated by the money, but you should have other reasons for doing the work. If you are really just doing the job to make a buck, it might not be a good fit.There are many people who manage to find work doing what they love, whatever that may be, so look around and try to find yourself a job doing something you are passionate about.Consider what type of work you would like to do if money were not an issue. If you would still be doing your job or something similar, then this is a good indication that your job is a good fit for you. If you’d rather be doing something totally different, then you may want to look into changing fields.

Do some background research.,
Have a solid understanding of what qualifications you're seeking in a candidate.",How to Interview Someone1," You have a resume and cover letter presenting information that is said to be factual. Before the candidate even enters your office, take some time to verify the information he or she has given you. The job market is tough, and it's not unthinkable for candidates to embellish their resumes a bit to get an edge over the dozens of other people who applied for the job. Doing research beforehand is also a good way to prep yourself for the interview so you can ask informed questions instead of just winging it with generic ones.


Call the candidate's references. Ask questions specifically related to information from the resume and cover letter.
Do an online search. Google the person and check LinkedIn, if their profile is public.
If you know people who know the candidate, casually ask a few questions about the person's work history.
Research the companies the candidate worked for - you can learn a lot about what the candidate might be bringing to the table.;
, The purpose of an interview is to learn more about a candidate's personality and determine whether he or she will be a ""good fit."" This is your chance to learn more than what the candidate presents on paper. You might be interviewing five people with the exact same level of education and experience, so it's time to think more deeply about what you need from your potential hire. What kind of person is going to do the job well? What will make one person stand out from the rest?


Are you looking for someone with a big personality who's going to push traditional boundaries? Would it be better to have a serious, hardworking type who reliably gets the job done well every time? Figure out what work style you want in a candidate.
Determine whether you need someone who is detail-oriented or a big picture thinker.
Think about the people who have previously held the position in question. What worked, and what didn't?
Remember that getting along with someone else isn't a good enough reason to hire them; you need to be confident the person will do a good job. There are plenty of people who make excellent first impressions, but falter when it's time to get to work.

"

Start with a few general questions.,
Ask behavioral questions.,
Put the candidate on the spot.,
Give the candidate a chance to ask questions.,
Tell the candidate what the next steps will be.",How to Interview Someone2," After introducing yourself and exchanging a few pleasantries, ask general questions geared toward verifying information on the candidate's resume and cover letter. This helps both you and the candidate ease into the interview before diving into deeper and more complicated questions. Make sure the candidate's answers match what you learned in your research.


Ask the person how many years he or she worked at the last company, and why he or she is leaving.
Ask the candidate to describe his or her former position.
Ask the candidate to talk about how his or her prior experience is relevant to the position in question.

, Learn more about how the candidate handles professional situations by asking him or her to provide you with examples of times they displayed some of the skills and traits you're looking for. The answers to these types of questions will reveal a lot about the employee's work style and abilities. In addition, behavioral questions have been shown to elicit truthful answers from candidates, since the answers are based on concrete past experiences.Make your questions skill-specific. For example, say ""Tell me about a time when you used creativity to come up with a solution to a puzzling marketing problem."" If you just said, ""Are you creative?"" You might not end up with an answer that reveals the information you need. Behavioral questions can also tell you a lot about the candidate's personality. Asking the candidate to tell you about a time when he or she was faced with an ethical dilemma, for example, could lead to some interesting answers.

, Some interviewers like to ask a few questions that make the candidate uncomfortable, to see how the person handles stress. If this kind of situation is going to be encountered on the job, you might as well know now if the candidate is going to crumble.


""Why should we hire you?"" Is a classic stressful question. Many candidates prepare for this one beforehand, though, so you might want to make it a bit trickier by saying something like, ""I see you don't have any experience writing press releases. What makes you think you're the right person for a PR position?""
Asking the candidate probing questions about why he or she is no longer with the previous company also gives the person the chance to either shine or buckle under a little pressure.
Uncomfortable hypotheticals such as ""What would you do if you witnessed a colleague demonstrating unethical behavior?"" can also be useful.

, Most people prepare a list of intelligent questions to ask the interviewer, so be prepared to give some answers of your own. If your candidate says ""I don't have any questions,"" that is in itself revealing; you might question how engaged the person is with the prospect of working for your company.


Have specific details ready to relay to the candidate. Hours, benefits, salary, specific job duties, and other information may come up, so make sure you have answers ready, even if the answer is ""we'll discuss that later.""
If the candidate asks something like ""what are my chances?"" don't give an answer that will lead him or her on unless you're 99% sure you're going to offer the person the job.

, Let him or her know that you'll be in touch within the next few days or weeks, whatever the case may be. Thank the candidate for coming in for an interview, stand up, and shake hands. This will be the interviewee's cue to leave.

Make sure to keep it legal.,
Don't talk too much.,
Establish rapport.,
Represent your company well.,
Take notes and double check answers.",How to Interview Someone3," It is against the law to discriminate against an applicant due to race, sex, religion, age, disability, pregnancy, national origin, and other factors.Do not ask the candidate any questions that are geared toward finding out information in one of these areas. Here are a few common questions interviewers ask, even though they shouldn't:


You may not ask a woman whether she is pregnant, or expecting to start a family in the next few years.
Don't ask someone if they go to church, or what religion they were raised practicing.
Do not ask someone their age.
Do not ask someone if their health issues will affect their ability to work.

, If you're going on about yourself or the company the whole time, your candidate won't be able to get a word in edgewise. You might feel like it was a great interview and then realize you didn't really gain new information. Ask leading questions and let the candidate speak for the majority of the interview.

, You'll get more information out of the person if you're friendly, warm and inviting. Taking a hard-nosed approach will cause some people to close up and answer questions guardedly. Encourage openness and honesty through your body language. Smile, nod, and don't flinch if the candidate stumbles or has difficulties answering a question.

, Remember that the candidate has a choice in the matter of whether he or she takes the job if it's offered. You might find people reluctant to take the job if the company doesn't seem like a great place to work, or if you seem like you'd be an unpleasant manager. The cards aren't all in your hands, so don't go on a power trip during the interview. 

, Note important information during the interview, so you can double check on it afterward if need be. If the candidate gives you details about a big project he or she completed for a previous company, there's no harm in calling the references again to double check that it really happened.

Choose professional attire.,
Get educated.,
Prepare stories that illustrate your skill-set.,
Alter your social media sites.,
Arrive early.,
Be friendly to everyone you meet.,
Work on your handshake.,
Use effective body language.,
Bring extra copies of your resume.,
Find ways to be memorable.,
Avoid certain subjects.,
Ask the right questions.,
Depart smoothly.,
Follow up.",How to Impress an Interviewer," First impressions are usually formed within 30 seconds. The first thing an employer will notice is your physical appearance. Pick a wardrobe that communicates effort and professionalism.


Research the company's dress code going into the interview. If you know anyone from the company, ask them what's appropriate. You can also call the company's Human Resource Department and ask what is recommended in terms of attire.
If you're interviewing for a professional, managerial, or executive position you should always wear a suit. Have a few interview suits, preferably tailored to your body, on hand to choose from.If the attire is business casual, or if you're applying for a lower ranking position, a nice blouse with dress pants or a skirt is a good choice for women. Men can wear dress pants and a button down shirt and tie.If this is for a factory, construction, or other such job where you will get dirty, wear sensible attire to the interview, this includes steel-toed safety shoes and if it's a construction site, you'll need to wear a hard hat (not a bump hat) to get from the gate to the office.
Do not forget footwear. Oftentimes, an outfit is great but shoes are tattered or worn. Invest in comfortable, work-appropriate shoes. Do not fret if you have to pay a little more. Remember, you will use these shoes often when you land a job.Avoid perfumes and other fragrances, which can appear tacky and put off interviewers. While accessories, like a nice belt or tasteful jewelry, can be a nice touch avoid anything overly flashy or distracting.If you wear make-up, stick to neutral shades of lipstick, eye-liner, and eye shadow. Your make-up should ideally enhance your existing facial features without overwhelming them.;
, Never go into an interview without prior knowledge of the company. This conveys a lack of interest and respect on your part. Conduct thorough research in the days leading up to an interview.


Know what skills the company values. Look at the career page on their website and pay close attention to the desired qualifications listed on their job postings. This gives you the opportunity to learn more about a given company and discover what aspects of your skill set and career history to emphasize.Read up on the latest news involving the company. Oftentimes, company websites have a section dedicated to press releases and news coverage. You can also search for the company's name in Google News.Research the company's mission and values. You'll want to make sure you come off as a good fit for the company's culture. There should be a section on the company's website with a mission statement. You can also follow the company on social media to get a sense of their ethos.Find out who your interviewer will be. Oftentimes, this is disclosed in the email asking you to come in for an interview. If not, you can politely request their name. Research the interviewer on LinkedIn and Twitter. This increases your chance of connecting and, in turn, landing the job., Concrete is better than abstract when it comes to wowing an interviewer. You should have a few solid anecdotes prepared that speak to your experience.


People tend to remember stories easier than direct information. Therefore, telling a story rather than simply conveying your experience means you'll stand out in an interviewer's mind.Ask yourself, what are the skill sets this company is looking for? Write down a list of skills and, from there, try to come up with stories from past jobs, volunteer experiences, and internships that illustrate your proficiency with said skills. Have 2 to 3 anecdotes to choose from going in.
Rehearse. Recite the stories to yourself to make sure you include all necessary information and don't slip up or stutter during the interview. You can always record yourself speaking and play back the recording to see where you need to improve.

, It's not uncommon for employers to scan the Twitter and Facebook accounts of potential employees. Make sure your social media presence is clean before going into an interview.


Curse words do not reflect well on you as a potential employee. Make sure any obscenity is removed.
A negative attitude can be a deterrent to employment and people often take to Twitter and Facebook to complain. Delete tweets or statues that air grievances about friends, family members, or businesses.
If you want to err on the side of caution, you can temporarily deactivate your Facebook or Twitter profile the week before your interview. You can also change privacy settings so only certain posts are visible to the public.

, While arriving late to an interview is a major no-no, many people don't realize arriving exactly on time may also reflect poorly on you. Arriving early reflects initiative, drive, and good time management skills.


Aim to show up 10 to 15 minutes early, but no earlier than that. Any earlier can put pressure on your interview to conduct the interview prematurely. Stay off your phone while waiting. There's always a chance of receiving distressing information through your smart phone. You don't want anything to take your focus away from the interview.Briefly review any notes you have, but do not go overboard as this can increase your anxiety. Simply scan what you've jotted down.Sit up straight and be attentive. Convey confident body language even while waiting as this will set the tone for your interview., Your interview starts the moment you enter an establishment. Treat any secretaries or other employees with courtesy as you navigate your way through a place of business. Your interviewer might ask about your behavior afterwards, so be sure to be friendly and engaged with everyone you meet and not just the person conducting the interview.

, A good handshake is vital. This is your first opportunity to impress an interviewer.


A handshake should be neither too limp nor too hard. Both methods are off-putting to interviewers.Make sure you arrange your belongings on your left side as you'll be shaking with your right hand. You don't want to leave your interviewer waiting while you fumble with folders and notebooks.Offer your hand with your palm slightly up, allowing the interviewer's hand to cover yours. This is a subtle gesture that conveys respect.Never cover the interviewer's hand with your left hand while shaking. This can be seen as inappropriate and a sing of domination., From the moment you enter the room, use body language that conveys confidence and respect.


When you're being lead to the interview, follow the leader. This shows you respect their position of authority over you.Put any belongings, such as a briefcase or purse, on the floor beside you. Holding onto to these items during an interview is awkward and distracting. Placing them on the interviewer's desk can be seen as intrusive.Sit up straight in a manner that displays your neck, chest, and stomach. Do not lean forward. This makes you look nervous or aggressive.Keep your hands above the desk and below your collar bone when gesturing. You don't want to appear overly excited, which can put off your interviewer., The power of the paper resume still exists in our increasingly digital world.


Even if your interviewer does not need an extra copy, they will be impressed you took the initiative to print one out beforehand.Keep your resume in a business folder so it's not tattered or torn when you enter the interview.Having copies on-hand reflects initiative and organizational skills, highly valued traits in job candidates., Remember, you're competing with an onslaught of other applicants for a single job. If you can find appropriate ways to stand out, this could translate to success in landing the position.


If there's anything in the interviewer's office that interests you, bring it up. This is especially effective if you have common interests. People are more likely to remember, and hire, people they like. If, for example, you see a picture of your interview riding a horse ask about it, and casually mention you used to take horseback riding lessons as a child.The interviewer will likely ask a general question going in, like ""How are you today?"" Think of a creative, amusing answer. Instead of saying something like, ""Fine"" or ""I'm good,"" try using a memorable adjectives like, ""Perfect"" or ""Doing fantastic."" You could also create your own answer, relating your mood to something interesting in your day. Like, ""Great, actually. The drive over here was so scenic it put me in a fantastic mood.""Leave behind a resume or work sample. That way, the interviewer will have a physical reminder of your presence even after you leave., Knowing interview etiquette is key to impressing your interviewer, and you should know what subjects are off-limits during an initial evaluation.


Never bad-mouth past employees. Whether it’s your prospective employer’s competition or a previous employer, only say positive nice things about others. Interviewers might be wary to trust you if you come off as bitter or a gossip.
Do not discuss salary or ask about benefits during the initial interview. While important, these questions should wait. You want to look interested in the position because of a genuine investment in the company rather than monetary gain. Hold off on such questions until you've been hired or moved to another round of interviews.

, You will likely be asked if you have any questions about the position. Many candidates simply say ""No"" or ask something about logistics (i.e., ""When will I hear back?"") but this is your opportunity to convey genuine interest in the company.


Ask about the company's values and how your work can help further those values. Also, ask about the company's culture. Ask your interviewer what aspects of that culture they find most valuable as an employee.Ask the interviewer if they have any concerns about hiring you. This shows you're willing to adapt to changes and are genuinely invested in self improvement.Ask what an average day of work looks like. This shows that you want to be prepared in the event you get the job.
Ask about what opportunities the company provides for collaboration, growth, and education. This shows you're interested in growing as a person and a professional during your employment., Your departure is as important as your arrival, so make sure to exit the interview with grace and class.


Gather your belongings calmly. Try not to stumble or drop anything.Shake hands again, following proper protocol. If you can't conveniently shake hands with everyone present, make sure you at least shake hands with the hiring manager.
Nod your head as you leave and take the quickest and most convenient route out the door.You may be tempted to try and read your interviewer's body language for signs on how you did, but this can cause undue anxiety. You don't want to engage in any behaviors that can disrupt your confidence., In order to convey continued interest, follow up in the days following the interview.


As soon as you get home, write down notes from the interview. Include the names of the interviewer and staff you met and specific questions you were asked.Using blank notecards, write a handwritten note to everyone you met. Thank them for the opportunity to interview at their company and mention any specifics you remember about the experience.Emails are often used as a form of follow up, and while this can be great in a pinch aim for a physical note. This sets you apart from other candidates and shows greater effort."
"
Gather your reference materials together and keep them close.,
Be prepared to discuss why you're currently looking for work; what skills you have that meet the position requirements; and whether your pay requirements fall within the hiring range.,
Take a short moment to collect yourself before launching into the conversation.,
Write down the caller's name and use it.,
Know what the caller's role is within the hiring process.,
Relate well to the caller.,
Set the interview appointment and get the details.,
Before hanging up, thank the caller for her time and consideration.",How to Handle a Telephone Screening Interview," - These materials include a copy of your resume, a copy of each job posting or ad to which you've applied and your research notes about the company. Since it's a phone call you can easily refer to these things without the caller being aware of what you're doing.;
, There may also be questions relating to your job stability or why you changed from job to job.

, The call will generally be made during business hours and may take you by surprise. If that happens ask the caller to hold for a moment while you move to a quiet location. Or ask if you may call the person 'right back'. It is also acceptable to let the call go to voice mail. That will give you time to prepare for the call.

, Use Mr. and Ms. Don't call the person by her fist name unless invited to do so.

, You need to know who you're dealing with. If you can't tell by the caller's title ask if she's ""the hiring manager"". If she isn't she'll be flattered and if she is...good! Keep in mind that the person screening you can only pass you through to the next step or screen you out. She can't hire you.

, Be pleasant and easy to talk with while remaining business like. Smile when you talk. Don't talk too fast. When you want to emphasize a point don't raise your voice stand up instead. It gives your voice more energy.

, Make note of the date and time; the name, title and phone number of the person with whom you'll be meeting; the address or location; and directions to get there (if offered).

, End on the upbeat.

Take an online personality test.,
Consider what “people skills” you have.,
Think about your decision making style.,
Consider your preferences for planning vs flexibility.,
Think about what activities lead you to demonstrate flow.,
Consider what activities you feel naturally good at and which skills you've worked to improve.,
Think generally about what areas you are strongest.,
Make a list of the activities you enjoy outside of work and school.,
Write down what skills you need to do each of these activities.,
Add any skills your education has provided you to the list.,
Write down your volunteer activities.,
Make a list of your previous jobs.,
Think about your job descriptions and what you contributed at work.,
Look carefully at the requirements.,
Check out the organization’s website.,
Talk to others.,
Make a list.,
Match your own strengths to the position requirements.",How to Identify Your Strengths," There are dozens of online tests that will help you pinpoint your own strengths (and weaknesses). These tests are particularly helpful when you want to think about intangible skills like fortitude, kindness, creativity, or adaptability.


Try the University of Kent Strengths test.You could also take a Myers-Briggs Type Test.;
, Whether you tend to be shy our outgoing, you probably have a number of valuable skills. Consider how you interact with others. Think about what intangible strengths (such as an outgoing nature or the ability to delegate) are apparent in your interaction style.


Do you enjoy working with other people on a group project, or would you rather work alone? In a group setting, do you tend to take the lead, or would you rather contribute by being a good foot soldier?
Do you feel very sympathetic toward other people’s problems? Perhaps you are naturally caring and empathetic.Do you tend to notice things that others don’t? It sounds like you have great observation skills.
Do you tend to be very at ease in social situations? You’re probably pretty outgoing.

, Some people tend to base their decisions on logic, whereas others care more about personal feelings. Both logic and emphasis on values are important strengths.For example, when you decide to buy a new sofa, if you spend hours reading consumer reports and comparison shopping, you probably value logic. On the other hand, if you sit on a sofa, think that it’s super comfy, and then decide to buy it, you base decisions more on personal feelings.

, Some people like to know what they’re doing well in advance. They like schedules and do a good job following them. Other people like to “go with the flow.” They prefer a flexible agenda. Both planning and flexibility are valuable skills.One way to think about this is to think about how you like to vacation. Do you spend hours on the internet before you leave on a trip, planning every stop? Or do you wait and see where the wind blows you?

, Flow is a state of mind in which you lose your sense of time because you’re paying so much attention to a task. When you’re in flow, you often feel very energized and engaged and good at what you’re doing. Then think about what kind of intangible skills go into this particular activity.


For example, do you lose yourself in art projects? Do you find yourself brimming with new ideas whenever you’re asked to design a project? If so, creativity may be one of your intangible strengths., Perhaps you are naturally athletic and were born with great eye coordination, and you don't have to practice much in order to sink free throws. On the other hand, maybe you make all of your free throws because you practice ten hours a week. Remember that both natural talents and learned skills are important! Don't write off any of your strengths because you have to work hard to maintain them., Do you like to dream up big ideas and try to put them into action? Are you more of a logical thinker? Are you better with numbers or words? Do you like hands-on activities and physical movement? Do you work well with others?


Jot down anything that comes to you at this point. You can always narrow later.

, Include everything that you like to do, even if you’re not that good at it. Write down your hobbies, any athletic teams you belong to, your favorite weekend activities, and so on. Here are some ideas to get you started-- do you enjoy any of these activities? arts and crafts (jewelry making, painting, pottery, coloring)
theatre or public speaking
dancing, singing, or playing a musical instrument
sports
cooking
shopping
hanging out with your friends
gardening or yardwork

, You may have to get a little creative, but you can probably find something positive for each one, even the ones that don’t really seem like skills (like shopping or going to the movies with friends). For example:


jewelry making - attention to detail, patience, artistic eye
gardening - planning ahead, attention to the big picture
shopping - budgeting, attention to advertising and pricing
hanging out with friends - good social skills, ability to work well in a group

, Are you a particularly good writer, because you majored in English? Did you take a Statistics course that will help you analyze data? Did you learn the basics of working in a lab in your Chemistry class? , This could include anything that you did for charity (like holding a bake sale or working at a food bank) or anything that you did as part of a club or organization. Include leadership positions you held, but don’t leave out times when you were just part of a group.For example, if you did a great job selling raffle tickets as part of the Fundraising Committee for your intramural softball team in college, write that down. If you apply for a position at an organization that values the ability to raise money or talk to potential donors, you may be able to say that that is one of your strengths.
Remember that working as part of a team is a strength that many employers and schools value, so include any activities (like sports teams) that required you to do that.
If you’re working with a therapist on listing your strengths to building self-confidence or for any other purpose, include activities even if you aren’t sure what strengths they may show. Your counselor may be able to help you recognize skills that you didn’t know you had.
Again, you may want to ask others who were involved in these activities with you if they can help you come up with strengths you may not have thought of. Maybe you really motivated a teammate and weren’t aware of it, or maybe your friends think you’re great at planning social events., You may want to do this in a spreadsheet (as opposed to on a napkin over lunch) so that you can expand it later or use it for future positions. Include every job you have had in the last ten years. If you’re young and haven’t had much paid work, you’ll want to include things that seem small scale to you.Don’t forget things like:


babysitting
mowing lawns
helping out at your uncle’s business on the weekends
cleaning out your grandma’s attic
painting your neighbor’s garage

, For the purposes of this list, write down even the tiniest contribution that comes to mind. If you’re interviewing for a position, you won’t read this to future interviewers - it’s just a way of brainstorming. Think about anything you were ever proud of yourself for doing in a previous position or anything that you were asked to do on a routine basis.For example, if you worked at McDonalds and were routinely assigned cash register duty, perhaps your strengths include working with money, customer service, and multitasking.
Assuming you’re on good terms with current and former bosses, you could ask them what they think your skills are. They may think of something you’ve overlooked.

, This should always be the first step when you’re planning for an interview. Look carefully at the requirements for the position to determine exactly what kind of candidate they’re looking for.If this is a job or internship application, look at the advertisement for the job.

, If you’re participating in a college interview at a school that values volunteerism, think about your strengths in that area. If you’re applying for a job that requires you to manage a large group of people, ask yourself when you’ve had to lead others or delegate tasks. , If possible, speak with people who are already a part of the organization that you’re interviewing with. Ask them about what skills and values the organization thinks are important. Ask them what strengths they bring to their organization. Depending on your relationship with this person, you might even want to ask them if there are problem areas in the organization. If they tell you, for example, that the company really needs to work on its social media presence, and you have a lot of experience promoting events on Facebook and Twitter, you’ll want to play up that strength in an interview.
If you can’t talk to anyone at the organization, you may want to talk to someone at a similar organization or someone who knows about this industry or school. For example, if you’re applying for a job at Verizon, and your aunt works for Sprint, she might be a good source of information. Talk to your school counselor if you’re applying for colleges, or seek out Career Center staff at your school if you’re applying for an internship.

, Using the information you gleaned from job postings, websites, and talking to others, write down the skills and character traits that you think are most important for whatever you’re applying for. You may want to put this information in a spreadsheet. , What skills (both tangible and intangible) do you have that match well with the job posting or school’s ethos? Notice whether only one or two of your strengths match up with what they’re looking for, or whether there are a lot of things on both lists. Decide which strengths are most important to emphasize. Using the information you learned about the school or company and the lists of your own strengths, decide which ones are going to be the keys to success.Write out your answer. Be prepared to support your answer with evidence from previous jobs and your personal life. You may also want to make a note of how this skill will be valuable to the organization you’re interviewing with to remind them of why you’re a perfect fit.Don’t be tempted to claim you have strengths that you don’t, even if the company is looking for those particular strengths. For example, if they want someone who is good with Microsoft Excel, and you have never so much as opened a spreadsheet before, don’t claim this as a strength. Chances are good that they will catch on to your lie quickly. Instead, move down the list and find a strength that you can truly claim as your own.
Also avoid overly cocky answers. “I’m the best social media expert on the market today,” not only sounds arrogant, but will probably come off as untrue.
At the same time, don’t be afraid to toot your own horn! You have to make it clear that your strengths make you the perfect candidate for the position. Be polite and genuine.

Understand why an employer might discriminate based on age.,
Recognize the ways that an older age can affect your candidacy.,
Consider the ways that a younger age can affect your candidacy.,
Identify questions related to your age.,
Know your rights.,
Know when you can refuse to answer.,
Respond to age-related questions professionally and courteously.,
Answer questions truthfully.,
Aim to reinforce your qualifications with concrete examples.,
Work to demonstrate your maturity if you are on the young side.,
Show interviewers that you are up to date if you are on the older side.",How to Handle Age Issues on a Job Interview," When employers have job openings, they often have certain kinds of ideal candidates in mind. For the most part, they are usually concerned with finding candidates with the appropriate experience and abilities (including physical abilities, when relevant). Sometimes, coinciding with these qualifications, employers develop a “vision” ideal candidates who fall into a particular age bracket. For example, a new innovative technology company may be searching for new engineers and imagining that most of their best candidates will be between 22 and 32 years old. If you fall outside of that age range, the company may have concerns about your candidacy.;
, If you are older than the imagined ideal age range for a given job, an employer might think you will lack state-of-the-art skills or technological abilities. In addition, you may be perceived as less innovative. The employer might also have concerns about health issues or your retirement.

, If you are younger than the imagined age range, an employer might doubt that you have sufficient skills, knowledge, and maturity. In addition, an employer may worry that you will not be able to gain the respect and authority necessary for a supervisory role.

, Understand that employers may not ask you directly about your age, but they may ask other questions that are designed to estimate how old you are. This makes it more difficult to identify potentially illegal discrimination. Some of these questions may include:


When did you graduate from high school (or college)?
Are you married?
Do you have children?
How old are your children?
What are your long-term career goals?

, The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), which is enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), protects all applicants, candidates, and employees over 40 years old from discrimination due to their age. This protection extends to hiring, compensation, promotions, terminations, and the conditions and privileges of employment. People under 40 years old are not protected, however, and there are other exceptions as well – if age is considered a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ), employers may use it to make decisions. For example, if a TV producer wants to cast a role for a teenager, he or she can legally discriminate against anyone too old to play the part.


The ADEA also prevents employers from mentioning age in job postings, advertisements, or recruitment propaganda.
Note that employers do have the right to make non-discriminatory inquiries regarding a candidate’s age if they have lawful reasons for doing so. For example, employers may need to determine whether a candidate meets a minimum age requirement for safety or legal employment.

, Questions that are illegal (or not recommended) under the laws that govern employment do not have to be answered. Unfortunately, you will have to weigh your right not to answer against your desire to be perceived as a cooperative, attractive candidate. That said, you can absolutely refuse to answer:


How old are you?
What year were you born?
Are you of retirement age?
When do you plan on retiring?

, Whether the question you are asked is illegal or not, you should not respond rudely. The best option is generally to recognize the problematic nature of the question, deflect it, and redirect the interviewer’s attention to a related qualification.


For example, say you are asked whether you have reached retirement age. You can recognize that this question is inappropriate without being rude or unprofessional, and you can bring the interviewer’s attention to a related qualification. You could, for instance, say, “I’m not sure what retirement age has to do with being successful in this position, but I will be glad to explain to you my career goals and five year plan.”

, Regardless of whether a question presented to you is legal or illegal, you should not lie. Answering the question is fine, and so is refusing to answer an illegal question, but lying is never appropriate. Keep in mind that any lies you tell might get discovered, anyway.

, No matter what questions your interviewer throws at you, remember to circle back to your qualifications, stressing your skills and your ability to be successful at the specific job. Providing concrete examples that illustrate these qualifications may help you overcome potential age discrimination. Explain, for example, that you were able to increase efficiency by developing an innovative process.

, If you are worried that employers will think you are too young, use the interview experience to show your maturity, professionalism, confidence, and courtesy. Focus on your experience, emphasizing your past successes. If you are interviewing for a supervisory role, provide examples of your ability to lead and earn the respect of others. These tactics will help the interviewer see you as ready to handle the job.

, If you are worried that employers will think you are too old, use the interview experience to demonstrate that you are up to date in your field. Emphasize your technological skills, if relevant. Show that you are mentally and physically able to do the job successfully, and provide examples of recent experiences that are relevant to the job at hand. These tactics will help the interviewer see you as an asset to the company.

This will normally be to somebody who works in Human Resources or recruitment. If you have received a letter or email asking you to interview, it will most likely include instructions on confirming your attendance and the contact details of the person to contact.


You can do this via email, but it can be nice to call so you can have a brief chat and ask any immediate questions you might have.
If you have any special requirements, such as disabled access, you should let them know as soon as possible.;
, A crucial part of your interview preparation is thoroughly researching the organisation you are interviewing for. This is vital for a number of reasons, not least for demonstrating your enthusiasm and initiative to the interviewers. The level of research that is possible will vary massively depending on the company and the position you are applying for, but there are some common areas to research before the interview.What kind of organisation is it? Is it in the public or private sector, or is it a charity or voluntary organisation?
What are the values and mission of the organisation?
Who are the company’s clients and services?
Has there been relevant news in the industry that you should be aware of?
Read up on the competition. , This information should have been communicated to you by the company when they invited you to interview, but be sure you completely understand the format and elements of the interview. Is it going to be a straight question and answer? Are you expected to give a presentation? Or, is there is test? If you are in any doubt, ask well in advance of the interview so you can prepare accordingly.


If you know there is a presentation, ensure you know what sort of thing is expected. You should know roughly how long you are expected to speak for, what sort of format you should use and what you should cover.
If you need any IT, such as a laptop and projector with Powerpoint, communicate this to the organisation as soon as possible so they can be prepared.

, Every interview will be different, and it’s impossible to entirely predict what questions you will be asked. But, with some thought and preparation you can work up an idea of what to expect. When you are thinking about these questions, also think about how you would answer them. You may want to make some notes, but don’t sound like you are reading from a script. Practice answering these common interview questions.


Tell us about why you want the job.
What are your strengths and weaknesses?
What would you bring to the position and the organisation?
Where would you like to be in five years?, When you are preparing for your interview and thinking about how you would answer certain questions about your knowledge, skills and experience, it’s important to be able to give evidence. A great way to do this is to give real world examples from your employment, education or volunteer history. You want to be detailed, but concise with your answers, and having thought about specific examples is a good way to do this., One thing that you can do to help you to think of possible interview questions and answers is to read through the job description and personal specification again, as well as your application. This will refresh the particulars of the job in your mind. The interviewers will trying to determine how well you meet the specification for the job, so by re-reading this you will have a decent idea of what they will try to ascertain in the interview.

, It’s a good idea to have a practice interview before the real thing. You could do this with a friend or family member, or you could just do it yourself rehearsing some answers in front of the mirror. List your strengths and qualities, but practice doing it an engaging way. Keep track of your language and tone, it should be formal but friendly, with confidence not cockiness.You could even record yourself and watch it back to analyse your body language as well as your answers.

, What to wear to the interview is a common point of debate and anxiety. There are no cast iron rules, and you should use a measure of your own judgement. But keep in mind that impressions matter and that you want to present a professional image. If you are in doubt it is definitely okay to ask somebody at the company what type of clothes are appropriate. If you do decide to do this, don’t just say ‘what do I have to wear to the interview’, but frame it in a more considered way.


Try something like, ‘I am interviewing for a position at your organisation and was wondering if you could tell me a little about the company culture, so that I can dress appropriately’., When you arrive for the interview, you want to be fresh and sharp. It might be tough, but try to get to bed early the night before so you are well rested and ready to go. You don’t want to be yawning and rubbing the sleep from your eyes in the interview.

, You will most likely have been instructed on what documentation you need to bring with you to the interview, but if you haven’t be sure to ask. Employers will often want to photocopy or scan particular documents while you are there so be sure that you have these in hand the day before the interview. Some things you may need to bring include:


A copy of your resume, or CV.
A copy of your passport or some photograph ID.
Any professional or educational certificates or records required.

, There is nothing worse than arriving late for your interview, not only does it demonstrate a lack of commitment and interest in the position, but also indicates poor personal organisation and initiative. Your train might be delayed, or you might get stuck in traffic so give yourself plenty of time to get there.


If you arrive very early, it’s probably best to get a coffee somewhere nearby, rather than going and sitting in reception for half an hour. It can be a bit stressful for the office staff to have all the candidates queueing up, and it will be more relaxing for you.But be sure to report to reception with five or ten minutes to spare.

, It’s important to make good first impressions with everyone you meet, not just the people conducting the interview. Be polite and greet people with a smile and a handshake. Your performance in the interview is ultimately what will determine whether or not you get the job, but demonstrating that you treat other staff members will help to create a positive overall impression of you in the office., During the interview, smile and look the interviewer in the eye, wait to sit down until the interviewer asks you, don't slouch, and avoid nervous actions. Having a positive attitude is expressed through your body language as well as what you say, so pay attention to this during the interview.


The initial stages of the interview are crucial and the impression you make in the first twenty minutes count for a lot., The interview is a conservation, not you giving a monologue. The interviewers won’t be impressed if you don’t show that you can listen intently and take it what you are being told. Your interviewer is giving you information so you need to be alive to that to be sure you don’t miss anything important. Part of communicating well, is listening well.Listening well will also help to get a good picture of the culture of the place you are interviewing for.

, When you are being asked a question, it’s important that you take in the content of the question and answer it directly. If you are being asked if you have a particular skill or experience then you should provide some clear evidence of this with an example. If you don’t give a specific example, then not only are you only part answering the question, but you are also missing a great opportunity to present your skills and achievements in the clearest possible way.For example, if you are asked about your organisational skills, you might say that you are highly organised but follow this up by describing an event you organised in the past.
If you are asked about meeting deadlines, you could reference the college or school assignments which you always turned in on time.
Or if you are asked about the ability to handle competing priorities, you can talk about juggling work and study.
If you can use evidence from outside work and education, you will also present a more rounded picture of yourself and your outside interests.

, Be professional, but relaxed and confident throughout the interview. If you pay close attention to the interviewers you will see the style and tone they use and you can try to adapt to that and show that you can work well in such an environment., The language and tone you use is vital so you need to be aware of leaving negative soundbites in the minds of the interviewers. This can occur if you are asked a question about something that you do not have direct experience of. Of course, you should never give a false impression of your abilities or experience, but how you frame a negative answer is very important.Instead of just saying ‘no’, change the emphasis to a positive by highlighting other things you have done which are relevant, while indicating that you are keen to develop in this area.
For example, if you are asked if you have ever organised an event at work, don’t say ‘no, never’, but say something like, ‘I have not been the lead in organising events, but I have been part of a team who did this and learnt a lot from it’. You could also give an example of something you have organised outside of work, like a sports tournament or charity event.
Be positive, and show how you want to develop your skills and experience.

, When you are talking in the interview keep in mind that you are trying to give an overview of your career progression so far, and your aspirations for the future. We learn in different ways, and your own personal experience has contributed to your personal and professional development.


Don’t get carried away, veer off topic and give a monologue of your life story, but some personal information that explains how you have arrived at where you are can make your interview memorable, and contextualise your CV., At the end of the interview, the interviewers will normally turn to you and ask if you have any questions for them. An important part of interviewing is asking good questions here, which demonstrate your enthusiasm, willingness to learn, and ability to take on board the information you gained through the interview.You should ask questions both about the employer and about the job.Some good examples of questions to ask are:


What kind of training and career development opportunities to you offer?
What are your favourite and least favourite parts of the job?
How would you describe the work culture here?
How do you envisage the company’s growth and development in the next five years?
Do you have any doubts about my suitability for the role?, You can do this with a handwritten note, or by email, but you should do it within the first 24 hours after the interview. In this note you should thank them for the opportunity to interview, and you might like to include some further information about you that follows up in something touched upon in the interview.You can follow a basic template of thanking the interviewer, briefly reiterating why you should be selected for the job, before finishing by saying you are looking forward to the next step.You can include additional information, and follow-up on something specific, but try to make it sound as natural and unforced as possible., If you were told you would hear on Monday morning and you haven’t heard a few days later, it’s okay for you to contact the employer and politely ask if a decision has been made yet. A brief phone call or email to HR should suffice. The key thing to remember is to be positive and don’t sound impatient or annoyed.Say something like, ‘it was great to meet you, I enjoyed talking to you and I was just wondering where you are in the decision process’.

, Often recruitment procedures include more than one round of interviews. If this is the case with the position you have applied for, don’t hang around after the first interview before you begin preparation for part two. You could get short notice for the second round so you need to be prepared and ready to go.At the second interview you will want to be even better than at the first, so make sure you prepare thoroughly and have information about the company and the industry that you can talk about to demonstrate your knowledge.

, Whether you are successful or not, you should keep your professionalism at all times and thank the employer for the opportunity to interview. If you did not get the job, try to think of it as a learning opportunity and ask for feedback on your interview to see where you can improve.


This feedback can be very helpful, but it can also be frustrating. Take criticism on the chin.

Inquire how much the firm charges for security transactions. If the answer is more than $10 for 5000 shares of stock, approximately what discount brokers charge, ask under what conditions the firm could justify the additional cost to the customer.
Learn what the average mutual fund expense ratio costs clients for funds recommended by the firm. This is sometimes called the net expense ratio.
Can this expense ratio be justified by better performance in up markets, slower declines in down markets, or lower risk than an equivalent index fund with an expense ratio of 20 or 10 basis points (or less)? (10 basis points is 0.1%; 100 basis points is 1.0%.)
What is the range of Wrap Fee charges for accounts to be offered to clients? (Most firms allow Financial Advisors (FAs)to charge a range, for example between 1.5% (150 basis points) and 0.75% (75 basis points).) How can this fee be justified? (Note the Wrap Fees are in addition to the mutual fund expense ratio.);
, Here are questions to ask to learn what the firm pays, and what you'll pay out of your pocket.


What are the best ways to make your target market aware you are accepting accounts, once licensed? How much will it cost? Will the firm pay these costs, or will it be paid out of salary?
Will the firm pay for advertising in a high quality magazine, read by people the firm would like to have as clients?
Ask about seminars or trade shows attended to build business. Does the firm pay all or only part of the expenses?
Will the firm provide a coach to help you improve your prospecting and sales techniques? (If so, consider asking for the name of the coach, how many hours per week or month the firm will provide, the coach's credentials, years coaching Financial Advisors, how many FAs coached are successful and how many FAs coached are no longer active.)

, What amount of production will be needed to get a private office? How long does it usually take a new Financial Advisor to achieve this level of production?

, If alone, who can you ask for guidance? If with a team, how will your contribution be judged? Will there be a partnership agreement detailing mutual responsibilities? If so, ask for a copy to read before accepting employment.

, If so, how does the firm protect you and itself from Do Not Call List violations?

Practice, practice, practice!,
Hire an interview coach.",How to Handle a Job Interview After Being Fired," Plan to provide a concise explanation of what occurred with your recent position. The trick here is address the past and then move on. Remember, this interview is about your future and the potential for you to help this company be successful. Don’t let your past become the focus. Your explanation should be brief. No more than 1-2 minutes long, professional, and free from emotion.


Undoubtedly, this will require some practice; however, underestimating the importance of your response can be devastating. Your response to this question, alone, may determine if you move forward in the selection process. Therefore, it is best to save the sordid details for happy hour with your friends, avoid negativity at all costs, and, if you learned something from the experience, include it.;
, It’s critically important that you know how your former employer will respond to reference requests. Will they share the details of how your employment ended or will they simply confirm your employment dates and job duties? Once you know this information, you can present your situation in the most accurate and positive light possible.


It is critical, though, that you don’t ever lie. If you are caught bending the truth, you can literally kiss the opportunity good-bye.

, An interview is your opportunity to sell yourself and your abilities to a potential employer. While you may be anxious to find a new job and put the whole situation behind you, it’s important that you take some time to sort through emotional issues before starting your job search in earnest.


Remember, not every employee is a good fit for every employer. And it’s likely that the person conducting the interview gets that. While your interview prep will undoubtedly focus on how your last position ended, it’s equally important that you are ready to sell yourself and your abilities going forward. Dig deep and be passionate about your experiences and skill set. Know why they need you and then be prepared to demonstrate this by way of historical examples or a portfolio of your work.

, One of the difficult parts of being fired is that it’s hard (and likely a bad move) to list your former supervisor as a reference. While this is certainly understandable, you can’t expect a potential employer to hire you without some ability to speak former management and co-workers. Perhaps your references can be pulled from a different department or area of the company.


Worst case, perhaps someone in the Human Resources area or even a vendor with whom you worked closely can be an option. Regardless, it’s important that you gain their permission to serve as a “positive” reference. Unfortunately, many people agree to serve as references and then provide less than glowing reviews.

, Interview preparation is always important, but interview prep after being fired is critical. Being fired is an emotional experience…and that’s okay. But keep in mind, no employer wants to hire you until you have healed, learned from the experience and are truly ready to prove to the world that you are back! Consequently, you must practice your explanation of why you are no longer at your previous job. The ability to choose your words easily and state them in a matter of fact tone during your interview projects confidence and portrays professionalism.


And your practice doesn't end with the explanation. In the words of Melody Carlock, President of Resume Muse, “Good interview preparation shows how you can do one (if not all three) of the following things: Show how you can make them money, save them time, or make the boss look good.""

, If you have hit the wall and are really struggling with interview preparation after being fired, you needn't go it alone. There are thousands of professional coaches that specialize in this realm. Most charge a modest fee, but can you really put a price on regaining your self-confidence and finding that next stop on your career path? A simple internet search with the keyword “interview coaching” with your city/state will net you a place to start the conversation.

, Employers may want an idea of how you will respond to certain situations. When asked a hypothetical, take a moment to think your answer through before you respond.


Use past experience to demonstrate how you would act. For example, you could say: ""Something similar happened at my last job..."" Then, explain why your solution worked.

, Your interviewer may ask how you organize yourself, what your Excel proficiency is and how you meet impossible deadlines.


Offer specifics. Instead of saying you are good at making travel plans, talk about how you found a low fare on a complicated international flight by shopping around online.

, If your potential supervisor is involved in the interview, it is appropriate to ask about how he or she manages.


Explain how you respond to that sort of management. For example, if your interviewer says she is not a micromanager as long as the work gets done, say that you work best independently. If she says she prefers working as a team, tell her you enjoy receiving and offering feedback during the course of a project.

You'll often be able to learn the answers to basic questions you have, especially concerning work schedule and job responsibilities.You may also encounter information you're curious about, so you can ask the interviewer to expand or clarify.


Try the company website, anything a search engine turns up about the company, and the company's social media pages.
Try to understand the company's goals and mission, and how it ties in to your skills and interests. This makes you appear prepared and suitable for the company, which is a cut above someone who only repeats the website's talking points.
If you know someone who works or used to work at the company, that contact can give you specific tips about your interviewers or what the company values.;
, Write down a list of questions you expect them to ask, and then construct a thoughtful answer to each one in writing. If you get some of your guesses right, you'll appear confident and practiced, and will have less anxiety about improvising your answers.


Be prepared to summarize your previous work experiences, and to explain how they contributed to skills and knowledge that applies to the job you're trying to get.
Certain common resume occurrences are often brought up in interview questions. These include a long gap in your employment, a job you only had for a short time, or unusual work experience people may not be familiar with.

, The interviewer may ask you non-work-related questions, and you should be able to tie them into your interest in the company. Some of these may take verbal gymnastics, but if you focus on your personal character development and your passion for the work the company does, you can usually find a way to connect them with the question.


Prepare a short summary of a few major accomplishments in your life or career, ending with a tie-in about how you are suited for this job. When they ask you to ""tell me about yourself,"" they are looking for more specific information than what you included on your resume.Google your name and be prepared to explain any unflattering information, work experience you left off your resume, or unusual hobbies. The last category can easily become a strength if you describe positive reasons you enjoy them.
Other common questions include What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?, Why should we hire you?, Where do you see yourself in five years?, and How did you hear about our company? These are all opportunities to describe yourself in a positive light, especially your connection and commitment to the company's mission. If you are having trouble coming up with answers, have a friend who's prepared for interviews before help you construct answers that are positive, but not clichéd.

, Have a friend read out your list of questions, or do it alone in front of a mirror. Answer them without reading from your paper, although glancing down at first is fine. Do this several times, trying to word your answers in different ways each time. The more you practice, the more natural you'll sound when the interviewer asks a similar, but not identical, question.

, Bring along a copy of your resume, as well as a notepad and pen. If you're coming straight from another obligation, bring along a comb, makeup, or whatever else you need to improve your appearance before the interview begins.


Bringing a phone to exchange contact information is a good idea, but be sure it is set to silent during the interview.
Consider printing out the ""about the company page"" or the job postings section of their website and making notes on it concerning what information you'd like to learn more about.

, Cut your nails, tidy your hair, and wear well kept, formal clothing. See this article for more detailed information if you're not confident about your dress decisions.


There are rare exceptions, but you should only dress more casually if you are specifically told not to dress up. Even then you should pay attention to hygiene and not wear ratty or dirty clothing. This situation comes up most often for jobs that require outdoor manual labor.

, Having a bored friend in the car or kids waiting in the lobby will increase your anxiety.Similarly, keep your schedule clear so you don't keep someone waiting if the interview goes long. If you have to pick your kids up from school or have a meeting with a friend, try to get someone else to cover for you or reschedule before the interview.

, Aim to show up in advance in case of unexpected delays. You only have one chance to make a good first impression, and even a reasonable excuse for being late will make you look worse.

Don't enter the interviewing office until five minutes before your scheduled interview time. Give yourself extra time to find the interview location if it is in a large complex or complicated building.
If you are unavoidably delayed, call in advance and let them know the reason and your estimated arrival time.

, This article contains many methods for reducing anxiety. Pick one or two that you can do before the interview and have calmed you down in the past. If you have trouble relaxing and aren't sure which will work, try to find the time to try some of these out in the week before the interview.


If you have the time beforehand, try having lunch with a calm friend or getting a massage. Many people become nervous if they are waiting for something stressful alone, so try to choose an absorbing, distracting activity with a relaxing friend.
If you only have a few minutes before the interview, take a few deep, slow breaths in and out, holding each one for a brief pause. Do this for 30–60 seconds if you can.
Some relaxation methods are impractical when preceding a job interview. Taking a bubble bath or jogging right before your interview will leave a bad impression when you show up with wet hair or a sweat soaked shirt.

Prepare beforehand.,
Make a good impression with your introduction.,
Stay upbeat but don't joke around.,
Don't share personal information.,
Take a few notes for important information.,
Ask questions when given an opportunity.,
Ask about the next step.,
Send a thank you note for important jobs.,
Follow through if the company is slow getting back to you.",How to Go to an Interview2," Follow the advice under Preparing for the Interview thoroughly. The more work you do beforehand, the more confident you'll be. Don't leave everything to the morning before if you want to make a good impression.


The advice under the Preparing section includes information on everything from doing research days in advance, to calming your nerves a few minutes before the interview.
This section covers the interview itself, starting with introducing yourself and ending with how to follow up afterwards.

, Greet them confidently, without mumbling, and make eye contact. Shake their hand firmly but don't crush it, unless you live in an area where a different greeting is more common between business contacts.

Consider waiting while standing up in the few minutes before the interviewer shows up. It's easier to make a good impression when you're not struggling out of a comfy chair. This won't make or break a job, so feel free to sit down if your knees are shaking or your legs need the rest.

, You should never appear sad or grim. Try to turn every question into a positive, even ones that touch on depressing subjects such as losing your last job. It's great if you and the interviewer are getting along, but don't go too far and start chatting instead of answering questions.


When discussing losing a job, use comments such as ""I'm glad of the experience I got there."" or ""And now I'm free to apply to great companies like this one.""
Don't crack jokes during an interview. It's hard to predict how a stranger will react to your humor.

, You should focus on the questions you are asked and how they relate to the job you're applying for. Be especially cautious about sharing potentially controversial information such as religious beliefs or hobbies.


Prepare responses beforehand in case you are asked personal questions. Try deflecting them with responses such as ""My (health / family situation / hobby) will not affect my ability to perform this job."" or ""I have a rich (background / set of life experiences / world view) that adds a lot to my work ethic.""
In the United States, it is illegal for your interviewer to ask about your race, religion, birthplace, marital or family status, age, sex, or disability.Many countries have similar anti-discrimination laws which you can find summarized online. If the interviewer breaks one of these laws, try to deflect the question without getting angry.

, The purpose of a notepad at an interview is to jot down important information you need to remember, such as the potential start date of the job and the contact information of your interviewer. Don't spend the interview writing down every word; your focus should be on the conversation occurring.

, Don't make this a one way street. When your answer leads to a question you have, feel free to end by asking it. When your interviewer asks if you have any questions, have a few relevant ones prepared. This is an opportunity for you to find out more about the nature of the job you're considering, not just a chance for the company to evaluate you.

, At the end of the interview, if the interviewer doesn't tell you already, you should find out what the next step entails. Will they get back to you within one week or three? Will they schedule a second interview, or let you know whether you have the job? Know what to expect before you leave.


Always remember to end by thanking the interviewer.

, The manager of a chain store probably doesn't care whether you send him or her a thank you note, but if this is a job that is important to your career, you should go the extra distance. Contact them the same day just to let them know you appreciated the interview.


Send a handwritten note only if your handwriting is clear and legible.

, If the interviewer tells you they'll contact you in the next week but there's no sign of this happening, send him or her an email inquiring politely about the situation. This keeps you at the forefront of his or her mind and lets you know exactly what to expect.


Don't sound impatient or annoyed, but don't feel shy about contacting them, either. Following through shows interest in the job, and should be received positively, as long as you wait until the company has had a reasonable time to respond, at least a week or however long the interviewer specified.

Don't schedule phone interviews during work.",How to Go to an Interview3," Look up the location of the company office as soon as possible, preferably when you are applying to the job. Once you are offered an interview, ask for an estimate of its length. Is it possible to get there during your lunch hour? You might end up in an awkward situation if you answer a phone call and agree to an impossible time slot in your excitement.

, If the date is a week or more in the future, you can probably find a way to rearrange your schedule. But if the interview is offered at short notice, or you know you have an important meeting at your current job during that time, suggest an alternate interview time.


If you are caught in a phone conversation and offered an interview when you aren't certain of your availability, say you will try to clear up space on your calendar and will let them know soon. Call or email them back as soon as possible, preferably within a few hours, to let them know when you can make it.
Some employers have unreasonable expectations, expecting potential employees to show up on a day's notice or clear their calendar no matter what.In initial interactions, assume the other person is reasonable. If you've exchanged a few emails and noticed indications otherwise, you may need to cancel important appointments or make similar sacrifices if you're still interested in the job.

, Be honest with your potential employer, and let them know you already have a job. The company you're applying to join wouldn't want its employers skipping work to apply to other jobs, so trying to arrange an alternate solution sends a better message about your work ethic.

, If the interview is not available outside of your work hours, and the location is nearby, suggest using your lunch hour. Be sure to ask how long the interview is expected to take, so you know whether this solution is reasonable.


Don't assume the travel time and interview length will stick within your estimates. If it's a tight scheduling squeeze, ask your boss if you can come in early or stay late that day and run some errands during a longer lunch break.

, Use one of your time off days when you need to schedule a longer interview or one located further away. If you can schedule several interviews for that day, even better.


Depending on how nosy your boss is, you might not need an explanation longer than ""I'm taking a vacation day."" Sick days do require lying, but with some employers or short notice interviewers, you may not have another choice.
If you're planning on leaving your job anyway, using your vacation days for interviewing isn't much of a loss.

, ""I have an appointment Friday afternoon; could I work longer on Thursday instead?"" is enough for many employers. It even has the advantage of being true, which makes you sound more convincing. If they grill you about what type of appointment it is, just stick with something simple and believable, such as a doctor's or dentist's appointment.


If you are taking time off for interviews frequently, the dentist or doctor's excuse still works. Many people need to go back several times to check their dental work, and you shouldn't be expected to reveal your health problems.

, In your anxiety not to reveal your job search, you may end up making your boss even angrier!If you're lying to make your boss think you're skipping work because of a hangover, what are you accomplishing?


Always let your boss know before you take time off, not after. Any excuse sounds unprofessional once you ditched your employer without telling them.

, Of course you shouldn't fall into the old trap of ""my third grandmother died"", but really, even the first invented excuse about a family member is a bad idea.It's not uncommon for your boss to eventually meet the person you're talking about, and then you're stuck explaining that your sister developed amnesia about the race car accident.

, If your interview and travel time is going to take three hours, saying your son is running late for school won't sound convincing when you finally slink into work. The worst mistake is telling your boss the delay is caused by something he or she can fix. ""I have a flat tire, but don't send anyone, I'd rather sit on the highway all day."" screams dishonesty.


Many large companies have daycare services that can look after your kid, so be sure you know that yours doesn't before claiming your son and daughter as an excuse.

, Most workplaces don't require formal clothing on the same level as interview dress. If you're coming straight from work, give yourself enough time to stop by a public bathroom, clothing store changing stall, or your home and change into nicer clothes before the interview.


If you have no convenient place to store your interview clothing, drop it off the day before at a dry cleaner's and pick it up on your way to the interview.

, If you manage to get an interview outside of work, but need to take care of your kids, hire a babysitter to cover you for a couple hours. If you can't afford to, find a responsible friend or family member to help you out for this brief period.


This applies to other obligations as well; you may need to reschedule less urgent tasks or ask a friend or family member to do them for you.

, If you are having a phone interview, make it clear to your interviewer that you need to know when to expect the call. Don't agree to answer the phone during work hours; that's an easy way to get caught.


If you have little time free between when you get out of work and your interviewer does, suggest a phone interview immediately after work, before you get home. You can find a quiet public park to conduct it in, or pull over by the side of the road if you are phoned while driving.

Be infectiously enthusiastic!",How to Get a Job at Chipotle Mexican Grill," You might be asked this at the interview, but even if you aren't, this is very important to know when you get hired. Chipotle's vision is to ""develop a team of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards.""


Everybody must work together and work to accomplish the goal of making your general manager a restaurateur every day. Good is no longer good enough and great can be even better. Living the vision is the only way to become restaurateur. Your general manger needs 3 things to become a restaurateur: top performers, empowerment, and knowledge of high standards.;
, Steve Ells, the founder of Chipotle, says that it is ""our commitment to always look closer, dig deeper, and work harder to ensure that our actions are making things better, not worse. It’s our promise to run our business in a way that doesn’t exploit animals, people or the environment. It is the philosophy that guides every decision we make at Chipotle.""


In other words, Chipotle does whatever it can to make sure 

livestock is not put through harsh conditions or given antibiotics
livestock lives on a vegetarian diet
the produce is locally farmed and organic whenever possible


If their food ever doesn't meet their high standards, they make sure to let people know and sometimes will even pull the food item in question. This happened in January 2015 when the pigs from a supplier were found during a routine audit being put through conditions that did not meet Chipotle's standards. All Chipotle restaurants that got their carnitas from that supplier immediately donated their carnitas and no longer served that meat.Food With Integrity makes a difference in how everything tastes and also takes a big step in changing the way people think about food.

, This is something that may be asked during the interview. Chipotle's definition of a top performer is ""A person who has the desire and ability to perform excellent work, and whose constant effort to do so elevates them, their team, and Chipotle.""


Being a top performer is not just about being awesome at everything you do, but about how much you want to be awesome and how you help your team to be awesome and to achieve high standards.

, This is something that may be asked during the interview. Chipotle's definition of high standards is ""Creating a uniquely extraordinary restaurant experience for every one of your customers and crew.""


Remember that high standards means always. Always make the best food. Always have great work ethic. Always give your customers great customer service. Always keep the restaurant ship-shape. Always have high standards. It's the way everything should be.


, This is something that may be asked during the interview. Chipotle's definition of empowerment is ""To be confident in your ability and encouraged by your circumstances such that you feel motivated and at liberty to devote all of your talents to a purpose.""


Remember that empowerment is a feeling. Empowerment is a feeling of ownership. Empowerment is a feeling of motivation. Empowerment is a feeling of wanting to be a top performer. Empowerment is a feeling of always having high standards. Empowerment is a feeling of passion for what you do and what you can accomplish. It is important that everybody working in a team at Chipotle feels empowered to be the best.


, This is something that may be asked during the interview. Chipotle's definition of a Restaurateur is ""a person who develops a team of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards.""


All Restaurateurs are Chipotle general managers, but not all Chipotle general managers are Restaurateurs. It takes a special person with a special team to be a Restaurateur.


, When you get the job, you will most likely start as a crew member because Chipotle tends to only hire managers from within. Understand that you probably aren't coming in and exclusively working the line, or the cash resister, or the grill, or whatever you want to do; you will be trained to do everything. When you are handed your black Chipotle shirt with the nifty typography on the back and non-slip shoe covers, you have officially become a potential Chipotle restaurateur. You'll have to do hard work to be a top performer. You'll have to be empowered to make your own decisions on how to achieve high standards. If you are not inspired, Chipotle might not be the right place for you to work.

, Groom yourself before you go in; take a shower, brush your teeth, comb your hair, rub on some deodorant, put on a nice outfit, do your makeup if you wish. Make sure you are presentable as that is one of the 13 characteristics they look for when they hire you. You don't need to wear anything formal, but try to look presentable. Ladies, try a skirt and a nice top or a nice pair of pants and a sweater or a casual dress. Wear flats or Mary Janes or nice dress shoes. Gentlemen, try a nice pair of pants with a button up top or a polo.

, Happiness is one of the 13 characteristics they look for when they hire you. Don't pretend to be happy either. Shake your interviewer's hands and introduce yourself. You are likely to have more than one interviewer so shake everybody's hands. If you are being interviewed with other people, introduce yourself to them as well. Smile, and look like you want to be there.

, Honesty is one of the 13 characteristics they look for when they hire you. It's better to be honest than to have problems later along the road because you lied.

, High energy is one of the 13 characteristics they look for when they hire you. If asked to do icebreaker games or to do group activities, show that you are excited to do them and that you love to be there. Have a good night's sleep before you come in because you can give off a bad impression if you look tired or bored.

, Being smart is one of the 13 characteristics they look for during the interview. Make sure you know about the company and thoroughly read through the 'Do Your Research' section of this article. You don't need to memorize anything just yet, but be able to answer questions Chipotle's vision and what high standards, empowerment, and a top performer is. You might also be asked what you are passionate about, and about what makes a person a good or bad leader.

, Being polite is one of the 13 characteristics they look for when they hire you. Wait your turn to answer questions if in a a group setting. Say please and thank you whenever needed. Don't fiddle with anything.

, Being ambitious is one of the 13 characteristics they look for when they hire you.  If asked what your dreams are or where you see yourself in five years, don't feel pressured to say anything Chipotle-related if that's not where you see yourself.


Do not answer with ""I don't know"". That answer sounds lazy and gives off the impression that you lack ambition. It's okay to not know, but say something along the lines of, ""As of right now, I don't know where I'll be career-wise, but I'm considering . . . "" and say something you might like to do.

, There is no reason to put others down. Being respectful is one of the 13 characteristics they look for when they hire you. When you're in a group interview, there is no reason to act like it's you against them. Let others answer their questions and don't hog the spotlight. If the team likes you, they like you. If they don't, then they don't see the 13 characteristics in you and working at Chipotle isn't the right job for you.

, Curiosity is one of the 13 characteristics they look for when they hire you. Ask anything that comes to mind during the interview. There's no such thing as a stupid question, especially when you are asking questions about your future as a Chipotle employee. Come in with a list of questions, because coming up with questions on the spot might be difficult.

, Motivation is one of the 13 characteristics they look for when they hire you. Show you are excited to work at Chipotle and that you are motivated to do well.

, Hospitality is one of the 13 characteristics that the Chipotle team looks for when they hire you. Be kind and friendly to everybody in the room and explain how you love people. If asked how you would handle rude customers, explain that you would be kind to them (if that's true--remember honesty is one of the 13 characteristics).

, Being conscientious is one of the 13 characteristics that Chipotle looks for when they hire you. Chances are, your interview will have group activities. Be able to do your part thoroughly but don't try to steal the show.

, That is one of the 13 characteristics that Chipotle looks for when they hire you. Have fun at the interview. Don't be afraid to make a few jokes and make the interview enjoyable for everybody.

Ask for a timeline.,
Ask for your interviewer's business card.",How to Follow Up After a Job Interview1," If the interviewer does not offer a timeline for their decision-making process, you are perfectly entitled to ask for one. Find out when they expect to let candidates know their decision, who in the company will be contacting the candidates (interviewer, HR manager), and through what means - email, phone call or letter.


This is extremely useful, as it will give you some indication of how long you are expected to wait for a decision and of when it will be appropriate to follow up with the correct person.;
, This will give you the person’s correct contact information, including name, title, mailing address and email address, which will save you time when you are sending your thank you note and letter.

Find out what the mission of the company is, how long it’s been around, how many employees it has, and what your position would be if you got the job. If the company has a motto, memorize it. Make sure you know as much about it as you can so you can impress your interviewers and show them how much you care.


You can find ways to show that you know your stuff during the interview. You can say something like, “I’ve read all about your mission and I think being committed to educating the world for free is an amazing goal.”
Show that you know what the position entails, too. If you know the qualities the interviewers are looking for, then it’ll be easier to sell yourself and to show that you possess them.;
, If you can spend a few minutes looking up your interviewers, finding out where they went to college, where they previously worked, or anything else about them, then you’ll have a leg up in the interview process. Though you don’t need to mention that you internet stalked them unless it comes up, if you find a few things you have in common, such as the fact that you both happened to work at the same company five years ago, then this can help you get an extra advantage.


You can check out their LinkedIn profiles or their profiles on any other professional networks to get even more information.
Just don’t get too personal. You don’t to mention something you found on the interviewer’s Facebook page.

, Though each interview is different, there are certain questions that many interviewers commonly ask, and it’s good to have some answers prepared so you don’t look unprepared or caught off guard. Here are some questions you should be prepared to answer:


“What are your biggest strengths?” Pick a strength or strengths that illustrate why you’d be a good fit for the position, and provide concrete details to back up why you possess that strength. Make sure it’s relevant to the job.
“What are your biggest weaknesses?” Don’t say “I work too hard” — everyone has heard this one before! Instead, pick a weakness that isn’t super important to the position and show that you’re working on improving at it. Say something like, “My biggest weakness with teaching is time management. I get so excited about all of the material that I sometimes try to cram too much new material into one class. But I’ve learned to break down each class in five-minute intervals and to make sure to only cover what the students can handle in one class period.”
“Why do you want to work at this company?” Don’t tell your interviewers that you want to work there because it’s the only company that asked you for an interview. Instead, point out several things you like about the company and be as detailed as possible; also make it clear why you think you would fit in there and be able to contribute to their team.

, At the end of most interviews, your potential employers will ask you if you have any questions you want to ask them. You should prepare at least a handful of questions and pick the ones that are the most relevant to ask; this shows that you’ve done your research and are excited about the position. If you just smile and say that you have no questions, this makes it look like you don’t care about the position all that much. Here are some things you can ask about:


Details about an aspect of the job you’d like to know more about
Asking what your daily life on the job would look like, such as how much time you’d spend collaborating with other co-workers
Asking what their favorite part of working for the company is
Asking about other ways you can get involved at the company in addition to the job description. For example, if you’re applying for a teaching job at the high school, you can ask if you can be involved in extracurricular activities too.

, If you want to feel really confident going into that interview, then you may want to practice with a friend or even someone who knows about your field first. This can help you practice stating your answers with confidence, getting the body language down, and feeling secure in what you have to offer. This is also a great way to get rid of some of those pre-interview jitters and to give you the confidence you need to face the interview.


You can even dress up for the practice interview so you don’t feel so nervous when you put on your interview clothes.
Have your friend give you an honest assessment of what you could do better in the actual interview. Just make sure that the friend gives you more compliments than criticism so you feel encouraged.

, Another thing you need to get ready to say is why you’d be a great fit for the company. Check out what the employees at the company are like and what the company values the most when it comes to the position you’re seeking; use buzzwords to show why you possess those qualities and why you’d be a perfect fit for the job you’re interviewing for. Here are some things you can say:


“I know that strong communication skills are essential for this position, and I would be a great fit for it because of my years of management, training, and hiring experience. I’ve communicated with employees, customers, and managers for years and have learned how to give positive feedback as well as how to respectfully discuss room for improvement.”
“I’m excited about all of the teamwork that the position requires. I’ve successfully worked in teams and have collaborated with many co-workers at my current position, and I would be eager to bring that experience to your company.”

, It’s important to get everything you need together the day before you go to the interview so you don’t have to do any last-minute preparation to get ready for the big day. You’ll most likely need to bring your resume and cover letter to use as a reference, as well as any other additional materials that you think will help give your interviewers a better sense of who you are and the work that you do.


For example, if you’re applying for a teaching position, you may want to bring an old syllabus to show the kind of work that you’re capable of doing.

, If you want to make a good impression, then you have to start off by dressing professionally. If that means spending some money on a business-appropriate outfit, then you’ll have to make this choice; having at least one solid interview outfit can really help you land the job of your dreams. Even if the office is a bit more casual, you should err on the side of being a bit overdressed, which is far better than looking casual in front of formally-dressed interviewers.


Make sure to groom yourself well and to pay attention to your hygiene, too. If you don’t put time and effort into your appearance, it will show.
Try on your outfit at least a few days before to make sure that it’s flattering and that there are no problems with it. You don’t want to put on your interview outfit an hour before your interview to find that the store clerk forgot to take off the security tag.

, Showing up a little bit early to the interview shows that you’re punctual and that you really care about your job. Plus, if you rush in there just before it’s time to begin, you won’t have time to decompress and get into a relaxed state of mind. If your potential employers see that you can’t even arrive to an interview on time, they’ll be likely to think that there’s not a big chance that you’ll show up to work on time, either.


Even if you’re really early, throw out your Starbucks coffee at the door. Rolling in with coffee shows that you’re taking too much of a casual approach.
If you’re half an hour early, wait outside or in your car. You don’t want to show up way too early and then end up making your interviewers feel flustered because they aren’t ready for you.

, When you walk into the room, stand tall, make eye contact, put a smile on your face, and give your interviewers a firm, confident handshake when you introduce yourself. Walk with confidence and avoid fidgeting or looking around the room; remember that you only have one chance to make a first impression, and you want it to count.


You can say something simple like, “I’m Susan. Thank you for taking the time to meet with me.”

, Speak as clearly and confidently as you can and make eye contact when you share your thoughts and ideas. Try to avoid saying “like” or “um” too much and focus on getting your points across, even if that means pausing to think. The most important thing is that you deliver your words with confidence and sound like you really mean what you say.


Practicing saying what you have to say aloud can help you gain the confidence to be articulate during your interview. That said, you should make sure your words sound natural, not rehearsed.

, Though you may feel like your interviewers really like you and that they’re getting buddy buddy with you, you should avoid mentioning anything overly personal about yourself. Don’t talk about your significant other, your kids, or your personal problems at home; this shows that you’re not focused on the job and that you’re unprofessional.


Of course, if you see that your interviewer has a big poster of your favorite sports team in his office, you can mention the connection in passing if it comes up, but don’t get much more personal than that.

, When the interview is over, show that you’re grateful for the fact that your interviewers took the time to meet with you and to get a chance to talk to you about your skills and qualifications. As you leave the room, shake your interviewer’s hand again and make sure to look her in the eye and give her a sincere smile and a real thank you; this shows that you’re considerate and that you’re really grateful for the opportunity.


Just say something simple like, “Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me. This has been a wonderful opportunity and I really appreciate it.”
As the conversation wraps up, you can also ask about a time frame and next steps. They should tell you when they’ll get back to you and what the next steps would be.

, There are a few things you should avoid at all costs when you go into an interview. Many people don’t know that a few innocent comments can actually cause a big red flag to go up for the interviewer. Choose your words carefully and make sure you give an impression of being a respectful, hard worker who is truly excited about the position. Here are some things you should avoid:


Don’t ask about the perks of the job before you’ve been given an offer. This will make it look like you’re more interested in vacation days than in working.
Don’t talk about how you’ve applied to a million jobs without being asked for an interview. Make it look like you really want this specific position.
Don’t say something that shows how little you know about the company or how little research you’ve done. Make sure your potential employers see that you really care about the company.

, Even if your boss is a rude, petty, inconsiderate, condescending jerk and your job is unstimulating and you feel completely unfulfilled there, you should say something like, “I’ve gained a lot of great experiences at my current position, but I’m ready for a new challenge.” If you say horrible things about your job or your boss, then your potential future employers will think that you may turn around and say the same about them in the future.


You want to give the impression of being an easygoing, agreeable person who is easy to work with. Even if your conflicts at work aren’t your fault, you don’t want to give the impression of being someone who is difficult to work with.

, Once you’ve completed your interview, you should send your interviewer a quick email thanking him or her for taking the time to meet with you and to reiterate your interest in this position. Taking the time to write a quick note to your interviewer shows that you took the process seriously and that you’re eager to find out about the next steps.


Besides, not everyone does this, so you will make yourself stand out as a person who is truly passionate about the position.

, The trick to acing a Skype interview is to treat it just as seriously as a real interview even though you’re not doing it in person. If you want to really succeed, then dress up just as if you were going to a real interview, leave a copy of your resume and cover letter on your desk, and make sure you’re in a quiet place with good internet connection.


Pick a location with flattering lighting so your interviewers can really see you and read your expressions.
Close your email window and any other windows that are likely to distract you during the interview. Give all of your attention to the person who is talking to you.
Check that your microphone and video chat works in advance. Practice by trying to chat with a friend the day before so you know you won’t have any technical difficulties when the time comes.

, Many companies have an initial phone interview to get a better sense of their top applicants before they invite them to meet for an interview in person. This saves time for them and gives them a better understanding of each candidate. You should treat this type of interview just as seriously as a real interview. Have your notes in front of you, dress up, and find a quiet place and good reception so you can have a meaningful conversation over the phone.


Make sure to be professional and considerate in all of your responses. Don’t slack off just because you’re only talking over the phone.
Remember that, since your interviewer won’t have visual cues, you’ll have to work extra hard to paint a picture of who you are with words. Have a list of relevant buzzwords ready if you think it’ll help you.

, Occasionally, you may be invited to a group interview so that your interviewers can interview more candidates at once and so they can get a better sense of how you interact with other people. The trick to acing these interviews is to be able to be assertive enough to still give your interviewers a sense of who you are while also showing that you’re considerate toward others and can work well in teams.


Don’t try to put down other interviewers in order to make yourself look good. Instead, be kind and supportive toward them while making it clear that you’re the best candidate for the job.
If there are group activities during the interview, try to take a leadership position while making sure you’re not bossy and don’t keep the other interviewers from contributing.

Know your intent.,

Avoid asking yes or no questions; e.g., ""Do you live in San Francisco?"",
Don't let the subject see any emotion on your face except pleasure.",How to Film Interviews,"


Ask yourself:

What is the subject/purpose/theme of my film?
What are some good questions I can ask my interviewees?
Why am I conducting these interviews; what do I hope to gain from this?
Where do I want to take this film or what do I want to do with it when I'm done?
Who do I want to film?
Do I want to be on or off camera when I ask the questions?

;
, Try to find films or television shows that have a similar subject to yours or that offer a style you hope to imitate.


Ask yourself these questions when viewing:

How is the interviewer asking their questions?
Where is the interviewee looking when answering the questions?
Where is the camera's focus?
Where is the light hitting on the subject's face?
How close or tight is the camera shot?
At what angle is the camera pointed and what angle is the interviewee sitting in relationship to the camera?



,


Have at least 10 to 20 good questions prepared, and be prepared to ask more on the fly.
Be prepared to stray from the questions you have written down; your interviewee might offer information that you weren't expecting taking you in an entirely different, yet more interesting, direction.
Start with topical questions that will make your subject feel at ease; e.g., ""What is your name?"" ""Where are you from?"" These kinds of questions are easy for the interviewee to answer, which will help them to feel comfortable.
Save the hard questions for the tail end of the interview. A person tends to forget the purpose of the questioning and becomes more comfortable talking with you in front of a camera after about ten minutes.

, The biggest fear of anyone that agrees to be on camera, is that the person interviewing them will make them look like a fool.


Be upfront with your interviewee with what you are doing and why you're doing it.
It is imperative that your subjects are okay with you asking them questions and comfortable with the idea of a camera being pointed at them. If they're not, you will have a resistant person and the interview will be difficult.
Some people will want a list of the questions before they agree to do the interview. They would not be what you would call an open minded or willing participant. Think of them as apprehensive and consider asking someone more agreeable.

, Your interview location and background are as important as the interview.


Know if you want the set to play a role and shape the tone of the interview, or if you want the subject to pop out from the plain or dark background.
Let the interview subject know you are not wasting their time. Have a place for your subject to sit and all the lighting in place at least 15 minutes prior to their arrival.
Adjust the lighting based on your subject's height and what they're wearing.
Place the camera where you want it to be before they arrive. Plan to adjust the height of the tripod and the camera settings once your subject is in place.
Have the camera on and be ready to shoot before the subject arrives.
Be prepared for last minute changes. Rarely do things go precisely according to plan in the business of film-making.

,


Know the rule of thirds. Place your subject's face on one of the axis points; i.e., where the vertical and horizontal lines intersect - also in red in the picture.
Film the interview subject straight on or at an angle (45 degrees is ideal). Filming straight on requires that you place the interviewee in the left third or right third of the camera's screen.
Have the interview subject speak directly to the person asking the questions, not directly into the camera. Sit near the camera (within 45 degrees), but not behind the camera, when asking questions.

,


Relax. If you're relaxed, you will put your interview subject at ease and they will relax.
Be confident. If you're prepared with your questions and you arrive early to the set, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable. You can do this, it just takes practice. This calm confidence will be silently communicated to your interview subject, and things should go well.

,


Ask thought-provoking questions that cause the interviewee to pause and contemplate an authentic response. These are contemplation centered questions as opposed to content centered questions. For example, ask: What do you like/dislike about driving a car? What have you learned about driving over the years? rather than: What is the purpose of the gas pedal? The last question leads the interviewee to your desired answer rather than letting them contemplate a personal response.

,


Ask your subject a question, then listen to the answer. Pay close attention to the content of what they are saying, the context in which they are saying it, and what their face, body, voice, and eyes are really saying to you. Notice if they are uncomfortable with the question, and find out why without forcing the issue.
Nod with your head and focus your eyesight to acknowledge you are listening. Insert the occasional, ""Yes"", or ""Uh-huh"". Make sure you don't overlap or interrupt the interviewee. Your voice will be recorded also.

, You can be held legally liable for many things such as defamation of character if the subject(s) of your film does not like the way you portray them.

, Get a signed release form from your film subject if you plan on showing this film anywhere other than your home.

, Get a location release if you are filming in a location that does not belong to you; i.e., you do not own the property.

, Children under age of 18 come with parents and a lot more responsibility for the filmmaker. Avoid minors until you are an established filmmaker and more aware of the legalities that come along with this.

, Again, until you are an established filmmaker, this is not an area you want to enter into because there are many laws and regulations when working with professional actors and minors or both.

, Make sure you have plenty of time booked at your location, charge left on your batteries and at least one back up battery, and storage space on your recording media (e.g., SD Card). An interview with one willing participant is likely to run 25-35 minutes, so be prepared.

, The interviewee will most likely give you one word responses.

, A person on camera is very aware of everything around them. If it is a bad interview, you may need to do another one, but it is more likely that you will find usable pieces of the interview when you head into post-production editing. It may take some people longer to really open up on camera than others.

"
Send a thank you note by email.,
Make notes about the interview while it is still fresh in your mind.,
Ask to connect on LinkedIn.",How to Follow Up After a Job Interview2," You should do this as soon after the interview as possible, from your smartphone on the way out of the building, as soon as you get home, or at least the same evening as the interview. This shows the interviewer that you are both enthusiastic and organized and ensures that they will not forget you as a candidate.


Include your full name, phone number, mailing address and email address on the note. Also, make sure this email doesn’t go to a spam folder by writing “Job interview follow up for (your name)” in the subject line.
If you leave it too long before writing your thank you note, you risk looking uninterested in the job while also giving another candidate the opportunity to get there before you.
If there was a particular person who helped you to set up the job interview, you should remember to send them a note also.
Some people advise writing a thank you note by hand. While some interviewers will appreciate this, it is somewhat outdated and other interviewers may regard it as being unprofessional. As a result, an email or typed note is your safest option in this scenario., These notes will be useful during a second interview to help you recall topics of conversation and any qualifications or personality traits that your interviewer emphasized as being important for this position.


They will help you to tailor your responses should you be called to a second interview, or may give you some indication of where you went wrong if you are not.
The notes will also help you to refer to more specific points in your follow-up thank you letter and give an indication that you really took on board everything that the interviewer said.

, Asking your interviewer to connect on LinkedIn is a completely appropriate move, if executed correctly. You don't want it to look like your motives are purely selfish or that you're over-confident about getting the job. Instead, send a simple message which states exactly who you are and refers to some topic or point that was raised during the interview, before asking if they would like to connect.If you are applying for a job in the fashion industry, for example, and the topic of Paris Fashion Week came up during the interview, mention an interesting article about a particular designer or fashion trend that you found online and ask if you can share it with them.
Alternatively, if you had a casual conversation with the interviewer before or after the interview and something came up about a particular restaurant or upcoming music event, request to share a link providing additional details.
The bottom line is that you need to request to connect on LinkedIn by making it interesting or worthwhile for them - it shouldn't look like a purely self-serving move.

"
"
Mail a more formal thank you letter.,
After the indicated time period has passed, follow up with a single email or phone call.,
Respond promptly if you are contacted about a second interview or a job offer.,
Even if you didn't get the job, thank the interviewer for their time.",How to Follow Up After a Job Interview3," This can also be done via email, or through a typed letter, depending on the kind of company you are applying to. A social media related or tech company might appreciate the ease and efficiency of an email, whereas a company with more old-fashioned or traditional values would appreciate a letter.Whatever form you use, the purpose of the letter is to remind the interviewer of what a strong candidate you are and why you are uniquely qualified for the job. If you interviewed by multiple people, you should send each of them a separate thank you letter.


Use the interviewer’s first name in the greeting and salutation only if you were told to do so during the interview; otherwise, address the interviewer in a formal manner.
After thanking the interviewer again for the opportunity to interview with the company, affirm your interest in the position and reiterate how you would be an asset to the company.
Add information that the interviewer might be interested in, or some useful information that the company could use profitably. This will help the interviewer to remember you, as most people follow up after a job interview with only information about themselves.
Close the letter with the valediction ""Yours sincerely"" and proofread it thoroughly for grammar, spelling and punctuation. A poorly-worded or misspelled thank-you letter can be all it takes to disqualify you as a candidate., If the time period they specified it would take for them to reach a decision has passed - whether it has been two days or two weeks - it is now appropriate for you to follow up about the decision via email or phone call. Keep it brief and breezy, you could say something like:


""I hope the hiring process is going well for the position of Marketing Assistant. I believe you mentioned that a decision would be reached by Monday and I'm eager to find out if you have any information on the status of my application? Please let me know if I can provide any further information that would help you with the decision making process.""If you decide to phone, make the call from a quiet place a few days after the interview. Pick a good time of day -- not right after lunch, early in the morning or at the end of the working day. This will maximize your chances of actually speaking to the interviewer.
Be as polite and brief on the phone as possible - remember that you may be talking to a stressed-out hiring manager that has a 101 things on his/her mind other than the status of your job application. Don't call a second time unless you are specifically told., Making them wait for a response is unprofessional and makes it seem like you are not enthusiastic about the job. Don't be worried about coming across as over-eager - they want candidates who are excited by the prospect of working for their company.


Reply using the same method as they used to contact you - if they called, ring them back as soon as possible, if they sent an email, an email reply should suffice.

, Don't be angry or overly disappointed - accept the fact that there were probably many other qualified candidates and view it as a valuable learning experience. Whether you are informed via phone or email, you should send a follow-up message to your interviewer thanking them for their time and for giving you the opportunity to interview with them.


If you dare, ask the interviewer if he or she would be willing to provide any feedback on where you went wrong during the interview and how you could improve in future. They will most likely decline, but if they agree you stand to gain some valuable insights into exactly what the company were looking for and where you fell short. Don't be disheartened by it, take the interviewers' suggestions on as constructive criticism.This step should always be executed through email or letter, never by phone call. Calling your interviewer to ask why you didn't get the job may put them in an uncomfortable position and rule you out of any future open positions with the company.

"
"
Don't harass the company.,
Don't go to the company in person, unless invited.,
Don't avoid the follow-up letter or phone call.",How to Follow Up After a Job Interview4," Being over-eager and bombarding the company with follow-up emails and phone calls is not a good idea and can actually harm your chances of getting the position. Follow the three-strike rule - one thank you note, a lengthy thank you letter, and a follow-up email or phone call to find out whether a decision has been made. If you get no response from any of these three, you are better off quitting while you're ahead and moving on with the job search.Whatever you do, don't fill up your interviewers inbox with daily emails or leave long-winded messages or his or her voicemail, as this will definitely won't win you any favors.

, Showing up at the company uninvited is a definite no-no. It puts pressure on the hiring manager or interviewer to speak with you, even though the timing may be very inconvenient for them. It also puts them in a very awkward position if you didn't get the position and they are forced to tell you in person. Either way, it reflects badly on you and you should avoid at all costs. This advice also goes for delivering thank you notes in person - just don't do it., Some people erroneously think they should just wait for a decision and not bother the interviewer. This is not the correct tactic. Many companies deliberately wait before hiring to see who follows up after the interview in a professional manner, and who is really hungry for the position. As long as you abide by the three-strike rule, following-up is a positive and strategic move which may be instrumental in securing you a position with the company.

Request follow-up contact.",How to Give an Interview1," You should have a fairly good idea of what the person is going to say.;
, Ask the person for permission. If they allow you to, you can take fewer notes and pay more attention to your questions during the interview.

, It may not be used in your writing, but it will put the interviewee at ease.

, Touch on education, hobbies, clubs and family. You may want to refer back to these things later on.


If the information you are going to cover is technical, you may want to send the interviewee some questions in advance.
If you want to probe into the person, don’t send them questions. The more practiced they are, the less likely they are to show their genuine selves.

, The person will steer the conversation to where they want to go if you ask too many questions.

, This is when you can fit in yes or no questions. Ease the person into the interview.

, If you want a person to elaborate, try leading questions with “Explain how” or “Could you take me through the process…?”

, Learn to probe deeper into a question. If the person seems upset, uneasy, excited or surprised, this is probably a good time to use a probe.


Examples of probes include “Could you explain what you mean when you say…,” “How did you accomplish that?,” “Why does that stand out to you?” and “Can you tell me more about that?”, If a person has given you a long rambling response, try summing it up with “It sounds like what you’re saying…. Is that a fair summary?” You might be able to pin the person down more on a subject.


It is important to take control of the interview and steer the conversation to your priorities after digressions, unless you are hoping the interviewee will digress., If you want to break into details about personal life or reactions, then say, “Why was this significant to you?” or “What was your motivation?”


If the person gets emotional, give them time to recover before continuing. You don’t need to pat them on the back and comfort them, but they should be allowed to compose themselves.

, You should arrange a way to fact-check anything that you plan to write or print. Ask the person to sign a release if necessary.

The Custom Resume Portfolio: Design a customized resume 'portfolio' for each person interviewing you.,
Remember and use the names of the people that are interviewing you.,
Research the Company!,
The Premier Thank You:To top off your interview with class, immediately after your interview, mail a thank you note to your interviewer(s).",How to Eclipse Your Competition at a Job Interview," Spare no expense here. Build each of your portfolios with a dynamite cover page and tailor it to the specific interviewer. You want it to look like it was made especially for that person, so you will have to find out their names in advance. Your portfolio should contain the 'deluxe' version of your resume, accompanied by all of the necessary documents your future employer would need. Include copies of your degree, combined with duplicates of any special certificates and awards you may have received. Enclose any additional material, such as diagrams, drawings or any project summaries. Use professional style formatting, line art and the appropriate fonts to make your portfolio look like it was designed to sell a new BMW. Lastly, crown your portfolio with a sharp looking professional report cover. Now, imagine the contrast. At your interview, you will slide this personalized portfolio across the table to the person sitting on the other side, while your competition will offer up a stapled xerox copy of their two-page resume.;
, This is very powerful. You'd be surprised at the number of people that forget a person's name just after meeting them. Forgetting someone's name is basically telling that person, ""You are not important enough for me to remember."" Remembering and using someone's name has the exact opposite effect, where instead you are telling that person, ""You are very important to me, so important, that I will make it a point to remember your name."" It's a psychological fact that people love to hear their own name. Use this to your advantage to create a positive anchor about you in the mind of your interviewer. The tactful use of first names during a job interview shows that you are a person who will go above and beyond.

, Before you go in for your interview, put in some extra effort to research and discover some key facts about the company. Memorize the company's mission statement. Learn all you can about what they do. Seek information from their public press releases as a means to ask your interviewer intelligent questions. Use this information in your answers, weaving in what you know about that company when appropriate. What happens next is amazing! Your potential employer will pick up on your genuine interest in them, and your sincerity will tip the scale in your favor! It takes some intense homework and memorization to do this, but it will pay you back. Remember, while your competition is asking the interviewer about vacation pay, you'll be asking about the write-up you saw in Forbes on their most recent innovation.

, Not just any plain old thank you note will do, because that is what your competition is doing. Write your thank you note on a professional high quality card and be sure to write it in your finest penmanship! Make the body of your message effective. Write something that relays your sincere gratitude for the interview opportunity that was just given to you.

, If you would like to sound like an expert, read trade journals, web articles and books the week before the interview. If you are going to quote something it should be correct.

, It’s likely that these written answers won’t reflect how you will deliver them, but it will help you get the facts straight.

, Ask them to pose the questions you came up with. Then, try a few more answers so that you sound natural giving them.

, Understand that any information that they gather from the setting may be used to describe you.

, Instead of pausing, just ask, “Could you go a little more in depth about that?” or “Could you repeat that?”

, If you’ve done research and practiced a little, the information you want to convey is likely to be on the forefront of your mind. Show your personality during an interview, while being professional.

, Ask the interviewer questions as well to make it feel more like an exchange. The person is going to enjoy the interview and have a more favorable impression of your answers., If the interviewer seemed to skip over something that is important, you can say, “I’d like to go back to that” or “I think this is an important part that we should touch on.”

, You probably are, so stop after the next complete thought. You don’t have to answer every question elaborately.

, The interviewer doesn’t always do their research properly, so feel free to provide them with background information that is advantageous to you.

, You may also ask them to send you some copies. Give them your email or phone number for follow-up questions."

Find out where the interview is to be held.,
Dress appropriately.,
Take care with nighttime interviews.,
Tell someone that you're going to an interview.,
Speak up if the interviewer behaves wrongly.",How to Ensure Your Personal Safety when Attending an Interview," If it is on the premises of the organization, this is usually fine and is expected practice. If you are asked to meet somewhere else, however, you may wish to question the request and, in some cases, refuse to comply.


Avoid having interviews in a private residence. Unless you know the person well, this is too risky.
Avoid being interviewed somewhere remote unless you can be with support people. Be sure that your return travel (plane, etc.) is booked and paid for. If you're going overseas for an interview, do your research in advance to check that you're going to a safe place with trustworthy people.
Ask for your interview to be in a public or official place. It's fine to be interviewed in a restaurant provided other people are around, but be wary of a private room.;
, Do not wear clothing that could be viewed as provocative, whatever your gender. It's neither appropriate for an interview and it's a safety measure that makes plain common sense.

, If your job involves shift-work, you might be asked to attend at night although this would be unusual. If you do have a nighttime interview, it can be a good idea to go with someone else and have them wait for you in the car or somewhere near such as a cafe.


Don't let an interviewer drive you home. Have your transportation arrangements sorted and readily accessible.

, Even if you don't want your current work to know you're going for a new job, it's always a good idea to let someone such as your spouse, date, parents, etc., knows where you're going and when you're expecting to return. This isn't just about possible interview problems but also relates to having an accident, or getting lost, etc.

, If the interviewer starts making lewd suggestions, exposes themselves, yells or throws things at you, or harasses you in any way, immediately ask for the behavior and line of questioning to stop and terminate the interview. Inform the interviewer that you are leaving and go as quickly as you can.


Follow up the matter as soon as you can with the firm (and police where necessary). The firm deserves to know it has a rogue interviewer at large.
It is best not to hang around making threats of legal action, etc. This could endanger you. Quickly note what has happened, make your exit and go home and record everything so that you can take this up with the firm the next day. If you are assaulted, go to the police station as soon as you can.

, Consider it the way someone walking in the door would when they tried to figure out just how you did the job.

, E.g.:

Organise your stuff.,
Use music to alter your mood.,
Look after your body.,
Set office hours.,
Don’t be afraid to outsource.",How to Fight Stress as a Graphic Designer,"

If you’re stressed, that probably means you’re busy, and if you’re busy, you probably haven’t had time to clean your workspace recently. It happens to the best of us. A messy or cluttered desk can really exacerbate any sense you might have of being overwhelmed, so take a ten-minute break to clean up your office.;
,

If you have a favourite CD that you’ve been playing to death recently, try going a whole week without. When you get used to (or tired of) a certain piece of music, it ceases to inspire you and lift your spirits — and when that happens, it’s no longer going to help you work.
Try something relaxing like ambient music, or trance, if that works for you. It also helps to change how you listen to music.
Use headphones? Try going without. Headphones can often make a space feel claustrophobic, and if you’re already stressed, it won’t take much to make you feel trapped or hemmed in.

,

When we’re stressed, we don't tend to look after ourselves as well as we normally would — and there’s no excuse for it. Keeping the mind and body healthy can actually help us fight stress, so make sure you stay hydrated, eat properly, and pay close attention to your posture. Don’t hunch over your desk for hours, and don’t forget to take breaks from staring at the computer. If you’re getting headaches or finding you need the screen closer to your face, get your eyes tested.

, If you’re a freelance designer, having office hours might seem like a strange concept — but, if you’ve been working late recently, not sleeping well and getting up mid-morning only to repeat the cycle, imposing a structured workday on yourself might be beneficial.

Letting your work spill over into your home life will definitely make you more stressed, as it restricts the amount of time you have to wind down before bed. In turn, this can have a negative effect on the quality of your sleep, and make it difficult to break the cycle.

, Got too much on your plate? Don’t run yourself into the ground trying to finish it all yourself — outsource it. Working with other designers, and managing a project instead of doing the leg-work, can reduce your stress levels and allow you to focus on other, more pressing things.

It’s good to have a network of people you can call in to assist you if things get busy, and being able to collaborate with others on a project is a useful skill to have anyway.

Love the work that you do.",How to Get and Keep a Job," It’s important to get your resume in the best shape possible before you begin your job search. You need to state all of your relevant work experience, use active verbs to explain the work you’ve done, and make your resume easy to read and understand. Most importantly, you have to make sure to proofread it several times before showing it to anyone.Keep in mind that you may need to create more than one resume in order to tailor your experience to the position. If you’re applying to both a job as a library assistant and a teacher, for example, then you may need two resumes that highlight different strengths.
Make sure your resume is easy to read and that it’s obvious where you worked, what your position was, and how long you worked there.
Some positions will ask you to list your references right on your resume. Prepare to have at least 2-3 people who can vouch for you before you begin the job hunt.
Have a friend or a professional in your field look over your resume to give suggestions for how to make it more readable.
Size 11 font has been shown to be the most appealing font to employers. You can try font 10 if you really have a lot of information to cover, but you shouldn’t go smaller than that.There is the option of paying companies to help you spruce up your resume, but this can cost a pretty penny.
Use a simple font, most preferably Times New Roman.;
, If you feel like you don’t have the needed skills to even land an interview in your field, then you may need to do a bit of skill building before you take your resume out into the world. There are a variety of ways to gain more experience before putting yourself out there if that’s what you want to do.


See if you can gain experience at an internship, even if you’re only doing it a few hours a week. Though the work won’t be paid, most likely, it’s a great way to get your foot in the door and to gain the skills you need to get an impressive resume.
There are also many opportunities to learn skills online. For example, if you’re applying for editing jobs and notice that many of them prefer a candidate who knows basic HTML, find an online class that can help you master this skill.
Talk to people in the field that you want to enter. They can help you get a sense of the skills you should possess before you start looking for a job.

, Some studies show that up to 70-80% of jobs are found through networking, not through the traditional job application process. If you want to dramatically increase your chances of getting a job, then you have to try to network with professionals in your field, as well as with people you know, as much as you can. Though this may feel like you’re cheating, think of it as giving yourself the edge you need to succeed.It makes sense that it’s much easier to get a job through networking. Employers want to hire someone who can be vouched for instead of facing a pile of anonymous resumes; it makes their job much easier.
You may not think that you know anyone who can help you get a job. However, even if your friends or family members don’t directly have a connection to anyone in your field, you should tell them that you’re starting your job hunt to see if they know someone who knows someone who can be an asset to you.
If you’ve gone to college and your school has regular networking events in the area, try attending a few to see who you can meet. Make sure you prepare your elevator pitch before you go to these events, so you can comfortably tell people who you are and what you’re looking for when they ask you to tell them a little bit about yourself.

, Once you have your resume up to date, have tried your hand at networking, and have an idea of what you’re looking for, then you can begin your job search. Check out all of the different job searching sites on the Internet and look for positions that sound perfect for you. You should pick jobs that you feel fairly qualified for, though you can go out on a limb and apply for a job that may ask for a bit more experience than you have if you feel like you can make up for it in other ways.


Remember that it’s important to apply to a job while it’s “hot,” or recently posted. The most activity around a job posting happens in the first three days, so if you find a job that sounds absolutely perfect for you, try to apply for as soon as you can instead of putting it off until the weekend.Some popular sites for looking for jobs are Indeed.com, Simplyhired.com, Monster.com, or even craigslist.com.
You can also look for job search sites that are more relevant for your field. For example, if you’re looking to get a job at a startup, then you can try sites like Ventureloop.com.

, Once you’ve found a job you want to apply to, you should take the time to write a concise, eye-catching cover letter that shows why you’re perfect for the job. If you really want to succeed, then yes, you should individualize each cover letter to the job you’re applying for. This shows employers that you take the job seriously and that you really want to be a part of their team.If you can find the name of the hiring manager or the person in charge of your application, then addressing your cover letter to this person shows that you really care.
Use engaging language. Instead of saying, “I believe I am a strong candidate for the job,” say something more exciting like, “I would love to bring my enthusiasm and experience to your team.”
Make sure to address the qualifications and qualities the company is looking for and to show how you possess them and how you would succeed in the position.
Don’t just regurgitate your resume. Give them more details about work you’ve done or interests you have that they can’t find out about through your resume alone.
Keep it short and sweet. Just two paragraphs talking about who you are and why you’d be a good fit for the company and one paragraph saying where you can be reached and that you would look forward to an interview will be just fine.
Keep your language professional and appropriate to the company. If the company is a serious business, then you shouldn’t try to use casual, jokey language; however, if you’re applying to write for an online humor journal, you can be a bit more creative in your word choice.

, Once you’ve found a few jobs to apply for, go ahead and send in your resume and cover letter and hope for the best. If you want to take initiative, you can send a follow up email to make sure the hiring manager got your materials after a week or so to show that you really care. If you’re really serious about the job search, then you should aim to apply to at least a few positions each week, as long as they sound relatively appealing.


Some companies can take months to get back to you, so it’s best to keep your options open and to cast a wide net.
As you apply to more and more positions, it will become easier, because it won’t be as hard to tailor your cover letter to each job.

, The fact of the matter is, the job search process is an arduous one, and it can take several months, or even longer, to find a job that suits you. The average person applies to over 60 jobs before finding that perfect fit, so you shouldn’t feel discouraged if you apply to 30 or 40 jobs and don’t hear a peep back; this is a reflection of the market and the fact that many jobs are posted but given to internal hires or people who get them through networking. Don’t think that this means you’ll never find a job and continue your search.


Though this will take up a lot of your time and may be draining, imagine how good you’ll feel when you finally land that perfect job after so much hard work.
Don’t let the job search affect your mental state. Many people get really discouraged by the whole process, but you can’t let it get you down. Rest assured that, if you work hard enough, you are bound to succeed.
Continue to network as you search for jobs the traditional way. You never know what you may turn up.

, If you’ve landed an interview, then the most important thing you can do in advance is to prepare as much as you can for your big day. You want to read up on the company, understand what the position truly entails, practice answering relevant interview questions for your field, and make sure you have plenty of specific examples to illustrate how you have the qualities your employers are looking for.


You’ll probably be asked about your biggest strengths. Make sure you’re prepared with specific examples of why you possess these strengths, and make sure that they are skills that your interviewers are looking for for the position.You may be asked about your weaknesses or areas of improvement. Don’t say that your biggest weakness is that you work too hard; they’ve all heard that before. Instead, you should mention a weakness that isn’t that bad and which isn’t crucial to the position, and also mention steps you’re taking to improve that weakness.You will likely be asked why you’re a good fit for the company. Make sure you understand the company’s mission and goals and talk about any relevant things about the company, such as the workplace culture, that make you a good fit for the team.
Prepare to answer behavioral questions too, such as, “What would you do if a manager was out of line?” or “How would you control a classroom with several rowdy students?”

, The worst thing you can do is to roll in to an interview late; this shows that you really don’t care about the job. Aim to get there at least half an hour early, and then walk in to the building 5-10 minutes early. This shows that you have your act together without you being so early that your interviewers are annoyed or thrown off. Use this time to get yourself in a calm and positive state instead of reviewing your answers.


Bring a copy of your resume and cover letter with you, along with any other relevant materials you may need to bring. This can help you answer your questions and can show that you’ve put thought into your interview.

, Obviously, dressing professionally and looking your best is a must when it comes to an interview. Even if the environment at the job you’re applying for is a bit more casual, you should err on the side of being overdressed than looking overly casual in a more professional setting. Wear well-fitting, neat, and appropriate clothing and make sure you’re well groomed and look put together for the interview.


Looking professional will not only show your employers that you take your job seriously, but it will also give you more confidence as you go through your interview.

, It’s important to be confident, well-spoken, and articulate as you answer your interview questions. Speak clearly and slowly enough to be understood, look your interviewers in the eye, and know that it’s okay to take a minute to form your response instead of blurting out your answers before you’re ready. Make sure to answer the questions confidently without coming off as arrogant, and be comfortable asking for clarification when it’s necessary.


When you speak, make sure to keep your posture solid and keep your hands on your lap. Avoid fidgeting or staring at the floor. This can help you sound confident.

, At the end of most interviews, employers ask if you have any questions for them. You should remember that the interview really works both ways and that it’s up to you to see if the job is a good fit for you as well. Prepare a few questions to show that you really care about the position and want to be as involved as you can. If you say that you have absolutely no questions, this can indicate that you haven’t really done your research.


You can ask things like, “How would you describe the office culture at your company?” or “Will there be opportunities to collaborate with other employees?” or “I read about the (name here) project online. I was wondering if you could tell me more about it.”
If the interviewers truly did answer all of your questions, you can say, “I was going to ask more about (mention the aspect of the job here), but you’ve already covered that.”

, There are a few no-nos when it comes to interviewing successfully. Though you should focus on the positive aspects of interviewing, you should make an effort not to do a few things that show employers that you’re not really all that serious about your job. Here are a few things you want to try to avoid when it comes to interviewing:Avoid asking about perks before you’ve gotten the job. If you’re already asking about vacation days and bonuses before you’ve been hired, it’ll show that you care more about what comes with the job than the job itself.
Don’t bring your coffee into the interview with you. This shows that you’re taking too much of a casual approach to the interview.
If they ask why you left or want to leave your current position, avoid bad-mouthing your previous employer. Even if your old or current boss is a real jerk, you should never say this. Say something like, “I’ve gained a ton of valuable experience at my current job, but I’m ready for a new challenge.”
Don’t mention that you’ve applied to 80 other jobs without getting an interview. You want your employers to feel like the position they are hiring for is your #1 choice.

, The most important way to make sure you keep your job is to have a strong relationship with your boss. You don’t need to be best friends with your boss, but you should have a friendly relationship that is based on mutual respect and strong communication. Though each boss has his or her own style, you should make sure to be friendly with your boss and receptive to what he or she has to say, and to show that you really care about him or her.


Though some bosses are much more private about their personal lives than others, if your boss is open about his interests or his family, then you can take the time to ask him about it when you’re making small talk.
If you have issues with your job, take it up with your boss respectfully. Don’t complain to your coworkers instead, or you risk having that get back to you.
When your other co-workers gossip about your boss, try to remove yourself from the situation.

, Another way to make sure you to keep your job is to show that you can play well with others. If you want to seem like an important part of your company, then you should be friendly with your co-workers, receptive to their ideas, and willing to openly collaborate and communicate with the people you work with. Even if you disagree occasionally, you should do so respectfully so that you seem like you can get along with anyone.


If you have a reputation for not being able to get along with other co-workers, then your boss will see that it’s hard to fit you into a team. However, if you’re the one making people laugh and feel good at the office, it’ll be hard to picture the office without you.
Make an effort to attend office activities after work, such as happy hours, volunteering events, or team building activities. Though you don’t have to attend every event, you should make an effort to show that you do care about your co-workers outside the office.
Steer clear of office gossip. You don’t want to get a reputation for talking about people behind their backs.

, One way to make sure you keep your job is to try to maintain a positive attitude around the office as much as you can. Talk about the things you love about your job instead of complaining about the things you don’t like and make an effort to make other people smile and to avoid whining about the small details you’re not so thrilled about. Get a reputation for always having a smile on your face and it’ll be much more likely that you’ll keep your job.


Of course, if something really upsets you at the office, you should have a respectful conversation with your boss about it. You don’t need to “fake” it if you really feel like something isn’t right.
Try to laugh or be cheerful as much as you can. You want people to feel like they are gaining energy from your presence, not being drained by you.

, If you want to keep your job, then you should make sure to be eager and excited about whatever challenges come your way. You don’t want to look like you don’t want to do anything beyond your job description. If your boss asks you to take on an extra project or to try something new, you should accept it and be excited about all of the new things you will learn.


If you continue to challenge yourself, not only will you impress your boss, but you will also make your job much more fun and rewarding.
You want to be known as the person who will be happy to take on extra work or to learn something new. You should be the first person your boss thinks of when it’s time to tackle a new project.

, Showing up to work on time, or even a little early, may not sound like a huge deal, but it’s actually an important way to show your boss and everyone in the company how much your work means to you. Make an effort to show up at least 15-20 minutes early each day so you’ll at least be there on time if you run into an unexpected delay. Plus, if you get there a little early, you can get a head start on your day.


If you do show up late, make sure to apologize and show that you know this is not acceptable. You don’t want to seem smug about it.
Make sure to be punctual to all meetings as well.

, You should make a sincere effort to be neat and organized in all of the work that you do. Make sure your computer files and all of the files of your desk are in order, that your appointment calendar is up to date, and that you have a to-do list that is easy to accomplish and easy to read. If you spend just 10 minutes a day cleaning up your workspace and organizing your files, you should be in great shape.


Being organized is another sign of somebody who really takes his or her work seriously. If your boss asks you to send him a file and it takes you an hour to find it, then this shows that you don’t really value your work.

, If you want to show that you take your job seriously, then you have to show up to the office looking professional. Though some offices are more casual than others, you have to adhere to the dress code and show that you’re really determined to make a good impression. Plus, you will feel more professional if you look more professional, and having a disheveled appearance will make it look like you really don’t want to put in the effort.


If you care for your appearance, then your boss, your clients, and your customers will take you more seriously.

, Another way to make sure you keep your job is to be creative and innovative in your position and to always look out for new ways to do things. You don’t want your boss to think that you’re set in your ways and that you’re not ready for the next challenge that your job will bring. Technology and the work many people do is rapidly changing, and you have to be ready to roll with the punches, and even ready to propose ideas for how to do your work more efficiently.


Be eager to suggest new ways of doing things to your boss, and to show him or her that you’re always thinking outside the box.

, If you want to keep your job, then you have to be able to take feedback well, and to understand that constructive feedback is meant to make you do better at your job, not to make you feel inadequate in some way. You should be respectful and thankful when your boss takes the time to give you feedback, and use it to improve what you do on a daily basis.


If you’re mean or unreceptive to feedback, then your boss will see that you’re not willing to improve at your job.
Of course, not every drop of feedback may always be helpful to you. Still, you should be kind and gracious when you receive it.

, Show that you want to go above and beyond by continuing your professional training even after you’ve landed your job. Take night classes, get a part-time Master’s degree, attend conferences, read relevant journals in your field, talk to experts, and just do whatever it is you want to do in order to stay up-to-date about the innovations in your field and to do the best work that you can.


If your boss knows that you’re continuing your professional training, then he’ll see that you’re really committed to excelling in your field and taking your job to the next level.

, Honestly, when it comes down to it, the best thing you can do to keep your job is to truly love all of the work that you do. If you feel like you’re faking it at work or pretending to be interested in most of the things you do, then it may be time to find a position that is better suited to your interests. If you find something that truly suits you, then you’ll feel like you never have to work a day in your life.


If you really love your work, then you won’t have to make an effort to be positive, to advance in your field, and to find new ways to succeed at what you do every single day.

Use social media effectively.",How to Go on Strike," One person cannot lead a successful strike. Instead, you’ll need all unionized members on board. Begin talking about why you think a strike is necessary. Remember not to talk about striking on your employer’s premises or during work hours.


Begin by talking to other workers you trust. Has someone complained about your wages, benefits, hours, or working conditions? This is someone who thinks like you and probably will help plan a strike.
Keep your discussions as secretive as possible. If management gets wind of the strike, they’ll try to divide the union membership.;
, If you’re part of a national union or other overseeing organization, you will need to contact them before you go on strike. The union can give you suggestions and help outline any requirements your strike must meet to have the union’s support., If your agreement has a “no strike” provision, then you can’t strike.Your strike is illegal and your employer can fire you. Take out your collective bargaining agreement and read it.

If you don’t understand the document, retain a labor lawyer. Contact your local or state bar association for a referral.Your national union also probably has legal counsel who can help you understand your rights.

, Even if you have the right to strike, not all strikes are lawful. For example, you can’t strike to force your company to stop doing business with another company. You also can’t strike to force your employer to do something illegal.

You can strike for economic conditions, such as higher pay, better benefits, shorter hours, and better working conditions.You can also strike to protest unfair labor practices. Examples in the U.S. include spying on the union, refusing to bargain with the union, or giving wage increases to employees to keep them from joining the union., In the U.S., federal law requires that you provide certain notices to your employer to terminate your collective bargaining agreement. You also need to wait a certain amount of time before you can strike.If you don’t wait, then the strike will be illegal unless you are protesting unfair labor conditions.This is a complicated area of law, so talk to your national union or your lawyer. You don’t want to strike at the wrong time, since your employer might be able to fire you as a result.

, Each country has its own labor laws, so you should understand what can happen to you if you choose to strike. In the U.S., the consequences will depend on whether you are striking for economic reasons or because of unfair labor practices.Economic strikers can’t be fired, but your employer can replace you. At the end of the strike, you are not entitled to be hired back. However, you are entitled to be recalled to jobs when there is an opening.
Unfair labor practice strikers are entitled to reinstatement at the end of the strike. They may also be awarded back pay.

, If you want to go ahead with the strike, you’ll need to form committees. These committees will be in contact with each other, but each will have certain well-defined tasks. Consider forming the following committees:General strike committee. This committee oversees everything and keeps detailed records.
Negotiating committee. This committee works directly with management to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement.
Picketing committee. Members of this committee raise public awareness by coordinating legal picketing.
Publicity committee. This committee works directly with the news media and other public officials to spread the word about what you are fighting for. If you have a small workplace, you might combine the picketing and publicity committees.
Financial committee. This group will help members support themselves without a paycheck.

, Without any wages, your striking employees might soon lose enthusiasm for the strike. Cushion the blow—and maintain union solidarity—by building a strike fund as soon as possible.You should set aside a portion of your dues to build up the strike fund. You might also need to request additional payment above and beyond the regular dues to build the fund.

, A strike costs money, and you need some general idea of your expenses before you pull the trigger and strike. Consider the costs of the following:food, health care, and transportation assistance to strikers
legal expenses
printing expenses
publicity, such as maintaining a website

, Some workers might have trouble buying food for their families. Help them out by contacting foodbanks. Also consider creating your own food bank. Ask other employees to contribute food to the bank, and invite strikers in need to help themselves., Without health insurance, strikers and their families might be denied the medical care they need. Contact doctors and health clinics. Ask strikers if anyone knows of a doctor who might be sympathetic to your cause and send sick strikers to them., Strikers might not be able to make their rent payments. Coordinate with a legal aid clinic to draft a template employees can use. The letter should explain the strike and ask if the landlord can give their tenants a break during the strike.If your strike fund is large enough, you can help renters by paying their rent.

, If a strike lasts longer than a couple weeks, you should pay for bus far and other transportation costs. You want the strikers to show up at the picket line., As workers talk with each other, you should come up with a list of things you want changed in your workplace. Write up a list of demands to present to your boss.One demand should be that anyone who agrees to strike won’t be penalized later.
Also ask that all employee insurance premiums and medical bills be reimbursed at the end of the strike.

, Your boss might welcome your demands but then never implement them. For this reason, you need to set a hard deadline. Give your boss a couple weeks to agree to your demands but then be prepared to strike if they aren’t met., There’s no reason to strike if you can avoid it, and your employer might be willing to meet some or all of your demands. Your negotiation committee should take the lead.


You might not be great at negotiating. A good negotiator should be patient, smart, and focused on details. They shouldn’t be easily ruffled or intimidated.
Talk to your national union, who might have negotiators who will come down and help you.
Alternately, you might need to hire your own professional negotiator. Talk to your lawyer or contact a nearby law school for help.

, You can expect management to spread false rumors to create divisions in your ranks. For example, they might lie that the negotiation committee is being completely unreasonable. Keep your strikers in the loop about what is going on by using email and bulletins to communicate.

Your union can also use social media to update employees.

, Your employer might try to force you back to work by getting an injunction.An injunction is a court order to stop doing something, in this case a strike. Typically, your employer will claim the strike is illegal.


Rely on your legal team to fight the injunction. Work closely to document that your strike is legal and peaceful.

, Depending on your situation, this could take a day, weeks, or even months. You must also know that there is a possibility that your efforts will not work.


Increase the pressure on your employer by picketing and waging a media campaign.

, Very few people can picket 12 hours a day, so you should set up several teams to picket for a certain amount of time. Name a captain for each team.This person will be responsible for making sure strikers get to the picket line on time. Your captains should be your most responsible union members.


Ideally, picket teams should be more than two or three people. Try to aim for a dozen or more, if possible.

, Picketing is a great way to increase visibility. If possible, picket on the sidewalk or at locations that are visible to the road. You should also picket at the entrance and exits to the property.However, you cannot block entrances. If you do, then your strike is illegal., Signs should be easy to read from a distance and memorable. Text-based signs with limited colors work best. Remember you are creating a message, not a work of art. Bold black lettering on a white or yellow background stands out.

Choose your materials wisely. For example, you should use foam-core board, since it is lightweight but also rigid. For a handle, use hollow cardboard tubing since many cities won’t allow sticks.

, An unruly picket line can damage your union’s cause in the public’s eye. Keep drugs and alcohol out of the picket line.Team captains should send unruly picketers home until they can get control of themselves.

Strikers cannot threaten non-striking employees, management, or management representatives., Your strike might start enthusiastically, but workers can soon become demoralized as weeks pass without work or a new paycheck. Try to keep spirits high on and off the picket line. Consider the following:

Bring in speakers.Your national union might send someone down to give a speech. You can also ask local university faculty to speak about the importance of labor strikes.
Let people take breaks to recharge. Maybe a few days off the picket line will reinvigorate them.
Come up with fun chants. These will build solidarity on the picket line.
Offer mental health services. You might be able to find a sympathetic therapist who will agree to meet with strikers to help them work through their problems.

, Sometimes, management will claim that your picketing is threatening other people or causing general violence. Often, they can get a court order blocking the strike on these flimsy grounds. Because of this, document your picket line by having at least one person videotape it., Your publicity committee should reach out to local and regional newspapers and TV stations. Distribute a press release describing the strike. With luck, you’ll increase your strike’s visibility and put pressure on your employer to give in to your demands.

Have your most articulate union members as spokespeople. They should be well-versed in what you are demanding of management.

, Some members of the public think unionized workers are fat cats who loaf around and enjoy luxury benefits. Counter this perception by emphasizing how the union members are just ordinary hard-working citizens.It might be effective for workers to talk about their families and children when explaining why they are striking. For example, you can really humanize a strike by saying something like the following: “Our health care benefits are terrible. My daughter had a heart defect, and our insurance only picked up 10% of the costs of her treatment. I work too hard for such skimpy benefits.”

, Unionized workers generally make more than nonunionized workers, and for this reason some people might not be sympathetic to your demands for more money or benefits. Nevertheless, you can counter by always pointing out how much money your employer has made.


For example, you can say, “All we’re asking for is a 4% raise, at a time when the company’s profits grew 25% last year and their stock value increased 30%.”

, Many companies receive tax credits or other assistance to open or expand a business. Always points this fact out. Taxpayers will be angry, especially if the company is trying to move their location.

For example, you can say, “We’re trying to keep this plant here, in this state. Do you know they received over $40 million from the city and state when they opened 10 years ago? And now they want to move the plant halfway across the world? It’s unbelievable.”

, You don’t want to come across as lazy or envious of your employer. Instead, emphasize that you love your job and are anxious to get back to it once your employer agrees to your reasonable demands.

For example, you might say something like the following: “I love working as a nurse. Love it. And I can’t wait to get back to my patients once the hospital wraps up these negotiations.”

, This is a type of strike where workers provide their services to the public for free. It’s most successful in service industries, where employees work directly with the public. For example, striking taxi drivers can give people rides for free. A good work strike can quickly build public support.There are definite legal risks to this type of strike, especially if you use your employer’s property. Consult with a lawyer first.

, You can get your message out most effectively when you control the medium. Create a website and keep the public updated about the state of negotiations. Include pictures and personal stories from striking employees on the website.

Create a Facebook page and create a Twitter account. Your strikers can also use these sites to stay updated on the latest information.
Make sure only one person is in charge of these accounts and approves all content posted. You don’t want any striker to post their thoughts.

Ensure that you’ll arrive on time — or better yet, early.,
Prepare the night before.,
Pack a smart lunch.,
Dress for success.,
Be ready to ask questions.",How to Get Ready for Your First Day in a New Job1," No, you don’t need to get there before the cleaning crew leaves, but set your goal to be a good fifteen minutes early. This provides some “wiggle room” for unexpected delays and, in their absence, provides an initial image of you as someone who is eager and ready to go.Avoid getting lost on the way to your first day on the job by knowing the best way to get there. Practice driving there a couple of times at the same time you will be heading to work so you can time out the drive, and also plan ahead for any potential traffic issues.Have an alternate route ready. You need to know more than one way to get to your new job in case you find yourself stuck in traffic or encountering an unexpected hangup. Search online maps before you leave the house to give you an idea of multiple ways you can try to get to your new job on your first day.
The same principles apply for public transportation. Make a few “test runs” of your commute under similar circumstances, and have a solid backup plan (the bus instead of the train, for instance) just in case.;
, Don’t leave anything to chance on the morning of your first day. Instead, lay out or pack up everything you need the night before.Lay out your clothes and pack your lunch (see the relevant steps for advice on each). Have your briefcase, bag, and/or purse ready to go as well.
Create a checklist if necessary to make sure you bring things such as: your wallet and ID; your phone charger; gum or breath mints; medication for headaches, upset stomach, or other possible medical conditions; any hygiene products you normally use, including feminine hygiene products; and a small water bottle to combat any “cotton mouth” on a stressful first day.
Being prepared the night before may also help you to rest easier, and a good night’s sleep is always helpful before your first day at a new job., Even if you are not a brown-bag kind of person, packing a simple, non-perishable, non-odoriferous lunch (no tuna!) gives you maximum options for the first day.


You want to be able to be flexible at lunch time. It is hard to know if someone will plan a lunch outing for your first day. You will be able to save your non-perishable lunch for another time, unlike with a turkey sandwich or salad. This way, too, your new coworkers won't feel bad if you need to leave your packed lunch behind.Lunch is a big deal in some workplaces, and a faint memory in others. Be ready for either situation, or something in between, until you learn the lunch ropes.
On another food-related note: before helping yourself to coffee and/or danish, find out what the policy is. Does everyone chip in a set amount each month, or is it pay-as-you-go?

, You surely put a great deal of thought into the outfit you chose for your job interview, trying to figure out which ensemble projected the proper image/message. Your first day is another type of interview, and your sartorial selection should be given equally careful consideration.


While at your job interview, or during any other pre-employment visit to the workplace, take note of the formality level and styles of clothes worn by your co-workers-to-be. Do not be afraid to ask the HR representative about any dress codes or expectations.Generally speaking, you want to err on the side of dressing slightly more formal than the prevailing level in the workplace.Going over-the-top (wearing your best three-piece suit in an office where polos are the norm) might send the impression that you’re out-of-touch or feel superior, while under-dressing can indicate that you just don’t care enough already.
Dressing for success can be a bit more complicated for women. It is an unfortunate reality that women who dress in what might be called a fashionably conservative style tend to be deemed more honest, trustworthy, and intelligent than those who choose more cutting-edge or revealing fashions (even something as simple as a shorter skirt or higher heels).As a woman, if business casual attire is suitable for your new job, be prepared to choose tailored, pressed, well-fitting (not too tight or too baggy) pants or knee-length skirts, fitted tops that conceal cleavage, modest jewelry, and simple, dull-colored, closed-toe shoes. See what other women at the office choose to wear before your first day.

, Almost invariably, the first day at a job will include some sort of orientation program, perhaps involving an HR meeting, lots of forms to fill out, tours, videos, handbooks, etc. Instead of passively trying to survive what can often be drudgery, use it as an opportunity to establish yourself as a co-worker who is eager to learn and succeed.


The night before or earlier, prepare a list of general (“Can you give me a primer on the office phone system?”) and more specific (“In my position as ‘x,’ what will my role be during staff meetings?”) questions to bring up during your orientation. While there’s no “magic number,” try not to overdo it, however.Beware of asking so many questions that you seem annoying or uninformed. Asking few or no questions, however, makes you seem disinterested.

"
"
Start before you start.,
Be eager but not overbearing.,
Listen, observe, and learn.,
Don’t make excuses.",How to Get Ready for Your First Day in a New Job2," While you want to rest up the day and night before you start your new job, make fruitful use of the remainder of any lag time you have before starting.Contact HR and complete ahead of time some of the mountain of forms that will surely be waiting for you. This will enable you to focus your first day more on getting to know your workplace and co-workers, and to jump right in to work.
Keep up-to-date on the company by following its website, social media presence, and media mentions. Be ready for any changes (good or bad) that may happen between your hiring and first day.
Ask your supervisor if there is any research, organization, or other preparatory work you can begin before your first day. This will help you get a “leg up” on your initial tasks and shows initiative.

, The first impression you make on your co-workers will be difficult to change, so provide them an image of a friendly, engaging, helpful, and dedicated compatriot.Do a little homework on the web to familiarize yourself with your co-workers ahead of time (basic info, not life histories — you want to be seen as a friend, not a stalker).Then, on your first day, introduce yourself to everyone you can, but in an organic, sensible manner. That is, don’t walk right past people without shaking hands and giving your name, but also don’t glad-hand around the room like you’re running for President while people are busy working.Accept invitations to lunch, drinks after work, or other such get-togethers if at all possible. This is part of why you want to pack a first-day lunch that you don’t have to feel bad about leaving in your desk (or worry about the smell if you do).Volunteer to help with tasks, or even take one on yourself. Earn a reputation right from the start as a helpful, eager “team player.” Don’t let it backfire by taking on tasks for which you are not yet prepared to do well, however.

, As indicated in this section, you don’t want to be a wallflower on your first day. At the same time, however, don’t spend so much time trying to force a good first impression that you miss opportunities to gather key intelligence about your new workplace and co-workers.

Watch how decision are made, and get a feeling for where the centers of power reside and how the office politics play out. Much of this may not occur in the same manner as described in your orientation packet. Get an idea about who you need to befriend and who you should be wary of if you want to succeed.
Pay attention to the office rules — phone and social media usage, breaks, dress code, etc. — presented during your orientation, but also observe the “rules.” That is, see how things are actually done on the ground. It’s best to err on the side of the official policies, especially early on, but you also want to know how things operate among your co-workers.
On a side note regarding your phone: silence it the first day, if possible. Present an image of focus and dedication., Your co-workers and supervisors probably expect some mistakes and failures as you adjust, but that doesn’t mean they want to hear you explain them away by saying “I’m new here” or “It’s my first day.” No one likes excuses, even when they are somewhat understandable, so making a “no excuses” first impression will pay dividends for you.Through preparation and focused effort, do all you can to make your initial tasks be successful tasks. The quality of your initial work can help you earn a reputation as a “go to” person who can be trusted to do exceptional work.
Do the job to the best of your abilities, and if you need guidance or help, ask for it. People expect the new guy / gal to need some assistance. It’s better to meet a new co-worker by asking “Can you give me a hand formatting this? I want to make sure I do it right.” than it is to say “Sorry I messed up that formatting. I’m new here, after all.”

Respect others.,
Do your job and do it well.,
Have dignity.,
Be discreet.,
Look good.,
Be confident.,
Make others feel good about you.,
Be a person of your word.,
Behave in a way that allows people to respect you.,
Keep your cool.,
Give proper credit.,
Do not ever bad mouth people at work.",How to Get Respect at Work," Show your coworkers that they matter. Respect the authority of your bosses and treat underlings well.;
, Don't make anyone carry your workload, be on time and offer to help coworkers when possible. If you do not understand something or cannot handle a task do not be afraid to seek help or partner up with a coworker.

, It's great to help out others but don't let yourself be the office pushover either. Don't do everyone's work for them. Tell the boss, ""I can take one for the team this time"" which lets her know that you are willing to pitch in but you are nobody's fool.

, Nobody respects a gossip. And nobody wants to have to watch what they say around you because you'll go blabbering all over the office. Respect people's confidence in you.

, Shower as often as is needed(at least daily) wear freshly laundered clothing, get them pressed if necessary. Ladies should wear a reasonable amount of makeup-nothing heavy or better suited for a night at a club(unless you work at a club). Keep jewelry tasteful and appropriate for your occupation. Hair should be neat, clean and should not get in the way of doing your job.

, Stand up straight, hold your chin up, make eye contact, use a firm handshake and SMILE!

, Greeting each person by name shows that they matter to you. Everyone wants to feel important and be heard. Make a random honest compliment to someone you work with. Do this every day to a different person.

, Keeping your word is one of the biggest things you can do to gain respect. And in doing so you make a good reputation.

, If your coworkers at the law office see your drunken pass out pics on Facebook it's probably a good bet that they will lose respect for you.

, Be unflappable. Do not let jerk bosses or rude coworkers cause you to be overly emotional or verbal. Nearly every job has one so bite your tongue, don't get involved with office drama or infighting and always take the high road. When all of the silliness has died down you will be remembered as the one with class.

, When working with others always be sure to give others their due credit. Don't hog all of the kudos, let others bask in the glory of accomplishment with you.

, You and your coworker may have a chuckles at your dorky boss but when your coworker needs that raise or gets mad at you he may repeat everything you said. Don't give anyone any fuel to make a fire.

Have a positive attitude.,
Accept your flaws.,
Review your accomplishments.",How to Feel More Confident at Work1," Try to focus on your skills and talents as much as possible. Don't dwell on what you perceive are your weaknesses. Focus on providing solutions to problems and not on the problems themselves.Choose to be happy. This is not easy, but important to find the good in any situation.Remove negativity. This means refraining from behaviors cause you unhappiness or from interactions with people who make you unhappy.Never underestimate the power of a smile.

Attend industry meet-ups. Not only will you get to know new people, you may also of a new company or a service.
Take a class online or at your local college. Familiar with C++, but not Python? Enrolling in a class is a great way to brush up or expand your skills.

, Don’t obsess about them, but making an action plan to overcome them can help you feel more empowered.For example, you may feel very comfortable in 1:1 meetings, but the idea of presenting at the annual board meeting makes you quake in your boots. Taking a public speaking course could help you to get over your fears.

, You will feel more self-assured and engaged if you use your strong suits to help you lead.Continue to refine those strengths.Do you currently work in the Accounting department and enjoy web design in your spare time?

, Never be afraid to ask to for something you want. It is important to do it in a way that is not rude or impertinent. However, it is possible you will hear a yes. If you don’t ask, you will definitely not receive what you want.For example, you may want to adjust your work hours to attend a class to expand your skills. You may choose to phrase your request as, “Would it be possible to for me to take an evening course to learn SQL? I would need to leave work at 6PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I am happy to stay later the other nights.”

, A part of growing your confidence is acting like you are confident. You do not need to be arrogant or constantly brag. However, you should believe that you are able to leverage your abilities to successfully complete new tasks.Your response to a request may sound something like, “Great! I can try to make those design changes for you. My Javascript skills are not strong, but I know I can use my PHP skills to figure out how to get the task done.”

It's best to go right to the source when it comes to knowing what you need to do to improve your job performance. Though it might be intimidating, in the end it'll be worth it. Ask him or her a few questions, like:


Where do my strengths and weaknesses lie? How might I improve my overall job performance?
What skills/competencies can I work on that make a difference to the organization from a financial perspective? From a client perspective? From a team perspective?
How can I be responsible for my learning and growth?
Does the company offer training or workshops I can attend to better my performance?;
, Assessment centers offer one of the most objective and dependable solutions to assess employees against diverse criteria. Assessment is the key to filling employee gaps by giving you a vivid picture of where your gaps lie and what best can be done to bridge the gap between your skills and competencies. It may also outline what your job exactly demands of you.


Initially great importance was attached to assessment centers during selection and recruitment processes. However, their potential is now being seen in bridging employee gaps and even in designing effective training and development programs.

, Assessment centers usually employ exercises such as psychometric tests, business games, group discussions, role play, presentations, structured interviews, fact finding exercises and paper based tests. These can be very useful in pinpointing your gap. Talk to your boss or coworkers about what assessment test may be the most helpful to you and your organization.


An assessment center specializes in administering meticulously designed tests and simulation exercises to groups of participants (employees). The performances are then observed, evaluated and apprised by specially trained assessors.
These tests help the employees get a better understanding of themselves as in where they stand, what their strengths are in terms of fulfilling job roles and tasks, their shortcomings, and even what could be done to improve on their shortcomings.

, With these, employees can be shown the effects (positive or negative) which their skills, personality, competencies, behaviors, and functioning have on the business, project, or organization. This way the management/managers are able to see where the employee believes they need improving and, what's more, the employees will be able to identify their own gaps and work on bridging them.


Ideally, all employees then get an opportunity to initiate their own learning be it asking the organization for certain training programs or workshops and then taking charge of their own learning and growth. Bosses should also look at their own feedback to pinpoint what they need to offer their employees to make this feasible.

, Once the scorecards are filled out, your boss should give you feedback. Otherwise the scorecards serve no purpose! Your boss should encourage you to develop your own objectives while simultaneously making sure they're aligned with the team's/department's/group's/organization's objectives.


Feedback should also address the measures to take in order to achieve the objectives and by when – a time frame is a must. These objectives and measures can and should be revisited from time to time to check their efficacy, too.

, This is an alternative to the traditional appraisal system. With this way, information is collected about you, the employee, from all areas – self-assessment, peers, superiors, and subordinates. This provides a combined opinion which is definitely more accurate, objective and reliable.


This can let you know your employee gap on all levels and to what extent the gaps are present. Ideally, it'll also inform you what should be done to fill the gaps, what training programs would be required (and are available), what mentoring options you have, and what workshops would be useful.
The feedback is substantiated by multiple responses, leading to more openness and transparency. Sometimes, when the feedback is anonymous, others are likely to be more honest.

, This is often referred to as the ""competency based performance management system."" Using this approach, skills and traits with levels of proficiency expected are assigned to every job. Based on this, you know exactly what to shoot for.


You, the employee, can then absorb the precise skills required to keep you competent enough to take charge of your tasks, responsibilities, learning and growth. Not only this, it encourages you to aim for the highest level of competence in the most efficient and effective manner. When you know what is expected of you, you can rise to the top.

, Mentors play a vital role in developing employees, aiding in their learning and growth. They can give you advice on establishing objectives, the strategies to be adopted to achieve the objectives, and keep your morale up, too. What's more, a mentor likely has access to resources and a vast network of people who can help as well.


A mentoring relationship should focus on building and developing skills, competencies and personality. The personality aspect involves helping the mentee review his strengths and shortcomings, appropriate behavior and actions to be implemented, and work on improving communication skills, problem solving skills, and teamwork habits.
Having a mentor could help you move in alignment with the expectations of the organization. This can to a great extent serve the purpose of reducing gaps between where you stand and what is expected of you &dash; both in the short and long term.

, There is a growing need for employees to keep pace with the changing trends and technologies at the workplace. They need to keep their skills updated at all times – it's not just you! Because of this, a lot of workplaces offer training. One of the best ways to keep pace and eliminate or minimize employee gap is through the training program at your work. If your work offers one, take advantage of it!


Not all training programs suit every employee. The training program should be one offered by your work, chosen carefully by your boss. It may be a waste of time and resources (money, facilities, trainers) if the training program is not applicable to the employee or the field, offered by some third-party organization who doesn't have your goals in mind.

, Your willingness, competence, and if you are able to tap into your potential are all key factors in the success of any training program. If you are ready, willing, and able, you could be trained in such a way that could make you multi-skilled and ready to take on diverse roles and responsibilities desired of you. However, if you don't take the training to heart, it's likely you'll end up right back at square one.


Through training, the gap and shortcomings that have been hindering you from fulfilling your objectives may fade away. This allows you to explore your work world to your full potential. Again, only if you take advantage of it!

, Training enhances adaptability of the employees by preparing them for any changes in the workplace or in technology. With this training, you may become readily able to accommodate the team, the organization as a whole, and even yourself.


Training enables employees to perform better, often resulting in work being more tolerable. This can impact their motivation and job satisfaction because they feel ""not left out"" or ""not left behind.""
You may also feel taken care of by your organization because they've provided you with a platform to keep yourself updated, prepared for the future, and made valuable. Training is a concrete attempt to retain you and make you a part of the team. When you feel this, you may feel more connected to your work, improving your morale.

, A workshop is something different than a formal training program, seminar or meeting. It can be used in tandem with training and development programs. It's usually more informal and an ideal platform to introduce the employees to ways to reduce the employee gap. Sometimes, the employees are asked to determine ways they think would help them. In other words, it's more hands-on than training usually is.


Workshops are great for soft skills, too, which are just as important. They can even help with relations between clients, customers, peers, and managers. On the other hand, they can also address oral and written communication skills, negotiation skills, and correspondence issues. If your aim is to improve your soft skills, workshops are the way to go.
In workshops, the employees get a chance to take ownership of their learning, skills, growth in the organization and acceptance in the organization. Afterward, you emerge feeling like you have a hold on the company's ideas and are part of their vision.

, Often workshops are used to introduce technologies and trends that the organization would like to adopt. Once you know what technology is to be incorporated, learn it! This can greatly lessen the gap by keeping you up with where the company sees itself going.


If you don't know how to learn the technology, odds are you have a wealth of options you haven't even thought about. Would your coworkers be able to help? Could you take a class? What about the Internet? A mentor? If your company doesn't offer training, seek out ways to solve the problem yourself.

, Once you've completed the training program, attended workshops and seminars, taken classes, and, what's more important, you feel more competent, ask for feedback. How have you improved? Do you now meet all expectations? Has the gap been filled?


It may be helpful if you get feedback now in the same form you received it prior to your training. This way you can juxtapose the two against each other, comparing your progress. You'll be able to see on paper just how much you've bettered yourself and your career.

, If you visited an assessment center and took a test, take it again! This is a concrete way to see what improvements you made and in what areas. It may also shed light on what areas still need a nudge in the right direction. But be sure to retake the same test; retaking a different one won't be as easy to compare.

, Workshops, seminars, and training are great platforms for employees’ opinions to be gathered. This time should be used for the employees to feel more visible – so take advantage of it! How did training help you? What could make it better? Should any part be more widely implemented?


This is an opportunity to come up with solutions for problems, voice your concerns, give recommendations, and ask any questions you've been dying to ask. Not only will this be a time for you to give feedback to your company, but this time the tables will turn – the company can use your feedback to better themselves as employers.

, Odds are with all this talk about feedback and your job performance, your boss knows you're up to something. Have a one-on-one with him or her and address all the efforts you've made and how you can see yourself implementing what you've learned in the future. Now that you've gone to all this work, do they have any other ideas that might make your work even better?


Use this time to not only talk about the training (and how it might be made even more effective) but to also talk about this problem can be avoided in the future. Whatever worked best for you, could it be implemented regularly? Could other employees be served well by this same tactic? How might this affect the company overall?

, The work world is always changing and improving. Even if you meet expectations now, things may change in the future. This goes for every employee! To stay on top of your game, keep on training. Attend seminars and workshops even if you don't have to. Keep an eye on technology. Stay in contact with your mentor. With these tactics, it doesn't have to be a recurring issue.


With any luck, your experiences will show your employer what training is effective. Talk to your boss about implementing a new program if you previously had to take matters into your own hands.
Don't shy away from new skills, either. Just because your job doesn't require it doesn't mean it wouldn't make the job easier. If you find an opportunity to learn something that may improve your performance, take it! You'll be impressed with yourself and your boss will likely be, too.

Am I ready to go back to work?
If I am, how much do I need to make? And if I'm on some form of social benefits, will that be affected? Namely, if I earn money will it affect me and my benefits such as in the USA Social Security Disability /SSDI and/or Supplemental Security Income/SSI , Medicaid or Medicare or housing benefits? And if you think it may, set up appropriate appointments with those offices, such as social security in your town and/or social services or Independent Living Centers which are nationwide in the USA, although not in every town. These can advise you how your earnings will affect your social service and social security money and health insurances.;
, It's helpful to ask any MD/doctors you may work with for their advisement as to any physical or mental health concerns, such as: How many hours can I work a week? What type of jobs do you think might be good for me or not? This conversation can include your psychologist, psychiatrist, and/or licensed social worker to see how their professional opinions impact your process of designing your return to work path. Key in on what jobs they recommend that are low stress. Be aware that any stress will likely worsen medical concerns, even chronic ones, but with planning, the other questions will be: How can your medical team help you succeed and cope with this new change you are proposing: going back to or going to work!

, Listen to the answers from family that loves you and friends that have your best interest in mind. They may have some ideas about places to work and how to go about jump-starting your back  to work career path. They may even have some connections to get you an interview.

, Many people spend hours online, especially when health forces you to remain at home. While you are online, you can do something that matters for others. Maybe you eat in a certain way or Sharing your experience and knowledge to help others is a good thing. Begin showing community spirit with your positive self. Helping others may help you in unexpected ways to be more proactive and interactive with the world community. And who knows––that happy, gentle new job may come from this type of powerful connecting activity.


If you ever have anything embarrassing online that you or some old friend put up and you can't or don't know how to fix it, keep trying and keep forgiving yourself. Raise your positive vibes by posting things that make a positive difference, that can help the world.

, Work out or go for walks or wheel your chair or meditate with movement. As your doctor allows and as your friends support you, getting up and moving around more is helpful, so that you can be more work ready. Even sedentary jobs require some movement and any increase in fitness may help. Also bring a water bottle with you. Drinking quality, filtered water increases your health (unless your doctor says less water––always check on that).

, Do this in gentle, affordable ways. For example, go to the library and take out upbeat or motivational talks or funny talks. You might like listen to comedy a lot when getting your ego ready for asking people to hire you, like Jerry Seinfeld, John Pinette, Carol Burnett and Kevin Hart. What makes you smile? What can help you feel good? Maybe do affirmations as well. There are a lot of affirmations on YouTube that may help. Again, if you are sensitive with your mental health, doing this type of self support may need some support from your counselors or your friends, or both, to be sure you are on a good path. Or, doing some lighthearted viewing or reading in a way that suits you.

, Resume oh resume, where art though dear resume? Do you have one? If not, write one if you can't get help. It doesn't have to be perfect. There are articles to help you prepare a resume but the issue is: What are your strengths and qualifications? In particular, how to cover your work gap is a big deal, so it is important to do volunteer work as a way of showing you have stayed engaged and can work. It is dreadful to do work for no money, yet even once a week for two hours shelving books at the library, being a mental health peer, being a writing tutor, babysitting, making meals for your grandma, and so forth, are all ways that you can factor in to explain how you spent your time while recovering. Moreover, volunteering is a way of getting your work network going. For example, who knows and has seen you do some form of work, whether it's filing or stirring soup.


A quick resume tip about gaps: Highlight your qualification section. Write a brag resume that brags about your volunteer work too.
It may be that you have other steps, such as meeting with a jobs counselor at your local One Stop Employment Center to have access to free technical classes (to help you prepare the resume, etc.) and his or her advice, so as to be able to produce a good document. Be sure to make use of all that is offered, so that when you apply, you have what's needed.

, Most American cities have One Stop Employment centers that can be very helpful. Do an online search for your city and/or county and that term and you will find the address. These people offer free help for work and that way, if you don't want or have enough personal network to help you, you can connect to some workers whose job it is to help others find work.

, if you have your other steps in play, it's time to start applying, even part time, as long as you feel ready and your medical and/or mental health staff are there for you to trust and transition to working. It doesn't mean you can't go about this stuff on your own, just that the help of others matters so that you can be brave. Try making applications for jobs you like or think you are qualified to do. Don't forget to use the libraries as a fabulous source for help to manage this very technical aspect.

, Trust and love yourself. Looking for work needs a lot of ego boosting. The fact that you had some time off to gain or regain your physical and/or mental health has an impact on your confidence. In some instances, that's a badge of honor, to be able to say: ""I'm better now, I'm ready now."" Pat yourself on the back and take steps, baby steps, each day.


When you are cleared to work, on average try to apply to five places a week at a minimum.
If you are not volunteering, try to do this as soon as you can; volunteer at least two to five hours a week doing something you love, or think you will like and be able to do.

, Are you sleeping enough and eating reasonably? Do you have access to good or decent food and water, medicines if you take them, a secure place to live and a network of friends and/or professionals? Be sure you are okay and feel okay––you don't have to feel fabulous or perfect, love yourself totally every minute, or be proud of all you do. Trust your ability to succeed in this. There will be times when you wish you did things differently but you'll still find aspects that make the outcome tolerable. Your ability to cope with rejection will build, and you'll learn the courage to apply knowing that they may say no but continue to keep applying even if you don't get an interview, volunteering even if you haven't been doing anything for a while so that you can see what it feels like to be out there again.


Consider what is it like to even think: ""Hey, I can go back to work... or can I?"" Search deep inside yourself, boost your ego and spend time with the people who support you, with your pets, eating good food, getting sufficient sleep, enhancing your resume and putting together a job interview wardrobe. In doing these things, you help yourself, stay prepared and keep your attitude positive about the future. In all honesty, the amount of time you haven't been working is less important than your attitude in continuing to keep trying.

, Once you are approved medically, have your mental health supports behind you, some friends to support you, a place to live, a way to get about by bus or car or foot, and help to understand how work affects your benefits, get the applications in and keep up the volunteering. Stay physically active and do a little more each week, staying in a rhythm that feels right for you and keeps you actively involved in working your way back to working.

Rearrange your life accordingly. Keep the things that you need to do—working, grocery shopping, and so on—in your schedule, along with anything you love doing even if it does not have an immediate tangible benefit. Assign less time to the things that are neither necessary nor desirable.;
, Figure out how much time you spend on various activities throughout your day and throughout your work. This includes everything you do: sleeping, eating, working, watching television, and so on. Calculate a daily or weekly average for each activity.


Once you figure out how much time you spend on each activity, you can map out your time more effectively so that you have room in your life for both work and play.

, If your life is crazy busy, you might find it easy to postpone any downtime until later. Gradually, you'll keep postponing it until you reach a breaking point. Rather than reaching that point, plan on taking a few hours of downtime by specifically scheduling them in advance.


It's even more beneficial if you can plan a certain event for your downtime. Schedule a date night with your spouse, a day out with your closest friends, or weekend trip to the park with your family. By scheduling a specific activity, you will have something to actively look forward to. Planning something specific also makes you less likely to back out at the last minute., Everyone needs time to “veg out” on occasion, but if that's all you ever do when you have a chance to relax, you might end up feeling unfulfilled. Wasteful activities that offer no benefit and do not bring you any enjoyment should be reduced as much as possible.


Common pitfalls include time spent on social media and surfing the Internet. These activities only take up a few minutes of your time, but when done frequently throughout your day, those minutes can add up quicker than you might expect.

, Most errands are unavoidable, but if you have the resources, consider outsourcing errands you hate to other people who might be happier to do them. For instance, consider paying a kid in your neighborhood to mow your lawn or shovel your sidewalk instead of doing it yourself.


Similarly, you could trade errands or services. If you enjoy cooking, for instance, you can offer to prepare and freeze a week's worth of meals for a neighbor who hates to cook but loves to garden. In exchange, your garden-loving neighbor can tend to your garden over the weekend.

, You might think that squeezing exercise into an already packed schedule would be impossible, but a few minutes of exercise each day or each week can go a long way. Physical activity reduces the buildup of stress in your body, leaving you feeling more balanced and energized.


Try to get 30 minutes of exercise in two to four times a week. Any sort of cardiovascular exercise can work, even if it's just a walk or bicycle ride through the park.

, If your paid job is not especially satisfying, look for a volunteer project or hobby that you can involve yourself with that might provide you with the sort of satisfaction you're missing from your job.

, Keep your expectations reasonable, particularly when you first start planning out your work-life balance. Giving yourself a long to-do list of supposedly enjoyable activities can actually backfire and make you feel more stressed as you rush around to get those tasks done. Start small and work your way up as needed.


If you have a really hard time fitting relaxation time into your schedule, commit to as little as 15 minutes a day. You might not be able to do anything exciting during that time, but in those 15 minutes, you can indulge in something quick and enjoyable to reinvigorate yourself.

, If your current job makes you unhappy, ask yourself why that is. A problem with the work itself will be difficult to remedy without a career change, but a problem with the conditions of your job is usually a bit easier to solve.

, Talk to your boss about altering your responsibilities and tasks. Ask if the work you do can be tailored more toward your passions and skills, and discuss ways to ultimately improve your productivity.


If you feel overworked or overwhelmed, your boss might be able to rearrange your responsibilities in a way that will allow you to produce higher quality work in a more comfortable environment. Similarly, if you feel unchallenged at work, most bosses will be happy to assign you more challenging tasks., If you can no longer stand to do the work required of you within the department you currently work in, find out if there is another department within the company that you can work in, instead. In doing so, you can essentially get a completely different job without dramatically jeopardizing your job security.


Research the prospect before you bring it to your boss's attention. Find out if there are any other areas of the company you are qualified to work in, and pay close attention to departments and teams in need of new help that you could offer.

, Some of the biggest problems people face on the job are related to co-workers. There are some people you will always have to work with, but discuss the matter with your boss and ask to spend more time working away from those people and more time working with people you can stand.


Working with new co-workers can be a good idea from time to time even if you get along with the ones you currently work with. Doing so can make you view your work from a different perspective.
When you do find people you can work with remarkably well, collaborate with them as often as possible.

, Workplace friendships can be risky, but they can also be very rewarding. Keep an eye out for a co-worker you can get along with and talk to easily. Build your friendship with that individual and serve as confidants with him or her. Someone who works within your company is more likely to understand the woes and challenges you deal with on the job.


Workplace friendships should be about much more than complaining, though. Take an interest in your co-worker on a personal level. Ask about his or her plans for the weekend. Offer to pick up an extra cup of coffee for him or her on your way into the office. Meaningful interactions are more fulfilling for both parties than empty ones.

, If you don't like the hours you work because of the people you work with during those hours, or if you would prefer a different set of hours so that your current time slot can be freed up for an outside activity, ask your boss if it would be possible to change your shift.


If you are unable to change your shift completely, talk to your boss about altering your schedule slightly to relieve some stress. For instance, if you need a few extra minutes in the morning to drop your kids off at school, ask your boss if you can come into work 30 minutes later in exchange for working 30 minutes later into the evening.

, If you sit at a desk and stare at the same bare, white office walls every day, it's easy to feel trapped in your surroundings. Personalizing your space with a few pictures or meaningful mementos can make the environment more aesthetically pleasing and more comfortable to work in.


Think of ways to make yourself physically more comfortable, as well. Bring a cushion for your chair or keep a sweater handy if your office gets chilly.

, Use any downtime you have at work to clear away old emails, documents, and folders from your computer and your desk. Clutter can make you feel claustrophobic and overwhelmed. Reducing the amount of clutter in your work life can help you feel calmer.

, Even if you can take on three or four tasks at once and manage to get them done, don't do it. Research suggests that the mind is at its peak performance when it focuses completely on a single objective. Doing too much at the same time can make you feel worn down and unhappy., Your current job does not have to be the job you have for the rest of your life. If you really think that a career change is in order, plan for one while you're still safe and secure in the job you have now.

, When you make a mistake, don't stop at simply pointing out the mistake to yourself. You should also tell yourself what you should have done instead. Doing so allows you to learn from your mistakes and allows you to feel as though you are gradually making progress in your life.For instance, instead of telling yourself, ""If only I hadn't messed up when cooking dinner,"" tell yourself, ""If only I had paid more attention to the time instead of getting distracted by the Internet when the roast was in the oven.""

, You are your own person with your own set of circumstances. That being the case, there is no reason to compare your accomplishments with the accomplishments of others. Don't put yourself down because of others, and don't look down on others because of your own successes, either.

, Instead of saying “I can't,” tell yourself, “I won't.” The difference might be subtle, but it's important. Telling yourself that you cannot do something takes away the element of choice and makes you feel powerless. Telling yourself that you will not do something empowers you by turning that action into a conscious decision.


For example, don't say, ""I can't go to the movies on Friday."" Instead, tell yourself, ""I won't go because I have a greater priority to attend to,"" or, ""I don't want to go because there is something else in my life that is more important right now.""

, Spend more time with people who support you and less time with people who continually drag you down. Along with benefiting from their goodwill toward you, you should also extend goodwill back to them., Your loved ones might be a big part of your life, but that doesn't mean that every spare minute you have should be devoted to them. When planning out your free time, make sure that you schedule some time to be alone with your thoughts, doing what you want to do.

, The quickest way to find your passion is to search everywhere for it. Aside from that, as the saying goes, “variety is the spice of life.” Trying new things can make your life seem more exciting.


Study a new subject, visit a foreign location, or take up a new hobby. Take little steps outside of your routine and outside of your comfort zone from time to time. You do not need to embark on a completely different life path, but be open to the possibility that new passions and interests may arise that could lead your life in a different direction.

, There's no harm in buying things you really want, but “stuff” will not make you feel emotionally fulfilled. Enrich your life with experiences—whether those experiences are novel or familiar—and collect memories instead of knickknacks.

, You have strengths and you have weaknesses, just like anyone else. Only in learning to love and accept your entire person can you come to enjoy life.

Is my work routine with little change or little possibility for change?
Am I using my skills and education to the fullest? Am I challenged?
Do I feel fulfilled in my position and are my superiors interested in promoting my career goals?
Am I treated fairly and are my thoughts and contributions valued? Do I feel like an important part of the team? Am I compensated adequately?
Do I support the company values?;
, Review your answers to the above questions. Make a list of what you can and cannot change and take action from there to the best of your ability.Identify alternatives to your current position.Consider the advantages and disadvantages to leaving your current position.You don’t want to jump from bad situation to another.Consider what your career goals are and see if your current company can meet them.
For example, if its your specific job you don’t like, but you like the company and your colleagues, there may be opportunities within the company that are better suited to you., If it is just your position you don’t like, have an honest talk with your boss. If the company is truly invested in you, she can help you formulate a plan to get you into a more fulfilling position either within the company or in some other company.No matter what, keep your comments positive. For example, say “I’ve really loved my time here, but I would like to explore other challenges within the company.”Discuss your strengths and weaknesses with your both, and the ways in which you think you could contribute to the company further.Don’t get upset if your boss isn’t receptive. This could be a good sign that it’s time to move on to greener pastures., In the event that you want to change your company and job altogether, don’t announce it. This can backfire and undermine your ability to find another position that you will love.Be careful when telling colleagues about your decision to look for another position. People often have loose lips and this can hinder your efforts to get out of your job. It may also leave your current company to fire you or withhold a positive reference.You can discuss your situation with a trusted colleague or mentor. They may be able to advise you on the best strategy to finding a new job or they may have leads on new positions.Only use your personal computer to research new jobs. Many companies monitor internet use and this could set up red flags for your employer about your commitment.

From talking to friends and family to internet research and even contacting companies about job opportunities, you can find a wealth of potentially challenging and engaging positions for yourself.Word of mouth is a powerful tool when looking for new jobs.

, No matter how you feel about your current position, continue to do your job to the best of your ability while you’re looking for a new job. In addition, maintain respect and cordiality with your superiors and colleagues.This can help minimize the risk of you burning bridges, especially if you may need good references.Even if you are courting a new company or job, keep doing the best job that you can. People often talk and you wouldn’t want the new company to get cold feet or hear negative information about you., Gather data about the company and any other relevant information you can use to demonstrate your interest.

Employing this extra bit of information further shows your desire to work with company.Research the company for the name of the human relations director or the person in charge of hiring. This makes you appear engaged and polite and also shows your interest in the company.Keep an updated copy of resume on hand. You can use information from your professional experiences in your letter or you may want to attach it to your email., Take the information you collected to compose a preliminary draft letter. This ensures that you set the right tone and don’t forget to include any important information.


Refrain from placing the recipient’s email address into the “to” field. This can help prevent accidentally sending before you are ready.
Emails of interest should be between three and five paragraphs in length. Letters that are longer run the risk of not being read in their entirety, which means the potential employer could miss vital information about you.Your draft and letter should strike a professional, yet personable, tone.Write a brief introduction that includes your name, the job in which you’re interested or the types of positions that interest you. You may also want to include what prompted you to establish contact as well as that you feel you could make a positive contribution to the company and its mission.
As an example, you could write “My name is Catherine Smith and I am interested in working at Strategic Marketing. I have heard very positive reviews of your company from friends and colleagues, and am I writing to inquire about opportunities in your advertising department. I think my qualifications and experience can make a positive contribution to the company’s mission.”
The main body of the letter should range 1-3 paragraphs. They should discuss your qualifications and experiences, any specific skills, and other relevant achievements. You can also discuss the ways in which you feel that you could benefit the potential employer. You’ll also want to point the addressee to any attached documents such as a resume.Close your text by thanking the company or person for considering your possible employment. Also provide a time at which you will contact the addressee to follow up, as well as how the company or HR director can contact you.For example, “Thank you for considering my potential employment at Strategic Marketing I will contact you to follow up on my letter on Monday, January 5 at 3:00 to talk about potential opportunities. Please contact me at any time by email or phone. My phone number is (888) 888-8888.”, As you draft and revise your letter, make yourself as attractive to a company as you can. This helps potential employers get a better sense of what you have to offer. It also helps present a more positive and professional image of yourself.Use verbs including cooperate, collaborate, and promote.Use nouns including asset, responsibility, and team-player.Adjectives including intelligent, diligent, and reliable are attractive to potential employers.Combine these words together in phrases. For example, “I collaborated on a large international advertising project and was a significant asset in my company gaining several new multi-million dollar clients. Taking part in a vibrant team was integral to developing my company’s current successful advertising campaign with a Fortune 500 company. This work helped raise our company profile and increase our annual profits.”, Sell yourself in the best way you can while remaining honest about your qualifications. There is a fine line between honesty and exaggeration. Avoiding statements that can appear overblown or are false can help potential employers see you as genuine.Avoiding saying that you are the best unless they actually are. As an alternative, write something along the lines of “My current employers told me that I am one of the most responsible and collegial co-workers with whom they’ve had the pleasure of working.” When assessing your technical skills and abilities, write something that is quantitative. For example, “I am among the top 1% of advertising executives based on sales.”

, After you have composed your preliminary letter, revise it to strengthen the text and expand any areas that need more development. You can also copy edit the email for any spelling, punctuation or grammatical errors at this time.


Check to make sure that your revised letter has an introduction, body, and closing. They should be honest as well as incorporate positive vocabulary and present the most positive picture of yourself possible.You might want to read the letter out loud as you proofread it. This makes it possible to hear mistakes and also makes sure it sounds professional.Tailor the information in each letter to specific companies or jobs., After you’ve revised your draft, compose a proper greeting and closing for your letter. This can make you appear professional and attract potential employers.Greet the person with “Dear Ms. Smith”. Follow this statement with a comma.If you cannot locate a person in HR, use the more formal “To Whom It May concern”. Follow this statement with a colon.If your contact has a gender neutral name and you can’t figure out if the person is a man or women, be cautious and use the person’s full name. For example, it’s better to say “Dear Pat Smith,” than writing “Dear Ms. Smith” to a Patrick Smith.
Your closing can read “sincerely” followed by a comma. If you want to make it a bit more jazzy, write “I look forward to hearing from you” followed by sincerely.Include your name and contact information underneath the closing.

, If your letter mentions additional documents that you will provide, add relevant files. This may help the employer get a better sense of you and your qualifications.


Update and revise your resume before you send it to a potential employer.

, In order to email your potential employer’s HR director, add the email address in the “to” field. This helps ensure the mail is directed to the proper person or office.Consider blind coping yourself to confirm that the email successfully sent., Read your text one final time before sending it to the potential employer. This minimizes the risk of mistakes or omitted information.

Consider doing something for charity.,
Consider writing a book to be published.,
Consider a part time teaching role in the area of your profession.,
Consider setting up a small online business.,
Write a blog or write for a website.,
Update your CV/resume regularly.",How to Enhance Your Career," There is the old saying 'Who you know matters' this counts for so much because through social involvement and professional networks you recognise a wide arrange of opportunities that are available to you. It becomes easier to see methods in which you can progress financially and meritoriously. As well as being very informed about job positions that are available and having access to information about companies and what is going on within them. Try to make contacts with everyone in the company you are working for from the person in the mail room to the CEO.;
, This follows on from networking. Any time someone asks for a favour, do not dismiss it lightly. Often, professional interactions work on a ""You scratch my back and I will scratch yours"" basis and so doing favours for others professionally often sets yourself up for the future when you need a favour done.

, It is often much easier to convince people to do things if there is mutual benefit there. It opens the doors for working on things together and is usually very profitable financially. Having an eye for mutual benefit then is of its own nature beneficial.

, Charity looks great on the resume but is also enjoyable to do. You meet interesting people, have a good time and do some good in the world in the process.

, A book is a great way to add a little to a career and requires a only a little regular work to complete. If you are a professional consider writing a book about your profession or something that you enjoy. If you are good at something, consider writing a 'how to' book on that area of expertise.

, Teaching people is often very rewarding because you are helping to enlighten people and looks great on the CV because it is a demonstration that you know what you are talking about. It also shows that you're willing to give back what you've benefited from through your life.

, The aim of this is not necessarily to make it to the Fortune 500 company list but rather just to add a little extra income though you never know - it might be incredibly successful.

, This is often a great way to share what you know or provide some interesting articles for people. It often comes with certain benefits, as it can create a fan following. This can be used both for networking and crowdsourcing. If what you do is particularly successful, you can make a little money from renting out advertising space.

, This provides you with a current and useful tool so that you are immediately ready for any positions that come up.

Isolate the key differences in positions.,
Assess the new workload and hours.,
Think about your dynamic with your colleagues.,
Ask about flexible scheduling.,
Inquire about additional health care and retirement benefits.,
Seek out more vacation days.,
Ask about external training.,
See if a raise is in the foreseeable future.,
Discuss the potential promotion directly.,
Make a pro/con list.,
Talk to friends and family.",How to Evaluate a Promotion with No Pay Raise," Ask your employer for a clear breakdown of what the new job would entail on a day-to-day basis. Either take detailed notes as they tell you, or request this information by email and save it. Go through the description and isolate all the aspects that are different from your current job.For example, being promoted from an administrative assistant position to an executive assistant position will mean basic office tasks, plus the responsibility of handing an executive’s calls, emails, schedule, and correspondence.;
, Look at the job description of the position your employer wants to promote you to and try to gauge how much work that will leave you with on an everyday basis. For instance, if your employer wishes to promote you to the position of department manager, assess the increase in your workload based on new responsibilities like training new employees, organizing work schedules, and finalizing projects. Ask if overtime will be expected, and how often it will be expected.This might be a significant consideration if you have young children or other personal responsibilities.

, Rapport with fellow employees is important in maintaining feelings of engagement at work, which leads to better motivation and morale. Consider how you new promotion will affect your dynamic with your colleagues, in turn affecting your day to day environment. Suddenly being put in charge of managing your co-workers' projects, for instance, might be an unsettling experience that isn't worth attempting without a raise (e.g. becoming a department supervisor and overseeing your colleagues' performance reviews.), If a promotion does not provide you with a raise, it might allow you to be more flexible with your schedule. Ask if the new position will grant you more flexibility in terms of things like work hours, and working from home. Ask yourself if the improvement in work/life balance is as valuable to you as a pay raise might be.Lead with something like, ""Will this new position allow me the opportunity to work from home periodically, or work more flexible hours?""

, In lieu of a pay raise, improved employee benefits might be a worthwhile incentive to consider. Inquire with your employer if increased benefits are a possibility with the new position being offered. For instance, a new, management-level position might come with a handsome premium reimbursement plan for health care., If your employer won't offer you a raise with your promotion, they might be willing to negotiate some extra vacation days as an alternative incentive. In the U.S., there is typically a median of 10 days per year for sick and vacation days for full-time employees. Ask your employer if your prospective promotion warrants extra days off., If your promotion does not include a pay raise, examine its potential to further your job skills and career. Ask your employer if they will fund relevant external training (e.g. technical courses) for your new position. Many businesses have separate budgets for training than they do for raises, so this request may be granted as an incentive for your new position., The lack of an immediate raise should not stop you from looking into how the job will pay off down the line. Ask your employer how your performance in this new position will be compensated over time (e.g. after employee reviews) and if improvement will be rewarded. Be direct, and say something like, “I understand that this promotion will not come with a pay raise, but can you tell me how my growth and improved performance in this new position will be rewarded over the next year or two?”Request that your employer provide you with an outline of this information in writing, or ask the question via email to have a record of the conversation.

, To get the bottom line on what a new, unpaid promotion will mean for your career, have a forthright discussion with your employer. Be direct and polite, and ask them what will be in it for you if you accept a promotion with no pay raise. Mention your career goals and initiate a discussion on how the new position could be optimized to suit your aspirations.For instance, say, “I’m hoping that you can tell me how this promotion might benefit my career and work life at this company. In the absence of a pay raise, these are considerations that I feel are very important.”

, Pro/con lists are a straightforward way of analyzing situations and possible outcomes to make well thought-out decisions. Since some pros are better, and cons are worse, than others, make a weighted pro/con list. Assign positive or negative numbers to each consideration on the list., For help making a big career decision, ask friends and family for advice. Getting advice from trusted people will offer new perspectives, and allow them to weigh in on a choice that might affect them (e.g. how much time they will get to spend with you if your new position involves longer hours). Bring up the potential promotion at a time when you can talk freely and in-depth, like during a family supper.

A chronological resume highlights career experience. If you have been working as an advertising professional for a long period of time, then this is your best choice. Make sure to include the employer, the location, websites, duration of employment and a list of accomplishments for each job.
A functional resume highlights skills that have been acquired through a number of educational and professional experiences.

Sometimes respect is a combination of the two.However, when it comes to the workplace, it may be easier to control how competent you seem than how well liked you are. Demonstrate your knowledge and abilities at work in order to encourage respect among your peers., Respect is often afforded to those who work to further the interests of the group--in this case, your company.Demonstrate that you are responsible and productive and that you care about how your business if performing.

, Agree to accomplish your assigned tasks, and complete them on schedule.Some keys to scheduling your time wisely include:


Sticking to a routine.Avoiding perfectionism during routine tasks--if it takes you 30 minutes to write a brief, low-stakes email, you should reevaluate your priorities.Resist the urge to multitask. Instead, keep your attention focused on one thing at a time; you will get more done in the long run.Exercise in the mornings. Spending 20-30 minutes exercising in the morning can help keep you focused and energized for a full day of work.Write important things down. It can be difficult to remember everything we are told, and it can take valuable time and mental energy to recall important information. Write down important tasks, information, and details in order to save yourself time and energy., While you should accomplish your assigned tasks, it is possible that you will be given too many items to accomplish them all productively. Rather than refusing to accomplish your tasks, be proactive with your boss and colleagues about how to prioritize your work.For example, when your supervisor assigns you a new task when you are already overscheduled, you should say, ""I would love to help you with that. I am currently scheduled to accomplish tasks A, B, C, and D. Do you have any recommendations about what I might place on the back-burner?""

They will appreciate being considered as an expert and might help you learn new, valuable abilities.

, Make sure that you take the time to be impeccably prepared for any important meetings or presentations. Know the proper terminology, do your research, and practice public speaking. If you are presenting slides during a meeting, practice going through the slides to make sure that the technology is working correctly and that there are not any typos., Do not undermine yourself. If you respect yourself, others will be more likely to respect you.Ways that you can model confidence and self-respect include:


Speaking clearly, without mumbling.
Having good, upright posture.
Sharing your opinions and expertise during meetings.
Standing up for yourself (though in a polite, professional way).
Resisting ""uptalk"" (where declarative sentences are pronounced like they are questions).

Listening actively to their ideas.
Complimenting them when they do a good job.
Asking them for their input.
Behaving politely.
Showing interest in their lives.

, While shy, introverted people are often not initially respected by their peers, over time respect will grow. Indeed, introverts are often respected more than extroverts given enough time.If you are introverted or nervous, be patient and focus on your work. Let your colleagues' respect for you build over time.

, Employees respond more positively to supervisors who are humble and behave respectfully themselves.Those who insist on being deferred to might receive more external signs of respect but will not actually be respected by their employees.Always be humble, and never push colleagues and employees to behave in a deferential manner.

, Morality is one of the key attributes of respect.If you consistently demonstrate that you are an honest, empathetic, upstanding person, you are more likely to be respected at work. Do not try to take advantage of your colleagues or the company: that will hurt your reputation in the long term.

, Don't be a doormat. Respect means that everyone must listen to one another and hear each other out. However, it does not mean that everyone has to agree on a course of action. You should state your knowledgeable opinion and allow others to express theirs. Don't worry about agreeing with everybody, and don't worry about having everyone agree with you., People are more likely to respect members of their own in-group as opposed to members of an out-group. This kind of exclusion can take place because of differences in gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, language group, or socioeconomic status.If you are not feeling respected at work despite your competence and kindness, it is possible that your colleagues' internal biases are to blame.


If workplace disrespect due to bias is taking place, you might consider contacting your Human Resources representative or ombudsman. It is important that you be treated fairly and with respect.

Cultivate a professional appearance.,
Maintain your privacy.,
Be professional in group work activities.,
Keep your workspace neat and organized.",How to Earn Respect at Work3," People respond well to colleagues who appear healthy and professional.In order to command respect, be sure that you are putting forward an image that is professional and put-together. This includes:


Wearing clean, wrinkle-free professional attire.
Having hair that is free of split-ends and tangles.
Having a professional haircut.
Paying attention to personal hygiene.
Wearing appropriate accessories.

, Respect often hinges on your social reputation.Be sure that you maintain appropriate boundaries between your work life and your home life to ensure that your reputation is protected. Resist the urge to overshare everything about your personal life or what takes place outside of work.


For example, you might not want to discuss how much you drank over the weekend at work.

, Work outings can be excellent ways to bond with coworkers. However, sometimes they can involve alcohol or other substances. Eat and drink in moderation during work outings and try to maintain your professionalism. You can loosen up a little bit, but you never want to cross important boundaries.Do not drink to excess; do not touch your coworkers inappropriately; do not engage in gossip or bullying; etc.

, Have a desk and an office that are clean, organized, and professional. Most workplaces permit some personal details at your desk or cubicle, but be sure that these do not clutter your workspace. You also want to make sure that your personal items are appropriate for the workplace: do not keep anything at work that might be interpreted as lewd, crude, insulting, or unprofessional."

Consider placing a summary at the top of your resume.,
Format your resume according to modern conventions.,
Choose an experience-based resume format.",How to Write a Resume for a Non Profit Agency2," This 3 to 4 sentence paragraph is your elevator pitch, your chance to summarize your experience, passion and success. A well written summary can distinguish your resume, if there is heavy competition for the job.


An example of an executive summary would be, ""Results-driven non-profit communications manager with 9 years of experience writing press releases, planning conferences and leading summer educational programs. Passionate about helping low-income families to bridge educational gaps caused by lack of financial support. Expertise in improving team performance, obtaining funding and improving press coverage. Proven leader who can develop volunteer bases and foster enduring community support.""

, Choose a common font, such as Times New Roman or Sans Serif, and don't use a size under 11-point font. Try to fit your resume on 1 page, or 2 if you cannot condense your experience and education into a 1-page resume.

, You can choose either a functional resume, that provides experience based on skills, or a chronological resume, that shows a chronological list of all your non-profit jobs.


Choose a functional resume if you have worked in and out of the non-profit sector. You may also choose this format if the job description asks for a lot of diverse skills, such as grant-writing, donor development, management, communications, public speaking and more. Separate the resume into sections for each skill and list specific experience and accomplishments you have gained, followed by the job titled and agency name.
Choose a chronological format if you have many years of experience in the non-profit sector. With an impressive list of your past jobs, you can detail the skills you have gained underneath each job title. Include the agency and dates of each job.
If you have just graduated from college and you want to break into the non-profit sector, you may want to choose a functional format. Non-profits often value both formal and non-formal experience, so include volunteering, event planning and any skills gained with an organization under the skill sections. With both formats you can list your education in a short section at the end.

Use action verbs.,
Add important keywords.,
Include a volunteer section.,
Place an education component on the bottom of your resume.,
Attach a list of references from non-profit agencies.,
Proofread your resume very closely.",How to Write a Resume for a Non Profit Agency3," Many job seekers focus on skills and ignore their achievements. If possible, quantify the funding, increase in membership, donor involvement, community impact and more.


Revise your chronological or functional descriptions to include any time you were singled out for your success, given a promotion or even given more responsibility.

, Make sure each bulleted skill or accomplishment leads with an action verb, so revise each section of your resume to include the verbs with the most meaning. Action verbs qualify your experience in a positive, results-oriented way.


Consider using these verbs, if they apply to your experience: initiated, created, developed, organized, coordinated, inspired, established, planned, standardized, collaborated, negotiated, raised, volunteered, evaluated, optimized, solved, tested, built, invented, decreased, enhanced, increased and maximized.

, Return to your organization and job description research. Insert stressed or frequently used words into your resume in appropriate places, such as descriptions of your skills, experience, education or accomplishments.

, Many non-profits rely heavily on volunteer workers, so they value this experience more than other sectors. Include any board or committee positions, responsibilities and programs you may have started.


If you are just graduating from college, and you don't have much volunteer experience, then you should apply for volunteer positions or internships. This is a wonderful way to gain the necessary skills to be a standout applicant for a non-profit job. When you volunteer, ask to take on more responsibility.

, The more experience you have, the shorter this section can be. Highlight your majors, GPA and any volunteer or organizational accomplishments you gained.

, Include people who are able to attest to your value to an organization. Choose non-profit leaders over for-profit leaders, although managers from any company should be able to provide this kind of analysis.

, After you have settled on a good draft, also ask professional friends and family members to inspect the resume and suggest changes. Keep your final draft in both electronic format, rich text, word or portable document format (PDF), and paper copies.

, An executive summary is a four to six sentence statement at the top of your resume. It summarizes your relevant experience and the skills that you can bring to the job. Avoid generic phrases like “detail oriented.” Instead be specific: “Experience with recording transactions and managing the accounts of over a hundred subscribing customers.”


It used to be customary to begin with a two sentence “objective statement” that explained your career goals. This is no longer advisable, unless you have no workplace experience in the field in which you are seeking employment. Even then, you should consider whether you can write an executive summary that highlights general, transferable skills, like management experience and interpersonal skills. , The section labeled education should list the institutions you attended, the degrees you received, your GPA, and any awards you won.


It is not typically necessary to include high school education, unless you are just beginning your career or it was the only degree you received.If your college GPA is not as high as you would like, you can include with it your major specific GPA or junior and senior year GPA. If these are much higher, it will indicate either that you improved considerably over time or that your general GPA does not adequately convey how adept you are at your specific career.

, Here you should list relevant jobs that you have held along with internships or other unpaid work. You do not need to include every job you have ever performed. Focus on the most relevant experience.


Include the name of your employer, when you worked for them and the location of the job.After providing this information about the job, describe your experience in bullet points. When doing so, focus on particular accomplishments that demonstrate your ability to meet the qualifications of the job you are applying for.
Use active verbs that convey specific tasks you performed. Words like “Wrote, organized, managed, supervised, and designed” are better than others like “obtained,” “achieved,” or “accomplished” that don’t indicate what skills you employed to reach your goals., This can include a combination of “hard” skills like specific quantitative techniques and computer programming abilities and “soft” skills, which typically refer to your ability to deal with people. Include explanations that demonstrate that you have been able to exercise these skills in the past.

, Although it might be tempting to decrease the font size or page margins to fit more onto your resume, you should avoid the temptation. Never reduce the margins below .5 inches and stick to the standard 1 inch margins, if possible. Try to use size 11 font, but it is better to reduce the font size than the margins., Because banking is a detail oriented occupation, analysts will quickly recognize formatting or typing errors and judge you harshly for them. After completing your resume, you should take a day or two before returning to edit it with fresh eyes. Print it out and find a trusted third party to review it and look for errors., Much of the job of a bank teller consists in interacting with customers in a way that makes them comfortable. You will also need to sell services, like loans and mortgages. For the latter, you will need to be able to recognize which customers might require specific services and interact with them so as to encourage them to secure their business.To accomplish this you should focus on describing service sector jobs that required extensive customer interaction, sales jobs, or leadership roles in clubs and organizations.

, One of the principal jobs of a teller is to count money. You will need to demonstrate your capacity to perform basic mathematical processes. Also you should make it clear that you are attentive enough not to make small errors of calculation.


Tellers are only expected to have a high school degree. However, you should highlight any academic awards that are suggestive of mathematical ability. If any of your prior jobs required the counting of money or other mathematical skills, describe these in detail.Telling your employer that you pay attention to detail will probably not be enough to convince them that it is true. Instead, list instances in which you followed stringent workplace rules precisely, proofread text, managed large databases, or in any other way reviewed the work of a coworker to verify accuracy.

, As a teller you will need to make extensive use of a computer to record transactions. Your employer should teach you how to use these programs, but it is important to prove that you have been able to master other programs in the past. To demonstrate computer literacy, list any formal credentials you might have earned for specific software programs. Discuss any programs that you have had to use for other jobs, even if they might not seem particularly relevant, including word processors and database programs. Be precise: name the specific programs you used and how you used them., To break into investment banking you will usually need to demonstrate advanced abilities in some sort of quantitative field of study. There are, however, some exceptions. If you have a strong background in public policy or law, then an investment bank might find you a useful asset for establishing compliance with government regulation.


It is preferable that you have a degree in one of the following fields: accounting, banking, business administration, business law, computer science, economics, finance, human resources, information technology, or tax law.
Alternatively, you might be able to capitalize on past experience in public policy or international relations., Investment bankers spend most of their time and energy working. You will need to demonstrate that you have been able to submit yourself to such a rigorous work schedule in the past.


Academics are one of the most important ways to demonstrate commitment. Most recruits will have at least a 3.5 GPA from a top tier university. Emphasize major academic achievements and awards. Having held a leadership role in a campus finance society can also be an important selling point., Your prospective employer will want to know not only that you have experience in the sector, but also that you have accomplished something. Be specific and list precise numbers as frequently as possible.


Investment banking is detail oriented and mathematical. Giving exact figures will demonstrate that you are both of those things and prove that you have produced results. How many accounts did you manage and what was the volume of the exchanges you made? What sort of revenue did you produce? , Don’t be too creative. You should demonstrate that you pay attention to detail and can follow routine format. Keep your resume to a manageable length with precise and succinct writing.


Your resume should be no more than two pages long. To keep it short and attract the reader’s eye, use bullet points to highlight relevant experience.Use white paper and conventional fonts.Be particularly attentive to errors. Two typos will likely you eliminate your application."

, Sending out a general marketing resume is like planning a marketing campaign without considering your audience.


You should research the industries and clients that the marketing agency or business works with. You will need to tailor both your resume and your portfolio to the ideal client.
You should try to determine who will be looking at your resume. If it's a hiring manager, then you are probably seeking work at a larger company where professionalism, leadership and experience are important. If you are addressing it to a small business manager or owner, then you should try to show how versatile you are and use layman's terms as well as marketing terms.

, Write down your qualifications and the benefits the company would receive by hiring you. Most resumes focus on skills, but your resume should contain a value proposition that is unique to you.

, Instead of cutting and pasting, try to think of each marketing resume anew, according to the audience, qualifications needed and your value to the specific job. The following are good guidelines:


Format your resume in a way that will show your value. If the company's communications are stylized, try designing an original format. If the company is very traditional, use traditional formatting, like Times New Roman 12-point font.
Use a structure that communicates your value proposition. Most professionals with experience will want to use a chronological structure; however, functional resumes, that list experience by skill, may respond better to other types of resumes with strict qualifications. If you have any gaps in your work history, choose a functional format.
Consider a guerrilla resume. In the same vein as an infographic, more and more people are using new formats to stand apart from their competition. Creative marketing professionals, such as website designers, graphic designers and copy writers, may appeal to innovative companies by creating a website resume, placing your resume on a product that the company works or another concept completely unrelated to traditional resumes. Do an Internet search for ""guerrilla resumes"" to see what people have tried. Remember that there is extra risk in trying something unusual when applying for a job.

, It is important to reference as many important concepts you have noted in your research. Revise your prose so that it showcases relevant industry and client experience, as well as general skills.

, Many people focus on qualifications and skills rather than accomplishments. Make sure that you are proving your value as well as stating it.


Filling your resume with skills instead of accomplishments is like presenting features instead of benefits when marketing a product.
You may need to do some research on how your marketing has led to sales. If possible, do some reports to get the examples that will impress a hiring manager. If possible state a percentage increase in sales, the number of new clients added and the specific rise in profits.

, Each word should be selected for its meaning and power.


Consider using the following verbs in your marketing resume: authored, directed, doubled, enhanced, generated, initiated, maximized, engineered, orchestrated, structured, spearheaded, analyzed, boosted, evaluated, illustrated, produced, surpassed, planned, strengthened and launched.

, The resume should entice a company to ask for your portfolio and an interview, so it should be succinct. Make sure you are focused on 1 message, how well you are suited to the job.

, This is the most important marketing material you will create, because it has the potential to change your life. Ask another marketing professional to critique it in order to make it stronger.

Do a final edit.",How to Write a Medical Resume," Keep the medical resume up to date with current phone numbers, email and fax information, if applicable, as well as your full name and other important identifiers.;
, Many applicants for medical jobs showcase their relevant degrees, certifications and other formal educational bona fides high up toward the top of the first page of a medical resume.

, Objectives are part of many types of resumes. For the medical field, they should showcase exactly what you want to do within a very diversified work environment. For example, surgeons and other kinds of doctors will often include objectives related to skilled inpatient or outpatient procedures, along with good patient communication. Other professionals will highlight objectives related to reaching out to the public in a healthcare setting.

, Not all medical jobs are the same, and in fact, many of them fall into several distinct categories. Use these to your advantage when crafting a particular medical resume for your job applications.


Outline relevant clinical skills. Having skills in a surgical area, skills related to various components of general surgery, or even routine care skills, such as phlebotomy (drawing blood), can make a job applicant more qualified. When this kind of information is on your medical resume, you may be one step ahead of the game.
Identify coding or billing skills. If you work in medical environments handling complex insurance statements and billing documents, it can be extremely helpful to have some billing or coding skills mentioned in your resume.
Show customer service skills. If you have prior proof of your skill in reaching out to patients, this can make your medical resume more appealing and attractive to potential employers.

, In addition to all of the education, skills and experience that you have accumulated, you may want to mention any relevant extracurricular activities that will make you appear more well-rounded on your medical resume.

, It's a good idea to limit the length of your medical resume. This gives readers a better chance of going all the way through it and getting a full picture of the qualities that you bring to a job position.

, In the final edit of a medical resume, you can look for anything from typos to style issues, as well as a final scan to make sure that you have identified all of your strengths.

You can also search for templates online or quickly compare resumes of acquaintances or strangers working in your field of interest to see what they look like and what information they have included. Focus on what you like about their layout and formatting style.


Keep in mind that the aim is not to plagiarize their words but imitate their style if you think it's effective.;
, This should be as simple as possible. Make sure important information is highlighted appropriately and avoid squeezing too much text in a single page. Recruiters often have little time and sift through resumes very quickly: yours shouldn't be longer than two pages.


Your name should be the most visible item in the first page.
Start and end dates for each previous position or degree should also be clearly visible.
Use elements such as lines or boxes to separate different sections sparingly: they can take up space that can be better used by including useful information.

, Stick with professional-looking fonts like Arial, Georgia, Calibri, Garamond, etc. You can use bold type, block letters or a different color to highlight important information. However, avoid using too many colors as this will make your resume harder to read.


For example, in your ""Employment"" section the job title can be in block letters while the duties can be formatted as regular text. In your ""Education"" section, the name of your degree can be in bold while the name of the university can be formatted as regular text.

, Avoid using full sentences and try to be as schematic as possible.For example, you can summarize the sentence ""For this job, I was required to assist and help customers"" by simply writing ""Duties: customer care"".
Avoid repeating yourself and rephrasing competences or skills you have already listed.

, This should include your address, e-mail and phone contact. There is no need to title this section: simply list the information under your name.


You should not include personal information such as age, birth date, sex, ethnicity or a photograph of you unless your employers have specifically requested it. In many countries it is against the law to discriminate applicants based on this kind of information, which should usually be irrelevant for the purpose of the job. , This is where you should address the specific position and how your knowledge and skills make you suitable for the role. The section shouldn't take more than three or four lines. If you are just writing a general resume, leave it blank and write it later based on each job's requirements.


Avoid generic statements and adjectives such as ""hard-working"" or ""committed"". Instead, you should draw attention to what makes you unique.
Keep the focus on your future career goals rather than your personal qualities, and list clearly and concisely what you want to achieve and why this particular job can help you achieve it. , This section can also be titled ""Employment"" or simply ""Experience"". All your previous jobs should be listed in reverse chronological order with start and end dates. After the job title and employer, write a short list of your duties, responsibilities and achievements for each position.


Be sure to include strong action words and key terms to emphasize your leadership and team roles, such as ""organized"", ""developed"", ""supervised"", etc.Make sure you highlight your accomplishments. The goal is to show that, whatever you did in the past, your presence made a difference. If you have a lot of experience, you can organize it under subheadings such as ""relevant"", ""additional"", ""volunteer"", etc. If you are currently employed, write ""-Present"" instead of the end date and specify how much notice you are required to give to quit the job.

, List all the degrees that you have attained in reverse chronological order, starting from the most recent. Make sure you list the title of your degree, the awarding institution and the start and end date. If you haven't yet completed your degree, specify it in the date section by writing ""-Present"" instead of the end year.


You can include other information such as your GPA, dissertation title and supervisors if it's relevant for the job.

, This should be organized by subheadings such as ""Computer skills"" and ""Foreign languages"". In the case of computer skills, draw attention to those that are more relevant to the job. In the ""Foreign languages"" section, specify your proficiency by using words such as ""advanced"", ""intermediate"", ""basic"", or the Common European Framework of References for Languages (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) You can also list interpersonal skills such as communication or leadership if you haven't highlighted them elsewhere, but these should be supported by evidence. Therefore, you might want to showcase them in your ""Experience"" section by linking them to a particular position when you list duties and achievements.

, This is where you should showcase any scholarships or grants you might have received, competitions you have won or whether you're a member of a society whose focus matches that of the position you are applying for.

, Since you’ve recently graduated, you might already have a CV highlighting your academic experience. This is a very good starting point. However, a resume is what most non-academic employers in the private sector will ask you to send as an applicant. It is considerably shorter than a CV (two pages at the most), designed to highlight your work experience and transferable skills, and job-specific. This means that you will have to tailor it to the specific job requirements depending on the requirements.

, Also in this case, you can ask a friend to let you take a look at their resume or simply search templates online. Pay attention to what information is included and what is missing that is instead present in your CV.


Annotating your CV with a pen or marker can help you through the process. You can circle the sections and information that are also present in the resumes (such as ""Work experience"") and cross out those that are missing (like ""Publications"" or dissertation titles).
Make sure you have a look at several resumes: the more you see the clearer you'll be about how they should be structured. It will make it easier for you to develop specific ideas about what you want your resume to look like.

, This can take a little stretch of the imagination at first, but think through keywords that employers might be looking for. Be flexible and creative: reimagine college experiences such as group projects, societies and study groups as little work experiences that helped you develop specific skills. Examples of questions you should ask yourself: Have your ever worked in a team with other college students to work on a specific project? Have you ever been asked to lead or coordinate a group? Have you worked with data or large amount of information?, Some might be clearly linked to a previous job, while some others might be linked to your education (for example, college group projects). If you list interpersonal and adaptive skills under the ""Skills"" section, make sure you link them to a specific experience to provide evidence of how you developed such skill (for example, Communication skills: delivered papers at five graduate conferences, part-time receptionist at the Student Helpdesk).
If some skills don’t fit in any of these sections but still think they could greatly increase your chances of employment, the ""Objective"" section is probably the best place where to mention them.

, Keep in mind that the usual order is: Name, Contact Information, Objective, Work Experience, Education, Skills, Awards/Honors/Affiliations.

, Be strategic: rethink your skills through the job or type of jobs you are applying for and turn them into a positive asset.Phrase your skills as action words (""developed"", ""managed"", ""collected"") and always link them to specific experiences. However, keep the focus on the job and how your skills can best help you achieve your future goals.


Keep in mind this section should be only a few lines long. Be as concise as possible. Omit those skills that are irrelevant to the purpose of the job.

, This is by far the most drastic step: be as objective and detached as possible in identifying which parts of your CV are irrelevant for the job. Remove information such as publications, conferences or referees.


Some information in your “Education” can perhaps be omitted if unrelated to the job, such as supervisors' names or dissertation titles.
It can be worth retaining your Publications if you are seeking a job in the publishing sector.
If you have taken out all you think you could and the resume is still over the two-page limit, go through it again and choose what else you can let go. Delete repetitions, turn longer sentences into shorter words or edit the layout and formatting (but make sure the final result doesn't look cramped)., Look for typos and spelling mistakes. You can also ask a friend or professor to review it for you.

, Omit irrelevant information or expand on those experiences that are pertinent to the job.Make sure you rewrite your ""Objective"" for each new job to tailor it to the person specifications. Rephrase some passages to include keywords that recruiters might be looking for. When you think about your previous academic experience, focus on how your skills and knowledge can be useful for a particular job. Think of whether any projects or experiences you were involved in can highlight your leadership, teamwork, accuracy or communication skills. If you don't have extensive information about the job, do some background search to find out what kind of person they might be looking for and which duties it entails., If you are required to print it out, use good-quality white paper.

Figure out which format you want to write in - chronological, functional, or chrono-functional.,
Start with your heading that includes your name, full address, one main contact number, and e-mail.,
Write an objective statement or summary which tells the employer your goals, skill, and what you want in the job.,
List your education, which should include the name of your school, type of degree, major, concentration and minor(if any), and graduation date.,
Create your ""Experience"" section.,
You have an option to add more sections like Additional Experience, Community Involvement, Additional Skills, Awards & Honors or Coursework & Credentials.

,
Do NOT list ""References Available Upon Request.""",How to Write a Quality Resume,"


A chronological resume is listed by dates and is recommended for those looking for a job in a similar field as their previous work.
A functional resume does not have dates and is all explained in paragraph format. Instead listing by date, you describe your best skills. This is good for those changing career fields, going back to the workforce from a long break, or for students.
A chrono-functional resume is a combination of both of the above. Almost anyone can use this format if you want to add more detail to your jobs. This form is actually becoming more common.;
, An address is important because managers need to know how far you will commute.

, Display your most attractive qualities so employers can notice right away.

, GPA is not needed.


If you are a student or recent college graduate, display your education after the objective or summary on your resume.
If you have had several years of work experience and attended school far back, place this section at the very bottom of your resume because your experience and summary should be your main highlights.

, Start with your most recent position, and list 3-4 jobs total. No more than that! The duties that you list should reflect your summary of qualifications and describe your clear capabilities. Therefore, it must look organized and easy to read.

,, This is the 21st century. It is assumed that you should already have a separate reference page when you meet employers. Do not place them on your resume.

Proofread the letter.",How to Write a Job Interest Letter," A letter of interest is one of the many tools available for a job seeker. You can think of a letter of interest as a slightly more personal version of a cover letter when used in the job-seeking process. A letter of interest will accompany your resume and other requested documentation, but it also gives you the opportunity to spell out what makes you a great fit for a particular position or within a particular company.A letter of interest provides a portrait of you, which is backed up by the facts in your resume.


A company can either request a letter of interest from you, or you may send a letter of interest (sometimes also called a letter of inquiry) to a company you’re interested in but which hasn’t yet publicly advertised a particular position.Whereas you typically give a very brief explanation in a cover letter, a letter of interest gives you a bit more space to sell yourself to the prospective employer.;
, There are situations that call for a letter of interest and others that do not. If, for example, a job posting requests a resume and cover letter, then sending a longer letter of interest might immediately disqualify you in the eyes of the person choosing candidates to interview. Letters of interest are less common than cover letters, so don’t assume a company wants one when you’re applying to a job posting unless otherwise specified.A letter of interest is often more appropriate when making yourself known to a company that hasn’t posted a specific opening to which you’d like to apply. This allows you to express interest in the company or organization even if you’re uncertain about their current openings., Part of the purpose of a letter of interest is to explain what makes you such a good fit for the company. This requires a knowledge of the company’s background, products, services, and culture.This not only helps you form a more authentic connection between your experience and the job you’re seeking, but it also immediately makes your application stand out from those who had submitted generic or formulaic letters of interest.

, Basic greetings such as “To Whom It May Concern” can come across as lazy—or worse, rude. Do a little research about the company to determine whose desk your letter will land on, and address it directly to the person.This will immediately make your letter of interest less generic, and it displays an attention to detail that all employers want.

, Categorize your education and work experience, and start thinking about how you can apply it to the company or organization to which you wish to apply.


Make a list of the skills you possess as related to the potential job opening as well.

, Whether the company has requested a letter of interest with your resume or you’re sending a more exploratory inquiry letter, you should use the introductory paragraph to explain why you’re writing.This includes explaining who you are and what has sparked your interest in the company.Refer to any recent media coverage, interviews, company press releases, or other information that shows you’ve done your homework regarding the company and what they do.Highlight the position or types of positions you are interested in within the first few sentences. If a particular position is available, include the department or division of the company and indicate the source from which you learned about the position.
Try to avoid starting the first sentence of the first paragraph with “I.”The majority of the letters the person who reads them receives will start this way, so avoid it to immediately set yourself apart.
For example, “Your company’s CEO (use his or her name here as well) expressed some truly innovative ideas during a recent TED Talk. I’d love to be a part of what the company is working on, and I’ve written to inquire about any openings on the Production team.”

, Now that you’ve established your interest in the company, use the second paragraph to connect your skill set to the prospective employer.Use this space to highlight a few specific examples of what will truly make you an asset to the company.Address specific criteria or requirements listed in the job advertisement or description. Match your skills and qualifications to the job's required qualifications.
Do not simply repeat the information that the employer will find in your resume.Instead, take the opportunity to expand and contextualize select pieces of that information that communicate your potential value to the organization.
For example, “During my two years with Company X, I worked as a Senior Producer, coordinating multiple teams of programmers and artists to help deliver content to clients on time. My teams never missed a milestone, and I think these are the organizational skills that can help your company’s next project succeed.”

, The point of the letter of interest is to set you apart, which you can’t do while using cliche language.The second paragraph is where you will most likely find yourself tempted to use self-marketing cliches, so be especially mindful of them as you compose this paragraph.


Do not, for instance, write that you “think outside the box.” This isn’t only a cliche, but it also lacks concrete detail. Instead, write about a specific instance where you updated a process in a novel way that saved a previous company time and/or money. This concretely illustrates the idea without resorting to a cliche.

, Once you’ve explained what makes you the perfect candidate for the company, concisely conclude your letter with contact information and an explanation of any additional documents you’ve included, if applicable.Ensure that you provide both your telephone number and email address to give the recipient a way to reach out to you.


You may also choose to specify a time when you will contact the person’s office as a follow-up to your letter of interest.For instance, “You will find both my resume and a breakdown of projects I produced for Company X attached. I would love the opportunity to discuss my qualifications with you further. You can reach me at…”

, Show gratitude for the recipient's time and consideration as you finish the letter.Establishing yourself as respectful and professional can help you in the future, even if there are no positions available with the company presently.

, While longer than a cover letter, you should still keep a letter of interest to a page or less.Always remember that the person reading the letter likely has a busy schedule, and concision shows that you both respect the recipient’s time and know how to get to the point.


If you’ve gone over a page, review the first two paragraphs closely to find spots where you can pare down the language.

, Go over your letter before sending it while keeping in mind that simple is always a better approach. Take this opportunity to remove passive verbs in favor of clearer, active ones, and remove any language that comes across as too flowery or exaggerated.This is also the time to use a fine-tooth comb on the letter to find any typos, misspellings, run-on sentences (comma splices especially), sentence fragments, or anything else that could immediately send your resume to the “pass” pile."

Brainstorm a list of your dance accomplishments.,
Tailor your dance resume to the dance position.,
Format the resume.",How to Write a Dance Resume,"


Reflect on your dance training. Write down the names of the dance masters who trained you and the prestigious schools and dance studios in which you learned various styles of dance. Include any degrees in dance, theater arts or other performing arts.
List your performance experience. During the brainstorming phase, you'll write an extensive list of all of your performances. These may include dance studio recitals, community performances, college dance shows, taped performances and all professional shows.
Consider any honors and union memberships. If you were the dance captain of your high school cheerleading team or are a member of a dance union, write down these distinctions.

, For example, if you are applying to a job as a hip hop dancer, concentrate on your hip hop experience and avoid focusing on your many years of ballet training. You can create different versions of your dance resume depending on the dance position.

, Dance resumes are typically a single page and are formatted differently from the standard professional resume.


Include personal information at the top. In addition to your name and contact information, a dance resume typically includes your height, weight, eye color and hair color. Some dance employers are limited by the size of dance costumes or have artistic reasons for requiring specific physical features.
Present performance experience in columns. For example, you would use the column header, ""Show"" under which you would indicate the name of the show. To the right of that you would indicate your ""Role"" which may be ""Soloist"" or ""Chorus."" You might also include an additional column to the right that lists the ""Location"" of the performance, which would be impressive if you have toured extensively.
List your dance education and training. Include the year, school name, dance teacher's name, style of dance, and if you have obtained any degrees or certificates of completion.
Write a ""Special Skills"" section. Tailor this section to the particular job. For example, you may be applying to a theater piece that is looking for dancers who have experience in stage fighting or martial arts. Or you may be a strong acrobat and the production can benefit from this. If you don't know much about the production, include all of your dance-related special skills.
Include a photo on your dance resume. Placing a small photo at the top right of your resume is an effective method for helping dance employers to remember you when they sit down after an audition to make decisions. Make sure that the photo is relevant to the production. For example, you don't want a tap dance photo for a ballet job.

After writing all the details on paper, you can select the most relevant ones to include in your resume.,

For this resume, you may want to use the chronological resume format.,
It is important to place the details accurately in your resume.

Introduce yourself.,
State your ambitions and the career path you would like to follow.,
List your skills, knowledge and experience.,
Maintain a balance between selling yourself as an individual and yourself as part of a team.,
Demonstrate your leadership and team member capabilities.,
If possible, demonstrate your ability to make decisions and be able to think ahead.,
Don’t be ordinary, be exceptional.",How to Write a Dynamic Resume," Make sure that your name and contact details are highly visible. Give a brief description of the sort of person you are, what you do and what your philosophy is regarding the work that you do. Something that works well can be as simple as “I have worked in the restaurant trade for the past 10 years, progressing from waiter to manager, and I am passionate about service excellence”.;
, (Employers are rarely looking for someone who is stuck in a rut without drive or ambition) However, be careful not to overstate your case and make it look as if you want your boss’s job before you’ve even started.

, Don’t restrict yourself here. You need to think outside the box of past and present work experience. Include anything that may be relevant to the work you want to do. Think about the types of attributes and aptitudes the employer may be looking for. Being the coach for the under 10’s baseball team at the local school gives you skills in coaching, mentoring and working with a team!

, Believe it or not, your resume is not all about you. Don’t start every sentence with ‘I’. The projects and the work that you have been involved in are important too. You may be able to import better or more efficient ways of doing things into a new company, so make sure that your methodology and experience are highlighted. Rather than “I worked on a number of sales projects” say “ Two sales projects, which successfully raised local sales by ten and fifteen per cent respectively, increased my knowledge of both telesales and internet marketing techniques”. Your prospective employer will want to see that you have just as big an interest in the company as in your paycheck. Make a point of having a paragraph that details what specifically you are offering the company. (Many times I have asked that question of interviewees and a blank response usually consigns the resume to the trash can).

, Sometimes a leader needs to be able to lead from behind and sometimes a follower is required to stand up and be counted. Find examples of being able to take responsibility as well as showing your aptitude for delegation and team work.

, Employees who are able to handle the day to day tasks are easy to find. Finding that special person who is able to be counted upon during problematic times is like finding a diamond on the beach.

, It’s the little things that count. Make sure that your resume is clean, tidy and well set out. Good grammar and spelling are more important than clip art or Photoshop. Proofread at least twice. Finally, to make your resume really stand out prepare a one page summary headed ‘In Brief’ which details: Name and contact details, Personal Details (work philosophy and history), Career Path (relevant highlights) and ‘What I bring to my work’. This last is a brief summary of your attributes, skills and capabilities shown in bullet format. Trim and tailor this page, making sure that you include the key words that will keep your prospective employer’s attention focused on where you want it – your job. Most employers don’t have time to go through long resumes and having a single page summary of the most relevant details keeps your good points right under his/her nose. This page can be ‘tweaked’ according to the job that you are applying for and even if you work through an agency that sends out standard formats, taking this page with you when you go for an interview is sure to get you noticed and make you stand out from the crowd.

"
Decide that a chronological resume is right for you.,
Familiarize yourself with the company to which you are applying.,
Familiarize yourself with the details of the job ad.,

List your professional memberships and awards.,
Highlight special skills.,
Ensure the resume is one page to two pages in length.,
Type the resume in a standard font.,
Edit, edit, and edit again.,
Design the resume to look sophisticated and appropriate for your industry.",How to Write a Chronological Resume," There are several alternate resume formats, including a functional resume or a targeted resume. Only use a chronological resume if:


you have a solid work history that has improved over time on a clear trajectory (example: first barista, then shift supervisor, then store manager). As its name suggests, this format will emphasize the timeline of your work history, with your most recent job listed first and thus emphasized. If your most recent job is not your best or most relevant job, this is not the format for you.
you also have ideal experience for the job to which you are applying, and no major gaps between employment.If you're still uncertain what type to use, consider asking other professionals in the field to which you are applying what type of resume they used (preferably people who have successfully navigated the job market in the past few years, since norms for these types of things change rapidly). You can also ask people who have served on hiring committees, staff at your college's Career Services office, or professors or teachers who have prepared you in your field.

, Depending on how many positions you are applying to, you can spend more or less time on this task. In general, the more time you spend learning about the company, the better prepared you will be to write a compelling resume.


What are the priorities of the company? What types of people work there? What are their educational and work backgrounds? Much of this research can be done online: look at the company's website, read reviews of their services, read staff profiles on LinkedIn, or (if it’s a large company) read articles about the company from reputable business websites like Business Week at http://www.bloomberg.com/businessweek or The Wall Street Journal at http://www.wsj.com.
The dynamics, organizational leadership, and mission of the company should affect the contents and tone of your resume. For instance, a resume to a small, local charity organization that is family operated and not motivated by profit would look very different from a resume to a large corporate firm.

, Job advertisements are often lengthy and written in very industry-specific lingo, and it's important to familiarize yourself with the format and contents of job ads to find the ones you are most qualified for.


What are the specifics of the job ad? What type of position it is, and what are the requirements for education, experience, and skills? A close reading of the job ad should give you insight into the position and requirements and give you a hint as to what types of information the job search committee will be checking resumes for.
For instance, if a job ad says ""we seek a sales associate fluent in Spanish,"" and you don't speak Spanish, this isn't the job for you. If you do speak Spanish, you know from this ad that you need to indicate that skill in a prominent place on the resume, or it might be discarded after a quick once-over by a tired search committee.
Highlight every specific skill, duty, or requirement listed in the job ad. When you've completed your resume, come back to the job ad and be sure you've addressed every point listed in the ad in a clear way on your resume.
Sometimes job ads mention soft skills which can be tricky to demonstrate on a resume. Think of concrete ways you have displayed those skills in your education or career. For example, if an ad lists ""leadership skills"" as a qualification, you can describe how you managed a group of workers or supervised a successful project. If it lists ""self-starter,"" they want someone who can work without a ton of direct supervision and who shows initiative; be sure to mention any successful projects you have spearheaded or ways that you have exceeded expectations by completing major projects in advance of your deadlines.
Remember that many times job ads are written in an industry-specific lingo and might say more than they appear to say if you know how to ""read between the lines."" Ask a friend or mentor in the profession to look over the job ad with you.

, The chronological resume is typically divided into sections.


Objective or Career Objective; some applicants with major career accomplishments use a Career Summary section instead.Usually 2-3 sentences, this is a brief statement of the type of position you are seeking.
Employment History (or Work Experience): List your most recent or current position first, followed by the one that preceded it, and so forth until you've reached your first job. If you have too many positions to list, consider listing the most relevant, and adding a line at the end of the section specifying that you have held XX other positions.
Education: List your most recent or highest degree first, followed by any degrees that preceded it, including high school. If you attended college or high school but did not graduate, just put the years that you attended. You do not need to note that you did not graduate.Professional Memberships and Awards: This category is optional and should only be included if you have memberships and/or awards that are relevant to the job ad. For instance, you probably wouldn't list ""President of Future Farmers of America"" in a resume for a tech job, but you might list it in a resume for an agricultural job.
Special Skills: This is the place to include any skills you have that are specified in the job ad as required or preferred for the position, as well as any remotely relevant skills that set you apart from the competition. Examples can include languages spoken or read, computer software, skills in specialized areas like accounting or statistics, and special skills certifications (for instance, if you have a Certificate in Microsoft Excel from previous job training you might mention that here). Where relevant, also include your level of proficiency. You can also include ""soft skills"" like listening, conflict management, motivational skills, etc., but be sure these are relevant to the job.

, This is the only section of the resume that does not have a special heading (that is, it should not say ""Contact Information"").Be sure to include: your full name, email address, permanent mailing address, telephone number, and website or fax number if you have one.
Be sure that your email address is professional and simple, like firstname.lastname@gmail.com. Do not use your college email address if you're a recent graduate; it will likely expire soon. Also avoid email addresses that are funny or silly, as these will seem unprofessional.
Do not use abbreviations and remember to include your area code.
Consider centering the contact information and drawing attention to your name by typing it in bold or making it slightly larger than the rest of the text.
The contact information is the first thing the employer will look at, and it sets the tone for the rest of your resume. You want it to be eye-catching, but not too busy or hard to read. Generally, unless you are in a creative industry or are very familiar with the culture of the company to which you are applying, its best to make your resume conservative in appearance. Choose a standard font that is easy to read.

, The objective follows your personal information and is strongly written, but brief. In 2 to 3 sentences, highlight your best attributes that make you a match for the position.


Objectives are your best sales pitch for how you can help the organization reach its goals, not the other way around. It should clearly and specifically state your career direction or goal while simultaneously showing that your goal is synchronous with the description of the job to which you are applying and/or the organization's mission or goals.
Avoid using generic or cliché sounding objectives, like ""To achieve a position in my chosen field that allows me to use my skills.""Consider writing a ""user-centered"" objective, which names the organization to which you are applying.Example of a user-centered objective, which clearly describes a job seeker's background, relevant skills, and career goal with a specific employer: ""Experienced social science researcher with five years experience in research and public speaking skills at a nationally recognized university seeking to utilize background in ethnography, survey research, and report writing as a user experience researcher with ABC Social Media.""

, This section will chronicle your experience beginning with your most recent position and continuing in reverse.


For each position, include dates of employment, name of the employer, title of position held, and your responsibilities (summarized in 1-2 sentences)
You can also list additional details about your responsibilities in a bullet list. Start each bulleted point with an active verb, like ""Supervised construction of a major roadway"" or ""Drafted two successful grant applications for a combined $1 million in federal funding"" (see http://career.opcd.wfu.edu/files/2011/05/Action-Verbs-for-Resumes.pdf for a complete list). Use this section to detail responsibilities and accomplishments that will resonate with the search committee at the job to which you are applying.
The most recent position should have the most information with less description given for the older and/or less relevant jobs.

, This section will chronicle your education beginning with your most recent degree or diploma and continuing in reverse.


Starting with your highest degree earned, list the name of the school, its location, the date of graduation, the specific degree earned, and perhaps your GPA if it was over 3.0.Whether or not to include a high GPA is generally industry specific; technical fields generally place a premium on a high GPA, while many other industries don't care as long as your experience is strong.Ask a Career Services counselor or a mentor in the industry to which you are applying if you're unsure.
When you write a resume, you do not have to list your high school if you have a college degree, but it is often common to do so. Consider the advantages or disadvantages, particularly if your high school is a local one to the job for which you are applying and might have either a good or bad reputation.
Whether or not to list the dates you attended or graduated is a personal decision. Although age discrimination is illegal in many cases,it still happens sometimes and may be a concern if you are older or younger than the typical hire for the type of position to which you are applying. Some people choose not to list their graduate dates, particularly if they are over age 45, while others consider their age an asset and choose to include the dates.

, This is your chance to show that you have excelled in your area of expertise.


Include professional organization memberships, additional licenses or certificates, scholarships or academic honors, and community service positions.
Brainstorm a list, then choose the most relevant and/or recent to include. Try not to include anything that does not relate to the job or make you stand out as a candidate. You should also consider the values of the company, and think in terms of what types of memberships or awards would be appropriate to discuss in that context.If it is not obvious, be sure to specify how each membership or award you list might make you an asset to the company to which you are applying.

, List any skills, experience or associations that further demonstrate how competent and dedicated you are, but were not acquired in a professional setting.


Be sure this section includes any skills that are specifically mentioned as required or desirable in the job ad, such as language skills or computer programs that are proficient with.
Impress employers in this section by informing them of any fundraising, volunteer work sports or clubs in which you participate in your time off from work.

, Traditionally, resumes were expected to stick to a strict one-page rule, but today's standards have shifted.


A one-page resume is still standard, particularly if you have less than ten years of experience in relevant work or if you have not held many different positions. You might consider using a two-page resume if you have more than 10 years of relevant experience to list or if you have technical skills that need to be listed in detail.Your goal is not to tell your whole life's story or to seem like you're bragging about irrelevant accomplishments, but to concisely list all the relevant information about yourself.

, The hiring manager will spend only a few seconds reading your resume before deciding whether to discard it or continue reading. The font should be easy to read and pleasing to look at, but should not be distracting. While the right font is not likely to earn you any points with a hiring manager, a distracting choice could definitely cost you.


It must be easy to read and relatively conservative in appearance, such as Arial or Tahoma.The type should be 10-12 point in size, depending on the style you choose (some styles like Arial run larger, so choose 10 if that is the case).
The entire document should be in the same font, with the exception of your name and perhaps the section headings, which can be a different font but should still be very clearly legible.

, Grammatical, spelling, or formatting errors on a resume is a bright red flag to a hiring manager, telling them that you do not pay attention to details and that you can't be bothered to take your time on this very important document.


Spell check using your word processor's spell check program along with a through visual edit, since spell check is known to miss certain grammatical and spelling errors
Check for errors in your information, such as the spelling of former employer's names or dates of employment. Most importantly, ensure that your contact information is accurate so a hiring manager can contact you if you make the short list.
Ask a friend to give it a once-over for errors, since you are less likely to find errors in your own writing.

, The overall aesthetic of the document can make a lasting first impression.


Consider tying the aesthetic of the resume to your cover letter, using the same fonts, sizes, and heading styles. This makes your letter and resume appear to be a package rather than two disparate documents.
Browse the internet for industry specific sample resumes or ask an industry mentor to look yours over, to ensure that it is well put together.

List them in the order based on strength, with the strongest first after Education. You can also adjust the order depending on where you are applying to.

, In each section, start with your most recent accomplishment, and work backwards. Do not list any activities from middle school and instead focus on showcasing your high school accomplishments.

, Your margins should be set to 1” on all sides. Line-spacing should be wide enough to allow for easy readability, but not so wide as to spread your content out too much.


Font choice will have little impact on your resume, as long as you keep it professional. While a fancy or funny font may seem like it is speaking to your personality, it will cause admissions officers to dismiss it. Stick to business fonts such as Helvetica, Times New Roman, Calibri, etc.

Be concise.,
Don’t be modest.,
Use powerful verbs and action words.,
Showcase your grades.,
Focus on leadership.,
Show that you care.,
Highlight special skills.,
Proofread your resume.",How to Write a College Resume3," When writing about your achievements and activities, avoid going into details about unimportant aspects. Keep your descriptions to-the-point; this will make them more powerful to the reader. Ideally, a resume shouldn’t be more than a page or two long. Any longer and the reader will begin to gloss over the content.


Bad example: “I was on the Student Council, and attended the meetings every week. We had a lot of good debates in these meetings. Most of the debates were about how the school should be run.”
Good example: “Elected to Student Council, led the council in many debates about school policy.”

, While you should never lie, or even embellish, on a resume you should draw attention to your accomplishments. You aren’t trying to get your fellow students admitted, so focus on what you have done.


Bad example: “Took Student Council notes.”
Good example: “Managed all Student Council documents and meeting minutes.”

, When you write your descriptions, begin each point with an action word that will make it pop out to admissions officers. This will help keep your descriptions concise and impactful. Never use “I” in a resume.


Bad example: “In charge of several committees, including the Homecoming and Prom committee.”
Good example: “Chaired the Homecoming and Prom committees.”

, If you received good grades in high school, be absolutely sure to draw attention to them. Include a GPA score if over 3.0, and list your class rank or percentile if you have access to it. Good SAT or ACT scores as well as any honors programs should be listed as well.


If you have space, you can list some of the AP and college-level course you have taken.

, If you have a lot of extracurricular activities to list, then space on the resume can become an issue. When listing your extracurricular activities, pay special attention to anything that you took a leadership role in. This could be a section leader in the marching band, a team captain, volunteer coordinator, new student orientation, and much more.

, A strong volunteer section on your resume will help show that you care and take the initiative to help others. Try to have at least two or three volunteer entries to help you stand out.

, Throughout your academic career, you may have become fluent in a foreign language or mastered one or more computer software programs. These are things admissions officers look for and should be included on your college resume.

, Before printing and sending out your resume to colleges with your applications, have your resume proofread by at least two other people. Try to have a guidance counselor take a look at it to see if they have any recommendations. A resume should never be sent out with grammatical errors or misinformation.

Your high school course load can help you get into the proper higher education program after graduation.As you'll be working with bodies, it's a good idea to stock up on science courses. Take classes in anatomy and biology.

, Even without a high school degree, you may be able to find some work at a hospital. As a lot of medical knowledge is necessary to become a mortician, working or volunteering at a local hospital can bolster your resume.


Some hospitals may have volunteer programs for young people interested in careers related to medicine.
You can also see if you can do administrative work, like working or volunteering as a secretary.

, Becoming a mortician means working with death every day. If you want to pursue your apprenticeship, and eventually become a mortician, spend a long time thinking about the emotional toll the job will have. You will be dealing with bereaved family members and also have to handle dead bodies on a daily basis. Make sure you're up for the difficulties of the job.As a mortician, your job will be demanding. There is a lot of physical labor involved in preparing a body for a funeral. Think long and hard about whether you can handle looking at bodies day in and day out.

You may also want to look into a specialized mortuary school, as having a specific education may give you a better chance of landing an apprenticeship.
However, how certain are you in your career path? You can also attend a four year college, where you can study subjects other than mortuary sciences. This way, if you decide you'd rather do something else as a career, you have the option to change majors or explore career paths. A traditional four year school may be the right choice for you if you have any misgivings about becoming a mortician.

, Once you've decided on the right track for yourself, start applying for your chosen program. Programs will require different materials for the application, so read application requirements carefully to make sure you get into a quality program.


You usually need a copy of your high school transcripts, which you can get from your counselor. You also may need test scores, such as SAT or ACT scores.
Letters of recommendation may also be important. Talk to old high school teachers or anyone you worked with in the past, especially jobs related to mortuary studies. If you worked in a funeral home, for example, you may want to ask your boss there for a letter of recommendation.

, After gathering materials, you can complete the application process for the program you chose. You'll usually have to fill out a basic application, that includes things like your name, address, and so on. You'll also want to make sure you follow all protocol for submitting your application.


Some programs may require you to write an essay overviewing what you hope to get out of your education. If you need to write an essay for your chosen program, spend a long time working on your essay and make sure it's free of spelling and grammatical errors.
Read submission instructions carefully. Make sure you know where to mail your application, or how to submit electronically.

, Once you've been accepted to a program, you can begin your studies. Make sure you work hard. If you stand out in a program, it'll be easier to find an apprenticeship down the road. Work hard to earn high marks in all your courses.


You will study a lot of anatomy and biology during your program. You'll need to have a working knowledge of the human body in order to be a successful mortician. By the time you complete your program, you should have a sophisticated understanding of how the body works.
You'll also study some practical aspects of being a mortician. You'll study the science of embalming and cremation, as well as cosmetology and restorative art so you know how to prepare bodies for family members. You'll also have to study a bit about funeral law so you understand the legality of the funeral and burial industry.

, An internship can always help set your resume apart when applying for an apprenticeship program. Talk to professors in your program, as well as career counselors if they're available. Ask them about internship opportunities and have them direct you to relevant job boards and listings. An internship working at hospital or funeral can be a great resume builder as you apply to apprenticeship programs.

, As you near the end of your studies, you'll want to start seriously looking for apprenticeship programs. Ask your school counselor about where to apply. If you're going to a mortuary school specifically, there may be a placement program for apprenticeship programs available to you. You can also call local funeral homes and ask about programs.School counselors should be able to direct you to programs and give you guidance on how to apply. Start applying as you near the end of your program. Make a list of possible programs, and jot down the application requirements. Spend a little time each week polishing off applications. You should apply to several programs at a variety of local funeral homes.
Find an apprenticeship that works with your needs. You'll want to find an apprenticeship in an area where you're comfortable living. You'll also want to see what kind of funding or payment is offered during your time as an apprentice.

, You will probably need to write a resume to apply for an apprenticeship program. Start working on your resume as you near the end of your formal education. This will be an important tool as you hunt for the right apprenticeship.Choose a legible, professional font, like Arial or Times New Roman. Organize your resume in a logical fashion, putting your most recent and relevant experience first. Mark section headings with all capital letters, and avoid unprofessional bullet points or other decorations.
List all experience you have that's related to funeral services. If you took an internship in a hospital or funeral home, include this. You should also include any experience you have working with people, such as customer service work.
Be specific. For example, say you're writing about your experience working at a funeral home. Do not write, ""Talked to families on the phone to schedule meetings with the funeral director."" Instead, write something like, ""Coordinated between bereaved families and the funeral director in regards to scheduling and funeral arraignments, taking between 10 and 20 calls each week.""

, As you're hunting for the right apprenticeship, dip into your professional network. Past professors, co-workers, and supervisors may know of a funeral home seeking apprentices. They may be able to put a word in for you if they can speak to your skill set. Networking is one of the best means to find professional work.

, As you begin to get interviewed for apprenticeships, make sure you practice good interview skills. Behaving in a professional and impressive manner during an interview can help you land the job.Use body language to convey confidence. Sit up straight, make eye contact, and give a firm handshake. Nod as the interviewer is talking to show you are listening.
Make sure you use appropriate language. Avoid slang words and profanity, and use words related to the funeral industry. This will show you have a working knowledge of the mortician profession.
Always ask questions. You do not want to leave an interview without asking questions to show you're genuinely interested. Ask an open ended question, like, ""What is the culture of this funeral home like?"" and ""What does an average day of work look like here?""

, When you do land an apprenticeship, make the most of your time. Your apprenticeship is the time where you'll hone your skills as a mortician and can determine the course of your future in this career path.Your apprenticeship will last between one or two years, depending on your state's regulations. You'll work one-on-one with a funeral director, learning the trade. Do not hesitate to ask your director for advice and guidance during this time.
You may have to pass a certification exam in your state if you want to go on to become a professional mortician. Make sure you pay close attention to what you're being taught, as much of this information will show up on your eventual exam. Bring a notebook to your funeral home and take notes. You should also see if there are any supplemental reading materials that may be helpful to a budding mortician.

, As you work through your apprenticeship, think about your upcoming career. Being a mortician is a difficult but rewarding job. You should spend your internship seriously considering whether or not the job is right for you.Think about the longterm salary. Morticians do not usually make a lot from their trade, although you can live comfortably. The average salary is around $46,000 per year. Some morticians may make as much as $80,000, but this is rare. One of the perks, however, is that there's a healthy job market for morticians. It may be easier to get a job than it would in other fields.
Your schedule as an apprentice will likely be similar to your eventual schedule as a mortician. Think about whether you can handle the hours, which may erratic. You should also take stock of your emotional wellbeing. Dealing with the bereaved can be difficult and at times depressing work. However, you may also find the process of helping people come to terms with loss to be enlightening and personally rewarding.

Write letters of sales, not constitutive letters.,

Use the Internet.,
Get informed about the concealed jobs.,
Make research for your prospects.,
Dress to impress.,
Be reliable and efficient.,
Ask effective questions.,
Νever give up.",How to Convince Your Employer You Are Suitable for Work," You should know how you sell yourself to a likely employer and your application should give a good first impression. The employers will only take 20-30 seconds in order to read your application, so you should make yours stand out. A letter should gain the attention of the reader in the first paragraph in order to give him a reason for calling an interview. As an example: ""If you are searching for a director with an excellent, powerful network of acquaintances and with the skills to increase the profits by 20%, do not to hesitate to contact me."";
, If you use the same CV for all employers, it is time to change strategy. This method pushes employers away because your CV becomes impersonal, and does not fit the conditions that are required by the place of work. Adapt your CV and show that your experience and your skills suit the particular work. As an example, if you send your CV to a magazine company, make sure to mention your experience in magazine designs, applications, etc.

, Do not wait for the employer to answer to your application. Act in advance by calling or sending mail to their office(s) and try to have personal contact. Thus they will give you priority and if in point of fact they have decided to promote your CV then you will have the occasion to answer any chance scruples that they have.

, You may already be using the Internet, but the question is if you use it for your profit. Post your CV online, in an open account with companies that advertise announcements which are related to your search and report your personal elements in order to find you the employers that will be interested.

, Often it is said that the personal constitution is the best way of publicity and that the 70%-80% of all places will never be advertised. So how can anyone learn of these concealed jobs? Create a network of acquaintances. The friends and the collaborators (actual and future) who are found in the same industry with you can have precious information and constitution on places of work, a process that is facilitated a lot through sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn.

, You spend 70% of your time in your workplace, that's why it is very important that you will find organisms, environments and labour cultures that you would enjoy. A lot of sectors are combined. That means you will have a lot of occasions to learn first-hand how the enterprise you want to send your CV functions. So you will have also opinion on the subjects that occupy the enterprise, something that you can use in your favour to propose solutions during the interview.

, This it is not a puzzle. Simply get dressed appropriately for the work that you want, not for the one you have already. Your appearance is the exterior impression of your internal world that allows others to draw conclusions and to make affairs for the personality and your behavior.

, Time is precious in the enterprises and when most workers pass above 40 hours in the work weekly, the directors of engagements should make interviews in their schedule, something that leaves small margin for delayed interviews. Plan your way, forecast potential traffic on the streets and intend to reach there at least 10 minutes before the interview begins in order to fit in. So you might also read the newsletter of the company and be informed for the last developments.

, An interview is a bidirectional process: the employer tries to realise if you are fit for the job and you should see if the work suits your expectations and your requirements. Prepare a list of questions which you would want to ask with regard to the company and the place. This way, you will appear prepared and your interest will be genuine.

, If you receive a letter answering “Thank you for your time, but you are not suitable for the job” and you intend to stop trying , don't despair. You will not find a new job in one night and all the experts estimate that the MO of search of work oscillates from two until ten months. The more the ""No""s the closer you are to the final ""Yes"".

Plan your goals and set your targets.,
Network to grow your client base.,
Project a professional image.,
Build your expertise through continuous education.,
Follow-Up with your Customers.",How to Become a More Successful Financial Adviser,"


Start first by setting a goal of what you wished to achieve in a year's time.
Then break up this goal into smaller short term objectives to serve as milestones which seems easier to achieve and can encourage you along the journey while they are continuously being met.

Say for example if you hoped to obtain an annual income of $30,000 from policies sales commissions, you will have to earn $2,500 a month from the sales commissions. Usually this will means needing to close about 5 insurance policies in a month.
So how are you able to achieve that? If 1 in 4 prospects in face-to-face meet-up will be willing to purchase a policy from you, you will then have to fix-up 20 appointments with potential prospects in a month.
Let's say if 1 in 3 prospects in your cold calls would be willing to meet up with you, you will then have to cold call to 60 prospects in a month, which is also equivalent to cold calling to 3 clients a day if you are working only a 5-day work week. Setting goals and targets serve as a guide to help you plan your schedule and daily tasks list.


Try to discipline yourself to follow your planned schedule relentlessly, even though if it seems like it is not producing expected results initially.;
, You may want to start from your family members, relatives and friends. They have known you in person for years, and will naturally believe in you and trust that you will be doing a great job for them. When you are attending ex-classmates or ex-colleagues gatherings, re-build the relationships with your long-lost friends. Distribute your name cards and introduce to them what you are doing. There is no need to be shy and afraid. Let people be aware of you and profession, and how you are able to help them with your expertise and financial advice. Attend relevant trade shows, functions and conferences that are related to your industry, and get to know more people of related professions in your industry. You will never know when needs arise when you will require each other's expertise and field of knowledge.

, Be sure to dress professionally when you are meeting your clients. Make sure your hair is neat and tidy, well-shave and appropriately attired, so as to leave a good first impression. Avoid being sloppy and looked untidy which made him seems insincere and not ready to take up the project.


A prospect is more likely to trust an adviser who dress and look presentable, and know that the adviser appreciate and respect the meeting with him. Always be prepared before meeting your clients. Find out a little more about him, such as his age, gender, career and income, single or with a family, smoker or non-smoker, and hopefully what policies had he already purchased.
Think of a few options of what he is lacking and will possibly purchase from you. What are the coverage, premiums and returns that he will be getting for each options. And What are the available add-on that he may add for the options. When your client is impressed by the homework that you had done, he will likely be more convinced that you will handle his case in a quality and more professional manner.

, Your learning do not stop after you had gotten your adviser licence. Or rather, that marks the beginning of your learning experience in your career.


Always have a willingness to learn mentality, and keep yourself updated on news and changes that is related to your industry. Are there new changes to the rules and regulations governing your industry and how things will be working differently now? How will the changes affect you or your clients, and are the changes beneficial or not desirable? Are there new products released in the markets? How have the prices of your competitors' products adjusted as compared to yours?
As you build up your knowledge through continuous education, you may then slowly establish yourself as an expert in your industry. Attend talk shows and seminars as a guest speaker and share your knowledge and professional advice to those in need. Submit articles to recognized publications and magazines in your industry. Gain public awareness and recognition as being an expert. It is also advisable to obtain professional certification such as the Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) or the Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) to improve your credentials and demonstrate your expertise in this industry.

, It is advisable to follow-up with your existing customers regularly. This include responding immediately to every calls and queries from your clients.

This will give them a top-of-mind awareness about you whenever they or their friends and relatives have a need for your products and services. Do ask for referrals and testimonials from your satisfied customers.

Begin by determining what you like to do.,
Identify the skills you use when you're doing the thing(s) you enjoy.,
Think of fields broadly.,
Consider cross-field work.,
Learn as much as possible about the qualifications required for fields that interest you.,
Find people who work in the field and learn from them.,
Evaluate your choice of field according to your own perceptions and the information you have gathered.,
Sign up for an educational or training program in the career of your choice.,
Keep positive.",How to Decide on a Career Path," A lot of people look to others to determine their career paths: teachers, parents, neighbors, and peers. Think about your aim or goal. Consider which things you haven't tried. Think about what work you'd like to do or which ones are your passion. Don't compare yourselves with others - chose a path in which you are best. Think about people you respect and what they do for work. Take time to map out your wants and to match your skills with skills that are actively sought within certain fields of work. This will involve a fair bit of research work but it is well worth it.;
, Look at the things you are good at doing already. These will give you a very good indication of what you are likely to enjoy doing by way of a career. For instance, perhaps you like being with animals. Already this simple but important enjoyment opens up a very broad field of work for you that encompasses such possible jobs as caring for animals, veterinary work, animal advocacy, transporting animals, calming animals (e.g., horse whispering), making animal clothing and feed items, running a pet store, etc. Once you have identified a potential field, you are then ready to match your skills.

, A field of work is far more than a single job. It is an area in which many jobs or trades are possible and you should be able to consider your training and interests in terms of looking for a career path that will give you a shot at at least five related types of jobs that are available within that field. For instance, if you learn engineering, you might consider being an engineer out in the field (such as oil production), a manager of a site, an office manager, a trainer of engineering skills and a consultant in engineering. Or, if you study law, you may want to be a lawyer in a large law firm, a lawyer in a non-profit organization, a team leader in an office of any type (even non-law), a manager of a company or a writer of corporate compliance manuals. Realize that the breadth of the field will be determined in part by the training you receive and also by your own personal, up-to-date ""skills set"", as well as your willingness to try new things and to be retrained.

, When working out what you would like to be and what you will need to study to get to this point, give consideration to the possibilities involved in crossing fields; for instance, many teachers are good with word skills and hence make excellent editors and publishers. Think outside the square your title bestows (or will bestow) upon you.

, Library, Internet and direct contact research will be required here. It is also helpful to ask your school, local community services, university, etc. for assistance in career choices and development. Your thorough research will help you to determine quickly which areas you want to study in, as well as the depth of study required. Dig deep and look at third and fourth year subject/skills training requirements as well, so that you don't find any nasty surprises awaiting you, such as additional time or harder skills that do not match your interests or abilities.

, Once you have worked out which specific jobs interest you, speak to those already working in these areas. This will enable you to hear their suggestions and to ask them what they like and dislike about the field in which they work. Sometimes you may even have an opportunity to do some work experience with a place that interests you, to help you to ""get a feel"" for the work involved.

, Assess the comments you've received, weigh these up with your research work and add in your own feelings about your potential career path. This is now the time to decide whether this career continues to appeal to you. Do not forget to include the type of lifestyle you would like in the balancing equation. If you make enormous compromises as to the type of lifestyle that you ultimately want, you may be unhappy and live to regret this. As such, it is wise to try to combine your career choice with a lifestyle balance, with minor or short-term compromises rather than major, long-term ones.

, While studying, do not neglect to take advantage of networking opportunities and chances to work in your career field either as a volunteer or in short-term paid positions. These opportunities will give you the best possible feel for the work and the types of people in the field that you will be working with. It will help you to filter out any unneeded areas of study or to take on additional subjects and skills training that may be of possible use and could help to extend your horizons.

, When you are finally trained and ready to find that dream career, the most important thing is to maintain a positive outlook about your life and to be ready for change, difference and shifts in your comfort zones. This is the real world and it moves rapidly; it is important to keep up with changes and to take a positive approach by making opportunities out of challenges. However, always keep what is unique about you because at the end of the day, that is the special something many employers are looking for while they choose from many skilled and educated workers available to them.

Consult an attorney.",How to Deal with an Abusive Boss," Some types of abuse are explicitly prohibited under the law, including discrimination and sexual harassment. Approximately 70% of workplace sexual harassment incidents go unreported.The first step to protecting yourself from these types of abuse is recognizing and acknowledging abuse when it occurs. You may initially rationalize these behaviors or chalk them up to your workplace's culture, but excusing abuse only perpetuates it.


Sexual harassment can include inappropriate comments, requests for sexual favors, pressuring and controlling behavior, and unwanted physical contact.
Discrimination includes unfair treatment based on the employee's sex, age, nationality, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or other legally-protected characteristic.;
, There are other types of abuse that are not necessarily illegal, but are nonetheless harmful and disruptive. Some bosses are verbally abusive (to you directly, or behind your back), while others use their position to manipulate situations and cause trouble for employees. A boss who snaps once in a while might just be having a bad day, but one who regularly belittles you, insults you, or makes your job difficult is probably displaying abusive behavior. If you recognize a pattern of abuse, take action.

, Workplace abuse is linked to stress, which can have many adverse health effects, including depression, tension, heart disease, and self-medicating behaviors.If you have noticed a decline in your health due to workplace stress, you can still take control of your situation.


Some signs of stress include high blood pressure, feeling nauseated the night before you start your work week, and using up your vacation days just to get a break from work., Document all incidences of abusive behavior by keeping a record. Write down the date and time of each incident, as well as what your boss said and did. Record the names of any co-workers or others who witnessed the incident.You may also want to keep a journal describing how these interactions affected you, including how you felt after the incident and whether it continued to bother you or affect your work. Your notes will be helpful when confronting your boss, or filing a complaint with human resources or a government agency.Keep copies of any related emails, and record any illnesses or doctor visits related to the effects of the abuse., Don't confront your boss when you are emotional, if you can help it. If you appear emotional, your boss interpret it as a sign of hostility or weakness. To make the best impact, give yourself time to cool off.You will be better equipped to communicate and negotiate if you are feeling calm and clear-headed., Ask yourself, if your boss tends to yell at employees, why is he or she so upset? Some people yell because they are just mean, but is it possible that your boss is stressed at work or at home? Your boss may come off as extremely intense because he or she is under a lot of pressure to succeed.If you can empathize with your boss's situation, it may drain some of the tension out of the situation.

, Even if it doesn't make the problem go away, confronting your boss can be an important step in improving your situation. Schedule a meeting about improving your workplace relationship.Even if your boss does not change his or her behavior, standing up for yourself can improve your mental health and keep you from feeling like a victim. In addition, your boss might decide that you're not such an easy target and leave you alone.Prepare for your meeting by reviewing and bringing notes about past abusive incidents. Refer to specific incidents at your meeting instead of making general complaints. For example, telling your boss ""you always insult me at work"" is ineffective, because it is overly general and easy to deny. Instead, try, ""You often insult me at work, including twice during Monday's staff meeting and yesterday in the break room. I am open to constructive criticism of my work, but I want you to stop making jokes at my expense.""
You can also stand up for yourself in the moment when your boss engages in abusive behavior. Saying something as simple as, ""I will not tolerate that kind of language,"" and walking away can be an effective response to verbal abuse.

, When your boss makes a point, repeat and rephrase that point in your response. This demonstrates that you are truly listening and understanding what your boss is saying. If your boss was not clear, ask him or her to clarify.You can use this principle when you initiate your discussion by repeating the underlying message behind your boss's behavior. This shows that you understand and take responsibility for his or her complaint, which may make your boss more receptive to your criticism of his or her delivery. For example, ""I understand why you were upset yesterday. The report I gave you did not address one of the issues you asked for, and I told you I would revise it by the end of the day. However, I don't think it was necessary for you to curse and raise your voice to make your point.""

, When proposing solutions to your problem, use qualifying words, such as ""perhaps"" and ""maybe.""For example, ""Maybe you could start giving written instructions so that there is no misunderstanding about the details of this assignment."" By using ""maybe,"" you are offering a suggestion, but not giving an instruction or demand.


Use ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements. For instance, ""I need guidance"" as opposed to ""You haven't given me enough guidance."", To improve your work relationship going forward, you and your boss will need to find some common ground. Since you work together, you have certain common goals and experiences in common. Perhaps you share a common stressor, such as a looming project or deadline. You might try to work some of these common experiences into your discussion.


For example, ""You must be getting a lot of pressure about your presentation at the upcoming shareholder's meeting. The rest of the team is anxious about it too, and we'll all be glad when it's over, so let me know if I can help you prepare this week.""

, If talking to your boss didn't work, or if you are afraid that a confrontation will make your situation worse, you may need to talk to someone else or another department within your workplace. Workplace tensions can harm productivity and cost the company money, so your boss's supervisor should want to know if your boss is creating a hostile or counter-productive work environment.You can also make a complaint with your human resources department. The department may investigate and/or attempt to mediate the situation. At minimum, initiating a complaint with HR creates official documentation of your boss's abuse.If your employer has a contract with an employee assistance program (EAP), you should be able to get contact information from your HR department. EAP professionals usually offer free counseling and support that can help you deal with an abusive boss., This requires actively trying to rise above unpleasant situations and remain indifferent to your own emotional reactions.Like in meditation, you can practice changing your attitudes and emotions at work.


""Watch"" your emotions as they pass through you.When you get angry, think to yourself ""I am feeling angry, but I don't have to show it or give into the emotion."" With practice, you can choose not to react to abusive or aggressive behavior, and stay cool and professional. You can focus on your work without getting drawn into conflict, and your boss lose interest in picking fights with you.

, Do what you can to avoid opportunities for your boss to act out. Communicate via email and voicemail as often as possible to avoid in-person confrontation. Anticipate that your boss is going to be dissatisfied with your work, and prepare yourself in advance to offer to revise your work, rather than start an argument about your boss's expectations., Maybe your boss is under a lot of stress at work, or has problems at home.This does not excuse abusive behavior, but it can help explain it. Remember that you still have the respect of your coworkers, who are also suffering under a bad boss. With any luck, management will recognize that your abusive boss is ineffective and hire someone else.

, A study published in Personnel Psychology suggests that employees who engage in passive-aggressive behavior at work are generally happier and more productive in their careers.However, the study does not recommend passive-aggressiveness. Acting out can get you in trouble, harm your reputation, and have a negative impact on your employer's business. That said, you may be able to reclaim a sense of control at work and show your boss that you have a backbone.


Passive-aggressive behaviors noted in the study include ignoring an unpleasant supervisor, pretending not to know about something, and making a half-hearted effort at a task., One survey estimates that abused employees put up with workplace abuse for an average of 22 months before quitting.If you have an abusive boss, ask yourself whether the situation is likely to improve, and whether it might be better to look for a new job now. Remember, you still have the skills and qualifications that got you this job.You can find a better fit somewhere else.


If you can't find a new job before quitting, find out if your state law permits workers who quit their jobs to collect unemployment benefits.You can collect unemployment benefits if you quit for good cause, but each state defines ""good cause"" differently.For example, in California, you probably have good cause to quit if your boss is hostile and/or abusive, but you usually must try to fix or report the problem before you quit., ""Constructive discharge"" means that even though you quit your job, you were essentially forced to do so by your employer. This can occur when your employer creates working conditions (or allows conditions to continue) that are so terrible that you feel that you have no choice but to quit. To prove constructive discharge, you must show that you suffered mistreatment so intolerable that any reasonable employee would choose to quit, and that you tried to stop the mistreatment by complaining to your boss or HR department. Talk to an attorney about filing a lawsuit against your employer for wrongful termination and constructive discharge.


If you win a constructive discharge suit, you may be entitled to back pay, front pay from the time of the case to the time you are rehired or find another job, and damages., There are many kinds of abusive behavior, but since you can't sue your boss just for being a jerk, most of them don't warrant legal action. However, if you have suffered sexual harassment, discrimination, or sufficient threats, physical contact, or intimidation to make you feel endangered, you may have a case. You can get referrals from friends and family, or from attorneys who may not practice family law but know a trusted colleague who does. You can also use referral services through your state and local bar associations, or just search online.

Educate yourself.,
Update your resume.,
Brush up on new technologies.,
Find a market niche.,
Display strong communication skills.",How to Compete With Younger Job Applicants1," Consider going back to school or taking a few classes at the local community college. You can take classes in a field you’ve previously worked in to find out what has changed and learn new strategies. Alternatively, try a course in a new subject or field to expand your skills and knowledge., Your resume should highlight your accomplishments and experience. The best way to compete with younger applicants is to demonstrate what you have that they do not. Set yourself apart with specific examples of what you have achieved in your career.Include any licenses, awards, or professional honors you have received.
Be sure to proofread your resume carefully, as mistakes can land your resume at the bottom of the pile.

, Most companies are using social and mobile strategies to conduct business. Take some classes, read books, or get online to try out the new platforms and technologies that you may have missed in your last job.

, Rather than competing with thousands of applicants, consider creating your own niche. Look at your interests and skills, and see if there is a gap in the market regarding them. You could sell a product or offer services, based on what you are knowledgeable about and have experience with.For instance, you could become a consultant in the industry you built your career in.

, Globalization has made communication a highly sought after skill, so brush up on your communication skills to increase your chances of landing the position you apply for. Show potential employers that you can work with a variety of different people and communicate clearly with them all.If you struggle in this area, take a public speaking or interpersonal communications course to strengthen your ability.

Emphasize experience.,
Demonstrate dependability.,
Show adaptability.,
Maintain flexibility when it comes to salary and benefits.,
Highlight your transferable skills.",How to Compete With Younger Job Applicants2," Show potential employers that your age and experience make you a stronger candidate for the job. Explain experiences that qualify you for the position, such as previously managing a design department when applying for an illustrating position., Employers want to hire people who will be dependable as well as loyal to the company. Explain to prospective employers that your age is a benefit, as it means you can be counted on to show up and do the job to the best of your ability. Tell them you plan to stay with the company and won’t jump ship if another opportunity comes along -- something that younger applicants may be tempted to do., An advantage you probably have over younger workers will be poise and confidence. Hiring managers will want to know that you can adapt to a younger corporate culture, new business models, and a different economy. Provide examples of problem-solving abilities, and times when you have had to change course swiftly., If you are applying for a position that younger workers are competing for, do not expect the salary offered to be at the level you may be accustomed to. Younger applicants will work for less. Negotiate extra benefits or a flexible schedule in exchange for making less money., These are skills you possess that are not limited to one specific job but can be used in many occupations. Examples include writing skills, leadership skills, and the ability to motivate others. You may also be a team player, speak more than one language, know how to delegate responsibilities, or have strong time management skills."

Use your contacts.,
Join social media networking sites.,
Get a referral from an employee in the company.",How to Compete With Younger Job Applicants3," While you may have searched for previous jobs in the newspaper, most people now use the internet to find work. Use sites like Careerbuilder, Indeed, Monster, and Craigslist to find positions to apply for. Some sites allow you to post a profile in order to let employers search for qualified applicants, so be sure to thoroughly fill out such sections.

, At this point in your career, you are probably much better at networking than younger applicants. Get in touch with your alumni association, professional organizations, and colleagues from past jobs. They can help you with recommendations, references, and tips on what companies and industries may be seeking. Keep in touch with your network, and be direct about what you need from them., Websites such as LinkedIn are used by many recruiters and hiring managers to verify or supplement resume information. Set up a profile, add a professional photo, and organize your page. Make connections with alumni and previous colleagues as well as friends and family. You can uses these sites to show potential employers your skills as well as find new positions to apply for., Resumes from applicants who are referred by employees of a company are more closely reviewed than those who don’t have a connection. Reach out to friends or alumni who work at a company that you would like to join and ask for a referral. Recruiters are more likely to consider you for the position if you are recommended by someone working in-house."

Look at the Occupational Outlook Handbook.",How to Choose the Right Career," There is an old saying that if you’re trying to choose a career, you should think about what you would do if you didn’t have to work. If you had a million dollars and you could do anything, what would you do? Your answer to that question, while maybe not literally the best career choice for you, may give you insight into what you should do.


If you want to be a music star, consider going into audio engineering or music composition. These careers are easier to pursue and you will be much more likely to succeed and provide for yourself in the future.
If you want to be an actor, consider going into media broadcasting. You can get a degree in communications or work your way up the chain of command in a local news or other television studio.
If you want to travel the world, consider becoming an airline steward or stewardess. This is a great way to make a living and pursue your dream of traveling the globe.;
, It is very easy to turn your hobbies or something you love doing into a future career. Many hobbies correspond to real world needs and positions. Consider what you like to do and how that might fit into a career.


For example, if you like playing video games, consider becoming a video game designer, programmer, or QA specialist.
If you like drawing or art, consider becoming a graphic designer.
If you like sports, consider going into teaching and getting certified as a coach.

, Academic subjects translate well into future careers but may require more schooling than other types of careers. Your favorite class in high school could very well launch you into your future career but you have to be willing to work for it.


For example, if you loved chemistry, you could look forward to a future career as a lab technician or a pharmacist.
If you liked English class, consider becoming an editor or a copywriter.
If you enjoyed math, consider becoming an actuary or an accountant.

, Think about the subjects you excelled in in school. Though it may not be your favorite thing to do, choosing a career based on something you are skilled at can help you excel and provide yourself a secure future.


Look at the examples from the previous step if you need ideas.

, If you are particularly good at certain skills, such as fixing things or making things, this can provide you with a great future career. Schooling may or may not be necessary, but skilled labor is often in demand and you will find it fairly easy to find work.


For example, carpentry, auto repair, construction, and electrical work all benefit from people who are good at fixing things or working with their hands. These also tend to be stable, well-paying jobs.
Other skills, such as a skill for cooking, can also be easily turned into a career.

, If your skills lie more in helping and communicating with other people, there are jobs for you as well. People who communicate and interact with others well can easily get careers as social workers or in marketing and similar business positions.


If you’re more the type to take care of others, consider nursing or work as an administrative assistant or office manager.

, Sometimes it’s hard for us to see the areas in life where we excel. If you don’t think you’re good at anything, ask your parents, other family members, friends, or teachers what they think you’d be good at. Their ideas might surprise you!

, Figuring out what you should do with your life may sometimes require you to get to know yourself better. If you want a career that will really make you happy, you have to have a very good understanding of what you want and what you enjoy. For some people, this means taking some time off to decide what’s important to them.


There is nothing wrong with this, so don’t feel bad. It’s more important that you figure your life out as early as possible, rather than getting knee deep in a career which makes you hate your life.

, Your ability to pursue or change careers may hinge on your financial situation. Some career paths require special schooling and this is sometimes expensive. However, you should not feel that being poor restricts you from getting the education you want. There are lots of government programs to help you pay for schools, as well as scholarships, grants, and apprenticeship programs.

, It is important to consider what education you already have or will have as you begin pursuing a career. If finances may prevent you from pursuing more schooling, you may need to consider what you already have. It may also be necessary to stick with your existing high school or college degree if there are time limitations or other restrictions. If you find that you are limited to jobs relating to the degree you already have, consult with a career counselor to find out what options are available to you.

, If restrictions do not bar you from pursuing more schooling, you may want to consider this option. Not everybody excels in school or needs a traditional college education, but most career paths have associated training which you can do and will help you advance more quickly.


Technical colleges, for example, may be a good option for those who would prefer not to pursue a traditional education.

, If you're still confused, consider doing more research on this topic. You can find more helpful information here or consult with your adviser or college of choice.

, Consider what career options are available for you to easily move into. These would be careers in which you have both the necessary skills and an “in”. Examples would be working for the same company as one of your parents, working for a family business, or working for a friend. If your options are limited, choosing a career in which you can quickly enter may be your best option.

, One of the most important things to consider is if the career path you’re choosing will provide you with an acceptable level of financial security. In other words, will you be able to make enough money to support yourself and your family?


Remember, this doesn’t have to be a lot of money or enough money by somebody else’s standards. All that matters is that it’s enough for you and what you want for your life.

, It is also important to consider a future career’s stability. Job markets fluctuate as society needs different things at different times. Certain jobs are also always in demand or frequently unstable. You will need to consider if the career you choose is stable enough for you and your desires for the future.


For example, many people recently went into law school and racked up often in excess of $100,000 in school debt because they thought they’d be making a very high wage in the future. However, law positions are not in demand as much the last few years and now those people have huge debts and no way to pay them.
Another example is working as a writer or any career based on freelance work. You may sometimes have plenty of work but there may be years when you have almost nothing. Working in this way requires a certain level of determination and discipline and is not for everybody.

, One way for you to gauge if a career option is a good idea is to look it up in the Occupational Outlook Handbook. This is a guide, compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which looks at what kind of education is required for different jobs, how much people in those careers make on average, and how much the demand for that job is likely to increase or decrease."

Follow your gut.",How to Decide Whether to Accept a Job Offer," When the offer comes in, you should have a good idea of what it's going to be. That is, you should be discussing the benefits and salary throughout your negotiations with the employer. If a certain benefit is non-negotiable for you, you should ask about it when discussing the position.You should be able to get a reasonable idea of what the company will offer. Many companies publish salary information online, as well as information about benefit packages. You can also find some information on job sites, often posted by other job seekers and employees.;
, One factor you should consider when looking at a job offer is whether the company is a quality one. If the company is not quality or is on a down swing, you may be in for multiple rounds of downsizing, which could leave you searching for a new job in a few years., Once you've done your research on the company, think about whether you can truly support their mission and products. If you can't get behind their products and ethical system, it may be that you need to turn the job down., You may want to hold out for a job that you really enjoy. However, you may not be able to if you've been without a job for an extended period of time. You have to be honest with yourself about what you can afford. On the other hand, you may need to turn down a really enjoyable job if it doesn't pay enough to sustain your lifestyle.Take a hard look at your budget to see exactly what you need to survive.

, When looking at the salary for one job, you have to look at it in comparison to any other offers or potential offers you have. You may have to estimate what you would make at other companies to make a comparison., Sometimes, you may forget to add in the costs of a position, but those are equally as important as a salary. For instance, if you need to buy new clothes or you need a well-maintained car, those are both costs. Another cost could be the cost of supplies if you are a contract worker. Make sure you consider those before you accept a position.Another major cost to consider is daycare.
If you're taking a second job, think about the ways it will benefit you in relation to the ways it will cost you. For instance, will it cost you extra daycare to take the second job? Will that outweigh the salary you're making?

, Salary is a big part of compensation, but it's not the only compensation. Healthcare is another large benefit, as are things such as 401K benefits and paid vacation and sick leave time. You may also look at other perks, such as paid gym memberships, discounts on company products, and tuition reimbursement., While being underpaid is a problem, being overpaid can actually be a problem, too, if it's not a job you love or one that will advance your career. If you take this kind of job, you can get addicted to the pay. You adjust your lifestyle to this high pay, then it can be hard to leave for a job that's more in-line with what you want to do at lower pay., When thinking about a job, it's important to think about whether it will use your skills and whether or not it will keep you engaged. Of course, you don't want a job that's too far out of your skill range, but it should offer you some room for learning, growth, and challenge.Understand that not every job will advance your career. Sometimes, you may need to take a job even if it's not the perfect one to move your career forward. However, most experience is relevant in one form or another, so keep that in mind as you consider the position.

, How many hours you are required to work is another important consideration. You know how many hours you want to work in a week, and if the job is going to demand more than you want to give, you may want to pass it up.The same can be said for the amount of work it requires of you. If it's going to be an extraordinary amount of work that wears you down quickly, it may be a job you want to pass on.
If you're taking on a second job, it's important to consider if the extra hours are worth what you're being paid. If it makes you miserable, it may not be worth it.

, You should know by now that the perfect job doesn't exist. That means that when considering any position, you must be willing to give on some things that you want. You may have an idea of exactly what you want, and if a job ticks off a good portion of those items (but not all), that's probably a good fit for you., One very important consideration when it comes to a job is who your boss will be. Of course, many jobs come with bosses that aren't ideal. However, if the person is absolutely someone you can't work under, you should probably pass on the job.It's not all about personality. It's also about management style. If you like your freedom, you may not like working under a micromanager, for instance.

, If you want to move up in your field, you need to pick a position that has opportunity for growth and advancement. If the job is dead-end, you may decide it's not right for you, as you want to move up over the course of your career., When looking at a job, you have to consider the commute, as well. A long commute will eat into your leisure time. In addition, it costs you more money for a longer commute, if you're commuting by car.This consideration is especially important if you're taking on a second job. If your second job is far from your first job, it will cost you money, plus it may make it difficult to get to your second job on time.

, The culture of the workplace also contributes to your happiness. For instance, you may prefer a more laidback culture with casual dress, or you may prefer a more professional atmosphere, where you use formal titles with your co-workers and boss. Either way, it's important to evaluate the culture of the company before accepting a position.You can gain some idea of culture from a company's website, but you should also take a look around while you're there for the interview to get a better idea.

, While culture and environment are similar, they're not the same. For example, the environment can include things like noise level, temperature, and office decorations. You may not want to base your whole decision on something like environment, but it may be a factor. For instance, if you can't work in a completely quiet environment, you may not do well in a very quiet office., Once you've considered all the logical pieces of information about the job, you may need to set that aside and listen to your gut. That is, sometimes you just know whether a job will be right for you or not, and it's important to listen to that voice when it tells you what's right."
"
Think about whether or not the job offers you personal development opportunities.,
Determine whether the work you will be doing is challenging or meaningful, and if those two characteristics are important to you.,
Consider your need for flexibility and whether or not the job meets your needs.,
Think about the corporate culture that you would become a part of if you took the job.,
Consider the amount of prestige the company has and think about what that means for you.,
Ask yourself if the physical environment of the company suits your needs.,
Learn about the team you will be working with and think about where you will fit into that team.",How to Consider a Job Offer1," In particular, think about how the skills you think you will learn at the job will affect future job opportunities, and how you can advance in the company starting at the position you are getting offered.



Ask yourself: Will this job set me on the career path that I want to pursue? Is that something that is important to me?

Ask your potential employer: Does the company offer training programs pertaining to various skill sets? Has there been a history of promotion from the position being offered? What requirements are needed for trainings, promotions, certifications etc. offered at the company?;
, If you want to be challenged and excited by your work, it is important to consider whether the job you are being offered will involve work of that kind. Assess the goal of your job. The more challenging that goal is, the more motivated and upbeat you will feel is you are the kind of person who looks for engaging work.



Ask yourself: Will I be working on exciting projects? Will I be able to apply my knowledge and skills on a daily basis? Does this job offer me a challenge? Are am excited by the prospect of what I will be doing at this company?

Ask your potential employer: Do you find that this company’s goal challenges and excites you? Do you find the work you do interesting? Do you find that your colleagues are also excited by the work?

, Again, this is based on your personal needs. If you are a person who needs flexibility and the chance to pursue new ideas, you want to make sure that your job allows you to have that autonomy. If the job has very strict boundaries and a permanent schedule, you may want to consider looking for a different job.



Ask yourself: How much flexibility do I need to be happy and productive? Do I work well if I have no deadlines, many deadlines, or somewhere in between?

Ask your potential employer: Will I have the opportunity to set my own deadlines? Will I be able to expand my working hours without asking a supervisor?

, Evaluate the culture of the organization in terms of its overall environment. Assess it against your personality. You may consider elements like how focused on a goal the company is, the company’s emphasis on teamwork, professionalism, how fast-paced the environment is, how casual, caring, or creative the company.


Since understanding the culture is a tough task at the interview stage, you may have to talk to someone who is currently working there or who has worked there in the past.

Ask the current employee: Do employees tend to get to work on time and take ownership for their work? Does your employer seem to care about your concerns? Do people work in teams, or is it more individual work? Are new ideas welcomed at this company?

, Some people have a hard time considering working at a low-profile company. This is because they are concerned that future employers won’t know (and therefore won’t necessarily respect) this low-profile company. Alternatively, some people are concerned about getting no recognition in a large, prestigious company.Ask yourself: Am I alright with working at a low-profile company that people might not recognize in the future? Will it hurt my career path to choose a job at a less prestigious institute? Am I alright getting paid less at a job that has prestige?
Rather than asking your potential employer, do some research of your own via the internet and your networking sites to determine how prestigious this company is.

, If you are a person who needs to take a break and relax at least once throughout the day, or have specific physical needs, you may want to consider your potential office space environment.



Ask your potential employer: Is the workplace equipped with a space to take breaks? Is the office safe (ie. are there security guards in the parking garages, etc.)? Will I be sharing an office space or will I have my own office?

, Meet your potential team before hand if possible. Evaluate them not only in terms of how well they fit with the current job, environment and skill profile, but also in relation to your own personality. You should also determine whether or not the team seems like a strong one that will be successful. After all, a successful team has the potential to boost your career.



Ask yourself: What kind of team do I work well with? What is my role in that team?

Ask your potential team: How long have you been working together? Do you feel like you’ve learned a lot while you’ve been working at this company? What has their track record been since they became a team?

Target your audience.,
Consider your competition.,
Promote a consistent image.,
Choose a type of advertisement.,
Write a headline.,
Work on the body or main text.,
Draw the graphics in your ad.,
Create a layout.,
Test your ad.,
Choose where to advertise.,
Consider costs.,
Mix different methods.",How to Create a Successful Advertisment," Think about what kind of customer you want to attract and tailor your advertisement to that customer. Consider gender, age, education, and hobbies of your target group.Trying to reach everyone will spread your efforts thin. Choosing a specific target audience can maximize your advertising budget and get more efficient results.Pepsi's ""Choice of a New Generation"" ads are a good example of targeting. Pepsi decided to focus on younger consumers so they created ads that explained Pepsi as the drink for a new, young generation.;
, Think about your competitors, what makes their product good or not so good. Then focus on what sets your product apart. This will help highlight the things that make your product or service special and strengthen your advantages.Think about Apple's ""I’m a Mac, I'm a PC"" advertisements. They make a clear argument about the difference between Macs and their competition and they make the consumer want to be a Mac person because of the difference., Advertising helps customers easily identify your product and what makes it better, but advertisements have to present a consistent image and message for this to work. Make sure your ad builds on previous advertisements and promotes the message for your product that you want customers to know in the long run., Advertisements can take a variety of forms including:


Electronic messages
Print in publications or on outdoor surfaces
Audio ads for radio or podcasts
On-line videos or broadcast commercials

, The headline should capture attention and convey the main idea of the ad. If you are working on a video or audio advertisement begin with the major statement of the piece.


Keep the headline short.
Be creative, but be careful not to stray too far from a clear, core idea behind the ad.One example of a great advertising headline is Nike's ""Just Do It."" The line is short, and memorable, but it also conveys a clear message about fitness and sports behind the brand.Another great example is the De Beers diamond company's ""A Diamond is Forever."" This line on DeBeer's ads helped make the public see diamonds as the standard choice for engagement rings. It is simple, and clear, but it conveys a big idea about the product., Write the ""body copy"" for a print ad (the text that makes up the main part of the advertisement.) For an audio or video ad, work on the script.


The main text will convey the whole idea of your ad, including what you are offering, what sets it apart, and how to get it.
The copy should also remain concise. Balance detail with brevity to hold your audience's interest.The ""Got Milk?"" ads show how important the main text of the ad can be. The ads featured a short clear headline, ""Got Milk?"" and great images (celebrities with milk mustaches,) but the ad copy explained the benefits of drinking milk., Include graphics for print and video ads to draw and hold audience attention.Sometimes the graphics make up most of the idea behind the ad. Absolut vodka used just the shape of their vodka bottle to catch attention in famous ads., Decide how to arrange the graphics, headline, and copy in a print ad. For a video, determine where graphics will appear in relation to the action on screen and the script.

, Try testing your advertisement out on a focus group, a small group of people in your target audience. Show the advertisement to the group and ask about their reactions.Do they understand the message in the ad?
Do they find the way the ad looks appealing?
Would they try the product or service?
Would they tell a friend about the ad or product?

, Find out what your target audience likes to read, watch, and do for fun then place advertisements where they will be most likely to see them.Knowing your audience well will help you determine the best ways to distribute your ad., Take in to account the relative costs of different ways to advertise. Check with various media outlets to find out about ways to maximize your advertising dollars, such as special sections in print media., Different audiences learn differently and are receptive to different approaches. Use a variety of media to reach out to target groups and sell your product or service.Hand out flyers and brochures.
Make a commercial.
Advertise on billboards and on public transit.
Utilize in-store displays where customers make purchase decisions.
Advertise by email or social-media.

Look for a job in a climate controlled environment.,
Find a job in a clean and well-maintained building.,
Focus on jobs that don’t force you to overexert yourself.,
Avoid jobs where you will be exposed to allergens.,
Stay away from air pollution.,
Steer clear of jobs in which you are exposed to chemicals of any type.,
Talk to your physician.,
Have the air quality of your workplace tested.,
Investigate environmental risk factors at a location or business.",How to Choose an Asthma Friendly Job," One of the most important things to focus on is finding a job in a climate controlled environment. By working in a climate controlled environment, you’ll eliminate a variety of potential risks such as allergens in spring time, pollution, and more.


A clean and high-functioning air conditioning system is essential.
Stable humidity is important.
Make sure your employer changes air filters as often as necessary.;
, While climate control is important, you also need to keep other factors in mind that impact indoor air quality. Old and unkempt buildings can pose several dangers, such as:


Mold and mildew.
Asbestos.
Dust buildup., Although air quality is important to think about, the best jobs for asthmatics are ones that are not too physically demanding. Even in an environment with great air quality, you can still suffer an asthma attack if you overexert yourself.


Jobs that require a lot of desk work may work well for some asthmatics. Consider careers in accounting, law, or medicine.
Think about jobs that require you to be on your feet, but do not push you beyond your limit. Consider careers in education, writing, or editing.
Avoid jobs that require major physical activity such as manufacturing jobs or jobs in construction., One of the biggest risk factors for people with asthma are allergens that naturally occur in the environment. Thus, do what you can to avoid jobs in which you will be exposed to allergens that can aggravate your asthma. Stay away from jobs in:


Lawn maintenance, house-cleaning, or landscaping.
Forestry.
Construction.
Home nursing care. You will be exposed to roach infestations (highly allergenic for those with asthma) as well as tobacco smoke.
Agriculture., Perhaps even worse than naturally occurring allergens is air pollution. Inhaling air pollution, even on a limited basis, can exacerbate your asthma.


Avoid working outside in urban or even suburban environments. Inhaling pollution created by cars can trigger an asthma attack. Some of the worst jobs you could take include: highway toll keeper, postal carrier, or street sweeper.
Do not take a job in an industrial district. For instance, even the air quality indoors in an industrial district will be low. If you’re in a region with heavy industry, consider relocating or working far from any manufacturing plant., While there are a variety of well-paying jobs in which you work in clean, climate-controlled environments, make sure you stay away from jobs in which you’ll work with or will breathe in chemicals. Such jobs include:


Certain manufacturing jobs.
Jobs in which you are exposed to paint fumes.
Any job in which you must work with or be around cleaning agents. For example, jobs in custodial maintenance, dry cleaning, or pool care., If you are concerned about how a potential new job could impact your asthma, contact your physician. Your physician will be able to evaluate potential health risks and give you a good idea of whether the job will cause you health problems.


Schedule a consultation with your doctor. Let them know that you are taking a new job. Say “I’m very interested in this new job, but I’m concerned about how it will impact my asthma.”
If you don’t already have a respiratory specialist, have your general practitioner refer you to one., If you are about to accept it, or you are just taking a job, consider having the air quality tested. This is important especially if you have major reservations about how the work environment could impact your health


Ask your current or prospective employer if they have had the air quality tested recently.
If your employer will allow you, arrange for an environmental assessment specialist to test the quality of the air.
Consider purchasing a “home” air quality test kit online. These tests will provide the equipment for you to take an air sample, which you can then send to a laboratory for testing. Prices range from $50 to $200.
Depending on what state or country you live in, there may be laws guaranteeing your right for information about air quality in your work place., You can also take some investigatory steps to see if a business or location has higher risks for asthmatics or people with other conditions. By doing this, you’ll rely on the experience of past and current employees, as well as experts and government agencies.


Use pollution monitoring services to see pollution levels in a city or region. Visit aqicn.org for more information.
Contact your state or provincial government’s environmental protection agency for more information about environmental conditions or pollution at a specific location or for a specific business.
Google the name of the business and location to see if there are any news articles containing information about environmental problems or other risk factors associated with it."

Create a list of people who you believe will say positive things about you.,
Narrow down your employment reference list to ideally among 4 or 5 people.,
Speak to each of your prospective references prior to actually listing them.,
Ask the references what they will say about you if asked.,
Request current contact details from each reference.,
Provide each reference with your current resume and an idea of the types of roles for which you intend to apply.,
Let your references know how much you appreciate their willingness to help.",How to Choose a Work Reference," The best choices may include former supervisors, coworkers, managers in other areas who you worked closely with, or even clients. You will want to choose work references from this list that will speak highly of you and will attest to what you have accomplished.


If you don't have any profession references or are an inexperienced worker, you may need to broaden your list. You may want to use college professors, supervisors from internships or volunteer assignments, coaches, or close friends. These types of references are only acceptable if you're a recent college graduate or a young worker.;
, Keep a few alternative names handy in case some of your first choices for references don't want to participate or don't pan out.

, Ask if they would mind becoming a reference for you, and select only the people who agree they will participate.

, While this may seem uncomfortable at first, it is necessary for you to know what will be said about you to any potential employers. Choose the people whose messages highlight your best attributes and put you in the most positive light.

, This can include work phone number, cell number, and email address. Make sure you also have their current title, the name of their employer, and how long you've known them, as these details will likely be requested.

, It may be helpful to provide them with a bulleted or shorter list of your key skills and accomplishments so they know what points are important to you. They can reference this list while talking about you to your potential employers.

, Saying thank you is important because these people are helping in your job search.

Consider the pay the company is offering you.,
Determine whether or not the commute will be challenging for you.,
Determine how much vacation time and other benefits you will be given.,
Do some research to determine how financially stable the company is.,
Find out who you will be reporting to and what that means for you.Your supervisor may make or break your experience at the company.,
Learn about the retirement saving opportunities.,
Consider the position title you will be given.",How to Consider a Job Offer2," Of course, payment is generally a large part of deciding whether or not to take a job. Find out how payment works, and what exactly you will be getting paid. Start by asking at the base pay you will receive before asking about any other sort of payment (like incentive pay, bonuses, sales commission, etc.) It can help to research what other people are getting paid for the same kind of position that you are thinking about taking.Ask yourself: How much do I think I should get paid for this job? How much are people getting paid for jobs that are similar to mine? Will I be able to live off of the pay that

Ask your potential employer: How does the payment system work at this company? Are employees given bonuses? Is there any type of incentive pay? Is there the potential to increase my salary through good work and time?

, It can make your life easier if the job you are looking at is close to your home. If this is not the case, you will have to figure out how you will get to work, and potentially negotiate terms like flexible hours or working from home.



Ask yourself: How far am I willing to commute for this job? How will I get to this job every day?

Ask your potential employer: Is there a shuttle service for people who do not live close to the office? Is it possible to work flexible hours that accommodate a long commute? Is is possible to work from home some or all of the days of the week?

, It is important to find out what the company’s policies are on vacations, and what benefits, if any, the company will be giving you. If you are a person who does not have health insurance, a company that has health benefits might be a necessity for you.Ask your potential employer: How much vacation will I get? Will this vacation time increase the longer I work at the company? Will I be required to come in on holidays? What benefits does the company offer?

, When assessing a job, it is important to look at how stable and profitable the company is. If it is a new company, this might be hard to do, so do some research on the profitability of companies like the one that you are thinking about joining.Look at:


When the company was established.
How successful the company has been.
The company’s stock.
How often raises and bonuses are given (if you have access to this information).

, If you have to regularly fix conflicts with your boss, you will most likely not be as productive or happy as you could have been at another job. If you meet with your supervisor before accepting the job, look for things like:


Does your supervisor seem approachable or stiff and standoffish?
Does he or she seem flexible when it comes to extended vacations, odd hours, or new ideas?

, If you are in the older sector of the workforce, you are more than likely thinking about retirement savings. It is important to find out what the opportunities for retirement savings are at this company.Ask your potential employer: Does the company offer a retirement plan? How much income will I get when I retire?

, This element is similar to considering the company’s prestige. Your job title can affect your future employment opportunities, so it is a good thing to consider if prestige and job title are important to you. Position titles matter because they present the breadth of your job responsibilities in just a single word. Because of this, if you had a more prestigious title at your last job, it might make your resume look less respectable if you take a new position that has a lower title than your last position.



Ask yourself: Is this new job title above or below my last job title? How will this job title look on my resume?
For example, if you were a Manager at your last company, accepting an Assistant Manager position might not look as good on your resume, unless it is with a more renowned company.

Discuss moving fees and find out what the company will cover.",How to Consider a Job Offer3," If the company that is giving you the job offer is not in your area, and you are not able to telecommute, find out whether or not the company will help you with the relocation process. Moving is a big process and can be very expensive.Ask yourself: Am I willing move for this job? Can I afford to move if the company does not help pay for the move?

, When moving, it is easier to house hunt when in the area you are moving to, rather than looking at houses online. Because of this, it is important to find out if the company will pay for your house hunting trip. The company may also have a relocation specialist who can help you with your house hunt. On the other hand, the company may direct you to hire a specialist yourself and they will reimburse you.



Ask your potential employer: How does this company handle house hunting fees? Does it cover the costs of relocating? Will the company reimburse me for the money I spend while looking for a house? Is there a specialist I can talk to?

, It may take some time to find a good house and move into it. You may choose to instead arrange for a temporary housing set up. While considering the company’s offer, find out how they handle temporary housing. It may in fact be included in the ‘house hunting expenses’.



Ask your potential employer: Does this company cover temporary housing expenses? Is there a meal stipend that is included in the coverage? Does this include my partner or child’s expenses?

, When you do find a house, you will have to deal with actually moving to this house. This can be quite expensive, so it is helpful to find out beforehand if the company will pay for any (or all) of your moving expenses.Ask your potential employer: What moving expenses, if any, does this company cover? Does this include hiring a moving company?

Find out whether or not the company offers you a bonus.,
Ask about benefits.,
Consider whether or not the company will provide you with a company car.,
Discuss contractual agreements.,
Ask about stock options.",How to Consider a Job Offer4," If the company rewards your position with performance based incentive, you may want to find out about these bonuses beforehand, as they can may make a large difference when it comes to your income. Learn about them in detail and discuss various scenarios with your potential employer.



Ask your potential employer: How many bonuses are given per year? What is the formula to calculate the bonus? Is it a percentage of your base salary?

, Ask about other perks or separate plans that may exist for executive employees. You may have a separate package that is specific to your position. Talk to your potential employer about these benefits. The benefits may include:


Health insurance.
Retirement benefits.
Having a personal secretary.
Dress code waiver.
Personalized parking slot.
Membership to different clubs.
Unlimited vacations.

, If the potential employer is offering you a car, it is important to discuss the details of the car, and what policies apply to the company car. For instance, it is important to talk about whether fuel is included in the coverage.



Ask your potential employer: What car would you be provided with? Is the fuel included? What other policies apply to the company car?

, At the offer stage be sure to discuss in detail what reimbursements you may have to make in case you decide to leave before a certain time period. This includes going over the contract rather than just discussing it verbally.


Determine whether or not the employment is set for a start and end date.
Talk about whether or not you will get to reevaluate details at a later stage.
Discuss the conditions under which you would be asked to leave the job.

, Discuss how the stock options work while evaluating the job offer. Many companies offer stock options as part of a long term incentives plan. Find out if the stocks are being offered on an on-going basis and how many shares you can get.

Ask yourself if you could accept regular overtime at the expense of time with your loved ones. Think about how much control you would like over decisions about your work-life balance. Consider what you need to live comfortably. Reflect on whether you must be affluent or if you just need the basics., Finding a job you enjoy can do wonders for your productivity. Think about the duties you enjoyed in past paid or volunteer jobs. Ask yourself if you prefer working with people or things. Consider whether you prefer thinking or creating. Think about the industries that appeal to you., Look into options such as the RIASEC/Holland Interest Scale or the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). You can find many free versions on the web. The RIASEC scale will determine whether you're realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, or conventional. The MBTI will help you figure out whether you're introverted (shy) or extroverted (outgoing)., The two most common motivation types are promotion-focused and prevention-focused. You're promotion-focused if you're creative, impulsive, and enjoy trying new things. Consider fast-paced and evolving fields like social media and the tech sector. You're prevention focused if you prefer planning ahead of time and always paying attention to detail. Consider a job with set hours in fields like law or data analysis., Make a list or write a journal entry detailing where you'd like to be in 10 years. This will help you to decide between two or more job offers. For example, you could receive one job offer with a high salary that doesn't quite mesh with your 10-year plan. Another offer could pay a lower salary but be right up your alley goal-wise. If you're really thinking long-term, you should take the second offer., If you've already created a custom résumé, you've listed your most relevant experience tailored to a job opening. Try composing a master résumé that lists every job you've had. Chances are, you'll be able to spot connections you didn't think of before. You might even discover qualifications you never though you had., Don't just stop at your degree or professional certificate. Think about the transferrable skills you perfected as a student. Perhaps you excelled at argumentative writing or discovered a hidden talent in a studio art class. Maybe you participated in extra curricular activities that honed your leadership skills. Take your entire academic experience into account., These days, there are many consultants and coaches who can help you analyze your qualifications.Look for professionals who specialize in the field you're interested in. Search online for free webinars tailored to people with your background. Many colleges and universities offer free job search assistance to their alumni. If you live near your alma mater, make an appointment at the campus career center.

, Even if you already have a job, you can use your spare time to increase your know-how. Ask your employer if there are any on-the-job training opportunities you can take advantage of. Volunteer for a local charity or business a few hours a week. Take night or weekend classes at your local community college., Most job search sites allow you to choose one or more locations to limit your search by. Figure out the maximum round-trip distance you're willing to travel each day. Consider whether you're willing to relocate, especially if your dream job is in another state/province or country.


Pay attention to travel requirements if you're a single parent or caretaker. Consider who will care of your child, parent, or chronically ill companion animal if you have to travel frequently., Regardless of your age, you should take health insurance and the retirement package into consideration. Benefits that depend on your personality- and motivation types include extended vacation time, flexible work days, and telecommuting. If you're promotion-focused, you might enjoy flexible hours. On the other hand, if you're social, you might prefer to avoid telecommuting., Read your 10-year plan against the company description. Research whether the company has a mentoring program or offers professional development workshops. Opportunities like these will allow you to improve your skills on the job and better prepare you for future in-house openings that might meet your future goals., Your responsibilities on the job should mesh with your skills and/or education, at least to some degree. For example, if you're fresh out of law school, you probably won't make partner just yet. However, you don't want to be a paper pusher, either. On the other hand, if you've been in the field for a while, you should expect your responsibilities to be higher up the professional ladder., Figure out if it's compatible with your personality- and motivation types. For example, you might be a prevention-focused introvert. Ask yourself if a boisterous, fast-paced environment of a dot.com startup is worth the potential clash with who you are., Research the company. Look into its financial stability and reputation, since these usually indicate how long it will be around. Consider your motivation type in your assessment. For example, if you're prevention-focused, you should apply for a job that's going to be there for the long term. On the other hand, if you're promotion-focused, you might anticipate looking for a new job after a couple years."

Work reasonable shifts and hours.,
Find a job with meaning for you.,
Play to your strengths.,

These careers may be more dangerous because they involve heavy machinery. They may also be risky because they expose workers to things like falls, explosions, electricity, drowning, or other dangerous situations.Consider checking with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to find out more, as they keep track of fatal and non-fatal rates of injury in different sectors each year.
For example, agriculture, mining, and construction all have very high rates of on-the-job injury – usually in accidents with heavy machinery or vehicles and falls. Security guards and taxi drivers also face a higher risk of violence from other people.
As far as relative risk goes, some of the most dangerous careers include logging, fishing, construction, metal working, and taxi driving.;
, If there’s one thing the certain unhealthy jobs share, it’s that they take place behind the wheel of an automobile in transportation. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, truck drivers have the highest number of total fatalities – and of these fatalities, 68% are in crashes. But police officers and taxi drivers also make the list, as well, with high percentages of fatalities in crashes.

Transport is dangerous – driving cars or trucks for hundreds or thousands of miles each year always carries the risk of traffic accidents.
More than the danger of a crash, transport careers put physical and emotional stress on workers. It means that you’ll be sitting for long periods of time – in fact, transport workers have some of the highest levels of obesity and smoking.
Transport workers can also be exposed to harmful fumes and chemicals. For example, delivery truck drivers who sit at loading docks may be a higher risk for chronic lung problems.

, Some jobs require people to work with or be exposed to harmful substances. The risk might be direct and take place during manual labor – like steel workers working with molten metal – or it could be a long-term health risk from exposure to things like dust, fumes, or smoke. Keep this in mind if you’re looking for a health career.Miners and construction workers can be exposed to dangerous substances by breathing in dust from coal, concrete, and wood. Farmers are exposed to things like grain molds, pesticides, and herbicides, which over time can lead to lung damage or neurological problems.
Dangerous substances aren’t just for manual laborers, though. You’ll want to avoid more common things like second-hand smoke, too, which bartenders, waiters, and restaurant hosts can be exposed to.

, Some amount of stress and challenge on the job is a great thing. In fact, workers may express less job satisfaction when they have higher levels of on-the-job boredom, whether from lack of challenge or doing the same things every day. But too much stress can be a bad thing, as well, and make you less physically and mentally healthy.Too much stress can preoccupy you. Work-related pressure can make you feel stressed and fatigued, affect your personal relationships, and even trigger bouts of burnout and depression.
Stress can have negative physical effects, too. Overly stressed workers may eat erratically, exercise less, and end up with more problems with weight, cholesterol, and high blood pressure.
Look for a career with a healthy balance, one where you feel challenged but not overwhelmed by your duties.

, Thinking that a cushy desk job might be for you? Desk jobs might be healthier in some ways than those with a high risk of injury, like construction, but they keep you sitting for long periods of time. Doctors now think that this can be a long-term health risk and a factor in things like obesity, cardiovascular problems, and cancer.Studies show that more time in front of electronic screens correlates with a higher risk of cardiovascular problems, including heart attacks, as well as death from any cause. Trying to offset the sitting by going to the gym a few times per week does not seem to help, either.
Does this mean you should favor active jobs over desk jobs? Farmers, loggers, and construction workers all get more exercise on the job, but they are also at a much greater risk for accidental injuries and death.
Try to find a balance between workplace safety and activity. Teachers and nurses, for example, are safe professions but score well in daily physical activity, especially in walking. Try to add movement to your routine if you end up at a desk job, too, like using a standing desk or walking during your meetings.

, The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that millions of people in the US work evening or night shifts. Millions more work 48 hours or more every week. While there is nothing wrong with being productive, both shift work and long hours are associated with safety and health risks. If you are looking for a healthy career, you may want to avoid these.

Sleep deprivation is the biggest worry when it comes to shift work. Fatigue can lead to things like accidents, injuries, or even fatalities. Shift workers can also suffer from sleep disorders and are more likely to develop chronic heart and gastrointestinal diseases.
You may also have more emotional problems with longer hours. Not surprisingly, people who put in more hours seem to have higher levels of work-family conflict, stress, and stress-related health problems like depression.

, Choosing a healthy career isn’t just about avoiding things, but also about finding a line of work that will keep you engaged and satisfied. People spend about 80,000 hours working during a career. You’ll be happier and better off to land a job that provides you with a sense of meaning in addition to a regular paycheck.What kind of meaning should you look for in a career? Well, it mostly depends on you. Different people value different things, and different jobs offer different kinds of meaning.
Some people want to serve a greater good and contribute to society and will find a non-profit organization fulfilling. Others might value creativity and learning and enjoy a field like teaching. Still others may want the prestige and money of a career in high finance or the independence of a small business owner.

, You’ll also feel more satisfied in a career if you are able to use your strengths and talents. This is another part of finding a meaningful field and can be part of transitioning jobs: assess a job you’ve done, decide what you liked about it, and look for a job that allows you to do more of the same.You may have to think about what your strengths are. Try to get behind the activities you find fulfilling and pinpoint just what it is that you do well.
For instance, you might have loved studying history in school but not know how to build a career around it. What is it about history that you like? What is it that you do well? Do you like to research? Do you have a good mind for dates and details? These can be strengths in many other careers.

, Another factor that can contribute to overall job satisfaction and “wellbeing” is a positive relationship with the boss. Of course, this is not always something under your control. But having good relations with a supervisor is associated with higher job satisfaction, leaving workers feeling more valued. Look for fields with higher levels of boss-satisfaction if you want to choose a healthy career.Careers that rank among the best in wellbeing also rank highly in good supervisor relationships. Workers in these careers are more likely to report that their bosses treat them like partners than like inferiors.
Nurses, physicians, teachers, and other professionals all report high levels of perceived cooperation with their supervisors. So do managers and executives, as well as farmers, fishermen, foresters, and salespeople.

Evaluate all of your research.,
Weigh the pros and cons.,
Determine if the job is right for you.",How to Check Out a Company," If your potential employer has an official website, start your research there. Go to the homepage. Ask yourself if it makes a good overall impression. Is relevant information organized well? Does the website appear clean, professional, and modern? Is contact information (phone, fax, email, physical address) readily available? If so, you can probably conclude that the company is reasonably professional and cares about its public image.;
, Most companies have an “about us” page, which should provide you with its history, vision, mission, and philosophy. A good “about us” page will do much more than attempt to make money and state how great the company is; it should express the company’s intentions to solve a problem, provide a useful service, or satisfy its customers.


For example, a poorly written mission statement might simply say, “To be the best company out there.” Such a statement says very little about the company and does not express much thought. On the other hand, a mission statement that says, “To be the preferred provider of innovative technology to increase communications and efficiencies  for call centers throughout the U.S.” is much better – it reveals careful thought, specific goals, and a dedication to customers.

, If the company has a “careers,” “employment,” or “working here” page, read it carefully. In all likelihood, such a page will provide only the good information about a company – it aims, after all, to entice quality candidates to apply for a job. Nevertheless, reading all of the information will provide you with a good starting point for understanding and evaluating the company. In addition, it may provide you with information about salary, benefits offered, and opportunities available to employees.


Take note, in particular, of the number of jobs listed on the careers page and how long those jobs have been listed for. If there are many jobs open, this could mean either that the company is expanding or that it has a high turnover rate; try to find out which. If jobs are open for a long time, this may indicate that the company is having trouble finding and hiring qualified candidates. Consider this a potential red flag.

, In addition to official websites, many companies now have active social media profiles. These pages allow you to gather more information about a particular company and see who is following them. Some things to look for include:


consistency of information. Information about a company should be consistent throughout its social media profiles and official website. Inconsistencies could indicate that a company is dishonest, unprofessional, or lax in updating its sites.
appearance of professionalism. Social media sites should have well written statements with few errors, and they should look clean and professional.
followers. Who is following the company? It’s normal for brand new or very small companies to have only a few followers, but for larger and more established companies, a lack of followers could be a red flag.

, If you can, find employees’ profiles and see what you can learn about the type of people the company typically hires. Compare profiles to gauge common characteristics, education, and experience. See if you can determine how long employees stay at the company; if you keep seeing people who stayed for a year or less, that could be a red flag. In addition, look for:


employees’ statements or implications about looking for new work. If many of a company’s employees are looking to make a change, you might want to reconsider the company.
large numbers of previous employees who are now out of work. This could indicate massive layoffs, frequent firings, or a company’s inability to hold onto its employees.

, By using the company’s name as the keyword in a search engine, you will be able to view pages and pages of information about the company (in addition to its website and social media profiles). For example, you might find articles, books, papers and other publications about the company.

, Use the name of the company and the terms “reviews” or “ratings” as keywords, and run a new internet search. You should be presented with a list of websites that provide reviews or ratings for that particular company. Obviously, the more positive the ratings are, the more comfortable you may feel working for that company.


Try not to get hung up on one or two bad reviews. Even the best companies can have a disgruntled past employee. Consider the overall tone.

, When you speak with a recruiter, hiring manager, or other company representative, ask lots of questions about the company, the job, and the workplace environment and culture. Note whether people seem opening to answering these questions or not. If the person seems hesitant, you may have to dig a little deeper. Questions to consider asking include:


What is the management style like?
What is the company culture?
Does the company provide career development?
Does the company organize department or corporate-wide events?
Why did the last person to hold this job leave? How long did he or she have the job?

, Although you may feel nervous or uncomfortable about it, asking current employees what they think about the company may give you some much-needed insight. If employees are eager to talk with you and answer your questions positively, that’s a great sign. However, if the employees seem to pause a lot and hesitate about what to say, they may be trying to conceal negative feelings about the company.

, If the company is a consumer-oriented kind of business, visit as a customer. How was your experience? Were the employees helpful and polite? Did they seem happy? If the experience was a positive one overall, that’s a good indication that the current employees are content and that the company is striving to create a positive work experience.

, Even the best of companies will occasionally get a bad review. However, if there are many bad reviews that mention the same problems over and over – “overworked and underpaid,” for example – you should view that as a warning sign.

, As the interview process progresses and you continue your research, think about how good a fit the company might be for you. If you get the sense that you would not fit in or that you would be unhappy, take that feeling seriously. For example, if you prefer a relaxed work environment but you find that the company culture is very fast-paced and demanding, you may decide that you would be happier elsewhere.

, If you are receiving unclear or inconsistent information, follow up! Inconsistencies can indicate that you are not being told the truth, that your contacts are not knowledgeable enough, or that there is a lot of uncertainty within the company. If, for example, you were told in your first interview that you would need to work every other weekend and then, in your second interview, that you would not need to work weekends at all, you need to find out which is true – and where the inconsistencies are coming from.

, If your initial contacts treat you unprofessionally, you may not be comfortable working at a particular company. Examples of unprofessional behavior include:


poorly written emails
rudeness
harassment
comments or actions that make you feel uncomfortable (such as sexist or racist remarks)

, When you visit the workplace, evaluate your surroundings to determine whether you would be happy working there. Questions to consider include:


Do the employees seem unhappy? If you start working for the company, you may be unhappy too.
Is the workplace messy and cluttered? A messy environment can be a sign that employees’ work spaces are being disregarded.
Are there unsafe work areas? Unnecessarily hazardous work areas can cause major problems. Don’t put yourself at risk.

, Think about all the information you have gathered and all the interactions you have had. Do you feel comfortable accepting a job in that company? Will you be happier? Will you be able to stay for at least a year?

, All jobs and companies have both advantages and disadvantages. It’s important to make a list and weigh these pros and cons based on your particular preferences and specific circumstances. Keep in mind that a company might be right for one person and wrong for another. Only you can make the best decision.

, If the company’s pros outweigh its cons, then the job may be right for you. Trust your instincts and decide whether to pursue the job or not.

Research traveling nurse staffing companies.,
Apply to your top few agency choices.,
Speak with your agency recruiter.,
Choose an available position and interview at the facility.,
Accept a position.,
Begin your assignment.,
Periodically re-evaluate your staffing agency.",How to Become a Traveling Nurse," Before embarking upon a degree or program certification in nursing, it is a good idea to make sure this career suits your goals and interests. Do research online about what it's like to be a traveling nurse and speak to nurses about what they do on a daily basis so you can determine if you are suited to this career path.


If possible, seek volunteer opportunities in local clinics or hospitals so you can experience firsthand the work environment of a nursing career. This is the best way to figure out whether you like the job before you pursue it.
Consider the pros and cons of having a career that requires you to move around frequently. Some people may love nursing but want a more stable lifestyle, in which case a career as a traveling nurse might not be for them.;
, The first step to becoming a traveling nurse is to acquire the education and skills necessary to enter the profession. Research nursing programs in your area that are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN).The following are three common ways to go about becoming trained as a nurse:


Apply for a hospital diploma program. These training programs are only offered by some hospitals and are designed to provide the minimum required training to take your nursing board exams. In order to gain RN certification using this method, you must already be a licensed professional nurse (LPN).Obtain an associate's degree in nursing. These two-year community college programs include both classes and hands-on training to prepare you for nursing board exams.
Receive a 4-year Bachelor of Science degree in nursing. These programs are offered at universities and colleges. Although this method is more time-consuming and costly than the alternatives, nurses with a college education are likely to be afforded the best advancement opportunities and wages. A longer degree program may also allow you to train in a specialty field such as surgery, psychiatry, or physical rehabilitation.

, After you complete an accredited training/education program, submit your application to be tested by the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN).You will need to pay the applicable fees and submit your application along with passport photos and fingerprints.


You may wish to enroll in a NCLEX-RN exam preparatory course in order to increase bolster your test-taking skills and knowledge of the material. These courses can be taken in-person or online and are offered by private companies like Kaplan.
The NCLEX-RN exam is conducted at designated facilities and is entirely computer-based.Time allotment is 6 hours, with two optional breaks; be sure to prepare accordingly.

, The experience level required in order to be hired as a traveling nurse varies by staffing company, but can be anywhere from one to three years. Although your work experience does not have to be in a hospital setting, this is more likely to get you a job as a traveling nurse, as they tend to mostly work in hospitals.


Apply to nursing positions at all major hospitals in your area. It might also be a good idea to apply to smaller clinics and medical practices to maximize your options.
If you have a Bachelor's degree and are trained in a medical specialty field, you can also seek employment with specialized practices that match your skills and background. Just keep in mind that you will be more hireable and have a larger range of options to choose from if your experience includes a variety of work.

, Traveling nurses must be able to pick up and move to a new location, often in another state, with relatively little notice. It is important that you already be in a situation that allows you to do this once you have registered with a staffing agency. People who have young children or other responsibilities that require them to remain close to home should not pursue work as a traveling nurse.


Enlist friends, trusted neighbors, or family to help take care of things for you while you are away. This might include entering your home at least once a week to ensure that everything is in good shape. Because your assignments can last up to a year, you should keep your requests to a minimum so as not to overburden the person.
Do not keep plants or animals that require frequent care, or be prepared to give them away if you need to leave home.
Arrange for unnecessary utilities or home services to be canceled while you are away (such as cable television and internet). This will allow you to avoid incurring charges for things you won't use while on assignment elsewhere.
Have mail stopped or forwarded to your new location.

, Search for agencies online that specialize in or exclusively deal with traveling nurse staffing. Lists of these companies can also be found on nursing career websites.Call agencies of interest and ask to speak to a recruiter about what the staffing company has to offer.


As demand for traveling nurses is currently on the rise, most staffing companies offer highly competitive pay. Maintain an information spreadsheet for that includes pay rate, health care offerings, 401K contributions, average assignment lengths, placement rates, housing options, and the number of jobs currently available for each of your top agency picks. Compare at least four or five companies before choosing the best staffing agency for your needs.If possible, talk to other traveling RNs about what it's like to work for specific staffing agencies. An experienced traveling nurse can give you a new perspective on what questions to ask and what to look for when getting started in your new career.

, The demand for traveling nurses is relatively high, so your chances of being hired by the company of your choice are good. Nonetheless, it is a good idea to keep you options open by applying with multiple companies, even though you can only work for one. You will be required to complete a skills checklist and reference request in addition to your actual application.

Do not be afraid to negotiate your terms of employment. Salary and benefits are usually flexible for traveling nurses, so ask for what you think you deserve (within reason).
Be as comprehensive as possible in completing your skills checklist, but do not lie. You may have more placement options with a longer list of skills, but it is important that you not embellish your abilities.

, Once hired by a staffing company, a traveling nurse is assigned to a personal recruiter whose job is to assist his traveling nurse clients with job placement throughout their careers.Once you choose which staffing company you would like to work for, review the location and employment options available to you with your recruiter.


Be clear to your recruiter about your requirements. If there are certain places you wish to avoid being assigned, it is best to communicate this information to him or her early on. This will ensure that you are matched to assignments that suit your needs.
Understand that your recruiter can only work with what is available to him. Sometimes you may have to accept positions that are less than ideal if you wish to work.

, Before accepting nurses, most hospitals and clinics will want to conduct a telephone interview to make sure you are a good fit for the job. Your recruiter will help prepare you for the interview to improve your chances of successfully securing a position.

Although you may not always be able to find a position in the exact city or town of your choice, you are very likely to at least find work in the whatever state or region you wish.
You are not obligated to accept a position for which you have interviewed, but it is good practice to be reasonably certain that you want the job before you apply. This will ensure that a good relationship is maintained between your staffing agency and their affiliates.

, Your recruiter, your agency's housing board, and your destination facility will then work together to make arrangements for your arrival. Your recruiter will help you complete any paperwork that is needed in order to satisfy applicable state and federal employment laws.

All states require licensure to practice as a registered nurse, the requirements differ with each state. This is a good reason to tell your recruiter early on about any desired work locations, as he can then ensure that you acquire whatever licenses or clearances your target state may require. You can also contact the State Board of Nursing in the state where you plan to practice to find out the requirements to fulfill in order to be licensed.
It is sometimes possible to acquire a single ""compact"" license that will cover numerous states.For example, the Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) currently covers 25 states.It can take time to obtain required licenses, so factor this into your timeframes when applying to positions in states with requirements you do not already meet.

, Your staffing agency will arrange for your transportation so that you don't have to worry about making these plans yourself. Some jobs may be indefinite, in which case the duration of your stay will be uncertain at the start. At the end of your job, you may be offered a chance to renew (circumstances depending). Alternatively, you can begin working with your recruiter again to find your next placement.


Keep in touch with your agency recruiter regarding your position. Let him know if things are not going well or you are experiencing problems with your living situation. It is in your agency's best interests to keep you satisfied, so they will help you with any problems you happen to encounter with your assignment.
If you do know how long your assignment will be, you should begin working with your recruiter before your current position ends to find your next job and make the transition between the two as smooth as possible.

, Ask yourself from time to time whether you are getting what you need out of your current staffing company. Do they pay what you deserve? Are they able to find you positions in locations agreeable to you? Do you get along with your recruiter? If you are not satisfied with your current agency, consider joining a different company.


It may be difficult to quit your agency while in the middle of an assignment. If possible (and if your situation is not require immediate changes), wait until you are between positions to make this move.
Talk to your recruiter and agency administrators if you have concerns. They may be willing to remedy whatever issues you are experiencing in order to keep you on. Remember that you are valuable and may have more pull than you think!

Begin your new work for publishing.",How to Begin Writing Short Stories Professionally," A common adage among writers is “never publish your first work”. While this may seem a little harsh or restrictive, there’s good reasoning behind it. Remember that your first work is what sets your reputation. It’s hard to recover from a poorly-received first novel as many people may already have written you off. This may also seem like a wasted effort, but it’s generally a good idea to write your first story and then get it sent to an editor. That way, you’ll avoid common mistakes, and get valuable feedback about what you may not have developed enough, plot holes you may have written, and other roadblocks.;
, This is around the time that you'll want to hire an agent who can help you find a reputable printing press to get your story out to the public.

, This is rather self-explanatory, but is crucial. Choosing the wrong agent or the wrong publishing house can make or break the career of an aspiring author. Research reputable agents and houses, and ask around to see who can give you the best service for your money

, You’ve gotten it published; now it’s time to get some return on it. Thanks to today’s technology, it’s far easier to get word out than ever before. Some quick tips: post reviews on Amazon. Amazon will host more or less anything, provided there are more than several copies. Get some friends to post some positive reviews and help you out. Pass out copies to people in the right places. If you have a friend who owns or works at a bookshop, give them some copies to hand out. Start up a webpage, create a blog, do a reading. There are many ways to get the word out. You just have to find them.

, Depending on how you promoted it, you may get a lot of critical feedback in known works, or you may get a few simple reviews on Amazon. Any critique is helpful, and it can help shape your writing to be more successful in the future. Examine what you need to work on, and set upon fixing it.

, Your new career as a writer has only begun.

See what other women are wearing at the company to get a sense of what you should wear.For instance, see if most women are wearing skirts or pants. Check out how casual they are on a day to day basis. Try not to go on a Friday, as some places dress casually on Friday.
Also check to see if women are wearing hose and see what their jewelry and accessories are like.;
, You may also be able to find out what employees wear by looking at social media. If the company posts pictures, you can get an idea of what everyone is wearing in the office.

, It doesn't hurt to just ask what type of clothing is appropriate for that company. When you get an email about coming in for an interview, add a line in your reply.You can say something along the lines of ""Would you please give me advice on what one typically wears for an interview at your company?"", The company is part of a certain industry, and that industry will have certain standards of dress. For instance, librarians are going to dress differently than a financial corporation. Nonetheless, even within the industry, you'll see some variation by region.Really think about the job you're going to be doing. As a nurse, for instance, you may not want to go into an interview in high heels, as that may show you're not ready for a job where you're on your feet a good deal.
Showing your piercings or tattoos may be appropriate if you're going up for a job in the world of alternative art or one at a tattoo or piercing parlor, but you may want to hide both if you're applying as a teacher.

, Once you've observed what women at the company are wearing, it's your job to dress a level up or so from what they're wearing. For instance, if they're wearing nice pants or skirts and blouses with hose, you should definitely opt for a suit and hose., When you're unsure, a suit is always a good bet. Whether the suit has a skirt or pants is up to you.However, more conservative companies may prefer a skirt.Pick a suit that fits you well and isn't too flashy. Stick to darker colors.High-end brands will get you noticed, but they aren't strictly necessary. Buy the best quality you can afford, and try supplementing with a name-brand briefcase, handbag, or scarf if you can.For skirt length, knee-length is usually the most appropriate. If you wear something longer, it shouldn't puff or flow.

, Stick to neutral colors, such as white, beige, gray, or black. A button-down shirt or blouse is generally best.However, you can also wear a shell or a knit top underneath a suit, as long as it is well-made and professional-looking.

, If the place you're applying to is more casual, you may get away without wearing a suit. However, you should still wear something classy and sophisticated. For instance, a dark sweater and tailored pants is a good pairing.Nonetheless, if you wear a shirt, make sure it is button-down with a collar.You should still stick with dark colors and high quality materials. You don't have to purchase a high-end brand, but you should try to purchase material of quality that will last. Shy away from anything too flashy, including loud patterns.
Also, pay attention to details. Make sure you don't have any loose threads hanging down. Check for stains and holes while putting your outfit together, and don't forget to use a lint roller, especially if you live with pets.

, Some places will expect you to wear hose no matter what the weather. Other places won't care as much. If you're not sure about your company, it's best to err on the side of caution and wear the hose., Even if the company is casual, you shouldn't wear jeans to an interview. Dressing up shows you are serious about the job, and you want to show you are a professional, even if you dress more casually in your day-to-day job.

, Before you go in, you need to make sure your outfit is clean and free of wrinkles. Check on it a week before the interview to see if you need to take it to the cleaners.

, A mid-heel pump is a classic choice. Don't pick something you can't walk in. If you don't like heels, stick to something low and basic.Also, don't forget to take your industry in consideration when picking the shoe. In the fashion industry, you may want to choose a glamorous high heel, while as a teacher, a basic flat is probably fine.

, Keep it simple. For instance, a small necklace and a pair of smallish earrings. In addition, don't wear too many rings.You also want to skip other piercings besides a regular pair of earrings. Most companies frown upon other types of piercings.

, Like your jewelry, you want to keep your makeup simple. Go for a more natural look, and don't go overboard on designs or colors.Pick a natural, neutral concealer to hide flaws, followed by a neutral powder to help take care of shininess. Use blush that goes with your complexion; usually warm pink or peach is a good choice.For your eyes, a light brown or one slightly darker than your skin tone can add dimension without looking like you're wearing eye shadow. You can use eye liner, but try light gray and just lightly dot it on your upper eyelid.Finally, choose a lipstick or lip tint that is basically the same color as your lips.Keep all of it light. Basically, you want to look like you're not actually wearing makeup, but you want to even out your skin tone and add a bit of color., If you have important papers to carry, don't forget to add a professional-looking briefcase. Use a dark color, and try to pick one that's more modern. Leather is always a nice choice.

"
"
Be formal (no matter what the regular dress code is at the job).,
Choose a solid white or blue shirt.,
Wear a tie in a dark, conservative color (never pink).,
Wear a belt or suspenders, but never both at the same time.,
Show off your shoes.,
Wear solid, vertically ribbed socks in black or grey.",How to Dress for an Interview as a Man," The only exceptions to this are if you are interviewing somewhere that they tell you specifically what to wear for your own safety (such as at a factory). For most interviews, a suit is the appropriate attire. A blue suit works the best and it gives you a lot of versatility in terms of shirt and tie choice. Light or dark gray are also good conservative choices. A three button suit will look good on almost anyone, while a 2 button will give a slightly taller/slimmer appearance.;
, You don't want to look too flashy with a brightly colored shirt, and striped (and especially patterned) shirts are a little less formal. A straight collar is also more formal than a button down. Choose one with a medium spread. (If you have a particularly large neck, a wider collar may look better.)

, Stick to solids, rep (diagonal striped) or small patterned ties. A red tie will give the friendly politician look, while blue ties give a more serious FBI agent look. Both are acceptable.

, It’s redundant. If you're a suspenders kind of guy, get buttons sewed into your trousers and wear suspenders that button on, not the cheap clip-on kind. They will make you look cheap.

, A pair of black oxfords or cap-toed oxfords is the best choice. Get ones that don't have super thick soles so they won’t look like boots.

, Get socks that are long enough to cover your legs when you sit down in your suit.

Identify your objective as a job seeker.,
Look for an agency that is specialized in your field.,
Choose the size that suits your needs.,
Decide whether you seek temporary or permanent employment.,
Find an agency that can meet your salary requirements.,
Take location into account.",How to Choose a Recruitment Agency1," You might be in need of temporary work in between performing tours or looking for a full-time, permanent job as a graphic designer. Clarity about your professional needs will assist you in choosing the best recruitment agency.To further clarify your objective, write down a one-sentence statement about what you are looking for and keep this statement handy as you begin your search so that you don’t lose focus. Try to make it specific. For example, “I am looking for a recruitment agency that can help me to find an immediate opening for temporary, part-time office work that pays a minimum of $12/hour.”;
, Certain recruitment agencies are more geared towards certain professions, while others are more generalized. If you are seeking a job in information technology, one agency might have more potential employers than another. Also, certain skills are transferrable to a number of jobs, so your computer skills might also allow you to branch out to data entry if you are open to this. Decide whether you want a specific position or are willing to work in any area for which you are qualified.If you aren’t sure exactly what job position you desire, start by using a more general recruitment agency that works with a wide variety of industries. To find this, you can search online or call up a few agencies to ask about their specialties.
Consider the recruiter's knowledge about your specialized skills. If speaking to a software engineering search firm, for example, the recruiter must be familiar enough with programming terminology and tools to adequately promote your services to a prospective employer.

, There are a wide variety of recruitment agencies, some with only a few employees and some with thousands. The advantage to a larger agency is that they are often well-established and have a solid reputation. The advantage to a smaller agency is that they are often more specialized and can understand specific expectations and trends within your industry. It simply depends what you are looking for., Some recruitment agencies are strictly temp agencies, while others include permanent positions. Even temp agencies often offer jobs that can turn permanent. If your hope is to enter a company on a temporary assignment that turns permanent, ask the agency for its success rate in this regard. Companies typically are required to buy out the contract in this case. An agency with many temporary to permanent placements is likely doing a good job of matching people to jobs.Recruitment agencies that place permanent employees can help you to market your resume and negotiate your salary. They can help you find jobs that aren’t posted elsewhere.

, Some agencies excel in placing executive level positions, while others tend more towards working class positions. Based on your previous experience, skill set, and industry, determine how much is a reasonable amount for you to make. Other factors to consider are whether you have a college degree and the amount of time you have been working in a specific field. Both of these will help you to earn more. You can look online to compare average salaries in your field. This will help your agency to narrow down the search and will clarify whether or not they are able to help you.Recruitment agencies typically offer a designated rate of pay to employees and charge a markup to the client. To ensure that you are not shortchanged in this process, become familiar with the market value for your services.
Take into account any benefits you need as well. Temp and part-time positions often do not include these, but permanent, full-time positions often will.
Look at the salary you made at your previous position as well. Are you looking for a substantial increase or do you feel you have been fairly compensated? If you desire a larger salary, make sure it is justified based on the current market value of your job. Recruitment agents aren’t magicians!

, You should decide ahead of time whether you are willing to relocate for a good job or are only willing to search locally. This will help to narrow down your search and eliminate any agencies that service areas where you are not willing to work.


If you know you want to work locally, try to find an agency that is locally based and start there. They will be a good resource for offerings in your area.

Choose the agency that fits your needs.",How to Choose a Recruitment Agency2," Look online to find recruitment agencies. Make sure to include your location and industry if you want a specialized agency. Do a quick search for something such as “recruitment agency in Los Angeles for IT jobs.” Some recruitment agencies also advertise specific positions in job ads, so be on the lookout for those as well.Alternately, you can search for recruitment agencies on an online map to see their location. Simply go to an online map of your choice such as google or apple and look for recruitment agencies in your area.

, If you know someone who has been successfully placed by a recruitment agency, this is a good starting point. If you learn from someone else’s experience, you can have a smoother and more successful search., Although you likely will not register with each employment agency, calling and speaking to recruiters will give you a feel for each agency's communication styles, placement services and pay structure. It is a great way to see if their services will meet your needs. The more that you compare, the better idea you will have of what’s out there.Ask about the availability of open positions. Listen for the details in the recruiter's response. An agency that has a specific position matching your qualifications is worth pursuing immediately. Recruitment agencies that interview large numbers of candidates in the event of a future possibility are less likely to find you a job right away., Before working with an agency, you need a clear understanding of these processes. You should know what is involved in registration and how long it will take. You should know what potential employers they will be able to connect you with and what kind of salary to expect. They should also give you a timeframe for the hiring process and an explanation of how they will market your skills to prospective employers. You should have a clear understanding of what the agency will do to place you in a job and what your role in this will be. By finding a recruitment process that you feel comfortable with, you will save yourself trouble down the road.To learn this information, you can look on their website or give them a call, but it is preferable to sit down one-on-one with someone from the agency. Make sure that they are willing to answer your questions and that they have answers to your questions. This will help to make sure that they are organized and willing to assist you.

, To find out information, simply call or set up a meeting with them. You could say something like, “I am a job seeker and I was hoping to talk to someone about your agency. I have a few questions.” They will connect you with someone who can help. Have your questions ready ahead of time.


You can ask things such as: “How large is your agency?” “What is your success rate in placing employees?” “Do you specialize in any industries?” “Do you have any positions currently available?” “Are there any fees involved?” “Do you help build and market resumes?” “Do you place temporary or permanent positions?”
Write down their answers so that you remember and can refer back to this information as you continue your search. After talking with several agencies, you might struggle to remember which said what.

, Some agencies will revise your resume, offer free software training or coach you for interviews. Find out if these services exist before registering with an agency. If there are any services that you know you need, such as editing your resume, make sure they are willing to help with this., It is important that they are not involved in any kind of fraud. Agencies should never offer to fabricate letters of recommendation or credentials. Agencies in the UK should be affiliated with the REC, The Recruitment and Employment Confederation. In the US, agencies might be affiliated with various universities, although there are not government sanctioned recruitment agencies. Look for agencies that have been around for at least two years.Ask around among your business colleagues to find out what they know about agencies. They might have worked with one before and had a positive experience.

, Recruitment agencies that charge fees, are uninformed, or make grand promises are likely problematic. Since agencies generally pay you directly and charge a markup to the employer, you should not be paying any fees. If an agency isn’t able to answer your questions, they likely will not be able to help with your job search. If an agency makes overly grand promises, like “I promise you will be making six figures here” when you’ve only been paid minimum wage, they are being dishonest. Pay close attention to what they say and make note of any red flags., After thoroughly researching and interviewing agencies, there should be at least one or two that seem like good options. Choose the one that best fits your needs, and you can use multiple agencies as well. Just be sure to inform them as soon as you have been placed in a job so that they are no longer looking on your behalf.

Shop around for prices.,
Find out about their selection process.,
Inquire about their retention rate.",How to Choose a Recruitment Agency3," Your goal may be to hire temporary, entry-level administrative staff to cover for employees when they are out sick or on vacation. Alternatively, you might be in need of a highly skilled Web developer to help you launch your start-up product. Look for a recruitment agency that meets these requirements., Some staffing firms focus primarily on filling temporary administrative and accounting assignments. Other agencies place highly skilled professionals in short- or long-term contracts in industries like engineering and marketing. Executive search firms specialize in the recruitment and placement of corporate executives., An online search using terms like ""staffing agency,"" ""temporary staffing"" and ""employment agency,"" along with your industry and geographic location, will lead you to firms in your area. A great way to find an agency is to ask around., Gather information about their specialties, reputation and policies. Start by looking at many different ones and decide what you like about each one to narrow down your search.Review the staffing agency's client list. Visit the recruitment agency's website or call the agency to ask for a client list. A long history of serving reputable companies is generally a sign of a high-quality agency.
Ask for agency references. Call companies that use the services of the agency to inquire about its reliability, professionalism, communication habits and other questions relevant to your industry.

, A recruiter's lack of familiarity with your industry, excessive focus on agency profits, rushed communications and empty promises are reasons to avoid specific staffing agencies. On the other hand, if a recruiter is well-informed, takes the time to answer your questions, and has data to back their claims, they will be a much better choice., An agency that promises personnel at a price below market value might not necessarily be the best choice if it's not attracting high-quality personnel. On the other hand, a high-priced agency might be paying workers very little and charging an excessive markup. Investigate these issues before making a decision.Fees can vary from 8-25%. This depends on the agency and the salary. Find out this information ahead of time so that you know what to expect.

, Do they have a rigorous screening process? Will they be sending you lots of resumes? Ideally, they will do the hard work for you by carefully screening a wide variety of applicants from many sources and only sending the most qualified resumes to you. Find out exactly how many resumes you will have to sort through, what their application process entails, and what information they gather on applicants. Look for an agency that will do the hard work for you., A good recruitment agency should be able to place employees that will last in their position. It is both expensive and a waste of time to hire employees that leave the job quickly. If you will pay a fee to the agency for each employee, see if they offer a rebate should the employee leave."

Start with pants.,
Match your suit jacket to your pants.,
Choose a solid white or blue shirt.,
Wear a tie in a dark, conservative color.,
Make sure that the tie you wear complements the color of your suit.,
Wear either a belt or suspenders, but never both at the same time.,
Pay attention to shoes and socks.,
Don't be zealous with the cologne.",How to Dress for an Interview1," A pair of slacks is great, especially if they match your suit jacket. Chinos are also acceptable, but a two-piece suit is preferable, so try to have your slacks match your jacket.A dark color, like a blue, grey, or black, is probably your best bet as it looks flattering on everyone and makes you seem more professional.


No jeans. Jeans, however tailored or designed, are not suitable for a job interview. Do not wear them, because the company that is interested in hiring you will not take you seriously and think that you aren't interested.
No loud prints. Stick with simple patterns.
Make sure your pants are tailored. You want them to be form-fitting without being revealing. No overly baggy pants allowed.;
, Because the norm is a matching two-piece, you want to try to complement your pants with your suit jacket. If you can find a matching two-piece, that will leave the best impression.


Again, dark colors and simple patterns are the norm here. A tailored suit jacket to go along with your tailored pants is what you're after.
A blue blazer is acceptable in most cases if you cannot find a suit jacket to match your pants.

, You don't want to look too flashy with a brightly colored shirt, and striped (and especially patterned) shirts are a little less formal. A starched white or blue shirt is perfectly acceptable, even if it seems a little bit plain.


Wear long-sleeve shirts, even in summer. It may be a bit uncomfortable, but long-sleeve is what's expected in a traditional workplace.
A straight collar is also more formal than a button down, but button downs will work in a pinch. Choose one with a medium spread. If you have a particularly large neck, a wider collar may look better.

, Stick to solids, diagonal stripes, or small patterned ties. A red tie may give a friendly politician look, while a blue tie may give a more serious FBI agent look. Both are acceptable.

, Most ties will look great with a dark-colored suit, so don't worry too much about it.

Stay away from neons and pastels.
Bow ties are not acceptable for formal interview attire. Always stick with a regular neck tie.

, It’s redundant. If you're a suspenders kind of guy, get buttons sewed into your trousers and wear suspenders that button on, not the cheap clip-on kind.

, Your shoes and socks may not be the focal point of your outfit, but they're important nonetheless. Choose dark, polished shoes, black or brown, stringed or loafers and dark socks or match them to either your shoes, pants, dress shirt or tie. Make sure they are knee length, as you don't want any skin to show when you sit down and your pants ride up. Also pay attention to their texture, they should be dress socks, not sport socks.


A pair of black oxfords or cap-toed oxfords is a good choice of footwear. Get ones that don't have super thick soles so they won’t look like boots. Boat shoes are not acceptable for business formal.

, In fact, cologne is not necessary if you shower and smell good as it is. Having no smell at all is preferable to having an off-putting smell. If you feel like you absolutely need to spray on the cologne, keep it light and cap it at one or two sprays at most.

Pay attention to your grooming as well as your clothing.",How to Dress for a Project Management Job," Many companies provide descriptions of company dress codes. They may specify that work is casual, business casual or business.;
, They will set the tone for how you should dress. It is common for bosses to dress slightly more formally than their employees, so you may decide to tone down a few details.

, If you are applying for a project management position, it is always better to overdress than under dress. Take extra time to groom yourself and wear a suit.


If you believe the company values personal style, then use jewelry, bags, scarves, shirts or ties to express yourself. It is better to be safe in a suit than to take chances with other types of clothing.

, Upon reading your employee manual, you should be able to determine if you are required to wear coveralls, hard hats or other safety equipment. Maintain this equipment so it is always in good condition and available for use on a construction site.

, Women should avoid wearing high stiletto heels, especially if they are visiting construction sites. Men should wear leather shoes that can be cleaned and treated for scuffs fairly easily.

, Each color says something about you.


Navy blue and gray are popular suit and pant colors. They convey authority, while still showing style. Keep these colors on hand.
Black is the color of authority. If you want to be a commanding presence, then choose black for meetings. However, black can show construction dust more easily than other colors.
Wear khaki and other neutral colors on construction sites. Pressed khakis or suits in shades of tan or brown are very practical. They are better for a work site than a dedicated office job.
Clean, crisp white shirts or blouses maintain professionalism. You can wear shirts of almost any color, but you should ensure they fit well, are clean and are freshly pressed.
Red is a color of style and some authority. If you want to get noticed, wear accent pieces, such as a shirt, scarf, or coat in red.

, A button-up shirt fits nicely below a thin v-neck sweater. Dry clean sweaters after wearing 5 times or when it is visibly dirty.

,


Buy a high-quality pen to carry at all times. A beautiful pen can convey success.
Own a nice pair of sunglasses and a quality watch. These items are both practical and distinguishable. Remove sunglasses when you go indoors, instead of placing them on your head.
Wear high-quality belts and/or handbags. Try to buy quality, classic pieces, instead of those that are trendy and bright.

, Never go to work with wet hair, clean and file your nails and wear light makeup. As a courtesy to others, never wear strong perfume, cologne, or aftershave.

Stick with either a skirt suit or a pant suit.,
Dress with a blouse or top that is subtly patterned or solid.,
Choose close-toed shoes that are no taller than 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm).,
Wear stockings or pantyhose that's work-appropriate.,
Go subtle with your makeup.,
Avoid perfumes if possible.,
Be careful with your accessories.",How to Dress for an Interview2," Women have a few more options for dressing business formal than men do, but they also need to be more careful when they dress.


Skirt suits: stay with a dark color, a knee-length skirt, and a tailored jacket.
Pant suits: stay with a dark color, as well as tailored pants and a jacket.

, Transparent or see-through blouses are big no-nos. Wear a shirt or camisole underneath if needed. Stick with cotton, silk, or microfiber material.Material that can breathe well, like cotton, may feel the most comfortable in a potentially stressful situation.

, Your job interview is enough of a balancing act as it is, so don't make your shoes into one as well. Shoes that are any taller than that risk looking unprofessional. Dark shoes are best.

, As long as the stockings/pantyhose is dark, not heavily patterned, and seems like it would be appropriate to wear to work, it's acceptable to pass as business formal. Pantyhose or stockings that might be worn for a night on the town will probably not pass muster, and may be more distracting than is necessary. Do not wear pantyhose or stockings that are damaged in any way, as you will definitely appear as unprofessional. Be sure to check for any damage before you put them on.

, Don't cake on layers and layers of makeup. Dressing business formal is not the same thing as getting dolled up for for Friday night. A little bit of makeup is probably better than none at all, but too much isn't. Conservative is best.

, As for men, fragrances are best avoided altogether. It can be off-putting for other people who don't share your sense of smell, and it doesn't mingle well with the smell of sweat. If you need to wear perfume, know that a little goes a long way.

, Accessories can be the pride and joy of the female wardrobe. Knowing which accessories to wear — and which not to — may mean the difference between a lasting impression and a passing glance.


Wear a conservative watch. A watch is a good symbol that you're punctual and like to stay on top of things. Make sure that the metal flatters your clothing, as some colors go better with either gold or silver and may clash with the other.
Scarves and jewelry styles can be fickle, so stick with conservative options. If you're interviewing for a position in a creative field, you probably have a little more leeway here than if you were applying for a position, say, as a banker.
Do not carry two large bags to your interview. If you need to carry a purse, make it small, so that when you combine it with a business-like tote bag, it doesn't seem like you are schlepping bags upon bags with you to the interview. In your tote bag, keep a Padfolio with extra copies of your resume.

Dressing up is better than dressing down.,
If in doubt, ask about attire.,
Groom yourself to the best of your ability.,
Make sure the ins and outs of your suit are cared for.,
Carry a port- or padfolio with extra copies of your resume.,
Be aware of the list of don'ts.",How to Dress for an Interview3," Always opt for formal, conservative attire unless your interviewer states otherwise. Dressing nice is a compliment to your interviewer and a sign that you take your profession seriously.It's far preferable, therefore, to be overdressed for your interview than underdressed.


It's no secret that if you dress well, you leave a lasting impression. This may be attributed to the halo effect, introduced by psychologist E. L. Thorndike. The halo effect states that if you're found to possess one desirable (or undesirable) trait, people assume that you possess other desirable traits as well., If there's any doubt in your mind about how you should dress for your interview, don't hesitate to ask the person you're interviewing with or the HR representative. It's a common question, so don't be afraid to ask it. You won't be dinged for wanted to be prepared.

, Shower beforehand, and make sure that the following are groomed and look presentable:


Fingernails are short or manicured, without dirt or grime under them
Hair should be neat and clean, without excessive gel or styling
Facial hair, if you have it, should be groomed and in-control
Teeth should be cleaned and free of any food; mouth should be fresh smelling

, You don't want any loose buttons, loose fabrics, excessive lint or pet hair on your clothes. Give your clothes a good once-over with a lint roller before your put them on; better yet, take your clothes to a dry cleaner before you interview and let them clean up any problem areas.

, This is a time-honored trick of professionals the world over. Having extra copies of your resume on hand signals to your potential employer that you're prepared, forward-looking, and confident. Don't forget this accessory.

, The following things should be avoided during a job interview:


Do not chew gum
Do not wear sunglasses or keep them dangled on your head
Do not leave your shirts untucked
If it's ripped, don't wear it

Backup a digital copy of your work portfolio to keep it constantly updated.",How to Create a Career Portfolio," Depending on your career/job outlook, your career portfolio will take on different looks.


How will you use this portfolio? Will you take it with you to show in an interview? Will you send it with your resume or job application?;
, This is a very important step because, if you don't already know it, presentation is everything.

, What have you done? Can you get screen shots of it? Start with that and get screen shots and put them into a document and save it. Then print it out, preferably in color, to put in your notebook that you will be assembling.

, You want your potential employer to believe that you are the answer to their employment dilemma. The meticulous attention to detail that it takes to create a good portfolio shows them initiative and preparation.

, They should be the very best examples of your work.

, If you're looking in multiple fields, have multiple portfolios.

, Don't expect a prospective employer to sit there and read a fourteen page report, even if you did a great job.


Prefer visual examples of your work if they are available. Drawings, photos, diagrams, etc. won't compete for attention with you. Consider making screencasts.
Use smaller samples of larger works if they will take less time to explain. If someone is really interested in knowing more, you can send more later. A smaller piece can still be a great talking point.
If a written work is the best way to showcase your skills, you can send it, or portion of it, ahead to be read in advance. Alternatively, have it with you and describe it, summarizing what's inside and why it was important and valuable.

, Look at what the job description is seeking and select your work samples based on that.

, This way you'll stay always prepared for urgent interviews and will be able to update your portfolio quickly.

Sell yourself.,
Don't badmouth.,
Pivot to the present.,
Keep it simple.",How to Discuss a Former Employer in an Interview1," Questions about your previous job are more about you than about your former employer. The interviewer is trying to gauge your skills and professionalism, not the virtues or vices of your previous boss. The goal of any answer about a previous job should be to make yourself look good, not your previous position look bad.


Answer questions about previous jobs by discussing your accomplishments in those positions. Consider key phrases from the description of the job for which your interviewing, such as ""strong supervisory skills,"" and consider how you can frame your experience in your previous job to emphasize that you have what it takes for the new position.
Whenever possible, go beyond buzzwords and give examples from your previous job. Pivot from a generality, such as ""self motivated,"" by saying, ""I know you've probably heard that before, so let me give you an example."" Then have a brief two-to-four sentence anecdote from a previous job prepared that demonstrates your self motivation.;
, It's not a good idea to be negative in a job interview about anything, and that's especially true when it comes to discussing your former employer. An interviewee badmouthing his or her former employer raises a red flag in most Human Resource departments.You should cast even the worst previous employment experience in a positive light.


Negativity raises questions about you, not your previous job. If you say bad things about your old boss, the interviewer will wonder: 1) what the other side of the story is, 2) whether you will be a ""whiner"" or a ""complainer"" in your new job if they hire you, and 3) if you will speak ill of them if you eventually leave their employ. Ultimately, speaking ill of your previous employer just makes you look unprofessional.
No mater how much you disliked your old job, find something positive to say about it. Think of the office environment, training seminars, break room, flexible hours or anything else that appealed to you. Make the positive aspects of your old job the focus of your answer.

, The one time that it's okay to say something less-than-positive about your previous position is in comparing your fit for your previous job with your fit for the one for which you're interviewing.


If, for instance, you were promised an exciting, challenging position at your last job and instead found yourself in a boring, repetitive desk job, you may want to mention this to the interviewer. Make sure that your description of your old job draws out the distinctions between that position and the one for which you're interviewing.
More generally, it's okay to tell an interviewer your old job was a bad fit because you wanted more of a challenge, wanted more or different responsibilities, or wanted more opportunities for advancement. The key is to pick the phrase that best describes the job for which you're interviewing.
Finish your comment with a phrase like “I’m excited about this opportunity because…” that will allow you to further outline the opportunities in the new position that were lacking in your past position and why you're excited for the new challenge., Brevity is often the best way to avoid negative or unprofessional answers. Answer the questions you are asked, but be careful not to volunteer too much information. This tip should be applied to all aspects of your interview, but especially to any references to your previous employer.The shortest answer is usually the best answer.Leave emotion out of your answers. No matter how personable the interviewer may seem, a job interview is a business interaction, and your words should reflect that fact."
"
Don't be a quitter.,
Use generalities strategically.,
Steer clear of office politics.,
Don't be afraid of fire.",How to Discuss a Former Employer in an Interview2," ""Quit"" is ""four-letter word"" to most employers. Instead, use more neutral language and emphasize the positive reasons you left a job.For example, when describing a transition from one job to another, simply say ""I joined another company."" Never give unnecessary detail unless asked. Saying too much might prompt the interviewer to follow-up with uncomfortable questions that would be better left alone.

, If prompted for more detail, explain your departure from a previous job in general terms that don't cast you or your old boss in a bad light.


For example, saying you left a job to spend time with family or reevaluate your priorities before choosing your next career move are acceptable reasons for leaving a job in the eyes of most interviewers.Only offer more detail if it can cast you in a positive light. For example, you might want to talk about how a change in culture or management at your old job caused you to leave if it allows you to highlight how you're a good fit for your new job. You might say, ""After some management changes, it became clear that the company was moving in a direction that didn't align with my strengths and goals."" Continue by talking about your strengths and goals and how they align with the position for which you're interviewing., If personal conflicts in the workplace caused you to leave you previous job, don’t discuss them. Your new employer wants to know you can be a professional.The interviewer doesn't want to hear why you didn't get along with your old boss or coworkers. Instead, if a personality conflict with your old boss was at the heart of your departure, simply say you had “differing professional attitudes.""

, People get fired everyday. Employers understand its part of business. If you were fired from your previous job, be honest and try to frame the reason in as positive terms as possible.


If a force beyond your control — reorganization, change in management, merger, downsizing, recession, etc. — caused you to be let go, be sure to explain that as simply and straightforwardly as possible.If you were fired because of your performance, minimize your discussion of it. Unless the reason was criminal, it will not appear on your background check. When in doubt, say that you “were not a good fit” for your previous position, then explain why you’re a great fit for the new position.Always emphasize your positive attitude in response to the setback.In many cases, you can even turn the reason you were fired from your previous job into a discussion of the skills you developed. Make yourself, not your old employer, the focus of your response. For example, if you couldn't work the inconsistent hours that your previous job demanded, say so. Then add that the situation helped you improve your time management and explain how what you've learned will help you succeed in the position for which you're interviewing. "
"
Prepare your responses.,
Write a script.,
Select your references strategically.,
Contact your references.",How to Discuss a Former Employer in an Interview3," Always plan exactly what you will say about each of your former employers if asked by the interviewer. Never let yourself get caught off guard, resulting in a potentially inappropriate or insufficient answer.


Begin by taking notes on all of your previous jobs. Think back and analyze each carefully. Think about your responsibilities and the skills you developed, along with any awards, accolades or recognition you may have received.

, Use notes on your previous jobs to develop a response ""script"" for each job. The goal of this script should be to clearly and concisely convey what you gained from and accomplished in the position in a few sentences. Practice your job scripts until you have them memorized.If possible, have a friend or family member pose as your interviewer, rehearse your response scripts with him or her, and ask for feedback.If no one is available to rehearse with, you can record yourself. Try to put yourself in the shoes of an interviewer while you listen to your answers. What can be improved?

, Don’t list someone who won’t say good things about you. If you're not sure what a former employer will say about you, ask. It's better to have an awkward conversation with a former boss than a bad reference.


Pick the boss that liked you best. In most companies, there are several supervisors who can legitimately be called your “boss.” Whenever possible, choose the one with whom you left on good terms.
Even if you’re forced to list a boss with whom you parted on less-than-positive terms, you should be reassured to know that most bosses are not anxious to badmouth you. Not only do employers fear defamation lawsuits, they also want to keep the interaction professional in order not to harm their own reputation with their peers in the industry. , You should always alert a former employer that he or she is listed as your reference. Contacting your references as soon as possible in the job application process will allow for any potential delays in their response and give them time to think about what they will say if contacted by your potential employer's HR department.


Giving your references advanced notice works to you advantage, too. If a former employer is caught off guard by by a phone call from your interviewer, he or she may unintentionally provide a reference that isn't as positive as it would have been if he or she was prepared.

Come up with a salary range.",How to Discuss Salary During an Interview," Some employers might try to discuss salary at the start of the interview. If possible, you should delay any discussion of salary until you’ve made your case for why you should be hired. Deflect by saying something like, “Let’s talk numbers later. I need to hear more about the job first.”Of course, you might have had to put a salary down on your application. Remember that the number you proposed is simply a starting point for discussion. Based on what you learn about the job, you can increase the amount you ask for.;
, You can’t really discuss salary until you understand in detail the job requirements. Often, employers publish job descriptions that are vague or confusing. Accordingly, use the interview to figure out exactly what the employer wants you to do in the job.


Request a job description and spend several minutes looking it over.Make sure the responsibilities align with your expectations.
Based on the interview, you might realize that your proposed salary is much too low. For example, the job might be more complex than you had anticipated. In that situation, you'll need to adjust your salary expectations.

, Ideally, delay negotiations until you know you have the job. This will put you in the strongest bargaining position. Be sure to ask, “Are you offering me the job?”


Often, it won't be possible to have a job offer in hand before negotiating. If the employer is on a very tight budget, they might try to lock you into a salary range before even offering you the job.

, Not every employer is willing to negotiate salary, so ask. If they say “no,” then you can move on to negotiate fringe benefits, which can increase your overall compensation.Depending on your job, you might also negotiate a signing bonus, performance bonus, or commission. For example, sales people are often compensated in these ways.

, Your current salary might be the starting point for discussion. You can expect the employer to ask something like, “So how much do you make in your current position?” You must always answer honestly, but you can offer an approximation: ""I make mid-thirties.""


If you lie, you’ll destroy your credibility. An employer can do a little research to find out what you currently make.
If your current salary is low, you can explain why. For example, “I only make $24,000, but that’s because I needed to get my foot in the door somewhere. Since starting a year ago, I’ve taken on high-level work to gain experience, so I think I’m underpaid right now.”If your current salary is higher than what the new job can offer, you need to explain why you are seeking to switch.

, When negotiating, some employers might want you to throw out the first number. This can work to your advantage. Research has shown that the first number serves as an “anchor” for the negotiation, and that it is difficult to negotiate away from the anchor.Accordingly, you should state the high end of your salary range.


Experts recommend using a precise number, such as $38,550 instead of $39,000. By using a precise number, the person on the other side will assume that you have done considerable research.However, sometimes it’s better not to throw out the first number, especially if you don’t have sufficient information. For example, the employer might not have shared a job description with you. In that situation, you can say, “You have a better idea of your compensation policy. What’s a fair salary?”

, If the employer comes in low with their counter-offer, you should reject it and make your own counter-offer. However, you also need to give reasons justifying why.


For example, you can say, “I’m sorry, that’s a little low. I think based on my twelve years of experience in the field, I’m worth more.”
If the employer proposed the first number, ask why. For example, you could say, “That sounds a little low. Can I see a job description? I might not understand what you are looking for.”
Only move down from your first number in $500-1,000 increments. If your first number is $40,000 and the employer offers $35,000, don’t move immediately to $37,500. Instead, propose $39,000.

, Fringe benefits such as health insurance and a company retirement plan can increase your overall compensation substantially. Accordingly, you might want to focus on negotiating fringe benefits if the employer cannot meet your salary expectations.Also negotiate non-cash benefits, such as flexible time to work from home or more personal/vacation days.

, You shouldn’t immediately accept a salary offer, even if you are generally pleased with it. Instead, ask for a few days to think it over, which will make you appear thoughtful.Simply say, “Thanks for the offer. Can I have a few days to think this over?”
Don’t say, “I need to talk to my spouse.” This will make you appear indecisive.

, After you accept, ask for the offer and starting salary in writing.An employer should have no problem giving you a letter laying out when you’ll start and the salary.


Never rely on verbal promises, since they are easy to break. You’ll have no tangible proof that there was even a job offer.

, There are many online salary calculators you can use to find the market rate for the job you are seeking. Remember to find the market salary for your city or state. Salaries differ significantly depending on where you live, so you want the market rate for the area where the job is located. The following salary calculators are helpful:glassdoor.com
indeed.com
salary.com
payscale.com

, Governments make their salary data public, so you can also search there.Find an equivalent job in a university or city/state government. You might not be able to find an exact match, but you can look for a job that is similar.


For example, you might be interviewing in a small town to be a case manager. You can’t find salary information, but you see that a nearby community college pays project managers about $30,000. You can use this as a rough estimate for determining the market rate.

, Some professional organizations distribute salary surveys to businesses in their industry.This data can be very helpful when deciding how much to ask for a salary. Research professional organizations and check whether they have any recent survey data.


Some survey data is posted online. However, other data might be kept private and shared only with members of the professional organization.

, Find other people who currently work in the job you are interviewing for. You can schedule a lunch or meet with them at a professional organization. Although you might be embarrassed to ask how much they make, you can ask in a roundabout way.


For example, you can discuss the market rate based on your research and ask, “Does that sound about right?”, The market rate is just an average, and you can ask for more if you have more education than the position requires. However, if you have less, then you might need to accept a salary on the lower end of the market rate.Also consider any credentials you have. For example, you might have earned a certification which is recognized in your industry.

, The more experience you have, the more efficiently you can do a job, which should result in a higher salary.Look at the market rate and then increase or decrease it based on your experience.


Make sure your experience is relevant. If you worked six years as a paralegal, that’s not relevant experience when you negotiate a salary as an attorney.
Some salary calculators will ask for how many years experience you have.

, It’s better to have a range in mind than a single number.The range should include the bare minimum you are willing to work for, as well as the most you think you can get. The midpoint should be what you think you are worth based on your research.


For example, you might be an experienced administrative assistant interviewing for a job in Buffalo, New York. Based on your research, you see the average salary is $13.65, which works out to around $28,000 a year.Because you have 10 years’ experience, you might ask for $32,000-$35,000.
In this example, $32,000 is the minimum you’ll take. If the employer can’t offer even that amount, you’ll walk unless the fringe benefits are outstanding.

Inform your contact as to why you were late.Regular traffic issues are not valid excuses. You are expected to know what the traffic is like near the location of your interview.
Major transportation failures, public or personal, may be accepted as valid reasons for being late.
A true emergency, personal or family, may also be an acceptable reason for being late.

The amount of time that you will be late will determine when you should reschedule your interview.

, If you and your contact both agree that rescheduling is the best option, you will have to choose a time that works best. Choosing the new appointment time will depend largely on how late you expect to be and what time the interviewer has available.When rescheduling you may choose another day entirely or move the interview to later that day.
If you expect to be late by more than ten minutes, choose another day for the interview.
Ask your contact if your proposed times work for them. If your suggestions do not work, check with them and work with their availability.

Trust your instincts.,
Use the most appropriate method of communication for your situation.,
Write out your message.,
Decline the interview as soon as possible.",How to Decline a Job Interview," If you are thinking about declining a job interview, then you probably have one or more reasons that are influencing you. Still, it is a good idea to identify those reasons and think about whether or not you really want to decline the interview. Some common reasons for wanting to decline a job interview include:


Receiving a job offer from a different company
Having concerns about the commute, pay, or management
Feeling like the company is not a good fit for you
Hearing bad things about the work environment
Having worked for the company before and not wanting to return;
, If you are on the fence about accepting a job interview, take time to weigh all of the factors that are influencing your decision to accept or decline the interview. One way to determine if a job is a good fit for you is to make a list of pros and cons.To weigh the pros and cons, list all of the potentially positive aspects of working for the company alongside all of the potentially negative aspects. Determine if the pros outweigh the cons. If they do not, then you should probably decline the interview.
Keep in mind that you can often negotiate things like pay, hours, and other aspects of the job that are not quite in line with your needs.

, If after all of your soul-searching, you still think this job is not for you and you want to decline the interview, do it. Chances are that your gut instinct to a company, manager, or position are correct. The only exception would be if your instincts are telling you to decline the interview because you are afraid of being rejected or if you are just nervous about job interviews. In this case, you should push yourself to complete the job interview., If the employer contacted you via email, then you should send your message via email as well. If the employer has contacted you by phone, then you should pick up the phone to deliver your message. Don’t send a fax or letter via snail mail unless you have been contacted by the employer using these methods., Whether you will be sending your message or delivering it over the phone, you should write out your message. Make sure that you include the following elements in your message to decline a job interview offer:


A greeting such as “Dear ____,”
A thank you message such as, “Thank you for offering me the opportunity to learn more about the _______position at your organization.”
A brief explanation of why you are declining the interview, such as “At this time I regret that I must decline because I have accepted a position with a different company.” Just make sure that you do not provide a reason that might be considered rude or ungracious. If you can’t think of a nice way to phrase your reason, don’t provide a reason at all.
A request for confirmation of message receipt, such as “Please reply/call back so that I know you have received my message.”
A brief closing message, such as “Thank you for your time and consideration.”, While you may not want the position, there are likely many other eligible candidates who will be thrilled to take your place. Make sure that you respond to the company in a timely fashion so that the recruiter can arrange for someone else to interview in your stead.


It is important to be prompt with your response if you plan to decline an interview. Your prompt response will be appreciated by the recruiter, which will help you to maintain a good reputation with the company.

Reschedule your job interview only as a last resort.,
Contact your interviewer with as much notice as possible.,
Speak with your interviewer directly, do not leave a message.,
Apologize for the inconvenience.,
Send a follow up note to your interviewer.",How to Cancel a Job Interview1," Before reschedule your job interview, try to rearrange your other plans instead. Your job interview serves as a first impression for a potential employer, so rescheduling may come off as unprofessional. If possible, rearrange the other parts of your schedule before rescheduling your job interview.;
, Rescheduling a job interview can be a huge inconvenience to everyone involved. Because of this, it's important that you contact your potential employer to reschedule at least 24 hours before your scheduled interview. When you contact your interviewer, give a brief explanation for your need to reschedule. Be as honest as possible. Give your interviewer a few alternative dates that will work for your rescheduled interview.


If you're rescheduling due to another job interview, it's best not to tell your interviewer that. Tell them you've had a work or family conflict come up, and that you'd love to reschedule your interview for another time.
If a life emergency happens and you cannot give 24 hour notice, contact your interviewer as soon as possible to let them know what happened. If it's a real emergency (you were injured, you have a family emergency, etc.), your potential employer should understand.
If you're still interested in the job, express that when you call to cancel. Say something like ""I'm very sorry, but an emergency has come up and I won't be able to make our interview tomorrow. I'm still interested in the position and would be extremely grateful if we could reschedule."", When possible, make direct contact with your potential employer instead of sending an email or leaving a message. Making contact via phone will make you look like a responsible professional. Make an effort to get in touch with your interviewer in numerous ways, and only leave a message or send an email if you cannot reach them via phone.


Never send a text message to reschedule an interview, as it will make you look unprofessional.
If you end up leaving a message or sending an email, ask that your interviewer contact you to confirm they got your message.

, A job interview is normally scheduled around multiple people's schedules. Therefore, cancelling or rescheduling an interview is usually an inconvenience for multiple people. Don't assume that your interviewer's schedule revolves around you, and apologize for causing any inconvenience. Try to be flexible when you ask to reschedule your interview. If your interviewer sees that you are putting in good effort to make this interview work, they will be more likely to reschedule your interview., After you've contacted your interviewer about rescheduling, send them a personal note or email reiterating your apology and your interest in the company. Your interviewer may be frustrated or irritated by you cancelling, so use this note as an opportunity to let them know that you are genuinely sorry and would still like a chance to reschedule an interview.

Give advanced notice for cancelling your interview.,
Be honest about your reasons for cancelling your interview.,
Remain professional to ensure you do not burn bridges.",How to Cancel a Job Interview2," As soon as you know that you need to cancel your job interview, contact your interviewer. Don't waste anyone's time by waiting to cancel your interview. Instead, cancel it as soon as you know that you are no longer interested in interviewing for that position. Your interviewer will appreciate you giving them advanced notice, and you'll look much more professional., Whether you have accepted another job elsewhere, or are simply no longer interested in the job you had scheduled an interview for, let the employer know. The employer should appreciate your honesty, as they can begin looking elsewhere to fill the position they are hiring for.


If you've already accepted another job, call your interviewer and let them know. Say something along the lines of: ""Thank you for inviting me to interview for the position, but I have just accepted an offer elsewhere. I was looking forward to the possibility of working with your company, but am going to have to cancel our interview. Thank you so much for your time!""
If you are cancelling your interview because of negative things you've learned about the company, be a bit more vague when cancelling your interview. Say something like: ""I appreciate you scheduling an interview with me, but I'm going to have to cancel. I've decided to focus my career options elsewhere, but I appreciate your time."", You never know when you'll be in need of another job, or when you'll cross paths with your interviewer (in a professional or personal setting). It is best to remain pleasant and professional when cancelling your interview, as it's never a good idea to burn bridges. Do not be rude when cancelling your interview, and do not disrespect this employer's company. Stick to a simple explanation as to why you are cancelling, and end the conversation.

"
"
Contact the applicant as soon as you realize you need to cancel your interview.,
Tell the applicant if you have filled the position.,
Reschedule your interview as soon as possible.",How to Cancel a Job Interview3," It's professional courtesy to give advanced notice when cancelling or rescheduling an interview. If you wait until the last minute to cancel, it could reflect poorly on your business. If this is a potential employee that you are genuinely interested in hiring, make sure to show a great deal of professionalism. Cancelling an interview last minute may cause them to lose interest in your company.If an emergency comes up, contact the potential employee immediately. Give a brief explanation why you're cancelling and let them know you'll be in touch to reschedule. They should understand if it is a real emergency.

, Some employers do not inform candidates when jobs have been filled, they simply cut off all communication. This is extremely unprofessional and makes for bad business. If you have filled the position that you have been interviewing candidates for, let the candidates know. It's best practice to call candidates and let them know the position has been filled; this is a more personal and less cold method of informing a good candidate that you are not interested in hiring them. You can also send an email, although it's a less personal form of communication., If you are interested in hiring this potential employee, reschedule your interview as soon as possible and give them multiple dates to choose from. Since you interfered with their schedule, you should be flexible when rescheduling your interview. Express to the interviewee that you'd really love to interview them, and ask what you can do to make that happen.


If you are unsure when you'll be able to reschedule, let the interviewee know that you'll be in touch about rescheduling, and contact them in a timely fashion."

Avoid questions about benefits.,
Ask the interviewer for final questions.,
Try correcting any misperceptions.,
Ask about the next step in the process.,
Restate your enthusiasm and suitability for the position.,
Continue your conversation after the interview.,
Follow up.",How to Close the Job Interview," Even if you have already been asked about why you want the job, it’s important to state and restate your interest in the position. Enthusiasm goes a long way. If you show you are enthusiastic about the opportunity, the employer will know that you are worth investing in because you will carry that energy into the job while learning new skills.Harp on specific examples of your work that really interest you. If you can start a conversation with your interviewer about the ins and outs of your job you will look like someone who will be ready for work day one.;
, If you are going for a sales job, an aggressive close might pay off because you need to be forward and outgoing. For instance, you can ask outright, though politely, “So do I have the job?” or even “So when do I start?”


If you are applying for an accounting job, you might want to keep it low-key and show humility: “Thank you so much for the opportunity to interview.”, Instead of simply saying that you’re a good communicator, tell them that you are an incredible basketball player who knows how to take the ball to the hoop, or, in other words, you know how to seal the deal. Give them tidbits of your life that are both impressive and will create a memorable story., It’s important that your questions show you know a little about the company and the work, but that you want to know more. The more interest you show, the more you will receive.You can ask really specific questions about the work you will be doing or broader questions about the people you will be working with such as “How would you describe the work culture here?”

, Ask your interviewer questions that make them imagine you already working for them. For instance, “Imagine I have been working for you for a year and just received a great 1 year review. What did I do right?” This will establish an expectation for yourself, should you get the job, and it will also cause the interviewer to project positive possibilities onto you., Avoid questions like “How much will I be paid?” “When would you like me to start?” “What sort of vacation do employees get?” “Is health insurance provided?” All of these are important questions that you will want to ask at some point, but will detract from your overall goal, which is to seal the deal. You can ask these after you get hired!, If you sense uncertainty on their part, you can ask them questions that will clarify anything that wasn’t made clear about your background, skillset, or references: “Were there any answers I gave that you still have questions about?” Make the most of your time and don’t leave anything unaddressed., Though it can seem a bit bold, one strategy is to ask the interviewer what you’ve done wrong. “Is there anything you see in me that suggests I am not fit for this job?” If they say no, then great! You’ll be on the top of their list. If they do have some concerns, you’ll be able to address them and leave on a better note than you would have otherwise., Find out if there is another round of interviews. Ask when you will hear from them so that you know when to follow up: “So when do you expect to make a decision about the position?”


This would also be a good time to let them know if you have other job opportunities lined up so that you can manage your decisions appropriately, but don’t present this as a way of intimidating your potential employer.

, You’ll want to leave the interviewer with two main impressions: that you are excited to work for them, and that you are totally qualified. The best way to do this is to simply say it.For instance, you can say “I’m really excited to work with you and I believe I’m the right fit for the position because I have the proper managerial experience.” Or “I think my six years in sales has really prepared me for this next step working with your company.”

, When the interview is over, you don’t have to stop talking to the interviewer. Leave a good impression by making small talk. For instance, “So what’s the rest of your day looking like?” Or “Do you have any plans for the weekend?” You want to be friendly throughout the interview, even after it’s officially over., If you don’t already have it, get a point of contact for your interviewer. This relationship is key, and you will want to follow up with the same person who interviewed you. Within 24 hours of your interview, send your interviewer a brief email thanking them for the opportunity and restating your interest in the position.

Be in a good and natural mood.",How to Avoid Interview Mistakes," Generally speaking blue jeans and flip flops are not appropriate dress for an interview. Neither is very short skirts or low cut blouses, but, a three piece suit may not be appropriate, either. What is appropriate depends upon the open position. What you wear when interviewing for a banking position will differ from what's appropriate when interviewing to be an assistant for an up-and-coming fashion designer. A general rule of thumb is to dress as you would when working in that job.;
, Are you dressed appropriately? Is your hair style attractive? Are your fingernails clean and trimmed? If you wear makeup, is it subdued enough for a work setting? Did you stroll into the interview on your cell phone? Also, for younger interviewees, walking into an interview with your mother may prove that you’re not ready to be independent. Make a good first impression and the interview won’t be lost from the beginning.

, This is an absolute must. To be sure you will make it on time, take a ride to the location a day or two before the interview so you know how to get there. Leave the house an hour earlier than you normally would, because traffic jams and bad weather happen at the worst times. Take a few moments to calm your nerves, and, if you like, say a prayer and check yourself in a mirror. When it is time to walk in the door, do so about ten or fifteen minutes before the interview is supposed to start. Never arrive late. If something comes up, such as a traffic accident, call the company as soon as possible to make them aware of the situation.


If you are significantly under stress, you may wrongly read and remember simple things like the time or agreed place, or to charge your cell phone if it is a phone interview. This is a known feature of human psychology. As funny as it may seem, check the time and place at least twice, better still, do this on different dates.

, Professionalism is highly valued. Are you chewing gum, smoking or tapping your pen on your portfolio? Everything you do will be judged in some form or fashion by the interviewer. Omit anything that might exclude you from further consideration as a potential job candidate.

, It's simply rude to leave it on during an interview and even more so to answer a call.

, Remember the phrase, ""Never use two words when one word will do."" Address each person you meet as ""Mr."" or ""Ms."" and articulate your words using proper grammar. Also, keep your answers short and to the point. Talk to communicate a message, not just to fill the quiet spells in the interview. Speak up and out, so that your interviewer doesn’t ask “What did you say?”

, There are few things more disconcerting to an interviewer than a candidate whose responses aren't on point or one who constantly asks to have questions repeated. Stay engaged in the give and take of the conversation. Ask clarifying questions when you need to. Give answers that are on point. Lean slightly forward. Maintain appropriate eye contact. These behaviors indicate you're actively listening.

, The only thing worse than asking poor questions is asking no questions at all. Poor questions focus on what the company can do for you. They include questions about health benefits, salary or paid time off. These questions should wait until after an offer is forthcoming. (This is also in line with effective negotiating tactics.) Good questions ask about what you can do for the company. Questions like ""How do you measure success in this position?"" or ""How would you describe your ideal employee?"" show you 'get it'.

, It is surprising when candidates are unprepared to talk about themselves or their accomplishments. Interview questions seem to catch these people off guard or they give very short answers that don't convey much information. Interviewers interpret this behavior as laziness or disinterest. Take time to review common job interview questions and decide in advance how you will handle them. Practice telling (short) stories about your accomplishments.


Revise some general questions which have been asked many times. You think these are the very simple questions but you might not be able to give the appropriate answer without prior rehearsal, due to nerves or distraction.

, Too many candidates interview with companies they know nothing about. If you can't be bothered to do basic research the interviewer will infer you're not willing to go the extra mile. The bigger the company, the more unforgivable this will be.

, Forgetting to ask how long the previous person was in the role will cause you to lose out on valuable information. You should also find out what priorities would require your immediate attention. This will tell you if everything was left in order, or if you will have to sort out a mountain chaos. It should also tell you how much time the boss will give you to sort out the mess. Try to find out what type of corporate culture you will be entering - what you need to do to progress in the organization. Having received the answer to all these questions, you may decide to politely excuse yourself and head for the exit.

, This is immaterial in a first interview, even in a second. The salary, perks etc. will come onto the table, and the employer will offer these. You should not ask for it. You don't want to leave the impression that you are just in it for the money or the prestige.

, You need to know what happens next. Having this information will help keep you from fretting about an offer and more importantly it will facilitate effective follow-up. Questions such as, ""When do you anticipate making a decision?"" or ""When should I expect to hear from you?"" are completely appropriate.

, Candidate arrogance is a common complaint among interviewers. Candidates too often cross over from confidence to arrogance. There is a fine distinction between the two. Confident people relate to interviewers as equals, while arrogant people are condescending, giving the impression they think they're above other people, either socially or otherwise. Be especially careful about arrogance when you're interviewing with someone younger than you or if you're interviewing for positions that are a step or two down from your last role.


If your nerves cause you to appear arrogant, find a coping mechanism that will allow you to work around that unfortunately appearance.

, It is bad form to bash your former employer. If you speak ill of a former manager, the interviewer will assume you would do the same to him or her. Bad mouthing the company, manager or your former co-workers is always self defeating. You may be tempted to confide when the interviewer feels more like a friend than a decision maker but don't do it! It tells them that you're disloyal, easily discontented and a loose cannon waiting to go off again.

, Examples of unsuitable interviewing behavior include acting disinterested, answering your cell phone, relentless eye contact, not meeting the interviewer's gaze, talking incessantly and being too familiar. Interviewers have certain expectations about how you should act. These expectations fall in line with the rules of common courtesy. Being polite, businesslike, friendly, attentive and appropriate will stand you in good stead.

, There is nothing more heartbreaking than acing the interview only to blow it as you're leaving. This happens more than it should. For example: Just as candidates get to the door one interviewer will casually ask, ""By the way, how did you manage to get time off today?"" It's surprising the number who answer, ""I called in sick."" Likewise beware of casual interactions inside the company's building or facilities. Don't say or do anything that would reflect poorly on you if it were shared with the hiring manager.

, Yes, it sounds like this is just a little too much, but you can never be too careful in an interview. You want to eliminate anything and everything that might keep you from being considered for employment. Eliminate as many of the possible problem areas as you can so that the employer focuses on what you bring to the table in terms of qualifications. Also, don’t lie about something just because it looks bad. Your interviewer may consider you dishonest. If you honestly ‘forget’ to mention something, then that is a different story…

, Some interviewers dislike the process, and may say so, and they might be swayed more by a friendly attitude. Furthermore, if you are lucky enough to have an informal and friendly interviewer, you will feel more relaxed and find it easier to give perfect answers. Just don't get so comfortable you forget why you're there!

, More than likely, your resume is what netted you the interview. However, being prepared with extra copies will allow you to make sure the interviewer has it to refer to. References do not get checked until a company is seriously interested in a candidate. If you are asked for your references in an interview, great! Make sure you're able to supply them upon request.

, Smile, show interest and enthusiasm. Simply be positive in your body language and your speech. If you ooze positive energy it will rub off on everyone around you.

Check with the norms in your industry, and if you are unsure, opt for something more conservative and neutral.;
, Make sure your clothes are free from stains, missing buttons, loose seams, and wrinkles. You don’t want to show up to your interview looking slovenly.

, Make sure you have all the parts to your interview outfit a day ahead of time. Try on the entire outfit to see how comfortable you will be in the heat or sun., Choose a suit that is made of light-weight fabric, such as wool or cotton. If you are choosing a wool suit, a half-lining or quarter-lining in the suit jacket will help the suit breathe and keep you cooler.Half-lined jackets have lining along the back on the upper half, in the sleeves, and along the sides of the jacket. There is no lining on the back on the bottom half.


Choose blue, gray or a lighter-colored suit. Stay away from black, which is usually somber.
Stay away from linen, which has a tendency to wrinkle very quickly. This might result in your outfit looking poorly put together or slovenly.
If the suit has a skirt, make sure it is an appropriate length. If the skirt reaches your knees, then it will be a good conservative length. Moreover, you can be assured that when you sit, your skirt will cover your upper legs properly.

, Women also have the option of wearing a dress instead of a suit. The dress should only be sleeveless if you plan to wear a suit jacket with it. The dress’s skirt length should reach your knees. Choose a neutral or muted color. Do not wear a wild or overly colorful print, unless you are in a design or highly creative field., A silk or rayon shell can be a good choice, as long as you are wearing a suit jacket to cover up your arms. A crisp cotton shirt in white also always looks light and airy.


Do not choose a sleeveless shirt. Tank tops are definitely not a good choice for a job interview, and even tasteful sleeveless shirts can be questionable for some people. If you wear a shirt with very short or cap sleeves, be sure you are not showing any bra strap.
Make sure your shirt is modest. Select a shirt that does not reveal much cleavage and that fits well, If you opt for a dress, you can still pair this with a suit jacket to complete your look.


You can also wear a tasteful belt around your waist with the suit jacket. However, this might limit your ability to take off your suit jacket while you are traveling to your interview.
Keep in mind that the office where you’re interviewing is likely to be air-conditioned. It might even be chilly. Wearing a suit jacket may actually keep you comfortable in your interview.

, Underarm shields or underarm pads are disposable inserts that you attach to your shirt’s underarm area to protect your clothes from sweat, stains and odor.These are available online or at stores like Walmart and Target, and are priced at $5-$15.

, During the rest of the year, you might pair a dressy silk scarf with your outfit. But in the summer, this added layer will probably be too much and add to the heat that your body might already be feeling.

, It might be tempting to go without covering your feet or legs in order to keep cool. But this is an unprofessional look, particularly in a corporate environment.


Wear pantyhose that closely matches your natural skin tone.

, Jewelry should not be distracting either to someone’s eyes or ears. If your jewelry is clanking around, your interviewer might spend more time concentrating on that than on your responses to their questions.


If you are in a design or highly creative industry, you may be able to wear jewelry with a little more panache. Go with the norms in your industry, and if you’re unsure, err on the side of caution.

, Opt for more conservative shoes by not wearing sandals. Choose dress shoes, flats or heels (opt for low to medium height heels) in a neutral color that complements your outfit.


If the work environment is really casual, you might be able to wear sandals, but you should definitely never wear flip-flops to an interview. Check with the hiring manager to determine the dress code.
If you are interviewing somewhere that demands safe shoes, such as a construction site, a hospital or elsewhere, be sure to wear shoes that are appropriate for the location.
Even if you wear pantyhose, your feet might slip or slide in your shoes when it is hot outside. Buy padded inserts like Foot Petals, which are adhesive inserts to help keep your foot stabilized in your shoe., Shine and polish your shoes before the interview to remove any scuff marks. Use shoe polish that matches your shoes. Follow the instructions on the bottle of shoe polish.

, Choose a suit that is made of light-weight fabric, such as wool or cotton. If you are choosing a wool suit, a half-lining or quarter-lining will help the suit breathe and keep you cooler.Half-lined jackets have lining along the back on the upper half, in the sleeves, and along the sides of the jacket. There is no lining on the back on the bottom half.

Keep in mind that the office where you’re interviewing is likely to be air-conditioned. It might even be chilly. Wearing a suit jacket may actually keep you comfortable in your interview.

, Wear slacks that match a suit jacket. The slacks should fit well: not too tight and not too loose.

, Choose a long-sleeved dress shirt in a light color (white, blue, light gray). A crisp cotton shirt in white always looks light and airy. A single color or a conservatively striped shirt is best. The shirt should fit well: not too tight and not too loose.


Short-sleeved dress shirts for men, while offering a cooler option for your arms, are not recommended.
Choose lightweight, breathable shirt material. Cotton and tropical-weight wool are good options. Look for poplin, seersucker or madras cotton material, or fresco wool material., Underarm shields or underarm pads are disposable inserts that you attach to your shirt’s underarm area to protect your clothes from sweat, stains and odor.These are available online or at stores like Walmart and Target, and are priced at $5-$15.


Keep in mind that the office where you’re interviewing is likely to be air-conditioned. It might even be chilly. Wearing a suit jacket may actually keep you comfortable in your interview.

, Choose a light-weight silk tie in a color that complements your suit. Don’t choose a tie with a wild pattern or wild colors. A red tie might also be a little over the top for an interview.


When deciding not to wear a tie, you should still wear a collared shirt. Leave just the top button open.

, It might be tempting to go without covering your feet or legs in order to keep cool. But this is an unprofessional look, particularly in a corporate environment.


Choose a neutral color for your socks. Do not wear wild patterned socks.

, Opt for more conservative shoes by not wearing sandals. Wear dress shoes that are either brown or black.


If the work environment is really casual, you might be able to wear sandals, but you should definitely never wear flip-flops or crocs to an interview. Check with the hiring manager to determine the dress code.
If you are interviewing somewhere that demands safe shoes, such as a construction site, a hospital or elsewhere, be sure to wear shoes that are appropriate for the location.

, Shine and polish your shoes before the interview to remove any scuff marks. Use shoe polish that matches your shoes. Follow the instructions on the bottle of shoe polish.

, Now is not the time to experiment with Cleopatra eyeliner or wild lip colors. Choose a soft brown or navy blue eyeliner and a complementary eye shadow. Use a touch of lipstick in soft shades of pink or red.


Your makeup might run or smudge a little bit if you start to sweat. Be prepared to touch it up when you arrive at your interview site.

, Short haircuts should get a fresh trim no more than a week before the interview. Longer hair may not need to be trimmed, although if you have split or rough-looking ends, these should be trimmed off to clean up your hair.

, When worn down, long hair can make you feel and look very hot. It can cling to your face and neck, adding to the heat you may already be feeling. Choose a hairdo that is simple, secure and cool. Avoid an elaborate hairdo that is likely to result in stray pieces that stick to your neck and face in the heat.

, When your body temperature rises and you start to sweat, your perfume can become stronger. If you already are wearing strong perfume or cologne, it can quickly become overpowering in the summer heat. A quick dab of perfume on your wrists and behind your ears is likely all you’ll need.

, Neatly clip and file your fingernails to ensure they look tidy. You don’t need to get a manicure, although it might be a nice treat to prepare yourself for your interview.

, Your nail polish shouldn’t be the first thing someone notices about you. Refrain from wild colors or prints on your fingernails.

, Take the time to do a close, clean shave. If you have a beard and/or mustache, trim them to keep your face looking neat and tidy.

, Short haircuts should get a fresh trim no more than a week before the interview. Longer hair may not need to be trimmed, although if you have split or rough-looking ends, these should be trimmed off to clean up your hair.

, If you have long hair, wear it in a neat ponytail. When worn down, long hair can make you feel and look very hot. It can cling to your face and neck, adding to the heat you may already be feeling.

, When your body temperature rises and you start to sweat, your perfume or cologne can become stronger. If you already are wearing strong cologne, it can quickly become overpowering in the summer heat. A slight splash of cologne on your face is likely all you’ll need.

, Neatly clip and file your fingernails to ensure they look tidy.

, To help you combat looking sweaty or hot when you arrive at your interview, be prepared with a few supplies such as a travel-sized antiperspirant, moist towelettes, a small bottle of baby powder, and a handkerchief for dabbing away sweat on your brow. Bring a bottle of water to keep yourself hydrated.

, Leave the oversized bag at home, along with the backpack and wheeled suitcase. Complete your image with a professional-looking briefcase or bag in a neutral color.

, If you are wearing a suit jacket, you can opt to leave it off while you’re traveling to your interview. This way, you will not overheat. Carefully carry it, though, so it does not get wrinkled in transit.


Hang your suit jacket on a hanger in your car to keep it from wrinkling or gathering lint.

, It is not recommended that you wear a hat before your interview, as it could mess up your hair and make you sweat more around your hairline. While a hat is generally good to wear when you’re outside in the sunshine, this particular occasion is not the most appropriate time for wearing a hat.

, If you need to take public transit to your interview, you might want to spring for a cab this time. This will eliminate the need to wait outside for a bus or other transportation in hot weather.


If you are walking more than a few blocks, you also might consider taking a cab.

, Give yourself plenty of time before the interview by arriving early. If you are rushing to get there on time, you will likely be flustered and sweatier than if you had more time to spare.

, When you arrive, find the restroom and take a few minutes to refresh your look. This is a good time to take a few deep breaths and to make sure you look calm and collected.


Run your hands under cool water in the restroom. This will help cool you off by lowering your body temperature slightly. It will also leave your hands free of sweat.Blot away sweat with moist towelettes. Apply baby powder to blot moist areas of your skin on your face.
Reapply your antiperspirant. Be careful not to get any antiperspirant on your clothes.
Touch up your makeup and hair. Clean up any smudged makeup and reapply lipstick to look fresh. Smooth any flyaway hair.

, If you plan to wear sunglasses while you are outside, be sure to take them off and put them in your briefcase or purse before you go in for your interview. Do not wear them on top of your head.

Get your work professionally reviewed.",How to Develop Work for an Art School Portfolio," The biggest skill that serious schools look for is observational drawing. This is the same for any nearly any discipline, from fine arts to design, architecture to 3D animation. If you draw from photographs or 2D work, it will be obvious to the reviewer. You need to prove that you can translate 3D concepts into a 2D space, that you can rotate a subject and keep the correct proportions and perspective.;
, You'll want to show your process work - how you developed your ideas and how your work has matured. Some art schools will require that you submit your sketchbook along with your portfolio to give further insight.

, This may be experimental work or pieces that showcase your personal interest in a subject or medium. If you want to get into an animation school, for example, you might need to provide some motion graphics work or a demo reel.

, Find out what specific requirements or exercises your school may require, such as the famous RISD bicycle exercise or water study., There are many aspiring artists applying to art school every year. Out of all the hundreds of portfolios and blogs, you want yours to be one that stands out and is remembered.

, Make sure that you have the basics down: anatomy, color, lighting, etc. A creative art piece without proper proportions is not going to impress.

, Photograph outdoors or using natural light where possible. For three-dimensional work, use a 3-point light system: one overhead light, and two spotlights set at 45º angles to the piece.

, Most schools now require that you upload your portfolio rather than send in hard copies. Make sure you save your work with sufficient pixels so that the reviewer can zoom in on your work without pixelation. Use RGB color mode, and save in one of the following formats: jpg (max quality), pdf. Be sure you always archive a high-resolution image for your records.

, Choose your best and most recent work (within the last 12 months). Make certain that each piece showcases your talent and is as good as you can make it. Create a narrative throughout the portfolio that speaks to your intended audience, bearing in mind the particular program you are applying to.

, At this point in your career, it's not enough to ask your mom for her opinion. If there's one in your city, find a National Portfolio Day event where many art schools will have admissions officers available to review your work and give you feedback.

Assess how you feel at the day's end.,
Determine how you feel about it.,
Think about how you feel about your job.,
Check your stress level.,
Last but not least: This is an addiction.",How to Determine if You're a Workaholic," If you are often tired from work? This might be the first and foremost sign to look for when it comes to being a workaholic. It is just as important to look at how many hours you put into your work every week. 8-10 hours every day is about average. But if you go two or more hours above this, and also feel exhausted after a full day of work, this is the first and most crucial sign that you might be a workaholic. If this is the case, see if you can recognize yourself in the the later steps as well.;
, Does your job come before anything else? Remember, workaholism is first and foremost an addiction, not a hobby, sport, or even an interest. Workaholism is something that one might end up investing everything into, but not for fun. Therefore it's important to see where you place your work in comparison to friends, family and loved ones. One should never give up friends and family just for a job. This is a rule of the thumb. Reflect on your priorities!

, Does your job make you happy? If it doesn't, then you should look more closely into it. Workaholism is as mentioned earlier an addiction. At first your job might have seemed fun, but after a while, that feeling of having a good time with it might have faded, and been replaced by an urging feeling to do more work. Just for the sake of doing more, and completing that last report, even though it is late at night. Your job is supposed to make you happy and seem interesting!


When is your job fun? Most of the time, or just when you just completed that final task? Because completing a task might bring you some feeling of joy. But your job is supposed to bring you joy even through the process. Being addicted to the feeling of finishing something is often a big part of being a workaholic!
Do you feel bad when you are not working? A lot of workaholics are addicted to the feeling of that you are doing something important. That you are doing something that matters. Being a nice-guy or a good girl is about a lot more than just doing your chores perfectly. If that grudging feeling of uncertainty returns just about when the weekend or a vacation rolls up, you should look more closely into your habits!
Do you enjoy the harvest of what you have sown? Do you enjoy that big paycheck that comes in your mail after putting in those long hard hours? Because many people enjoy making a hard effort, but they are also good at praising that day of, or that new TV they could afford. Thanks to the long hours. A workaholic works differently. Seldom they take the leisure of enjoying what they've earned. So do some soul searching if you recognize yourself in this.

, Do you stress a lot? A workaholic is often obsessed with getting the chores done as fast and productive as possible. Together with the aspect of exhausting yourself, stress often affects the workaholic. When there is no break, or chance to relax, it is almost impossible to unhook. Remember: Only sleeping eight hours at night isn't enough relaxation for a human being. You have to take it easy at least a couple of hours every day in addition to the hours of sleep you get in order to combat stress and exhaustion.

, And it can get pretty bad. Exhaustion and stress is something that often troubles workaholics, and this is something that is not to be taken lightly. Both stress and exhaustion have been scientifically proved to shorten a humans lifespan. It is important that if this text make you suspect that you might be a workaholic, it is important to get support from friends and loved ones. And if it doesn't go away, professional help is advised. This is as already earlier mentioned a potentially grave addiction.

Analyze the training need.,

Implement the training program.,
Evaluate the training program.",How to Develop a Training Program on the Job," Who is your audience? When you develop a training program on the job, you'll take a look at what knowledge, skills, and attitudes the students need upon completing the program versus what knowledge, skills, and attitudes they have now. If there is a gap between desired performance and expected performance, what is the cause? Is training really the solution? When there is a gap, it might be because they can't do the work--physical limitations, lack of proper tools or equipment, environment, etc. Or maybe they know what to do but just don't want to or won't; in that case, you have a performance issue rather than a training issue. Training is only the solution when the audience members have not yet learned the information, skills, or attitudes needed to be successful on the job. Part of your analysis includes assessing the resources and tools you'll need vs. what is available to you, the schedule for the training, and how the students are likely to learn best.;
, Based on the results you obtain in the analysis phase, you will design the training. Think of a design as a sort of outline. The design phase consists of identifying learning objectives that describe what the student should be able to do upon completion of the training, and how these objectives will be measured. The objectives should match the knowledge, skills, and attitudes you identified were needed during your analysis. You'll also determine how the course will be delivered, such as by an instructor in a classroom, online, or a blended approach. In the design phase, you may also create storyboards to aid in the development of the training program.

, In the development phase, use the objectives and other materials you created during the design phase to flesh out your outline and develop the training program. The materials may include an online training component and manuals for the instructor and students. In this phase, you will develop a strategy for testing the students' change in knowledge, skills, or attitudes based on the training.

, The implementation phase is sometimes called the delivery phase. In this phase, you actually teach the training program to the students, whether the instruction takes place online, in the classroom, or through another method. If the delivery method is classroom instruction and you have a large audience, you may conduct a ""train-the-trainer"" program, where the facilitators sit through the class as students and then practice teaching various parts of the material back to each other to ensure consistency and full understanding. The first time the instruction is offered is called a ""pilot"" and there should be an opportunity to debrief and make changes based upon feedback from observers and the pilot audience.

, In the evaluation phase, you determine if the students obtained the knowledge, skills, or attitudes you identified as the goal during the analysis phase. You can use the information you obtain during the evaluation phase to make additional changes to the design, development, and delivery of the training program the next time you offer it to students. Depending on your needs, you will have decided in an earlier phase what level of evaluation you will use. Level I measures how the learners felt about the training, i.e., did they like it? Did they believe they learned something? This evaluation can be accomplished with a simple questionnaire. Level 2 measures whether the learners mastered the material delivered; this usually involves a test, or having each learner successfully perform a task that was taught. Level 3 requires following up with learners later, to determine if they are actually applying the new skills on the job. Some corporations actually strive to take evaluation to Level 4, where they determine whether there was an actual return on investment for putting the workers through the training program.

This doesn’t mean that many important aspects of your life that are not related to work, nor does it mean that you have to work all the time. During work time, work-related tasks should be your primary concern, and make sure you balance your work life and non-work life so that you have enough time and energy to do your work well.


If you are partially or completely in charge of setting your own work time, you will have to be sure to minimize distractions when working, and to work a reasonable amount of time (not too much and not too little).Diligently maintaining a log of the hours you work will help you to do this.;
, Being respectful of others, showing consistency and reliability, being honest, and other values are part of developing a good work ethic.Many of these values have to do with how you treat others; a work ethic doesn’t just mean working hard, but also working well with others.


When you make a mistake or don’t complete your work, don’t make excuses. Owning your mistakes or shortcomings and promising to improve in the future shows maturity and a willingness to work well with others.

, Aside from working doing your tasks well, you can cultivate a good reputation at work by being honest, following workplace rules (concerning punctuality, breaks, time off, etc.), and being fair to others.Avoid gossiping at work. This will show that you are focused on your job, treat others fairly, and are a good team player.

, Staying focused, and making choices that will benefit you in the long run are also part of developing a good work ethic.This means being able to tell yourself, and others, when work needs to come first. Values like dedication, ambition, and persistence are valued by employers, and can lead to success in school and work.Remember that if you tell yourself you need to put something on hold in order to take care of work first, it doesn’t mean that you’ll never get around to it. Reward yourself by relaxing or having fun after you’ve finished your work.

, When possible, try to work around “focus times.” Give yourself a set period of time (such as an hour or an hour and a half) in which you will work deliberately and without distractions.If you are in school or self-employed, then your hours might be flexible, and you will have to be diligent about making time specifically to do work. Even if an employer sets your work hours for you, however, you can benefit from declaring “focus time” if possible—ask others not to disturb you, turn off all electronic distractions, etc.

, Everyone has certain things that can distract them from work: social media, chatting or texting friends, playing games, watching television, etc. When you are working, make sure to minimize potential distractions, and especially those that you know you are especially drawn to.Be persistent if people try to pull you away from your work. For instance, if people distract you by chatting, tell them you have work that you’ve got to finish, but you’d love to catch up with them later.

, Often, you won’t reach your full productivity, work speed, or creativity immediately after you start working. Instead, you might need a certain amount of time (10-30 minutes, for example) in order to reach this level.Factor this into the time you set aside for work, especially if you are working on a deadline.

, Keep track of how long you can ordinarily work before getting tired. Once you have this benchmark, try working more than this on one day, followed by a day in which your work load is lighter. Periodically pushing yourself like this can help your build up to being able to work effectively for longer periods.Another technique to building up to longer periods of work is to push yourself a little further at times. When you feel like you don’t want to work any longer, or are looking for ways to procrastinate, don’t stop immediately. Instead, commit to working a little longer (20 minutes, for example), and then stopping.

, Getting enough rest is important to maintaining a good work ethic. If you are truly tired (and not looking to procrastinate), it is a sign that you should take a break. Whatever your work schedule is like, make sure you factor in enough time for sleep and relaxation into your day. There is some variation from person to person, but generally adults need 7.5 to 8.5 hours of sleep per day., Work can be very important, but it is also important not to neglect other parts of your life. Everyone needs mental breaks, to have time to do things they enjoy, and to take care of non-work priorities.Maintaining a life beyond work is actually part of developing a good work ethic, so make sure you allow yourself this.

, If you know or decide that something needs to be done, don’t give up until it is. Rest and finding a work-life balance are always important, but so is taking care of the things you need to get done., If you know you have a problem with procrastination, then make it a point to resist it for a month. Doing so can give you a foundation for long-term success and a strong work ethic.


During this period, if you feel the urge to procrastinate, remind yourself “I need to get this done,” and make yourself do work instead of turning to distractions.

, No one is perfect, so we all make mistakes in our work from time to time. However, if you make it your goal to do your work well (no matter what it is), it will increase your motivation to succeed, and to fight procrastination.If you feel yourself getting tired or worn out because of work, stop and rest. If you try to work when you are exhausted, you risk doing less than your best. Not only can this be discouraging, it can make more work for you to do later when you have to correct something or do it over again. Just make sure you aren’t procrastinating, and that you have a clear plan of when and how to pick up with your task after you rest.
If you work in or study a creative field, procrastination can be a way of dealing with pressures of criticism and/or creative block. If this is the case, resolve yourself to worry about perfecting a project later in the work process. That way, you can get started, make progress, be encouraged, and improve your work later.If you work in or study a creative field, you might also benefit from setting two deadlines—one to get a first “draft” of a project, and a second to revise and improve the project. It can also be beneficial to give yourself time between these two deadlines to take a break and refresh your perspective., Although you may enjoy your work and even find it fun, it is still work and you need to approach it with a positive attitude and have outstanding ethics., Distance learning requires you to develop your own curriculum and be self-motivated which help you to learn great work habits you can take into the professional arena., Juggling your education and a part-time job will prepare you for a busy work world that insists on multi-tasking.,, By writing down little techniques that helped you juggle your academic life, you can refer to this journal when you are employed in your career of choice to see what worked for you during stressful times in the past."
,How to Decline a Job Offer1,
"
Call promptly.,
Be thankful first.,
Reject the offer.,
Answer any questions you are asked.,
Finish with grace.,
Follow up in writing.",How to Decline a Job Offer2," As soon as you know you won't be able to accept the position, make the call. The longer you dilly-dally, the longer it will take for your potential employers to hire another candidate. You're already rejecting your potential employers, so the least you can do is be as efficient as possible.


As soon as you've accepted another position or have realized that the job will be impossible for you to take because of the compensation, responsibilities, commute, work environment, or whatever reason, place the call.
You should call the hiring officer or recruiter who made you the offer.

, Before you reject the job offer, take the time to show the company how much you appreciate the offer and how hard they worked to make you feel comfortable at the company, to show you around and introduce you to people, or whatever else they did.


Thank not only the person you're calling, but try to name a few people in the company who were also helpful to you.
Use a few kind adjectives to describe the people or person who interviewed you. You can say the person was kind, thoughtful, welcoming, professional, or whatever works best for the situation.
Don't overdo it. You don't have to spend an hour thanking the person over the phone. Just two or three sentences will do. Cut to the chase.
Maintain the right tone. Though you are complimenting the company, it should start to become obvious that you are not calling to deliver good news. Don't sound so enthusiastic that the person will be genuinely shocked to hear you won't be taking the offer.

, After you've thanked the person, clearly state, in no uncertain terms, that you will not be accepting the offer. You can start off by saying, ""Regrettably..."" or ""Unfortunately..."" before you deliver the bad news. Then you can briefly state a reason for why you chose not to accept the offer.


Be diplomatic. You don't have to be completely honest if you are feeling negative. Treat this person as a future potential employer, and state everything as politely as possible.
Speak clearly and steadily. Though you may be rushing to get off the phone, you should sound clear and confident when you deliver the message.
You don't have to go into detail. For example, if you just got a bad vibe when you visited the office, or if you realized the position was completely beneath you, you can just say, ""The job did not meet my career objectives."" You can also say that the job did not suit your needs.
If you got another job offer, great. That will make the whole process a little easier. Just say that you found another position that meets your career objectives more, or which is more aligned with your career objectives.
Stress that this was a tough decision to make, and that you really wish it could have worked. Don't make it sound like you don't care about the company at all.
Maintain a sincere and even tone. Show the person that you really do regret the decision.

, It's likely that you're not off the hook yet. After you make it clear that you're rejecting the job, you will be asked some more questions about your decision-making process.

Don't offend the company. If the benefits package was just not enough for you, for example, don't say the company was ""cheap.""

, Once you have made your goal and have answered every question you were asked, it's time to get off the phone. After all, the hiring officer on the other end has to go try to find someone else to fill your potential position, so ending the conversation will benefit both of you.

Start keeping a daily journal and write down how you feel about different aspects of your job, your colleagues, your immediate supervisor and the environment in general. Doing so will reveal the most dreadful points that may need immediate action.


This list can help you realize that it may not be the job itself – it could be just one or two aspects of it. It can also provide you ammo for when these hot button topics arise at work. You'll have thought the issue out and can add in your two cents to improve the situation.;
, There is a possibility that your job has many positive things about it, but your clouded mind is not enabling you to see them as clearly as possible. Look at your job from the perspective of someone else who is not at all familiar with your work environment. This will give you an opportunity to think from a neutral perspective and be able to spot the positive side of your job. What isn't so bad?


For example, your colleagues might be very supportive; however, the nature of your job is so monotonous that you have started to dislike your work, leading to a chain reaction of dislikes which ultimately turned to hating your job on the whole. It's easy to forget that your colleagues are great and you would enjoy the time spent with them if it weren't for work.

, In order to cope with these circumstances, you'll need to pinpoint just why you're feeling so frustrated. Observing your own situation in relation to what is happening across your organization will help you figure out why you're feeling this way. Are your coworkers feeling similarly? Is the company, too, on its last legs? Is there drama happening in your department? Seeing these things may help you understand why you feel the way you do and to know that it's not just you.


It may also help you see potential options out of this rut. Do you have grounds to ask for a raise? A different schedule? These are things that may make your work a bit more tolerable.

, Look at what is going on in the work life of your colleagues across the organization. If they are in a similar situation, be at ease since you are not alone in your struggle. Talk to others and learn about the coping mechanisms they have devised. Their situation may offer you the realization that there are things you can do. In fact, you may realize that you can take concrete steps to improve your own situation.


That being said, don't compare yourself to your colleagues. Don't worry about how much money they make, if the boss loves them, or if they have the position you want. That'll just make your frustration worse! Stick to finding those that also have to deal with hating their job for encouragement and support.

, Taking a hard look at your skills will unfold critical points you need to work upon. While figuring out what you like and dislike about your job in combination with advice from your colleagues, come up with a comprehensive list of skills you need to develop – in other words, areas of your professional life or personal development factors you want to improve. This will help you feel like you're going somewhere and not stagnant in your work.


For example, you might have seen that you usually take too much work on yourself, which implies that you should learn delegation skills. This will lessen your workload and you will have a new skill that you have developed. Likewise can be done for other noteworthy aspects you come across during your analysis.

, To get through this ordeal, it'll be incredibly beneficial to talk with someone who's been right where you are and who has gotten through it. This person will not only give you sound advice to trigger your action plan but will be there to consistently support and appreciate you in the progress you will be making. That person will also act as your confidant in case you need to share personal details or weaknesses.


You can't generally ask someone to be your mentor. Instead, look at your superiors and who you already have an established connection with. Without specifically talking about them being your mentor, seek them out for advice and feedback. The mentor-mentee relationship will grow naturally from there.

, If you develop a habit of keeping a lessons learned inventory, you will be able to improve many things about your professional life which will aid in your future work. You'll have a concrete list you can refer back to to show you the growth you've made and just how valuable of an employee you really are. When a new job rolls around, you'll have all these strong points of yours at the ready.


Unfortunately, lessons are easy to learn and easy to forget. Making a list will help you keep these lessons in the forefront of your mind and not let what you learned fall by the wayside.

, There could be a chance that many employees of your organization are having a smooth professional journey and are quite satisfied with their jobs. If you come across such individuals, don’t compare your situation with theirs. You have your own reasons why you hate your job, relative to your current circumstances. You are a unique person and will have to have your own way of dealing with hating your job. Comparison will kill all your attempts to healthily deal with the situation.


Think of it this way: maybe you just have higher expectations of your job; these coworkers of yours are content being a little miserable. Whether or not they like their job has nothing to do with the job itself; it's just how they look at it. Maybe they even used to hate their job, but now they've found peace with it. If you're close to them, ask them how they got past these obstacles.

, You will be going in the right direction, regardless of how you feel about your job, if you operate with the ultimate goal of being the master of your field. Growing your skills even in the face of this adversity will help you see the benefits of your current situation and will open doors in the future.


Aim to learn something new about your field of work every single day. Focus on the areas that you might have not worked upon due to the sheer negative attitude towards your job. Letting your field of interest suffer due to your attitude about your job is not a wise plan at all, especially when it comes to the future.

, If the predominant reasons you hate your job are because of your not-so-exciting work and low compensation, it's likely a good idea to take up a side job or project outside of your working hours. You'll surround yourself with work that is meaningful to you, in addition to supporting your income stream. When you're at work, you'll have other things to drive you, lessening your frustration and worry.


This has added benefits of interacting with new people, developing new skills, and exploring a different working environment to grab hold of additional opportunities to learn and develop. You'll better your mindset and yourself at the same time.

, If you feel you are being cornered or turned down for opportunities in comparison to others in your department or organization, then there is likely an issue going on with your boss. Learn to understand the working style of your boss and seek positive criticism. Proactively discuss your concerns with him or her and follow their guidance. Since your boss is the person you report to and will be responsible for your performance assessment you need to work in line with his or her expectations. When your boss is pleased with you, everything goes much, much more smoothly.


Meeting your boss's expectations about the job and the way he or she expects their expectations to be met may make work easier. When work's easier, you'll feel less stressed and like you're able to perform better. While you may not agree with their preferences or understand, you'll still reap the benefits from trying to work within their vision of your job.

, While at your job, you can explore the kettle of possibilities by negotiating adjustments on various fronts. One could be to ask for flexible working hours if your company policy allows it. This will put your mind at ease and you will be in a capacity to play at a different level. They may see that you're flexible and can still get the work done, making both you and your employer happy.


In rare cases, provided that you have a side job in hand, ask for a pay cut to earn more free time and spend it on tasks meaningful to you. For instance, spend a certain amount of hours on your personal and professional development through attending workshops or seminars, or consider volunteering for an activity or project unrelated to work.

, The more you interact with people in your professional fraternity, the greater your chances of getting in the forefront of being recommended for opportunities. You may come across a better opportunity through your contacts when you might have not even been thinking about it!


So much of hiring nowadays is through recommendations and in-sourcing. If you're the go-to-guy or gal who knows everyone and everything, your time at this job may be extra temporary. Keep your eye out for potential connections that could help you later on in your future.

, Don’t just straightaway begin your job hunt, but prepare well so that your time is utilized in the right direction. Target companies you wish to apply for and be on the lookout for new openings. Reserve a time slot every day to sit down and only apply for jobs. Doing this while you have another job will help keep this process from becoming stressful.


Keep your career sweet spot in mind. You want to maintain your own values with what the organization aims to achieve at the broader level. This promises a long term stay and will help you feel excited about your work every single day.
Present yourself as a brand, highlighting what you are able to accomplish. This should be communicated via your resume and your online profile regardless of the platform they appear on.

, Being frustrated with your job calls for getting involved in what interests you. When you do things you really like, you feel good and are more likely to stay relaxed in stressful situations.


This may include a long list of your hobbies, like singing, reading, painting, playing guitar, gardening, etc., or even just making more time to go to the movies or spend quality time with friends.
Consider taking time off from work and go on a vacation where the stress of work will not bother you – as long as you don't carry any work baggage in your mind.

, Being healthy will not only add years to your life but will also make you more productive. When you exercise daily and get a healthy diet, the mind starts working at a faster pace. This brings more clarity and precision to all aspects of your life.


Consider indulging in meditation that will relax you even more and will help you think as clearly as possible. When your mind is clear, negative thoughts can be more easily sidelined and your thinking pattern will be more positive, making you a productive person in all spheres of your life, including work.

If meditation doesn't appeal to you, consider yoga, learning some deep breathing exercises, or simply finding a relaxing spot each day to spend 15 minutes clearing your mind for a moment to yourself.



, If you really hate your job, there is a likelihood that every single inch of your workday is contributing to adding extensive amounts of stress to your life. You won't be able to get rid of this stress until you start thinking about striking a work-life balance. Steer your mind to organize your workday so that you are done with things during your normal working hours and don’t have to stay late at work.


If you spare time for other activities and people in your life, hating your job will stay at the back of your mind. Work will be something you just have to deal with from 9-5, that you can forget about on evenings and weekends.

, People who hate their jobs usually have obvious reasons: they are bored, the work doesn’t seem interesting or they are unable to tap into their full potential with the work they're doing. However, think about the positive side of this situation: being bored at your job opens a window of opportunity for you to tap into your creative side. More reflection time allows your best ideas to take deep roots and solidify.


See if you can tap into your creative side at work. You can take up a project that really excites you or come up with an initiative of your own and take the lead. Your own brainchild will definitely let you feel like you're on a creative streak, energizing your work.

, Since it's unlikely you're going to switch jobs in the near future, the best idea is to learn to stay positive about it. Don’t delve into negative thinking because it will act as a poison to sabotage your time at work. Instead of being irritated at each and every thing pertaining to your work environment, try to see the good things around you. For starters, you have a job. Things could be much worse!


Concentrate on the better parts of the day, like when you get to spend time with your colleagues, when you engage in healthy conversations about new ideas, or even this opportunity to force yourself to be a self motivator. When you start thinking positive, you will realize that things are not as bad as you think.

, The hatred and hopelessness associated with your work life is likely making you ignore the potential lessons learned from this situation. Rather than being really hard on yourself, try to analyze the situation and see if there are any learning points you can gather. This will turn your experience, albeit negative, into a more enriching one down the road.


For example, if you're not fond of your coworkers, this is a time where you can learn to get along with different types of people, and maybe even make friends. A poorly paying job will teach you to budget and make you more appreciative when the money does roll in. Though it's hard to see the silver lining, try to remember that these experiences offer value in the future.

Consult with your boss about taking on more work in areas in which you already do well, or about a plan to shift your focus to a new project. This will also suggest to your boss that you’re taking pride in the work you're putting out, which can lead to more responsibility and a more fulfilling workday.Ask for the opportunity to do work outside of your normal expertise, in order to master new skills in the future. Talk with your boss about altering your job description to include new tasks that you find interesting and that are beneficial to the business.
Without skirting any of your workplace policies, talk with your coworkers about swapping a few tasks to encourage versatility within the workforce.;
, Learning new skills can help you view your boring job in a whole new way. If you are stuck in a job with little to no room for learning new skills in the field, try listening to educational podcasts. Keeping your brain active is a surefire way to kick the boredom.Try talking to people in other departments about what they do and what their jobs entail. Maybe you’re working in sales but you’re more interested in working in marketing; socialize with people in other departments to get an idea of what other jobs are available that might appeal to you.

, Resist the temptation to spend lots of time checking emails and social media while you’re working. Although it is healthy to allow your brain to rest and relax throughout the day, schedule yourself specific time to respond to emails and check your social media accounts. Limit the amount of time that you spend doing this. Even though your job may be boring, spending loads of time distracting yourself from your tasks can make the day feel longer and your workload more daunting as the day comes to an end.


Pick specific times to check your email and social media accounts, such as once at 11:00am and once at 4:00pm. Spend up to 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the afternoon doing this, but when the 30 minutes is up, dive right back into to working.

, Offer your help when your coworkers are involved in new or difficult projects. Take the initiative to start on new projects. Involving new people or experiences in your workday can cut down on the monotony of your daily task list. Your colleagues are also a great resource to tap when you've come to a roadblock on a new project, or are trying to master a new skill. Don't hesitate to ask your coworkers for the same hand that you would be happy to lend.When offering help in the workplace, make sure to use statements that are positive, not condescending. If you know your colleagues have started a new project, or have hit a roadblock in a current one, let them know you’re available to help out by saying, “I’m available if you are interested in brainstorming about this project,” or by saying, “I have some ideas that I think could benefit your project.”

, Instead of spending time daydreaming or nodding off in your meetings, make a strong effort to actively listen and put forth new ideas. Find ways to participate in your meetings. If you are frustrated by meetings and the way they are run in your workplace, consult with your boss about changing their structure. Offer constructive solutions to making meetings more efficient and focused.If you are unable to actively participate in most meetings in your workplace, take notes or write down questions to discuss with your colleagues after the meeting.
If you feel that inefficient meetings are hindering your productivity, consult with your boss on the necessity of your attendance at these meetings. Avoid coming off as angry or aggressive, but suggest that you feel your time could be used more effectively elsewhere.

, Use your coworkers as sounding boards for new ideas. Ask them how they feel about their jobs, and what they do to combat office boredom. No one understands your office better than your coworkers, so use their knowledge as a resource for things you can do to improve your situation. Together, you may be able to brainstorm ideas for making your meetings more efficient, making your workday more productive, and overall improving the quality of your office’s productivity., Sometimes, exhaustion can be confused with boredom in the workplace. Often times, exhaustion is the result of poor diet or inconsistent sleeping habits. If you are struggling to stay awake at your desk, taking better care of yourself outside of the office may be the solution. Getting a decent night’s rest and eating properly are pivotal aspects of a more positive disposition.


If waking up for your day is a struggle, make an effort to go to bed an hour earlier.
If you find yourself eating a lot of fast food, work on developing a meal plan and doing meal prep on Sunday nights. Replace your fast food meals with fast healthy meals.

, When you feel your energy level decreasing, a small stretch can breathe new life into your day. If you're finding that your boredom is also causing you to lose energy throughout the day, spend some time stretching to reinvigorate your senses. Incorporating these exercises into your day can reduce stress and keep your mind focused.Research some basic yoga positions that you can do at your desk, such as the high altar pose or ankle to knee positions.

, If you are able, leave the office for your lunch hour. Take advantage of this time by spending time away from your desk and the office. You may discover that there is a great clothing boutique, delicious restaurant, or beautiful garden close to your office.


If you’ve come to work without a prepared lunch, try ordering a new cuisine that you haven't tried before.
If the weather is nice, go for a short walk to get your body moving and your blood flowing.
Bring a novel to read. Make you lunch hour beneficial to you by relaxing and preparing yourself to refocus on the day at hand.

, Consider whether you are bored with your work, or if your boredom is originating elsewhere. Maybe you're feeling bored at work because you're actually bored with your daily routine. Your commute, your lunch, and your day to day tasks all have to capacity to bore or stimulate your senses. Start combating workplace boredom by changing something about your usual routine each day, so that you can combat the feeling of monotony in the office.


Try a new coffee spot close to your office before work, instead of drinking the regular office coffee.
Try mixing up your commute by riding your bicycle or taking the train to work.

, If your day is filled with the same people, same morning beverages, or the same music, try to incorporate new things. Mix up the day by bringing in something that you can share with your coworkers. If the office always has the same music playing and you are able to change it, put on something upbeat and fun. These small changes can also help to break up the monotonous nature of the workday.


Make small changes for yourself, such as starting your day with a unique beverage each morning. Have cider, green tea, or hot chocolate in the morning, instead of or in addition to your usual coffee.
If your office is especially boring in the mornings before everyone has had a chance to settle in, bring in a box of pastries or bagels to share. This will put everyone in a better mood and help you all make it through the day.

, If you always spend your breaks on social media, make an effort to do something different during your breaks. Maybe this means doing jumping jacks or planning a weekend getaway. Perhaps try picking up a craft or a hobby that you can do in your free work time. Incorporate anything that brightens your mood into your break time, so you have something to look forward to during your boring workday.


Knitting or crochet is a great way to keep your mind busy during your breaks.
Try doing crossword puzzles on your breaks. Not only will they keep your mind active, but you’ll have something to ponder while you’re completing your boring work tasks.
Plan vacation or getaways to places you've never been during your breaks. These can be real plans, or imaginary plans that you use to motivate yourself!

, Add personal touches to your work environment. Without violating any specific guidelines set forth by your office, hang a piece of artwork that inspires you. Even if your job is boring, you workspace doesn't have to be. Bring in photos of loved ones, or those you respect or admire. Anything that reminds you of why you are motivated to do well in your current position is a great thing to have at your desk.

, Create a specific work playlist of music that is both relaxing and stimulating. For some, listening to music through headphones is a great way to drown out distractions. If repetition is a big part of your job, studies have even shown that including music into your routine can increase productivity. Choose music that is inspiring and will brighten your mood., Research the company you are working for. Learn more about the company, what they do, and why the are successful. Ask yourself if you are inspired by their mission statement, or if there is another area within the company or business that you are working for that seems more interesting to you. There may be jobs within the company that actively engage in work you find interesting, even if your current position does not.


Look into the possibility of changing roles or departments within your company, so that you have a wider variety of skill sets that benefit your position within the business.

, Perhaps you feel stuck in a job that required little experience when you were hired, but have become bored with the lack of challenges in your day to day routine. Whether you already have a degree or would like to study a subject that is completely new, seeking higher education can help you start a new career path. Consider heading back to school to complete a degree that mirrors your passions.


Research scholarships and grants that could help you fund this education.
If your situation is such that you can’t leave your boring job to go back to school, many universities and colleges offer online classes or classes that can be completed at night or during the weekends.

, Trade schools are also a great way to learn a skill. Perhaps you have had an interest in becoming a hair stylist, mechanic, or carpenter. Trade schools offer the opportunity to turn your passions into your employment. Typically, trade schools are less expensive and offer flexible programs that take less time to complete than obtaining a degree from a university.


Many trade schools also offer flexible programs that can be completed while working a full time job, such as night or weekend classes.

, If you taken every step to combat workplace boredom and are still feeling lackluster about your current employment situation, it may be time to consider a complete career change. If this isn’t your first boring day to day job, consider the types of jobs you applying for. Perhaps you would prefer working outside, working with people, working from home, making music, etc. Think about the possibility of taking a job in a field that is completely new to you. Sometimes this can involve seeking out higher education, but some forms of employment benefit more from a strong work ethic.


Research new employment possibilities and seek out companies that do work which inspires you. Consider exactly what you’re looking for in a fulfilling job and seek out positions that satisfy your requirements.
The food and beverage industry promotes fast paced work and tons of social interaction. Although working in the food and beverage industry isn’t for everyone, restaurant work is a highly respectable profession, that can result in some very lucrative benefits.
Jobs that involve physical labor offer many added health benefits to those in these positions. Working outside means access to fresh air and natural sunlight, and putting in physical labor keeps your body active.

You should get rid of anything that serves no functional or aesthetic purpose. Once this is done, you can reorganize the items you've chosen to keep so that they are easy to find.


You may find it helpful to assign certain drawers, shelves, or cabinets to certain categories of materials. This will keep things neat and facilitate easy access to essential items.
You will probably have to make a temporary mess in order to go through everything in your desk. Just make sure you don't inhibit your ability to work in the process, especially if your reorganization spans multiple days.;
, The best way to keep your desk neat is to keep various categories of items separated. Your workspace will quickly descend into disarray if you have to dig through a pile or stack to find things you need. Desk organizers can be purchased at any office supply store (such as Office Depot, Staples, or The Container Store) and are handy tools for making sure this doesn't happen. Examples include:


Drawer trays/dividers. These create separated containers within desk drawers to keep small, loose items from moving around or becoming jumbled together.
Stacked inbox sorters. These are small desktop shelves which can be assigned categories for different types of ingoing/outgoing paperwork.
Pen/pencil cups. This simple device simply holds your pens and pencils and provides easy access to them. They take up minimal desk space and save valuable real estate in desk drawers.

, If you deal with a lot of files, forms, or other paperwork that must be stored and referenced as part of your job, you will find it immensely helpful to have all your papers organized onto a bookshelf or in a filing cabinet. Nothing creates more clutter than papers scattered across a desktop.


Ask your supervisor if there are any unused shelving materials or cabinets that you can move into your cubicle. Many offices have surplus materials that sit in storage until they are needed. This is a better option than reaching into your own pocket to pay for a work-related necessity.
If you choose to use a bookshelf, also purchase hard-cover, three-ring binders to hold your paperwork. These stand up easily on shelves and keep papers from falling out or becoming mixed up.
If you don't have space in your cubicle for a filing cabinet or bookshelf, Ask your supervisor if there are any communal filing cabinets or bookshelves you might be able to use. Just be sure to avoid placing sensitive or confidential information in a place anyone can access.

, Creating spaces in/on your desk and throughout your cubicle for specific purposes will help you keep things organized and easy to find and use. For example, you may wish to assign one drawer for storing stationery and another for spare materials like paper clips, staples, batteries, rubber bands, etc. This will also help keep your decorative items and trinkets from becoming jumbled with work-related functional items.


Be practical when designating spaces so that you are sure to accommodate the demands of your work. If your work projects often require going through multiple stacks of forms in a short amount of time, you wouldn't want your 'pending paperwork' area to be assigned to your bottom desk drawer.
Don't devote too much desk space to personal items if it means you will have trouble fitting in necessary work items.

, A small, hand-held labeler can be very helpful in ensuring that your organization efforts stand the test of time. If you have labels on binders or even on desk drawers and cabinet doors, you will not only more easily locate items you need, but you will also be more inclined to maintain your space designations.


Be sure not to stick labels to company-owned property without first checking with your supervisor for approval. Some labels may be hard to remove, and your boss probably won't want you to damage materials that don't belong to you.
Don't go overboard. Limit your labeling to binders, drawers, cabinets, or shelves. Having labels covering every square inch of your workspace will likely be frowned upon by your supervisor and will reduce your cubicle's appeal.

, This simple touch is one of the most effective ways to give your cubicle a custom feel. So long as photos are workplace-appropriate (meaning not offensive to your coworkers) and not excessive in number, you can feel free to put up photos of whatever or whomever you'd like.


Many people choose to hang photographs of family members, pets, vacation memories, close friends, etc. Hang up photos of whatever is important to you!
If you are not allowed or able to hang photos on your cubicle walls, pick up a picture frame and make a place for it on your desk. Just be sure to keep them small so as not to use up valuable space.
You can supplement your personal photographs with art or decorative wall-hangings if you wish, so long as you keep the subject matter clean and don't overdo it. Also, make sure to avoid putting anything you value where it might get damaged during the course of daily work activities.

, Choose a calendar with a theme you enjoy. This is a great way to incorporate aesthetics into a cubicle accessory you probably need to have anyway. As with photos and wall art, this can be anything that appeals to you, so long as it is workplace-appropriate.


Choose a calendar with appealing colors to break up the muted tones that tend to characterize cubicle walls and carpeting.
You may find that a smaller sized calendar fits better in your workspace, especially if you are short on wall space. You can also consider daily ""tear-away"" desktop calendars if you can't hang one up.

, This is another clever way to put your personal touch on something that's already present in your cubicle. Your desktop background theme can be anything that appeals to you (photos, art, landscapes, etc.) and livens up your workspace.


Check with your company's IT department or a supervisor to make sure you are allowed to change your desktop background; your company might have restrictions on computer settings that would prohibit this.
Because it is easy to change a desktop background, you can switch yours up regularly to keep your cubicle decor from feeling stale.

, This is a simple touch that can go a long way toward making your cubicle feel more homey. Choose a mug in one of your favorite colors, one that has a funny saying, or that was a gift from your grandkids -- go nuts!


Keep the mug in your cubicle to use when you're at work. This way, you're less likely to lose or break it during transport and you won't be stuck without your morning cup of Joe if you forget it at home.
If you don't drink coffee and have no use for a mug, bring in a water bottle or other vessel for your favorite work time drink; the same tips apply.

, Decorating your desk or a shelf with small trinkets, figurines, toys, puzzles, etc. can be a great way to customize your cubicle while taking up minimal space. Anything you like to look at that isn't too distracting will qualify, just as long as it doesn't take up too much space.


Don't put any items in your cubicle that are exceptionally expensive. Cubicles are easily accessible to others; prevent the likelihood of theft by limiting your knick knacks to things you enjoy but that are not highly valuable.
Don't bring in items that you will want to have or use while at home, such as your favorite 3D puzzle or a figurine that is part of a larger set. The same logic applies here as to the coffee mug; it's easier to have your things assigned either to home or work.

, A desk plant will make the space seem more alive, more friendly, and will help purify the air in your workplace. Many potted plants are ideally suited to indoor living and are easy to keep alive. Avoid those that require intensive care.


Make sure the plant you choose will do well considering the lighting and temperature in your office cubicle. Some plants require lots of sunlight, so if you don't have a window nearby it's best to avoid these kinds.
Don't bring in any flowering or fragrant plants without first checking with neighboring coworkers to make sure they are not allergic.
Be sure to ask a coworker to water your plant if you will be away from the office for an extended period of time.
Keep a small spray bottle or watering can in your cubicle to help remind you to water your plant.

, It is usually not possible to keep a communal office temperature at a level ideal for everyone. You will work most efficiently if you are neither too cold or too warm at work. Plan ahead by keeping a small desktop fan and a small floor heater in your cubicle in case you need them.


Always check with a supervisor first before using a heater. The company may prohibit personal heaters for reasons of employee safety.
Do not use a fan or heater that creates excessive noise, as this may be disruptive to your coworkers.
If your heater has a timer, set it to turn off when your workday ends. This will eliminate the likelihood that you forget to turn it off when you leave for the day, which could pose a fire hazard.

, If your company-supplied desk chair is uncomfortable or broken, ask your supervisor if you can have it replaced. If the chair your company is willing to provide is unsatisfactory, look into buying your own. Sitting down all day can be tough on the body, and your productivity will increase if you are at least working from a comfortable chair.


If your company will not replace your chair and you cannot afford to buy one, look into accessories that may improve your comfort level. This could include a lumbar support pillow, arm rest pads, a seat cushion, etc.
If you purchase your own chair for use at work, be sure to keep the receipt so there is no confusion as to its ownership. You may also want to mark the chair or label it with your name.

, Some office environments are dimly lit or provide only fluorescent lighting. This can create a strain on your eyes and might even give your cubicle a drab, depressing feel. You can fix this by bringing in a lamp for your desk that creates more or better light in your workspace.


Make sure your light does not shine into neighboring cubicles, as this could be distracting to your coworkers.
Lamps with multiple brightness settings are ideal in case the lighting in your cubicle varies with the weather or if you prefer softer light in the mornings, for example.

, If your work desk has enough space to do so, you may wish to consider adding an adjustable desktop stand. These allow a portion of your desktop to be raised to standing height so you don't have to sit down to work at your computer. Having the option to stand while working can help you avoid the health hazards of sitting too much while at work.Make sure this accessory will work for your cubicle space. These are large items that may be too big to sit on your current desk.
Make sure you are not put in an awkward physical position by standing in your cubicle. For instance, you may not be comfortable having your head visible over the top of your cubicle walls while you stand to work.
Check with your supervisor or company IT professional to make sure it is okay to set your computer monitor and keyboard on a moving structure, as this creates the risk that company equipment could be damaged if your standing desktop were to malfunction or fall.

Get your team.,
Organize your team.,
Follow up your first meeting.",How to Create a Social Committee at Your Workplace," Tell your management that you want to start a social committee ask if it will be okay to advertise events and meetings in a mutually agreed location. Some employers allow their social committees to meet and organize events during working hours. If they do so, then do not abuse this privilege.


Firstly the committee will need members you will need at least a Chair Person, Treasurer and Secretary then an appropriate number of ordinary members.
Place sign-up posters to allow your work colleagues to sign-up to be on the committee. Don't forget to leave space to volunteer for the three posts that were mentioned;
, When you have enough names set a date and time for your first meeting.


Your First meeting. There is a lot to do at this first meeting so set up an agenda of all the issues that will be discussed during the meeting. This will allow the attendees time to prepare any research or information they would like to discuss at the time of the meeting.
Confirm Senior Committee members, as you set it up it is likely you will be asked to be conveyor, however any contested positions should be put to the vote.
Set up an account. The committee will usually require some form of bank account, so the next point should be to decide who will be the named holders; this is generally the treasurer and 1 or 2 other members of the committee.
Potential incomes, many social committees supplement their activities via various means, some provide pay-per-game pool tables in their staff canteens, others bake sales, at this first meeting the aim is to find out what people think will work at their work and give out assignments where necessary to secure these income sources.
Your first event. This is now the fun part, you get to plan and organize your first event, whether its something as simple as a company trip to the park or the dreaded Christmas night out, you can start planning it out.
Recap and close, the secretary should now recap everything that has went on during the meeting as well as highlighting the various tasks that have been assigned

, After your first meeting, you should give some time to allow people to get the jobs done that they have been assigned, around a fortnight is usually long enough before your second meeting. You have now set up your social committee, congratulations.

Don't take snide comments to heart.,
Talk to people.,
Accept the fact that is not that everyday is your lucky day.",How to Cope with Having a Bad Day at Work," Accept that nobody is a ""super-person"" and that mistakes happen when too much is attempted at any one time. Don't take to heart the mistakes that get made when juggling too much under time constraints; they are bound to happen.;
, If reformatting is stumping you, a legal issue has arisen and the support staff are whining about the milk supply all at once, it isn't a good idea to be their answer, at least not there and then. Delegate immediately to those best able to respond. You don't need to be a manager to delegate - cross-delegate to those colleagues who are clearly able to deal with the issues.

, Whether it's a good cry, sitting, deep breathing, stretching, or an air punch, get it all out in privacy. If this means going to the bathroom several flights above or below where nobody knows you, do it! If not the bathroom, take a 5 - 10 minute break outdoors and away from the place.

, Don't wallow in self-pity thinking the world is crumbling around you. If you don't understand something, don't want to do something or find something harder than you expected, it is not a shameful thing to ask for help. That is what others are there for. What people do hate is when a person neglects to seek help and then stuffs up.

, If a day is bad because you brought a bundle of home issues with you, sometimes nothing will turn that around. For some people, work is an escape from home issues but sometimes even for them, the enormity of something happening in your personal life is too large for work to help you forget. If you feel exhausted, teary, distressed and liable to explode and say inappropriate things, it is probably a good idea to call it a day and go home and sort issues out.

, If you are having a bad day because someone said something nasty to you, grin and bear it. It is important to not over-inflate the unhelpful or rude observations of colleagues who have a clear agenda to be disruptive, hurtful or unkind. Ask them to explain themselves if this feels appropriate and ask what it is you could do better according to them. But don't let this fester and make your day rotten.

, Just learn how to express your feelings to them. Burst it out, otherwise hatred will be keep in yours forever.

Explain the benefits to staff of cross training.,
Emphasize the element of cooperation.,
Set up times for staff to cross train.,
Provide back-up materials.,
Seek feedback.",How to Cross Train at Work," Any new initiative in a workplace should be explained, particularly in light of the benefits that it will bring to staff members. Also remember to alleviate any concerns about role usurpation, as sometimes some staff members might feel threatened. Benefits to emphasize include:


An opportunity to learn new skills that you don't yet have
Improved communications through better understanding of each others' roles and streamlined outcomes as a result
Improved knowledge and marketability of each employee who is cross-trained
Greater understanding of the company, business, or organization as a whole
Relief possibilities are expanded for sick leave, maternity leave, study and travel leave times;
, Probably the most important element of cross training is an increased understanding of what is involved in other people's roles. This tends to lead to increased cooperation because unknown or poorly understood work practices elsewhere in an organization can easily be viewed by some staff as presenting a hurdle or purposeful roadblock, or even be viewed as other colleagues' laziness or stubbornness. Cooperative approaches arise when staff have a more complete understanding of what processes, timelines, and challenges are involved for other colleagues they work with, however distantly.

, How you do this will depend on the type of work involved, time pressures, availability of staff, security clearances etc. However, in general, aim to have sessions where staff are performing their duties and other staff act as observers, followed by round table meetings which allow for a general question and answer session. Then swap!

, As well as observing the other areas of work being performed and talking to other colleagues, it is important that staff are trained in accessing materials online or in hard copy form where this is appropriate. This will enable them to do further reading to solidify the information that they have observed, and it also helps them to digest the processes that are followed elsewhere. Naturally, if such materials are classified or on a ""need-to-know-only"" basis, common sense will prevent such wide exposure but where it is possible to open up the knowledge to more staff, enable this.

, It is important to seek feedback on cross training. Find out what questions still remain, find out what concerns (if any) staff may have following the cross training, and ask for suggestions about future cross training. Use this information to improve the organization's cross training techniques and to keep staff up-to-date in the future.

Speak clearly and assertively.,
Listen to your co-workers.,
Avoid gossip.,
Ensure accuracy to build trust.,
Share information that’s specific and detail-oriented.,
Keep your communications brief.,
Respond to emails quickly.,
Follow up important conversations in writing.,
Ask questions.",How to Communicate Clearly Within the Workplace1," When engaging in direct conversation with your co-workers, use active verbs and simple language to make sure everyone’s on the same page.Avoid filler words such as “uh” or “um,” and don’t mumble.
Be concise. While it may be tempting to say things in a complex way to make yourself sound more competent, being too wordy can obscure your meaning. Don’t make things more complicated than they need to be.;
, Good communication is a two-way street. Ask open-ended (instead of yes-or-no) questions of the people with whom you work, and take note of their answers. Follow up with them and remain engaged in ongoing conversations.Follow up open-ended questions with more direct questions. This can help ensure that you and your co-workers are understanding each other clearly.
When a co-worker or supervisor communicates something complex to you, try repeating or summarizing the major points back to them. This will help you both be sure that you have understood what they are trying to tell you.
Personal conversations can provide a good foundation for more comfortable interactions about work. Your boss might tell you that their daughter is participating in a soccer tournament. A few days later, take the time to check in on how the tournament went.

, Whenever you’re part of a group of people who know things about one another, it can be tempting to talk about others behind their backs. This can only create negative feelings in the workplace, and it will almost certainly make it more difficult to communicate with your co-workers in a positive fashion. If you gain a reputation for being a gossip, people will stop trusting you, and may opt to avoid communicating with you altogether. Communication should be about building bridges between people, rather than breaking them down.

, Take the time to proofread your writing and double check your information. Spelling and grammatical errors can be a sign of laziness or lack of care, while mistakenly misrepresenting facts can lead to embarrassing results for you and your co-workers. If you develop a reputation for inaccuracy, your fellow workers may stop trusting your work.


This is especially important for written communications and visual presentations. When mistakes are written down, they’re easier for your audience to catch and harder for them to forget.
If you’re writing a really important message or document, ask one or more people to proofread your writing and check it for accuracy.

, Whether you’re writing an email to your supervisor or updating your boss on the status of your latest assignment, your co-workers want access to the most up-to-date and clear knowledge possible. If your colleagues know they can rely on you to provide specifics, they’ll come to you first with questions.It can be difficult to know how specific is specific enough. Take a critical look at your interactions, and ask yourself whether you’re leaving your fellow workers with more questions than answers. Don’t just say that a project is going well. Instead, inform your manager that you’ve reached or exceeded your selling goals, and provide them with exact numbers.

, The old adage that time is money applies to all profit-driven organizations. Make sure your spoken and written communications impart information as quickly as possible. While you should be sharing relevant details, do so without making your peers sift through unnecessary or redundant information.


Think about your audience and who needs what information. Your boss may only be interested in the bottom-line results of your work, while co-workers at your own level may need to know the challenges you met along the way.

, In today’s workplace, a large amount of communication occurs via email. Respond to emails within one to two business days, and don’t let your inbox get backed up. If your co-workers know they can rely on you for a quick response, they’ll be more likely to reach out with questions or comments.You should also find an efficient system for responding to calls and voicemails. You don’t have to be available at all times or return calls right away. However, you should designate a regular time for dealing with phone communications and be consistent about it.

, If you have an important work-related conversation over the phone or in person, send a follow-up email or memo. That way, you will have a written record of whatever was decided or discussed during the verbal conversation., If you don’t understand something, particularly if it’s something that pertains to doing your job, don’t hesitate to ask for clarification.

For example, if your boss has just given you a complicated assignment and you are not sure you understand your instructions, ask about the specific parts of the process you need help with. E.g., “Could you please tell me a little bit more about what I need to do after filing the report?”

Maintain eye contact.,
Maintain good posture.,
Ditch the electronics before and during in-person meetings.,
Smile to encourage open interaction.,
Use active body language when listening.,
Dress for success.",How to Communicate Clearly Within the Workplace2," When you’re having a face-to-face conversation with a colleague, focusing on their eyes and face is the best way to let them know you’re listening. If you extend your officemates this courtesy, they’ll do the same for you.Some people may find it difficult or uncomfortable to look directly into others’ eyes. Try practicing on friends and family, or focus on a spot on your co-worker’s face that’s very near their eyes.

, Slouching not only closes off your body, but it’s also associated with laziness and unprofessionalism. Try rolling your shoulders back a few times and opening your chest when you’re sitting and standing. You’ll look more approachable, and your back won’t hurt as much at the end of the workday.


If you’re unsure of what to do with your hands while speaking to another person, try resting them comfortably on your lap or on the table or desk in front of you. If you’re standing, try clasping them in front of you.
Always square your shoulders and face directly toward the person you are communicating with.

, If you’re waiting for a meeting to start, consider jotting down some notes rather than burying your nose in your phone. This will make it easy for you to immediately engage others in a conversation when they enter the room. Always keep your attention on the people with whom you’re communicating.


Do not, under any circumstances, check your electronics while others are speaking. This is the fastest and easiest way to shut down mutual respect, and it will surely affect your future interactions with your co-workers.

, Smiling will make your colleagues feel more comfortable around you, and psychologists suggest that it makes you happier on a day-to-day basis. While you shouldn’t paste a fake smile on your face every time you walk into the office, you can smile when you greet and thank people, or when they ask you how you’re doing. This will inject positivity and openness into your workplace., Nod and tilt your head when others are speaking so as to provide them with constant visual cues that you’re following along and engaged with the material. You can also take notes, making sure to periodically look up from your notebook., While everyone is entitled to their own personal style, wearing formal attire at work can lead to better communication between co-workers. Your superiors, in particular, may be more likely to take you seriously and interact with you as an equal if you’re dressing with care while on the job."
"
Look around at others’ work habits.,
Believe the compliments you receive.,
Make a list of your strengths and successes.,
Make a different list of your weaknesses.,
Learn from your mistakes.",How to Communicate Clearly Within the Workplace3," One of the hardest aspects of being confident at work is feeling like you’re not measuring up. Observe co-workers at your level, and take note of what they’re doing. Ask yourself if you’re putting similar care and effort into your own tasks.


If you are, reassure yourself that you’re doing what you need to do to contribute to the success of your organization.
If you fear that you are not putting in enough effort, select a role model or mentor among your colleagues, and model your work performance after theirs. Ask them for advice, if they are open to it.

, Most supervisors don’t give praise freely. If they’re giving you accolades for your work, don’t doubt that they feel you deserve it. Be sure not to diminish what you’ve accomplished by giving credit to someone else or saying that the task “wasn’t that difficult.”

, Writing down the things at which you excel will remind you why you were offered your job in the first place. This will also help you remember what you have to offer your colleagues. Being armed with this knowledge will make it easier for you to interact with them as co-contributors to the mission of your company.


Make a point of celebrating your successes. It doesn’t have to be anything elaborate. You could treat yourself to a drink with friends or a nice dessert after work, or just mark the occasion with a positive note in your journal or calendar.

, It’s just as important to be humble about how you can improve as it is to recognize your capabilities. If you’re aware of the tasks and skills that you find challenging, you can address them with a sense of calm preparedness. If your co-workers see that you’re self-aware about your faults, they’ll be more likely to share constructive feedback with you -- and to elicit it so they can improve themselves as well!


Talk to your coworkers about the goals you are setting for yourself. You might even ask them for feedback about your progress.

, Over the course of your career, it’s almost inevitable that you’ll make a mistake or have a bad day. Rather than dwelling on these mistakes, add them to your list of future spots for improvement, and view them as learning opportunities.

Learn how to read the DEFCON scale.,
Use DEFCON 5 for peacetime.,
Use DEFCON 4 for heightened alertness.,
Use DEFCON 3 for tense military/political situations.,
Use DEFCON 2 for major threats.,
Use DEFCON 1 for maximum alertness.,
Understand how DEFCON levels are assigned.,
Be aware of other US alert scales.,
Research the history of the DEFCON scale.",How to Understand the Defcon Scale," The DEFCON scale is a way of assigning a numerical value to the readiness of the American military. Higher DEFCON values are used for lower levels of readiness (during more peaceful situations), while lower DEFCON values are used for higher levels of readiness (during tenser situations where the possibility of military action is more likely). A DEFCON level of 5 corresponds to ordinary peacetime, while a DEFCON level of 1 (which has never been reached) corresponds to the most dangerous situations, like thermonuclear war.


Note that different branches of the military can be issued different DEFCON levels. For instance, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, which is generally considered one of the tensest moments in American military history, the Strategic Air Command went on DEFCON 2, while the rest of the military went on DEFCON 3., A DEFCON level of 5 is a very good thing — this is the condition used to designate normal peacetime military readiness. At a DEFCON 5, the US military takes no wide-scale precautionary defense measures beyond what is ordinarily required.


Note that DEFCON 5 isn't necessarily a sign that the world is at peace — conflicts, even major ones, may be occurring around the world during a DEFCON 5. However, in this case, the military judges that these events pose no significant defense threats.

, DEFCON 4 is the first level of readiness above the baseline value of DEFCON 5 and thus constitutes a fairly mild increase in readiness (though an increase from DEFCON 5 to DEFCON 4 is certainly significant). This DEFCON level signifies increased intelligence-gathering efforts and, sometimes, the heightening of national security measures. However, it is not usually an indication that the military (or the nation) are in imminent danger of attack.


In the modern world, it is thought that DEFCON 4 is sometimes issued after minor to moderate terrorist attacks and politically-motivated killings, or after would-be plots are uncovered. Presumably, this is done in anticipation of further violence as an attempt to prepare for and prevent it.

, Situations that call for DEFCON 3 are serious — though they may not pose an immediate threat to the existence or stability of the American state, they do call for significant vigilance. At this level, American military forces are put on a heightened state of alert in anticipation of mobilization — in particular, the Air Force is kept ready to launch operations with just 15 minutes of notice. In addition, all military communications may be encrypted based on classified protocols.


Historically, DEFCON 3 has usually corresponded to situations in which military action against the US or one of its allies was a distinct possibility. For instance, during Operation Paul Bunyan, which resulted in a DEFCON 3, two American officers were killed by North Korean forces in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). In this case, a DEFCON 3 was issued because of the possibility that any errors in the resulting standoff might trigger open war across the Korean border (a politically and militarily tense area then, as it is today)., DEFCON 2 refers to a further increase in force readiness just below maximum readiness. Combat forces are readied for major operations within just a few hours. An increase to DEFCON 2 is very serious — these situations carry a significant risk of major military operations against the United States or its allies, including the use of nuclear weapons. DEFCON 2 is typically reserved for all but the most militarily tense of international situations.


The most notable time that DEFCON 2 has ever been issued was during the Cuban Missile Crisis, although this declaration was limited to Strategic Air Command. It is though that this is the only time that a wide-scale DEFCON 2 alert has been issued, though, since DEFCON-related information is usually kept classified, it is not exactly certain how many times this level of readiness has been reached., DEFCON 1 refers to maximum military readiness — it is thought that forces with a DEFCON level of 1 are kept ready for immediate action at all times. DEFCON 1 is reserved for the absolute most dangerous, severe situations, including imminent or ongoing nuclear war involving the US or one of its allies.


Though, as noted above, DEFCON levels are usually kept classified until after the fact, it is thought that DEFCON 1 has never been issued for a branch of the US military before.
Some limited, unverifiable evidence suggests that DEFCON 1 may have been triggered for certain military units during the first Gulf War.If these claims are true, however, they only applied to individual units and not to entire branches of the military.

, The exact process that the military uses to declare a DEFCON increase is not perfectly-understood by the public. It is usually assumed that an upgrade in military preparedness is made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (the highest commanders in the American military) with the approval of the president. However, some anecdotal evidence suggests that top-level military leaders are able to increase the DEFCON level without the president — for instance, some sources report that the Strategic Air Command's decision to issue a DEFCON 2 during the Cuban Missile Crisis occurred without input from President Kennedy.Note again that the precise actions that the military takes at each DEFCON level are, for obvious reasons, kept secret. Thus, most of the information that the general public has on the DEFCON scale is based on old declassified documents or historical DEFCON ""spikes"" revealed to the public after the fact. Though some non-military, non-government sources may claim to know the current DEFCON level, there is no way to verify this., The DEFCON scale is not the only measure that the US government and military use to rate their readiness against external and internal dangers. These include LERTCON (used by the US and NATO allies), REDCON (used by individual US military units), and more.However, the most important alert scale besides DEFCON is likely the EMERGCON scale. These conditions (which have never been issued before) are thought to be issued in the event of nuclear war and include civilian directives as well as military ones. EMERGCON has two levels, which are:


Defense Emergency: Made in the event of major hostile attacks against U.S. or allied forces overseas. Issued by unified commander or higher authority.Air Defense Emergency: Made in the event of attacks against the US, Canada, or military installations in Greenland. Issued by the Commander in Chief of the North American Aerospace Defense Command.Note that, by definition, all military forces go to DEFCON 1 in the event of an EMERGCON being issued.

, Though much of the DEFCON scale's history is kept secret for obvious reasons, the declassified information that is available to the public is fascinating in its own right. Conceived in the late 1950s as a means of coordinating NORAD defense efforts between the U.S. and Canada, the DEFCON system has gone through several changes between its creation and its current form today.For instance, the original DEFCON scale had ""sub-categories"" for several DEFCON levels: ""Charlie"" and ""Delta"" under DEFCON 4 and ""Alpha"" and ""Bravo"" for DEFCON 3. In addition, it had an ""Emergency"" level above DEFCON 1 that greatly resembled the EMERGCON scale described above.

Realize that the victorious strategist is he who only seeks battle after the victory has been won.,
Understand that the control of a large force is no different than controlling of a few men, being merely the question of dividing the force.,
Know that to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence.,
Know that it is an essential in war to know when to attack.,
Know your enemy as you know yourself.In war, let your objective be victory and not lengthy campaign.,
Understand that the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy and does not allow his will to be imposed on him.,
Accept that soldiers must be treated with humanitarianism but controlled by the means of iron discipline.,
Believe that the general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service is a true jewel.","How to Understand and Apply Lessons from ""The Art of War"""," He who is destined to lose, fights first and then looks for victory. It is the acme of excellence to not only win, but to master winning at ease. The clever fighter makes no mistakes and establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated. He secures his position so that he may seem invincible and judiciously hides his weaknesses.;
, The true leader knows both how to utilize his resources and when to make a decision. He plans by making a combination of direct and indirect tactics. He combines his forces so that the enemy may bear similarity to an egg in the path of a grinding stone. Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.

, Supreme excellence consists of breaking you're enemy's resistance without fighting. It is better to recapture an entire army, establishment or company than to destroy it. Hence, the highest form of generalship is to foil you're enemy's plans. Second best is to prevent the junction of his forces. Next in order is to attack his forces in the field(direct encounter) and the worst is to conquer his forces. The rule is to avoid destruction if possible. The skillful leader subdues his enemies troops without any fighting. He captures their kingdom without laying siege to them. He overthrows their nation without lengthy operations. He triumphs without losing a man.

, If we outnumber the enemy, we attack them. When evenly matched, we may offer battle. When slightly inferior, we may overcome by superior strategy. If unequal on all accounts, we must flee. For a greater force will, in the end, overcome the inferior force. There are thus 5 essentials to victory... He will win:


who knows when to fight and when not to
who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.
who's army is animated by the same spirit throughout all the ranks.
who prepares and takes the enemy unprepared.
who has full control over his decisions.

, Avoid prolonged warfare. Invade your enemy's resources, for 1 quota of his provisions is equivalent to 20 of our own. Use your enemy's strength to augment your own.

, You can be successful only if you attack those points that are undefended and only defend those which cannot be attacked. Throw in you're enemy's way that which he cannot comprehend. This will force him to come out even of the darkest of shadows and reveal himself. Divide his forces and keep your forces concentrated. Scheme so as to discover an enemy's plan. Find his vulnerabilities. Compare your strength to his. Supreme strategy always aids the inferior side. Do not repeat those tactics that have previously gained you victory. Let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.

, Treat them as your own children and they will stand by you unto death.

, The question of using a strong or weak force is a question of studying the terrain. We must never enter an alliance with someone without studying their designs. It is only when an army is put in harm's way that it is capable of striking a death blow for victory. At first, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until he gives you an opening. Then emulate the rapidity of a running hare and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles without cultivating the spirit of enterprise. The enlightened ruler lays his plans way beforehand. The triumphant commander is he who has the foreknowledge and wisdom to manage his resources effectively and execute his plans without errors.

Know your suit.,
Look like everything else.",How to Use Your Ghillie Suit,";
, Human eye detects movement extremely well. If you just don't move, most of the humans don't even look in your direction.

, Non-camouflage boots can ruin your success.

, Crawling is always better than running.

, Naturally, they offer better cover.

, Add leaves and other plants in it while you have spare time. This makes you look like a bush... and that is exactly what ghillie suit should do.

, Know exactly what color it is and in which foliage it will blend. Otherwise you will be highlighted as something furry from the bushes.

, Camouflages mission is to make you blend, and make you look like everything else in the woods. Observe your environment and see how foliage grows. You want to look like you have always been there, part of the woods. Not some guy who is lying in the ground and pretending no one will see him.

Start a fitness plan.,
Remember, only you know what's best for yourself.,
Have a goal.,
If possible, take a course in the use of firearms.,
Learn some languages...at least one extra.,
Remember that these are just suggestions.",How to Train for Army Boot Camp," Don't focus on your weakness or your strengths, focus on EVERYTHING. Once you sign that contract, you are the property of the Army, and you complaining about sit-ups will just give them more reasons to make you do MORE sit-ups.


Even if you are pretty out of shape, you can get in shape...start our walking. Before long, one mile is a few miles!





;
, Don't start a plan you downloaded from a website for Olympic athletes if you know that's not your level. You'll just get discouraged and hurt yourself trying. Write your own plan. You want to join the Green Berets? Then that's the goal you're pushing for, and that's the last step. For example, start out trying to do 5 push-ups in a row. So, to do those 5, make a plan to do 20 over the course of the day. Remember, muscle doesn't heal while you take a break during an exercise, muscle heals while you sleep.

, Doing something like this gives you something to aim for, and will serve you well when you're taking that fitness test. It will also help boot camp become a learning experience with all that's being taught to you. You won't be physically exhausted and just trying to survive day to day.

, Of course, your instructors will teach you everything you need to know, but accuracy will help get you the Army job you want, commonly referred to as an MOS. Don't expect to get into Sniper School with a great smile.

, If you want to really excel in your career in the Army, take a few language courses and learn to speak something foreign to you. Not only will this show ambition on your part, but it will make you all the more valuable, and show that you're willing to get outside of your comfort zone.

, Take everything you see when it comes to your life, no matter what aspect of it, and take it with a grain of salt. Remember, recruiters from all branches have quotas, and they will do their best to distract you to get you to sign those papers. READ THEM: You don't want to end up peeling potatoes in Alaska in the middle of the winter or something like that that you'll hate.

Don't switch off days for strength and cardio, you won't get those opportunities in Ranger School to pick what you feel like doing. Do EVERYTHING, and take the next day off. That way, you'll learn how to function and perform with pain, even though your other muscles are still sore and aching. With your exercise plan, don't leave any exercises out. You may not like doing sit-ups or you hate push-ups, but you're the United States Army's for the length of your contract. The Army can't make you do anything, but they can make you wish you did.;
, Start off relatively simple, but include a lot of different exercises. Such a list might include: push ups, squats, lunges and other calisthenic exercises.

, Try to get access to a pool. If you join a gym, make sure you can get access to the pool, because you will have to pass Water Confidence Tests.

,, The recruiter can recommend books to study from.

, Just because you want to join a Special Operations force doesn't mean you can do 150 push-ups in a row. Take it easy, don't hurt yourself in a way that your muscle doesn't grow, and don't get discouraged.

, DON'T SIGN ANYTHING UNLESS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE.

, If you're positive about your decision, sign up, do the best you can on your entrance exam, and be a leader and a model soldier.

Be prepared.,
Train well for running.,
Learn to swim strongly.,
Focus on push-ups/sit-ups/pull-ups as the final exercise set.,
Choose a good quality, highly nutritional diet.",How to Train for BUD/S," Take the time to prepare for BUD/S in order to complete it and become a part of the elite group of Navy Seals. Before going to BUD/S, familiarize yourself with running, swimming, push-ups/sit-ups/pull-ups and maintaining a good diet. Upon acceptance into BUD/S, a Physical Screening Test (PST) must be completed. The test consists of a 500-yard swim done under 12.5 minutes, 42 push-ups in two minutes, 50 sit-ups in two minutes, six pull-ups without a time limit, and a 1.5 mile run in 11 minutes. These scores are just a minimum, so it is important to train hard to better your scores––the higher your scores, the better chances of completing BUD/S.;
, During BUD/S you will run many miles a week. Most of these timed runs will consist of four miles on the beach done in boots, and completed with a 32 minute minimum. Most candidates should be able to complete the four mile timed run right around 28 minutes. In order to get ready for the running in BUD/S, start many months before getting accepted into it. 


Start out running short distances at fast paces. This means running around two to four miles at six to seven minutes a mile. 
Increase your distance weekly between 10 to 20 percent, or when the distance is becoming easy for you. For example, start out running two miles, then add 0.2 to 0.4 miles the next time. Do not increase this by more than 20 percent throughout the process. Bear in mind that consistency is better than speed. 
Allow yourself two to three days off from running a week or try to run every other day. This does not mean you have to take a complete day off from exercise, just give your legs a break from running, in order to prevent injury at this time.

, Swimming is another essential skill you must master upon entering BUD/S training. The PST allows for a 500 yard swim of breast or sidestroke in under 12.5 minutes but really try to aim for a score of 9.5 minutes or better. 


Focus primarily on open water swims with fins. During BUD/S, you will be mostly swimming with fins on, so it is important to buy a pair of stiff fins, and to become comfortable with them while swimming.
Try to find access to a lake, or an ocean to gain the experience. First off, take the time to learn the stroke and master it. It is very important to be comfortable in the water. 
Swim between 1000 to 2000 yards a week. It is extremely important to master the stroke before adding length to your swims. Perfect form will help you gain speed and endurance.

, For the PST test you will need to complete 42 push-ups in two minutes, 50 sit-ups in two minutes, and six pull-ups with no time limit. These scores are minimums and will not do much for you if you are just hitting these marks. A competitive number for push-ups is 100, and 100 sit-ups, and 25 pull-ups completed. These should be your goals, because the higher you score on the PST the better you will make your chances of completing BUD/S. 


Complete these exercises at least four to five times a week. Given that the minimum scores should be exceeded, make those numbers your goals for the first week, and once you complete those, add to them. Then make your goal 100 push-ups/sit-ups, and 25 pull-ups, and once you hit that, keep going. Train yourself at this point to keep going. 
Practice makes perfect with these three exercises, practice them frequently, and master them just as you master the running, and swimming because they will be very important come time to go to Coronado and start your training.

, Diets are very important during this time of training and fitness preparation. During BUD/S you will be eating very fulfilling meals three times a day, and four meals a day during what is termed ""Hell Week"". Meals consisting of much more than you can eat are given due to all the calories lost through the exercises.


Eat healthy food. It is important to eat healthy, and in decent moderation. Do not eat junk even though you're training hard at this time. Good food will make you feel better and shape your body to be successful in your body weight exercises and most importantly BUD/S.  Failure to replace energy and fluids lost during one workout can really hurt you in the long run. 
For your diet, focus on carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and plenty of water. While you're training, increase you calorific/kiloujoule intake from carbohydrates. Be sure to consume 0.6-0.8 grams of proteins per pound of body weight while training. 
Be sure to drink plenty of water but mix in some sport drinks containing electrolytes to prevent over-hydration.

Evaluate the cost of a commuter pass or ticket.,
Think of the hours spent commuting.,
Measure how many miles you drive to work.,
Assess the cost of fuel and your car’s average miles per gallon.,
Consider the cost of parking.,
Calculate your annual commuting expenses.",How to Calculate the Cost of Working1," If you commute to work via train, bus, or tram, include the cost of the pass or ticket into your calculations. Some forms of public transportation have a flat fee per ride, while others charge a little less if your purchase a monthly pass. These costs can vary depending on your location. A monthly pass for the subway system in Boston, for example, costs $84.50 each month, or just over $1,000 every year.A monthly bus pass in Savannah, on the other hand, costs $50, or $600 annually., Whether you drive to work, take the subway, or walk, the time spent commuting should be included in your calculations to discover the cost of working. Even if your company only pays for 40 hours of work each week, you still spend additional time commuting to your job.If your commute is one hour each way, you will average 10 hours of commuting every week. This will mean that you are devoting 50 hours each work to your job.


If your base salary is $60,000, you may calculate that you earn $30 every hour if you work 40 hours each week. If your commute adds an extra 10 hours each week, you are really working 50 hours each week, which will decrease your hourly wage to $23.

, If you drive to work, you will need to consider how many miles you spend driving to and from work. The number of miles you drive each day will affect the cost of your car maintenance. Services can include changing the oil, rotating or changing the tires, replacing a battery, and changing transmission oil.The cost of a full service varies depending on your vehicle type and your location, but it can cost around $245 each visit.If your office is 25 miles away, you will drive at least 50 miles in one day. You will average at least 200 miles for each five-day work week, or 1,000 miles each month.
Mechanics will typically suggest that you should have your car serviced and have the oil changed every 5,000 miles or every three months—whichever comes first. If you drive 50 miles each day, you will need to have your car serviced at least four times each year, which can cost almost $1,000 each year.

, The cost of gas and the average distance your car makes on a gallon of gas should be considered. In 2016, the average cost of regular gas per gallon was $2.14.If your car has a 15-gallon tank, it can cost about $32 to fill-up your car. If you fill-up your car twice each month, that can cost you almost $800 in fuel each year.


A sport utility vehicle in the U.S. may earn 18 to 26 miles per gallon, while a smaller fuel-efficient car may get 40 miles per gallon.An S.U.V. with a 20-gallon tank that gets 20 miles per gallon can go 400 miles on one tank of gas, while a fuel-efficient car with the same sized tank may get 800 miles.
If you travel 1,000 miles each month going to work, you will need to fill-up your S.U.V. 2.5 times, while a smaller car will only need to be filled up 1.25 times.

, If you do not have free parking at your work, you will need to think about how much money you spend each month on parking. Consider the cost of your monthly parking permit, or think about how much you spend at a parking meter every day to determine the cost of parking.


If you have to pay a daily parking meter that costs $1 an hour, you will be paying $8 for an average working day, which can total almost $2,000 every year.
Perhaps there is a parking building near your employer’s office. If the monthly parking fee is $80 every month, you will need to budget $960 annually.

, The cost of commuting to and from work can add up quickly when you consider the cost of car upkeep, parking, or a monthly commuter pass. If you drive to work and spent $800 on fuel, $960 on a parking permit, and $980 on basic car maintenance, your annual cost of commuting will total $2,740.

Evaluate your monthly expenses.,
Assess the cost of work clothing.,
Consider the cost of food.,
Think about the cost of equipment.",How to Calculate the Cost of Working2," After you have deducted your taxes from your monthly paycheck, you will need to review the total and evaluate your other costs of living. From this, you will need to deduct monthly expenses such as your rent or mortgage, bills, groceries, insurance, and the cost of commuting.


If you earn $45,000 annually after taxes, you are left with a monthly payment of about $3,750. If you budget $1,500 for your rent or mortgage, $250 for commuting, and $500 dollars for all other expenses, you are left with $1,500 dollars from your monthly paycheck.

, When calculating the cost of working, it is important to think about the dress code. A U.S. survey showed that half of the respondents spent less than $250 annually on professional clothing, while another 35% spend between $250 and $749. When calculating the cost of working, consider how much you will spend on clothing.Other clothing items aside from business attire should be considered. Factor in the expense of wearing protective clothing for a construction job, for example.
If you are an actor and need to purchase clothing for auditions, photo shoots, or performances, calculate how much you pay toward those expenses., Think about the amount of money you spend each day or week on food. This could include your morning coffee from the café in the lobby, your groceries for making your packed lunches, or the cost of buying lunch in the cafeteria everyday.If you eat out for lunch every day, you could spend $2,500 each year.
If you pack you lunch each day, you may spend around $780 annually., The cost of supplies, equipment, or subscriptions you need to complete your job should be considered when calculating the cost of working. If you need a laptop to do work on the road or at home, you will need to factor in the cost of the device, your monthly home Wi-Fi bill, and any in-flight Wi-Fi connections you may pay for while traveling.


If you are a doctor, subscribing to an academic journal may be required so that you can stay up-to-date with new procedures and treatments for certain diseases. A digital subscription to the New England Journal of Medicine, for example, can cost you $189 annually."
"
Find out what tax bracket you are in.,
Write off clothing expenses.,
Consider itemizing work equipment.",How to Calculate the Cost of Working3," A percentage of taxes is taken out of each paycheck, and that percentage is determined by how much money you earn annually. In the U.S., single individuals who earned between $37,650 and $91,150 in 2016 paid 25% in income tax, while those who earned $190,150 to $413,350 paid 33%.If you are unmarried and earning $60,000 annually, you could be paying $15,000 in income tax every year, which reduces your annual salary to $45,000.

, If you are required to buy new clothing for your job, you may be able to deduct those costs when you pay your taxes. If the clothing is required for you to complete your job and is considered to be in line with industry standards, it may qualify as a business expense.Itemizing these purchases can help reduce the overall cost of working.


Be sure to save your receipts for your business attire purchases.

, When filing your taxes, think about any equipment or supplies that you purchased to complete your job. This can include laptops or other equipment, home office supplies, dues to professional organizations, or professional subscriptions, like a medical or engineering journal subscription.When itemizing electronic devices, however, it is important to consider how much of your time is spent using that item for work. If you are using it for work 80% of the time, then you can deduct 80% of the cost of that item."
"
Evaluate the commute.,
Consider an employer’s daycare or pet care benefits.,
Think about the company’s dress code.",How to Calculate the Cost of Working4," If you are offered two jobs, calculate the advantage or disadvantage of accepting a job that has a shorter commute. A shorter commute can help save on fuel costs, which is important to consider when comparing the pros and cons of multiple jobs.


Imagine that you have a car that has a 15-gallon tank and gets 20 miles per gallon. If gas is $2.00 per gallon, it will cost you $30 to fill up your tank.
You have been offered Job A, which has annual salary of $50,000 and requires that you drive at least 400 miles each week. To commute to this job, you will need to fill up your tank 1.3 times each month. At this rate, you will be spending $468 in fuel each year. Without factoring in other expenses, this will leave you with a salary of $49,532 annually.
Imagine that you have been offered Job B, which pays an annual salary of $52,000, but the commute requires that you drive 60 miles each day. In the same car, you will be driving 300 miles each week, or 1,200 miles each month, which will require that you fill up your tank once a week. At this rate, you will be paying $1,560 in fuel each year. Without factoring in other expenses, this will leave you with a salary of $50,440 annually.
Although there is a $2,000 pay difference between Job A and Job B, there will only be a difference of about $900 when you factor in the distance and cost of fuel.

, If you have a child or a pet, look into your employer's benefits regarding daycare or pet care. If Job A pays less than Job B but has daycare on-site or allows you to bring your dog to the office, then it may be more economical to accept Job A even if it pays less.


Doggie daycare can cost between $12 to $38 each day, depending on your location.To send your dog to daycare 5 days per week, you could be spending $3,120 to $9,880 every year. Imagine that doggie daycare is $8,000 annually in your area.
If Job A pays $52,000 annually but does not allow you to bring your dog to the office, you will be left with a salary of $44,000 annually without factoring in other expenses. If Job B pays $50,000 each year and allows you to bring your dog to work, you can save a significant amount of money.
The average cost of childcare in the U.S. is $11,666 per year.If childcare is offered in your workplace as an employee benefit, you could save around $12,000 annually. Imagine that Job A pays $60,000 annually but does not offer this benefit, but Job B, which pays $52,000, does. In this case, the cost of working at Job B would be more economical than accepting Job A, even if it does have a lower salary.

, Accepting a job that has a casual dress code can help reduce the cost of working, particularly if you do not need to buy new clothes and accessories. When comparing two positions, consider if you will need to buy new clothes and accessories, and how much this may cost you each year.


Imagine that Job A and Job B have the same commute and similar salaries. Job A will require that you spend $400 in business casual attire annually, while Job B will require that you spend $120 annually for casual attire. Over a five-year period, you could save $1,400 in work clothing if you accept Job B.

The first rule of thumb is this: Embracing deployment is far easier than fighting it.,
For new Soldiers, pay close attention to your DD Form 93 Emergency Data Sheet and your Soldier Group Life Insurance (SGLI) form 8286-A.,
For Soldiers with family, make sure your DD Form 93 and SGLI represents your wishes.,
For Soldiers who are divorced or will be divorcing their spouse-have it handy by the time you are notified of being deployed.,
For Male soldiers who have children out of wedlock-you must, within 30 days of the birth of your child, obtain your child's birth certificate along with a Court Ordered Certificate of Parentage or Statement of Child Support.,
Soldiers who recently gotten married or will get married- By Military Regulations, any changes of martial/family status must be reported to your unit and DEERS/ID Card, within 30 days to processes your spouse for Tricare Benefits.,
Single soldiers-ensure your wishes are taken care of by a responsible ADULT.Most single soldiers have their parents be their benefactors that will continue with the Soldier's wishes ""in the event"".",How to Survive a Combat Tour (Pre Mobilization)1," Use your energy wisely.;
, These forms are as important then your DD 214 Honorable Discharge paper because these forms will help The Army help you ""in the event"". Nobody wants to confront this possibility but you can never know when your death can happen. Your Unit Administrator (UA), the S-1 Personnel Clerk, your Soldier Readiness Team, and your Mobilization Readiness Team will assist you in formulating your forms.

, By regulations, if you decide to place anything less than 100% of your $500,000 Life Insurance, your spouse must be informed of this in writing. Make sure you discuss this with your spouse of the less amount of insurance before they receive the letter from the Army. Do not blindside them.

, You are still responsible for their well being even if you are physically separated by your former spouse. The Army is paying you Basic Allotment of Housing or BAH for the well being of your family that you are supposed to take care of. If you withhold that money from your former spouse and you have not legally divorce them, you will be subjected to a slew of Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)infractions and tons of bad karma throughout your career by being labeled a ""Deadbeat Soldier"". Bottom line-divorce her and pay child support or run the risk of losing your career.

, This document will legally prove that you are the father of the child. Generally, all soldiers with children must be entered in to Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) for their children to obtain TRICARE Health Benefits. Without these things, the Soldier will not gain BAH nor Health Benefits for their children. Finally, be sure to provide a special Power of Attorney for the mother of the child so she can continue to process the child's benefits by providing the Social Security Number when it is made. Contact your nearest DEER/I.D. Card facility nearest you for more information.

, Ensure you have an original/certified notarized copy of your Marriage Certificate, a certified copy of your spouses Social Security Card, and a certified copy of their Photo Identification (ie. State I.D or State Driver's License). Yet the shortest and best way to place your spouse in to DEERS/ID Card is to have both of you in person to not only to processes them but, also have them get their ID Military Card. Again, contact your local DEERS/I.D. Card station for their hours. At certain places, you might have to make an appointment.

, Military regulations does states that any beneficiary of entitlements must be 18 years or older to receive full benefits unless the beneficiary has an Agent on behalf of the Soldier's estate. For more information, contact your Unit Administrator or ask the Mobilization Site for advice.

To do this, you can take a PST. The PST (Physical Screening Test) is administered by the Navy to see if you have what it takes physically to complete the training. You can take a mock PST at home. All you need is a timer and access to a swimming pool.;
, The first event of the PST is the 500 yard swim. You can swim this using either breaststroke, or CSS (Combat Side Stroke, the recommended stroke). The current minimum time to qualify for a contract is twelve and a half minutes. A competitive score is around eight minutes.

, The second event is pushups. You must perform as many as possible in two minutes. Minimum score is 50, a competitive score is between 80-100.

, The third event is sit ups. It will be done with the same time as pushups. Minimum and competitive scores are the same as well.

, The fourth event is pull ups. This will be from full hang to your chin above the bar. You must perform 8, a competitive score is closer to 20. There is no time limit but you may not let go or touch the ground.

, The final portion is the 1.5 mile run. You must complete it in ten minutes thirty seconds. A competitive score is between nine and ten minutes. This will be performed in pants and boots.

, After you have taken your PST you can look at where you did well and where you need to improve to help form a plan.

, The U.S. Navy has built a Personal Training Guide (PTG), that is designed to help you ace your real PST for a contract. It is highly recommended to follow this program as it is designed by Navy Staff and BUD/s instructors, tailored to a SEAL candidate. The link to this is in the tips section.

, Most agree that running is both the most worrisome and taxing thing in BUD/s. This is because you will be running huge distances over the course of the day. Because of this you need a solid base of running before reaching BUD/s. This will help prevent injury.

, Another highly used option is to read the works by a former US Navy SEAL, Stew Smith. He has written multiple books on the subject and helps train aspiring Special Operations candidates, polices, and other national heroes.

, To succeed in BUD/s you must have an unfaltering desire to become a US Navy SEAL. If there is any doubt you will quit in BUD/s.

, By working hard you are paving the road for success.

, You are incredibly lucky to get to participate in these because they are considered rewards. Don't skip out on them. Enjoy them when they come around. If your school doesn't hold war games, suggest them about once a month.

, You can ask them why, but focus on improving yourself.

, Being given privileges and special treatment.

, If it's a Marine school or the Tactical officers (TACs) are mostly Marines, learn Marine Corps traditions and find out how to build rapport with them. Find out what those TACs did in the service and discuss it with them, especially if you feel that you want to join the military. Remember that the Marine Corps is the most elite of all US military branches, and Marine instructors will be the hardest to impress.

, If you are a good cadet and all of the people know it, when you get into trouble, they can help you out. This does not mean you can get in trouble often or abuse that person's trust, as he or she will end up losing faith in you. Make goals for yourself after graduation.

The time to prepare is not on the day of Mobilization.,
Pre-mobilization separates the ""Go's"" from ""No-Go's"" The phase usually starts with a Military Physical and Records check.,
When you wear that uniform, always wear your game face on.This is helpful for National Guardsmen/Army Reservist since we always seem to separate themselves from military and civilian.,
Attempt to include your family in military functions and Family Support Group functions.I see attempt since some wives do not want anything to do with the military.,
Stay away from irrational behavior.Basically, don't act stupid.",How to Survive a Combat Tour (Pre Mobilization)2," It actually starts months prior to to Deployment Day (or D-Day). This is considered Pre-mobilization phase where command has a ""Warning Order"" for a possibility that the unit will be called on to duty. For Active Duty Soldiers, they have a short time frame since it's their full time job to be prepare at a moment notice. For Reservist/National Guardsmen, it will take longer for them to prep for mobilization or MOB.

, The Military Physical is a comprehensive check to see if you are able to withstand the rigors of deployment. Depending on what Military Occupational Skill or MOS you have, if the job depends on good health, the Military doctors will ensure that if you have a medical condition, you will not be deployed. The Records check consist of making sure your military records are up-to-date and that your Family Care Plan is active and functioning. Also, if the you are getting close to Expiration of Tour of Service or ETSing, the Army Career Counselor will be knocking on your door to see if you want to re-enlist. Depending on the length of Mobilization, will depend if you will be deployed. If you ETS before the end of deployment, chances are, you will not be going or you might extend your enlistment to the end of deployment. So be aware of this before going.

, It can be hard to do when Reservist units get deployed when that the person who you used to call you Johnny from your work at the civilian office is now Sargent Smith during deployment-get use to it from day one of orders. Also, Active Component does not have that rapport luxury that Guardsmen/Reservist have so they may feel resentful towards ""fraternization"". They will call you out for it. So, be mindful of Military Bearing (or in civilian terms-respect of stature).

, It is their right yet, the helpfulness of the Family Support Group or FSGs can be helpful for young wives or wives who need moral support of those lonely days and nights. No family should be an island. Including your children will help understand why you must leave for a period of their lives. A Unit functions has fun things like live demonstrations, static displays of military vehicles and even the great army foods they serve. (as long as they don't serve Meals Ready for Eat (MREs)

, Many soldiers, young and old, have the belief that once they have mobilization orders at hand, they have the ability to be immune from stupidity. They want to drive 100+ MPH and flash their Military CAC card and act as if they have a get out of jail card. Last thing a commander wants is a person who has drama baggage looming at the end of the deployment. So, smart commanders will not deploy those drama king/queens. Mobilization to a combat zone must be focus on the mission. If a soldier's mind wanders around because the law is waiting at the end of the mobilization tunnel, because he forgot to pay child support throughout their deployment, that soldier is a risk to the unit. So, stay away from trouble and don't make trouble.

The Day of...Everyone loves a ceremonies.,
Have young children involve in the deployment process.",How to Survive a Combat Tour (Pre Mobilization)3," On the day of the order of mobilization will be the last day the soldiers and families will be together. On this day, families must be strong mentally as will as the Soldiers. Kiss them So-long and let them depart knowing that their family is taken care of. They're be crying. To soften the blow, let it flow. Soldiers-let your family run their course now, so let your spouse start taking care of children. Not only does being overbearing counter-productive but it provides a negative precedence to the one who will be in charge.

, For Soldiers who have young children above 5 years old, don't let them be excluded in being part of the deployment process. Kids need to be informed also of this major disruption in their lives. Ask yourself this question: How would you react if one day, your child waves their hand and just go out the door without telling you where they are going or when they come back? Set some time before you actually leave in telling them why you are going and when you should come back.(PLEASE DO NOT TELL THEM ON DAY OF!) Assure your children know that they are not the reason why you'll be leaving. Finally, provide them with responsibilities while you are going. It's always nice to tell your daughter to make sure to help out Mom in the kitchen or your son to dad take out the trash

Stand up straight.,

Bring your right arm up to the correct position.,
Raise your hand up to your brow.,
Modify the salute as appropriate for the headgear you are wearing.,
Hold the salute.,
Accompany the salute with an appropriate greeting.,
Lower your hand.",How to Salute Like a Soldier1," Use your best posture when saluting. Don't hunch over or let your shoulders droop. Stand with your arms straight and flat at your side and fingers pointed at the ground.;
, Turn your head and eyes toward the person or flag you are saluting. If you are saluting a person, it is respectful to maintain eye contact.


The person of lower rank should initiate the salute. By initiating the salute, the officer is not implying he is in anyway inferior to the superior. It is just a showing of respect and camaraderie., Bring your arm up so the bottom of your bicep is parallel to the ground. Your arm should remain straight, so your elbow is in a straight line with your shoulders.


A well-executed salute is a crisp, singular movement. Once you use a salute on a daily basis, it will become reflexive., Keep the outer edge of the hand barely canted downward so that neither the back of the hand nor the palm is clearly visible from the front. The hand and wrist are straight, the elbow inclined slightly forward, and the forearm is at a 45-degree angle to the ground. Keep your fingers and thumb straight and in line with each other.

, While the basic steps of the salute are quite similar, there are some small adaptations that you should make depending upon whether you are wearing headgear or glasses.


When wearing headgear with a visor (with or without glasses): At the command ""arms,"" you will salute with your right hand, touching the tip of your index finger to the rim of the visor, slightly above your right eye.If you are not wearing glasses and are wearing no headgear, or headgear without a visor, you will use the same precise movements, only you will touch your finger to the forehead, beside the outer edge of your right eyebrow.When wearing glasses, with no headgear or headgear without a visor: This time, you will touch the tip of your right forefinger to your glasses. Touch the part of the frame where the temple piece of the frame meets the right edge of the right brow., You should hold the salute until the commanding officer gives the ""At ease"" order.


During the National Anthem or other appropriate songs, you should hold the salute until the last note.

, Saying ""Good morning, Sir,"" or something along those lines is encouraged when you salute a superior. Perform the salute, then greet the soldier while holding the salute.


If you are reporting to the officer, you should identify yourself and state that you are reporting. For example, ""Sir, Private Jones reports."", Bring your hand directly down to its natural position at your side when dropping the salute.


Do not slap your leg or move your hand out to the side.
Any flourish in the salute is improper. If you perform a salute that is at all showy or lazy, it can be perceived as being a greater insult than not performing a salute at all.

Accept your emotions. Don’t bury them. Don’t worry about what other people think of you and whatever emotion you might be working through. Be gentle with yourself, and understand that for these first few days you’re going to find you aren’t quite yourself. And that’s okay. If you want to stay in bed and eat chocolate all day, do it!;
, Find something to focus on, no matter how small or big it may be. It can really help to find a project or a goal that will impact both you and your partner. Something like saving money for a long term goal you have together, like a house deposit or a holiday, can help you move forward but still feel connected to your boyfriend/girlfriend or husband / wife.

, Your difficulties with the deployment will come in waves. After that short Skyping session, you may ‘relapse’ and feel not at your best for a few days. Reward yourself for the small things, the little things you achieve, even if it’s just making it to work in the morning.

, Communication is key; don’t feel as though you have to work through the next few months on your own. Keep up good communication with your partner and friends and family. If you don’t feel able to, or prefer not to talk with friends and family, there are plenty of support groups available online and offline where you can talk to people experiencing the same things as you.

, Tell them the good and the bad. Make sure you have plenty to talk to and write to them about. Remember those goals that you set yourself, let them know what you’re up to.

Get in shape, learn to sew, do something to keep you busy, get you out of your comfort zone, and focused on something else. Find something you're passionate about.

, Get a pet, start a business, find something you can pour all that passion into. Don’t forget your partner, or show them any less affection, just try to think of now as a time to try something new and develop yourself.

, Discuss this with your partner prior to deployment, since they may have their own personal reasons and preferences for getting or not getting packages. If you do get the go-ahead from them, devote some time to assembling them. Pick up stuff day to day. Out on a lunch break, pick up one of their favorite chocolate bars. Having a clear out of your DVD collection? Send him a film you know you both enjoy. Try turning every day activities into ways to remember him/her and keep them involved in your life.

, See friends you don't get to see enough of. Even get out by yourself. Don't feel like you have to stay in Saturday nights because you'd usually spend them with your partner. Get outside, see the world, remember how beautiful it is. Even find activities and new places to go to to share with your partner when they return.

, Communicate with your partner as much as possible, but remember, you need to live for yourself as much as you live for them. Use this time for self development, keeping busy, and keeping happy and understand that while this time is challenging, and there will be good and bad days, it will only make your relationship stronger.

Understand the role of recruiting management software.,
Know that recruiting management software can detect specific keywords.,
Note that keywords may be weighted.,
Recognize that your resume will be ranked according to these keywords.,
Read the job posting carefully.,
Highlight potential keywords.,
Look for similar job postings.,
Research the industry for additional keywords.,
Add keywords based on your research.,
Include keywords in both full and acronym form.,
Place keywords throughout your resume.",How to Use Keywords to Strengthen Your Resume," Because companies receive so many resumes for their advertised positions, they sometimes choose to manage the early stages of a job search with software that automates and streamlines the process. Recruiting management software allows employers to limit the number of resumes they must read.;
, When you submit your resume online, recruiting management software scans it for whichever keywords the recruiter has specified. These keywords (“sales,” “closer,” and “cold calling,” for example) generally reflect the skills, attributes, and experience that a particular employer believes to be most important for the advertised job.

, Some recruiters assign a higher value to certain keywords. For example, for a sales job, an employer may specify both “closer” and “lead generation” as desired keywords, but one may be more important than the other. Having the keywords with the highest value will get you closer to the top of the list.

, Recruiting management software uses the number and frequency of keywords in your resume (along with the varying weights of each of these keywords) to determine your ranking in the applicant pool. Recruiters can then choose to read only the resumes with a high ranking, limiting the time they spend on each applicant. Hitting the right keywords on your resume increases your chances of getting it seen by an actual person, who may call you for an interview.

, Take the time to read each job posting in its entirety. You want to glean as much information as possible about the advertised position and about the type of person the company is seeking.

, As you read the job posting, take a moment to highlight words and phrases that seem especially important – generally, those are the words that reflect required or desired education, experience, and skills. The words you highlight will be your core keywords.

, The level of detail varies considerably from one job posting to another. If the posting for a particular job is short or lacks detail, spend some time finding and reading advertisements for similar positions in the same industry, even if you do not plan to apply for them. These ads may include helpful keywords that the ad for your desired position does not. Add these to your list.

, Every industry has its own particular set of keywords or buzzwords. In the hospitality industry, for example, a significant keyword is “RevPar” (revenue per available room). Placing these words in your resume (assuming you can do so truthfully) will increase the likelihood of making it through a first round of screening done by recruiting management software.

, Once you have identified important keywords in the job ad, other similar ads, and the industry as a whole, you can incorporate them into your resume wherever possible. This may even mean replacing certain words in your resume with keywords, a step that may make your resume appear more relevant to recruiting management software.

, Recruiting management software may be programmed to look for keywords in either the full form or the acronym form. To be safe, include both. You don’t want to be passed over because you wrote “ROI,” while the software was programmed to find “return on investment.”


A simple way to include both forms of a keyword in a streamlined way is to write out the full term, then follow it with the acronym in parentheses.

, Do not simply add every possible keyword to your skills section. In general, having keywords in multiple locations will increase your ranking. You can incorporate keywords in a number of ways. Try, for example:

using keywords in and below your heading. Add keywords like the job title to the beginning of your resume, and follow that with a brief list of three to five essential skills, which can also be keywords.






using keywords in your summary statement. Some resumes include a brief summary statement highlighting your qualifications for the job. If you use one, incorporate keywords to increase your perceived relevance.






using keywords in the skills section. Describe your skills with keywords whenever possible. This will make your qualifications read as more relevant to recruiting management software.






using keywords in the experience section. Whenever possible, include keywords in descriptions of your previous experience. Use as many keywords as possible for every job you have held.

Include an eye-catching summary statement in the title.,
Avoid making common mistakes.,
Make sure the resume name is the optimum length.,
Remember to capitalize each individual word.,
Use spaces, dashes or underscores between words.,
Include the most essential information, in the right order.,
Pay attention to the file format.,
Don't forget about the online resumes you upload to job sites.,
Realize that your resume title is the first thing a prospective employer sees.,
Know that an informative resume title will prevent your application from getting lost.,
Understand that a good resume name can be a powerful self-marketing tool.",How to Name a Resume," Your name is unique to you, so it's important that it is one of the first things you tell your employer. Make sure your name is always at the start of your resume title. This will make your resume much easier to manage and keep track of when it is in the hands of the employer.


When considering formatting make sure to pay special attention to the title and make it stand out, you want it to be the first thing the employer’s eyes are drawn to.
If your application is electronic don’t forget to include your resume name in the title of your document. The title should read something like ""JaneDoe.doc"".;
, So you’ve already put your own name in the title, which will help to differentiate your resume from other applicants. However, you still need something more. Creating a summary statement to add to your title will grab the employer’s attention by showing that you have read the job description thoroughly and have the skills or experience they are looking for.


A summary statement is a few words to sum up the information in your resume. For example, if an employer is looking for someone with experience and success in negotiating and your resume has told them that you have those skills, you can name your resume ‘Jane Doe Resume – Negotiating Expert’.
If you are applying for a job where the successful candidate must have a high level of Microsoft office skills you can name your resume ‘Jane Doe Resume – 5 years MS Office experience’

, Imagine yourself in the employer’s position. Wouldn't it be tedious to read endless pieces of paper all named ‘resume.doc’ and all following the same format? Unfortunately, most people aren't aware of the importance of resume title, so they tend to fall into a number of common traps, which include:



Generic Name: Don't send a resume to a recruiter or employer that's called ""resume.doc"". How many such documents do you think the recruiter already has with the same title? Wouldn't it just be easier for them to move on to the next candidate?

Resume Year.doc: When your resume carries a specific year you run the risk of appearing outdated. For example, sending a resume titled ""resume2010.doc"" will make it appear as if the last time you updated your resume was 2010. Even if the resume title mentions the current year, your job search may look like an annual activity, and you may not bring much stability to the table.

Prospective Employer Resume.doc: This option is better than the previous two, but when you save your resume file name with the company’s name that you are applying to, please make sure that you spell it correctly. Otherwise, the recruiter will not be impressed. The other important factor to keep in mind is that you remember to change the name before sending it across to another employer.

, Make sure the file name is of optimum length so that it can be viewed properly in all operating systems. For example, some systems only show the first 24 characters (o the including spaces); others may wrap it to the next line. So it is safe to keep the file name short so that it is properly visible in all systems.

, Use proper capitalized words to distinguish between words and also not give the recruiter the feeling that you are a little careless or lazy and couldn’t bring yourself to press the shift button.

, These will allow you to distinguish between the different words in your file name. For example, “Joe-Smith-Sales- Manager-Resume” or “Joe_Smith_Sales_ Manager_Resume.""

, It is important to use the important pieces of information in your file name such as the file type (resume/ CV) your name, the key role. You must even use the right order to prioritize the most important words from a recruiter’s prospect.

, Along with the right name, the file extension matters too. Using most commonly used PDF files are a much better idea than a .docx or even a .doc file. This minimizes the risk of your document losing its smart formatting or looking garbled on the hiring manager’s computer.

, While you take care to send all your resume email attachments, remember to pay attention to your online resumes too. All job sites have a different method of storing and sending your resume, ensure that you name your file accordingly, to make the most of this opportunity too.

, Today’s job market is a tough one. You have to present yourself to potential new employers in a way that shows that you know what they want and you are the perfect person for the job. The first thing an employer will see about you is your resume title, so it's important to make it good.

, Including your name in the title will make administration easier for the employer and it will ensure your resume stays visible during each stage of the hiring process. Including a summary statement tells the employer you have the skills they want.

, A good file name for your resume is a great marketing tool which you can use to create your mark on the hiring manager’s computer. By naming your resume something like ""Joe-Smith-Sales-Manager-Resume"", you are drawing your recruiter's attention to your name and skills every time they scroll through their database.


When you do this, you are standing out, effectively waving to them, and not giving them a single opportunity to miss your resume. It also tells them that you are serious and clear about your career goal.
Additionally, if you are applying for a sales or marketing job, your resume marketing expertise might just earn you that extra edge over the competition. The employer may feel that if you can’t market yourself well, you'll be unable to sell their products or services effectively. By promoting yourself well, you are demonstrating good marketing skills.

Understand why you should add course work to your resume.,
Make a list of all educational degrees and completed course work.,
Note any degrees or courses you are currently enrolled in or in the process of completing.,
Be honest about your course work.,
Select the courses you feel pertain to the job you are applying for.,
Create a separate section for your education on your resume.,
List advanced degrees or courses first.,
Include honors, rather than graduation dates.,
Use internships and volunteer positions to enhance your course work.",How to Mention Relevant Coursework in a Resume," Mentioning course work on a resume gives potential employers an idea of the relevant knowledge and proficiency you have acquired and any knowledge you are working towards in your current studies. You should only include course work on your resume that applies to the job you are applying for, as this will show the hiring manager that you understand the job or position and have the necessary skills to do the job.


Most employers will look at your course work to get a sense of your level of expertise in a certain field or on a certain subject. Recent graduates looking for a job or current students looking to build their resume through an internship should always include relevant course work on their resume. Your course work could make up for your lack of hands on experience in the industry.;
, Start by making a list of all your education degrees and all course work you completed in your degree. This will ensure you do not forget any classes you have taken and have a larger sense of your educational background. You can then whittle this list down to focus on more relevant course work for the position. List the main degree earned first, followed by any specializations, the university where you earned the degree and where the university is geographically located. For example:


Masters of Business Administration, Specialization in Marketing, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.

Certificate in Dental Hygiene, Specialization in Dental Cleaning, Hudson Community College, Hudson, New York.


, Maybe you are in the process of completing your master’s degree or have just started a training course. Always list any in process course work and note the planned completion date of the course or degree. For example:Masters of Business Administration, Marketing, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Anticipated completion: June 2017.
Certificate of Computer Coding, Hudson Community College, Hudson, New York. Anticipated completion: June 2018.

, Once you list all full educational background and course work, it may feel a little light or thin in relation to the position you are applying for. However, it’s important not to lie or fabricate course work on your resume. Your employer may ask you about this course and you may then be in a position where you have to be dishonest in your interview. This could then lead to not getting the job due to references that do not confirm your false education.Rather than try to put false course work or credentials on your resume that you in fact did not earn, use any advanced courses you completed during your degree to bolster your resume. Focus on enhancing the degrees and course work you have earned, rather than representing yourself falsely to potential employers.

, Look over the detailed list of your educational history. Consider what courses would apply to the position or job you are submitting your resume for. Do not list every course you have taken or every degree you have. Instead, tailor the education section to the position and only choose the most relevant courses.


If you are a communications major, for example, applying for a social media internship and you have taken some social media communication classes, those would be considered relevant. But if you are an Engineering major applying to work at a pizza parlor, most of your classes are likely not relevant and do not belong on your application for that job.
Keep in mind your core degree may not feel relevant, but courses taken as part of the degree or as an elective during school could show the employer you have the necessary skills for the job. For example, if you are seeking a position at a company in Human Resources then having a major in Human Resources, with courses taken on finance and payroll, may make you a suitable fit for a role such as Compensation and Benefits in the Human Resources department.

, List your education details before your work experience if your education feels stronger and more relevant to the position.


Title the section: Relevant Education and Course Work.

, Standard resume formatting is to list the most recent courses or degrees you have received and then continue the list in chronological order. But, if you have an older course that is more relevant to the position, or shows you have more advanced skills in a certain field, list these first. This will show the employer your relevant credentials up front.


For example, you may have earned a degree in English, but are now studying graphic design at your local college. If you are applying for a position at a graphic design firm, list this educational experience first, before your English degree.
You do not need to list the course number for each course, as the employer likely has no idea what these numbers mean. Keep the list of courses short and concise.
An example degree and course work listing on your resume may look like:
Bachelor of Science in Genetic EngineeringBrown University, Providence, Rhode Island
Expected completion date: 05/2017
Relevant Course work: Lab Testing & Reporting, Genetic Manipulation, Social Implications of Genetic Engineering.



Another example for a course, rather than a degree, might be:
Advanced Studies in Marketing and AdvertisingHudson Community College, Hudson, New York
Expected completion date: 05/2015



, You should only list graduation dates if you are a recent graduate, one to three years out of school, or if you are in the middle of completing a degree or course. The potential employer will be more interested in the degree, not when your earned the degree. This is especially true if you earned your degree five to ten years ago, as you don’t the employer to think your education is stale or outdated.


It’s also not necessary to list your final GPA for a degree or course, as most employers will not notice the score. But if you graduated with high honors, such as summa cum laude or with honors, make a note of this in your resume. The reviewer of your resume will see honors and be suitably impressed.
An example might be:
Bachelor of Science in Anthropology, Graduated with HonorsConcordia University, Montreal, Quebec
Relevant Course work: Advanced Topics in Social Anthropology, Research and Investigation, Advanced Studies in Ancient Cities.




, If you feel your resume is still light on relevant course work for a position or job, include any relevant volunteer experience or in the field experience in the form of an internship or an apprenticeship. This could be college related volunteer work with an organization you completed in your final year of school, or an internship with an organization that relates to the position you are applying for.


For example, if you are applying for a position at an aerospace engineering firm, you may list your internship at an aerospace research facility. Or, if you are applying for a social media position at a marketing company, you may list volunteer experience as the social media director at a local festival.

Create multiple resumes highlighting specific skill-sets.,
Upload your resume to the job site.,
Build your resume on a job site.,
Take advantage of the free tools that job sites offer when you post your resume.,
Use a resume posting service or a resume distribution service.,
Research different resume posting services to find the best one for you.,
Don't use this type of service if you want to personalize each resume.",How to Post Your Resume Online," There are tons of job sites, so you should do some research to find the job sites that are the best fit for you. Some job sites cater towards marketing jobs, some job sites cater toward retail or management. When you carefully choose which job sites to post your resume on, you'll be aware of the exact job market that you are creating your resume for.


Ask people in your field about the best job sites to find new employment.
Ask your former teachers or professors on input where to post your resume.
Some people choose to blast their resume out via every job site – which is fine – but selecting a few particular job sites allows you to be specific with each resume you send. Customizing your resume for a specific job or employer increases your chances of being called.
Search the internet to find the right job sites for you. If you're looking to work in marketing, search ""Best job sites for marketing."" You'll get some good search results to look through.
Some of the most popular job sites include Indeed, LinkedIn, CareerBuilder, Monster, ZipRecruiter, and The Ladders.;
, Job posting sites are slightly different from job sites, as the employers list the jobs they're looking to fill themselves. These type of sites allow you to filter what type of employment you're looking for (full-time, part-time, freelance, etc.) in your specific geographic location. When you find jobs you're interested in, you can send in your resume directly to the employer (usually by email or upload form).


Some examples of job posting sites are Craigslist.com, SnagAJob.com, and USAJOBS.gov., Don't limit yourself to just one job website, as that will limit the number of responses from potential employers. Each job site lists available jobs from particular websites or companies, so posting to multiple job sites will give you access to a larger amount of job openings. Each job site also has a different set of search options that will give you different results.


There are some job sites that are specific to certain industries. If you find job boards for your industry, be sure to post your resume on them to increase your odds. For example, MarketingJobs.com and TalentZoo.com are great job sites for the marketing industry.
The more job sites you are on, the higher your chances of being found by your future employer., All resumes should include your contact information, your employment history, your education, and your special skills. Your resume must have all of these components for it to be seriously considered by a potential employer.


For your contact information, include:

Your full legal name
Your email address
Your phone number

Do not include your physical mailing address in resumes you plan to post publicly online.


For each job, list:

The name of the company you worked for.
Your start and end date.
What your job responsibilities were.
Your major accomplishments at that job.
Your manager's name and contact information.


For your education, include:

The name of the college you attended.
The year you graduated.
Your major and minor.
Any honors you achieved while at school; i.e. the Dean's List.


If you have any notable skills, list them in your special skills section. These skills may include foreign languages, musical talents, computer programming knowledge, writing skills, etc.

, Keeping your resume 1-2 pages long is ideal. Potential employers don't want to look through lengthy resumes, so it's best to only include the most recent and relevant information.


Use a professional font (Helvetica or Times New Roman, for example), and keep the text between 10pt font and 12pt font., Some of the components of your resume will remain the same with every job you apply to, but some elements should be changed to better fit the job. You should cater your resume to highlight your skills for each type of job you apply to.


For example: If you are applying for a job in HTML, highlight your HTML and computer programming skills. But if you are applying for a copywriting job, highlight your writing experience, and list your knowledge of HTML as a skill.

, If your resume is long, you may want to consider preparing multiple specialized resumes for each type of job you would consider. This allows you to customize your resume to a specific type of job.


Instead of highlighting all of your skills on one resume, highlight the relevant skills to a particular job on each specific resume. This will be more appealing to potential employers.
For example, say you have experience in the restaurant industry and in the marketing industry. Cater one of resumes to your restaurant experience and one of your resumes to your marketing experience., To do this, you must first create your resume on your computer. Programs like Pages or Microsoft Office usually offer pre-made templates for you to follow while building your resume. Once you've created your resume, be sure to save it to your computer so that you can easily upload it onto job posting sites.

, Many career building sites have what they call a Resume Builder section. These resume building platforms help you to include all of the necessary information in a proper resume format.


You'll need to gather your job history and past employer's contact information, your education, and your special skills., Many job sites have automatic search engines that look for jobs matching your interests. Many career sites can also be setup to email you a list of matching jobs as they are listed.

, A resume posting service does the work of actually posting your resume to numerous job sites, saving you a great deal of time. Using an outside service also allows you to focus your time on less tedious methods of job searching, such as sending in specific job applications for your ideal jobs.


Most of distribution services cost between $50 - $100.

, Some sites send your resume out by email to employers and recruiters, some sites fax your resume to employers, and others actually post your resume online as if you had done it yourself. You may want to use one or more of these types of services., If you're applying to a variety of jobs, you'll want to cater your resume to each type of job. However, if you're applying to numerous jobs in the same field, this type of service may be right for you.


For example, if all of the jobs you're applying for are in retail management, your resume will most likely be the same for each job. In this case, it's a good idea to use a resume posting service.

Identify relevant references.,
Ask for permission to use someone as a reference.,
Provide your reference with helpful information.,
Format your document.,
Include necessary information for each reference.,
Print on high quality paper.,
Submit your references.,
Request recommendations on LinkedIn.",How to Provide References1," You want to provide a potential employer with the names of people who can speak highly of you. However, your references need to have relevant information to share. Don’t put down the head of your department as a reference simply because they have an impressive title.Former bosses and colleagues make good references. However, if you’re fresh out of school, you can ask volunteer directors, faith leaders, or even professors.You also might not want to use former supervisors. Be prepared to explain to the hiring manager why. For example, your older supervisor might not have really managed you, or you didn’t get along. Instead, provide the name of another senior-level person you worked closely with.;
, Call them up or stop in and tell them you’d like to put them down as a reference. Also check if they can give you a strong reference. Some people are afraid to say “no,” so they might hesitate. Cross them off your list.


Remember to ask ahead of time, especially if you need a written reference. Give at least two weeks’ notice.

, For example, you should probably give them an updated resume as well as information about the job you are applying for. If you have a copy of the job description, share that as well.


Ask if the reference needs any other information. If you haven’t worked for them in a while, then they might need to be reminded of important projects you worked on.

, You should type up your reference list. Open a blank word processing document and set the font to something comfortable. It should be the same font that you used on your cover letter and resume.


You should have the same letterhead information at the top of the page. Include your name, address, and contact information. You can take your cover letter and delete everything but the header information., You should have at least three references, preferably from your most recent job. However, you might want to include more, in case the hiring manager cannot reach all of your references.Include the following information for each:name
title
company name
business address
email address
phone number
a short description of your relationship

, Use the same paper you print your resume on. Ideally, use ivory or white paper and make several copies for an interview. More than one person might be looking at the list., Unless requested, you don’t need to mail in your reference list with your CV or resume. Also, you shouldn’t write “References upon request” on your resume.Instead, hold onto your references and give them to your interviewer.


Some fields (such as education) require that you submit references ahead of time. Check the job advertisement to see if references must be submitted before the interview.

, Go to your profile page and click on the “More” icon. Select “Request a recommendation.” You can request recommendations from three connections at once. You can receive an unlimited number of recommendations in total."
"
Ask to submit an “updated” resume.,
Choose how to phrase your request.,
Correct the “mistakes” and submit a truthful resume.,
Express your sincerest apologies for any misinformation.,
Accept the consequences.",How to Proceed when You Lied on a Resume1," If you have submitted an untruthful resume and are now having second thoughts, you can consider asking to submit an “updated” resume. This way, you can correct any lies or half-truths before you get called for an interview. This will allow you to proceed through the application process with a clear conscience.


If you choose to do this, remember to bring the updated resume to the interview, rather than the old version that contains the lie.;
, At this point, you can choose to be vague as to why you would like to submit an updated resume because you have not made a tremendous amount of contact with the company yet. This can be good if you do not wish to outright admit that you lied on your resume. You can simply say:


“After looking over my resume, I discovered some information that I would like to edit. Can I send you an updated resume by this afternoon?” Again, you are not admitting that you lied on your resume, just that you would like to make some changes.

, Edit your resume in a way that is now truthful but not obvious that you lied. Changing numbers or dates here and there is fine. However, eliminating false job duties, accomplishments or entire jobs may be noticeable and will raise questions. It may be best to rephrase these things to be truthful.


For example, instead of eliminating “Increased sales by 30% in 3 months” you can say “Contributed to a 30% increase in team sales”. This is not saying you personally increased sales by 30% but you contributed to that overall growth.

, Asking to submit an updated resume may be a red flag to an employer. Issues with trust and your ability to check your work before submitting are just among the few questions that may arise. You should consider apologizing for any inconvenience and submitting an updated version as soon as possible.

, After viewing your updated resume, it may be apparent that you lied on your initial resume. Again, this goes back to a trust issue. It is now up to the employer as to how they would like to proceed. They may choose to end your candidacy and you must accept the consequences and respect their wishes.

"
"
Check with your company.,
Ask for details.,
Review the person’s performance.,
Format your reference letter.,
Identify your relationship with the candidate.,
Describe exceptional skills.,
Provide examples and detail.,
Conclude your reference letter.,
Revise your letter.,
Give an oral reference instead.",How to Provide References2," Many companies have strict policies regarding references. You need to find out ahead of time if you can give one. Ask Human Resources.


If company policy prohibits references, you should consider giving a reference in your personal capacity. This means you won’t use the company’s letterhead., Once you agree to write a reference, ask if you need any information from the candidate. For example, they can provide you with an updated resume.Alternately, they might draw your attention to a project they are particularly proud of.


Check the deadline. Don’t procrastinate with your references. Starting early gives you a chance to outline your letter and think about what you really want to say.
Identify the type of reference. For example, you might be providing an employment letter or a character reference for someone. These differ somewhat.
Ask who will receive the letter. The requester might want a generic letter, or they might need it for a specific job.

, Refresh your memory about the person’s strengths and weaknesses. Also take another look at any projects they completed, as well as their performance reviews.If, after review, you realize you can’t provide a strong reference, then you should tell the requester.

, Set up your reference letter as a standard business letter. You should print it on company letterhead, so leave room at the top of the first page. Subsequent pages do not need to be on letterhead.Ask the requester who you should address the letter to. If it’s a generic letter to use more than once, you can use “To Whom It May Concern.”

, In the first paragraph, you need to identify yourself and how you know the candidate. For example, you may have been someone’s direct supervisor. If you no longer work with the person, state that information as well.For example, you can write, “I enthusiastically recommend Ellie Smith for the position of project manager. During the four years I supervised her at the Department of Health and Human Services, Ellie impressed me with her commitment and problem-solving skills. Although she has not worked for me in two years, I still remember the positive impact she made.”

, A positive reference must be concrete. You need to identify skills or abilities that make the candidate a great person to hire. This might require some brainstorming on your part. For example, think about times the person really pulled through for you. What skills did they rely on?


Many employers are looking to hire people with excellent communication skills.Accordingly, you should mention how well the person writes and verbally communicates, if possible.
If you’re writing a character reference, then you should identify traits instead of skills. For example, you might have been asked to write a reference letter for a friend who is looking to adopt. In this situation, you can highlight their patience, comfort with children, and stability.

, Your reference cannot be a string of conclusions. Instead, you need to support your statements with detail. It’s okay to say, “Terri is a tremendous worker,” but it’s better to explain why you think Terri is dedicated.


For example, you can write something like this: “Terri is a tremendous worker. During the first six months, she did the work of two people when her co-worker was out on maternity leave. Terri came into the office on Saturdays and stayed late most days of the week. For example, when a client needed an emergency presentation, she was able to pull it together in about a week when two or three weeks is standard.”
Remember to tell the truth. You might be excited to help someone out. Nevertheless, your glowing recommendation must be factual.Make sure you can back up everything you say with evidence, such as stellar performance reviews.

, Sum up your impressions of the candidate and enthusiastically recommend them for the job. Include your phone number or email so that the hiring manager can call you with follow-up questions., A poorly-written letter reflects badly on you and the candidate. Put the letter aside for a couple days and then analyze it afresh. Rewrite awkward sentences and provide more detail if necessary.


Proofread it to catch typos, missing words, etc. Also ask someone else to read the letter. A second set of eyes can catch small errors.
When the letter is finished, print it off and sign it. Hold onto a copy for your records.

, Often, a letter isn’t necessary. Instead, the candidate will put your name down on a list and the hiring manager will call. You should still prepare by reviewing the person’s resume and performance evaluations.


If the manager asks something you don’t know, then say so. For example, you might be asked about the person’s salary when you didn’t have access to that information.Some hiring managers might try to obtain information they shouldn’t. For example, they might ask questions about the candidate’s religion or marital status. You should decline to answer questions of this nature, since they are illegal.
You are likely to be asked about a person’s weaknesses in a telephone call. Identify something that the person has worked to correct. For example, you can say, “Terri didn’t have much experience working with spreadsheets when she started, but she took several courses.”

Try to get out of providing a negative reference.,
Agree to provide basic information.,
Consult with an attorney.,
Be accurate.,
Have the candidate sign a release.,
Draft a company reference policy.",How to Provide References3," If you can’t give someone a positive reference, then try to decline. This can be difficult. You might never have been honest with the person that you didn’t think they were a good employee and now you find it difficult to let them know.


Claim to be too busy. Apologize but state you’re swamped and can’t handle a reference right now. This is a good excuse if you’re asked to write a reference.
If the person no longer works with you, gently remind them that more recent employers would make better references.
Ideally, you will simply say, “I’m sorry, I can’t give you a positive reference, John” or something to that effect. This puts the person on notice that they shouldn’t put you down as a reference., You can always agree to provide only basic information. This is the easiest information to provide and protects you legally from a lawsuit. For example, agree to provide only the following:job titles
dates of employment
final salary

, Some employers have been sued for defamation for providing negative reviews which cost someone a job. Defamation is a false statement that intentionally harms someone’s reputation.If a bad employee has asked for a reference, you should meet with your lawyer.


If your business doesn’t have a lawyer, then get a referral from your local or bar association.Ask for a lawyer who specializes in labor and employment.
Discuss your options with the lawyer. Your options will be limited based on the law in your area.

, Truth is a defense to defamation, so you can protect yourself by always being accurate. Look through the employee’s performance reviews and personnel file to see if there are notes about the employee’s bad behavior. This evidence can help back up what you are writing.


The hiring manager is also entitled to an accurate reference. In fact, if you commit a misrepresentation, you could be sued.For example, you can’t accidentally claim an employee was a supervisor when she wasn’t.

, You can protect yourself legally by requiring the candidate to sign a release of liability. You can find samples online. With a release, the person agrees not to hold you responsible if they don’t get the job.The key language in a release is the following: “I hereby release ABC Corporation, and its employees and officers, from any claims, damages, or liabilities of any kind, that may directly or indirectly result from the release, use, or disclosure of such information by any person or party arising from the employment reference.”, Your employees should know your reference policy. Draft one and publish it in your employee handbook or manual. For example, you might create a company policy only to provide basic information about employment unless the person signs a waiver form.


Consult with a labor and employment lawyer to discuss the ideal policy for your company.
For example, you might want all references to come through one person in Human Resources.This person should enter reference requests in a log so that you can track them."

Explain to the recruiter or manager that you lied.,
Be sincere.,
Give brief reasons for lying.,
Express your understanding of their decision moving forward.,
Keep quiet and listen to what the employer has to say.",How to Proceed when You Lied on a Resume2," If you reach the interview stage and the hiring manager asks you about something in your resume that’s not true, resist the temptation to maintain the lie. Coming clean will make you feel better and show that you want to do the right thing.


Understand that you may no longer be considered for the job or, if you have the job, that you may be terminated.

, Expressing your deepest apologies for your actions may help you in this situation and may ease the feeling the employer will get from being lied to. You do not need to overly apologize. Just a simple, “I’m sorry for my actions” will do, so long as they are sincere words.

, Some potential employers may want an explanation so they can understand why you lied. Others may be angered and disappointed and not care about your reasons. In any event, keep your reasoning brief and to the point. Just a few words may help you to get your point across and stop the person from becoming more upset.

, You can simply say, “I am willing to accept the consequences for my actions”. Then, let them speak. While this is not the ideal outcome, it is something you will have to do if you still hope to get the job.

, It will do you no good to start arguing or defending yourself. Staying calm and listening to what the employer has to say will keep the situation from getting out of control.

Ask to withdraw your candidacy.,
Do not feel obliged to give an explanation.,
End on a good note.",How to Proceed when You Lied on a Resume3," If you went through with the interview without coming clean, you may be suffering from feelings of guilt and worry over what the employer will do if they find out. In this situation, you may want to consider withdrawing your candidacy for the position and put an end to things before they go any further. At this point, coming clean may have lost you the job anyway, so this method will allow you to maintain some dignity.


You can keep it simple by calling or emailing the employer to request a withdrawal of your candidacy. Briefly state, “I would like to withdraw my candidacy at this time”.

, You are not required to provide an explanation for the withdrawal of your candidacy. However, if you are asked why you are withdrawing your candidacy you can simply say, “For personal reasons”. The employer will not probe any further and will never know you lied on your resume.

, Thank the employer for their time thus far and apologize for any inconvenience. You can also wish them luck in finding the right person for the job. Ending on a good note may allow you to be a good candidate for another job in the future.

Carry copies of your personal data sheet.,
Share a copy with your emergency contact(s).,
Keep your information up to date.",How to Make a Personal Data Sheet," Are you sight-impaired and intending to provide useful information for a scribe? Are you compiling a medical history for yourself or your child? Do you plan to use your personal data sheet as a foundation for job applications? Understanding the purpose of your personal data sheet will help you determine what information you need to include.

, Gathering name and address information for references, any relevant medical data, and details regarding your past jobs and educational experience will help expedite the writing process once you begin.

, Job resumes are targeted toward a specific position opening. While you may use the same basic format for each job to which you apply, you'll adapt the objective, and possibly some of the supporting information, to the specific characteristics of each position. A personal data sheet, on the other hand, is a compendium of information about you. This document is not generated to ""sell"" your qualifications to a specific audience, but rather to provide complete, accurate, and clearly presented information about you and your life experiences.Note that while you may target your information to a broad type of audience -- medical professionals, potential volunteer opportunities, etc. -- the same personal data sheet should serve to introduce you to any audience of the targeted type.
If you opt to include your personal data sheet with a job application you should always provide a resume, as well.

, Any personal data sheet should contain your full name at the top of the first page. If your personal data sheet is more than one page in length, include your last name in the header on subsequent pages. Add your current or local address, as well as a permanent address if it is different. Include all of your phone numbers, including home, work, and cell. Provide an email address, as well.

, List the name, address, and phone numbers of at least one person who should be reached in case of an emergency. Be sure to keep this information accurate and updated at all times. This information may also be used if you cannot be reached for some reason.

, People are often hesitant to give out sensitive and private information such as a social security number. However, the purpose of a personal data sheet is to gather all of your information into one place, and this information is commonly requested on job applications and other forms. Include the state in which your license is registered.


If you do not have a driver's license, contact your local department of motor vehicles about obtaining a personal identification card. This card is an official form of identification just like a license, but does not grant driving privileges.

, Include complete information about your schooling and where you currently work or have worked in the past. List the names of past work supervisors. If you are still in school or recently graduated, put your education first. If you have been out of school for a while and you have a lot of work experience, list that information ahead of your educational credentials.


List your most recent job first, then work backward through time. The same principle applies to listing your education -- start with the highest level of education you have completed and work backward.
When in doubt, err on the side of extra information. Not all job applications, for example, may require a complete work history, but if you go ahead and provide one you'll be prepared for whatever you encounter if you or a scribe is making use of your personal data sheet to fill out forms.

, Include any languages you speak, licenses or certifications you hold, or awards you may have won. You can also include memberships, publications, or community activities and volunteer work.

, Include at least three references from various jobs and schools. List the reference's name, contact information, position title, and the number of years you have known the person. (Always ask potential references if they are willing to serve in this capacity before you list them on your personal data sheet!), If you plan to use this sheet for medical purposes, for example, provide information regarding your medical history -- immunizations, past procedures, and a list of current medications.

, One of a personal data sheet's chief advantages is that it provides a compendium of useful, accurate information that you or a scribe can employ to fill out other forms. Ensure names are correctly spelled and all details are correct., Having copies on hand will enable you to make use of your document on the spur of the moment. Use your personal data sheet as a foundation for completing job applications and other forms.If you are sight-impaired, being able to present your personal data sheet whenever it's needed will cut down on the confusion of making sure names are spelled correctly and important data is not transposed.

, If their services are needed, chances are your emergency contact(s) will need access to the information provided on your personal data sheet. Save time and worry in an emergency by ensuring they are prepared in advance.

, Review your personal data sheet each time you make use of it to ensure that all information is accurate. Remember that your references may have moved, changed positions, or otherwise altered their contact information, so keeping your sheet up to date may require some regular research work.

Learn about the career.,
Start in high school.,
Take advantage of your undergraduate education.,
Take the Medical College Admission Test.",How to Become a Medical Examiner1," A medical examiner is a difficult career for a variety of reasons. Before you commit yourself to the career path, take some time to learn about the benefits and drawbacks of the career.


A medical examiner is similar to a coroner. Your job would be to identify deceased persons and determine the cause of death. You would also conduct toxicology reports, autopsies, and locate sites of trauma and determine time of death. The difference is, a medical examiner is appointed while a coroner is elected. Also, coroners are not always medical doctors but medical examiners are.If a death is the result of a crime, you may also travel to the scene of an accident to collect evidence and conduct interviews.Medical examiners positions tend to pay well. Average pay is over $180,000 a year. However, pay is contingent on experience and location. Some states may pay less.
Given the nature of the work, it can be a stressful and emotionally demanding position. Give serious consideration to whether you can deal with death on a daily basis. The deaths can be quite gruesome at times. If possible, talk to medical examiner and ask them how they cope with the job emotionally.;
, If you want to be a medical examiner, your education path should begin early as you'll need 8 to 12 years of higher education after obtaining a high school degree.


Start looking into programs as early as sophomore or junior year. Get a sense of which undergraduate schools offer competitive, respectable science programs and what you can do to boost your chances of being accepted to one of these schools.
Take a lot of science courses, aiming for AP curriculum later in high school. You should also study hard for any standardized tests, such as the ACT and SATS, you might need to take. Pay particular attention to the science and math sections, as a high score in these areas can help you get accepted into your chosen college after graduation.
Look for science-related internships or volunteer experiences in high school. Ask your teachers and guidance counselor about opportunities.
Some schools allow high school students to enroll in low level science courses during their senior year. See if this a possibility in your school. It's something you might want to look into if you want to improve your college application.
You will also want to be a well-rounded individual. Colleges don't just look at grades and science activities. They look to make sure a candidate is active and interested in other areas. Good examples of activities include band, team sports, volunteering organizations, and after-school groups.

, Your career path begins in college. As a medical degree is a must if you want to become a medical examiner, you need to take a pre-med curriculum as an undergraduate student.


You should find a school with a good reputation for pre-med curriculum, as having a degree from a recognizable school can increase your chances of getting into a good medical school. You can find rankings of different degree programs online and ask your high school guidance counselor.
For the most part, pre-med students major in biology or bio-chemistry. These programs are offered in most 4-year colleges. Going for a degree with a pre-med focus will involve classes in cell biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and microbiology. Talk to your college counselor about what your course curriculum should look like semester by semester.Seek out internships and other experience. Medical related volunteer work, internships, and jobs look great on a pre-med application. Seek out experience in your area by asking professors, advisers, and fellow students to help you find opportunities.
Certifications, such as CPR, can easily be obtained during college. Certain medical positions, such as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), only require a high school degree. Doing EMT work part time in college or over the summers can really make your med school application stand out.
Junior and senior year, begin researching and touring medical schools. If you do tour, try to make connections. Send follow up e-mails to anyone you meet and strive to stay in touch. Making a good impression on an administrator or a professor can help your application for med school stand out.
Graduate schools look to see that the candidate is well-rounded and is pursuing interests like team sports, volunteering, band, and other campus activities.

, The Medical College Admissions Tests (MCAT) is the standardized test most medical schools require for admission. Getting a high score on the MCAT is important if you want to get into a good med school.


The MCAT consists of four multiple choice sections: Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems, Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems, Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior, and Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills.There are a variety of ways to study for the MCAT. You can buy online study guides, books, or take paid prep-courses through a program like Kaplan.You register for the exam online, on a date that is convenient to you. On the test day, you need to check in with an administer and show a valid form of ID. Your fingerprints will be digitally taken and a test day photograph will be taken.You can retake the exam if you do not like your score. The MCAT exam can be taken 3 times in a single year, 4 times in a 2 year period, and 7 times in a lifetime."

Attend medical school.,
Decide on the route you'll take regarding your residency.,
Complete a Forensic Pathology Fellowship, if necessary.",How to Become a Medical Examiner2," Medical school lasts four years and provides an intensive overview of basic medical science, the human body, and how to diagnose and administer medication.


Medical school is a stressful, time-consuming process that requires dedication on your part. Make sure you give yourself adequate time to study during your time in med school.
The first two years of medical school are academically based. You learn about basic science and human anatomy in a classroom setting.The second two years of medical school involve clinical training. You will work in a hospital with a team of other students, learning about medical work hands-on., After you complete medical school, there are several different routes you can take to become a medical examiner. Decide which route is right for you by weighing costs, efficiency, time, and your own personal learning style.


Forensic pathology in the United States requires at least 2 or 3 years of anatomic pathology residency training followed by at least one year of forensic pathology fellowship. Additional years (e.g. clinical / laboratory pathology residency and other specialty fellowships) can be added, if desired.
You can also do a more multifaceted path, doing a program that consists of anatomic pathology in addition to laboratory medicine and forensic pathology.This path is a good one if you know you enjoy pathology, but would like to keep your options outside of forensic pathology open.
A third option is to spend 5 years in forensic pathology and 2 years in anatomic pathology. A fourth option is one fellowship year of forensic pathology and one year of neuropathology, toxicology, or a related field following your basic pathology residency. These options might give you more expertise than that confined to crime scene investigation.Ask medical examiners you know as well as past professors and advisers about what path would be right for you.

, Depending on the path you chose, you might need to complete a Forensic Pathology Fellowship after completing your residency.


A Forensic Pathology Fellowship is designed to help you further your experience performing autopsies by investigating violent death. You will work with law enforcement agencies during this time, and play an important part in solving crimes and providing evidence for trial.You might be working in a local medical examiner's office. If you like the work environment during your fellowship, try to stay in touch with any connections you make. You might be able to find a full time job here down the road.Fellowships typically last one year."

Complete a licensing exam (or exams).,
Apply for positions.,
Learn good interview skills.",How to Become a Medical Examiner3," Regardless of your state, you need to take a licensing exam to become a medical examiner. You may also want to look into official certification, as some states require this for hiring.


Know the specific requirement of a medical examiner in your state. There is no one exam or one certification program that is accepted nationwide.How to study for an exam or prepare for certification depends on your state. However, if you've completed the necessary education you should be able to successfully pass. Study the basics before the exam and consult study guides specific to the exam you take.
For more information regarding state-by-state licensing and certification, look at the website of the American College of Forensic Examiners Institute. They provide license and certifications that are accepted in many states., Medical examiner positions are usually in high demand, and the position has a high growth rate.You should be able to find positions to apply for in a variety of locations.


Ask your contacts from med school, your residency, and your fellowship. Oftentimes, connections are what are most likely to help us find a job. Let people know you are looking for a job and to pass any relevant job leads onto you.
Go to online job boards, like indeed.com and monster, to browse positions. This is a great way to job hunt if you're looking for a job in a different state or region.
When forming your resume, put your most relevant education and work experience on the top. If you worked or interned in a hospital during med school, mention this information but leave out non-medical related jobs you might have taken during school to make ends meet.

, While waiting to hear back on the jobs you've applied to, brush up on good interview skills. If you get a call back, you'll be prepared to give an impressive interview.


Always listen in an interview. If they ask if you have any questions, always ask a broad, open-ended question to convey interest. Something like ""What is the culture of this hospital like?"" is far better than ""When can I expect to hear back about the job?""Do your research beforehand. Have some sense of the hospital's and the medical staff's accomplishments, reputation, and general philosophy before entering the interview.Use body language that conveys confidence. Sit up straight, make eye contact, and give a firm, but non-aggressive, handshake.
Use specific examples from your past work experience. Have a list of moments, preferably ones that can be told in anecdotal form, that illustrate your strengths as an employee.

Remember to consider both hard and soft skills.,
Be honest.,
Choose a few essential skills to highlight.,
Create a summary statement.,
Add a skills section beneath your summary statement.,
Relate your experience to your skills.,
Review and edit for each job.",How to Include Skills on Your Resume," Job postings or ads will provide you with essential information about the company, the job duties, and the type of person they employer is seeking. If you read the entire ad closely, you should be able to determine the majority of the qualifications a candidate will need to get an interview.


Remember to consider the whole posting. For example, an ad for a customer service representative might explain that the job involves answering a high volume of calls daily. It may list only “call center experience” under the qualifications heading, but if you read the entire ad, you’ll understand that experience taking calls of high volume is an implied necessity. You’ll know, if you have this experience, to include it on your resume.;
, As you read an ad, mark the skills that seem especially important for the job. This exercise will help you understand the type of person the employer is looking for and think through your own experience as it relates to these skills.


Remember, as in the example above, that necessary skills can be stated or implied throughout a job posting, not just in the qualifications section. Read the whole ad, and highlight all skills that seem essential for securing an interview.

, Many job postings break desired qualifications into “must have” and “preferred” skills and experience. By listing these separately, companies state minimum qualifications needed to secure an interview while also listing skills that are likely to move you ahead of other candidates. If you do not list “preferred” skills as well as required ones, you put yourself at a disadvantage.

, Hard skills are teachable and quantifiable, like knowing how to navigate a customer database or being able to communicate in a foreign language. Soft skills, on the other hand, are more subjective and related to your personality traits; examples include problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and good time management. Most companies are looking for a good balance of both hard and soft skills from qualified candidates.

, Once you’ve read a job ad and highlighted the important hard and soft skills (considering both the required and the preferred ones), think about your own experience and abilities. Consider which of your skills are strong matches for the skills this particular employer is seeking.


In the call center example above, if you have been a customer service representative in a company with very high call volume, you can list “excellent customer service skills,” “solid call center skills,” “high call volume management” and “outstanding problem solving skills.”

, Many job seekers zero in on the hard skills required for a job and forget to consider the relevant soft skills. Match the desired qualifications in the job ad to your own, and look for skills like problem solving, time management, and oral and written communication.

, If you do not have all of the required and preferred skills for a particular job, that’s okay. You might not be the most qualified candidate, but do not put false skills on your resume. Spin your skills in the most positive way that you can, and then hope for the best.

, Read the job ad again, and think carefully about what the most essential skills are. Choose three to five of these that you possess, and use them at the very beginning of your resume to grab the reader’s attention. This lets readers see very quickly that you are a good candidate for the position.


You can place these essential skills immediately beneath the resume heading, in one line. For the customer service representative example, you might have: “High Call Volume Management / Call Center Customer Service / Call Escalation”

, After your heading and essential skills, you should have a short paragraph briefly highlighting your basic skills and experience. This is called the summary statement. Make sure that you tailor it to the job you are applying for; include relevant skills, and remove anything that seems not to be applicable.

, Underneath the summary statement, create a skills section. This should also be tailored for the particular job you are applying to. Aim to include a list of five to ten skills, and no more than fifteen.


Be as concise as possible, using only one to three words for each skill. Keeping each skill as short as possible is important; it allows recruiters to review the list quickly. Remember that you’ll also have an experience section, which will back up your list and provide further details.
In general, it’s best to use a bullet format with multiple columns. Use a professional resume template. Adding two or three columns will keep your resume short and professional looking.

, Below your skills list should be your experience section, the bulk of your resume length. Make sure, in this section, that you back up the skills you have listed with more detail.

, You should not be sending identical resumes to different companies for different jobs. Taking the extra time to review your resume and add and delete skills to keep it relevant for a particular job is essential to securing as many interviews as possible.

, You will not turn in the same references unless you have to.

, Ask people to be references when you leave a job. Keep in contact with them online or by phone to keep the connection.

Keep your font size between 10 and 12pt to save space.,
Keep bullet points short and minimal to save space.,
Reduce the margins all around to maximize space.,
Delete unnecessary spacing and keep other spaces to a minimum.",How to Keep Your Resume to One Page1," Font size can make a substantial difference to the amount of space your information takes up. Obviously, the smaller the font, the more information can fit in a given area. However, it is important not to go too small because it can become difficult to read your content.


You also do not want to go too big, because it takes up unnecessary space and can look amateurish.
Stick with traditional fonts such as Times New Roman or Arial.;
, Bullet points should be kept short and provide only the most important information. If you find yourself writing two or three lines for a bullet point, you will most likely be able to break it down into more than one bullet. Breaking your bullet points down will make your information easier to read. Below you can see an example of the difference:


Created a 2 day training course called “Negotiation Tactics” and trained a team of 10 account executives to improve their negotiating skills when working with clients.
The above bullet can be turned into:

Created a 2 day training course called “Negotiation Tactics”.
Facilitated the “Negotiation Tactics” course to improve the skills of 10 account executives.



, Adjust your margins in order to make the best of your printed page. Don't allow a lot of white space around the edges of your document unnecessarily push your content onto more than one page.


If you are using a program such as Microsoft Word, your margins may be automatically set to 1” all around.
You can change your margins by clicking on “Margins” under the “Page Layout” tab. Here you can customize and experiment with different size margins.
Be careful not to have them too small and risk losing information when your document is printed.
To make sure a printer can handle the margins you have set, print your document before committing to the margin size.
It is not recommended to set margins below .25”, and your program may tell you to change them if you try to set margins below this number.

, You will be pleasantly surprised how much space you can save by adjusting your spacing throughout your resume. This means reducing the spaces between lines, bullets and headings. The idea is to keep your sections easily noticeable while using the smallest spacing to help you stay on one page. Resumes will appear differently when changing the spacing, so it is up to you to decide what the best size spacing is for your resume.


You can adjust this spacing by selecting a section of your resume and adjusting the “Before” and “After” spacing under the “Page Layout” or “Paragraph” tabs if you are using Microsoft Word.
You can set the spacing to as little as 0pt between lines in the same paragraph or between bullet points.
For spacing between sections or headings, it is recommended to stay between 4 and 8pt.

Use concise sentences.,
Do not write large paragraphs.,
Delete irrelevant information to shorten the body of the resume.",How to Keep Your Resume to One Page2," Resumes should be created to be easily and quickly read by the recruiter or hiring manager. These individuals may have a short amount of time to read multiple resumes and your resume must be written to keep their attention and easily highlight your key strengths. Therefore, writing concise sentences is extremely important for any resume, and even more so when you are trying to fit all your qualifications and strengths onto one page.


An example of how sentence a should be written vs. how it should not is:

“Developed a new email campaign and implemented that campaign which increased the company’s sales by 10% in just 1 month” VS:
“Developed and implemented an email campaign that increased sales by 10% in 1 month”.


As you can see, the second sentences can be read more quickly and easily when opposed to the first sentence.

, Although you shouldn't present your entire resume as a bulleted list, it is important to stay away from large paragraphs. Large paragraphs, in terms of a resume, are considered 5 lines long or longer. When you are trying to limit your resume to one page, it may be best to stick to the main ideas and not get too detailed.


Your reader will not have the time or attention span to read through a detailed story about your latest project and will probably not have the space for it either.
Therefore, it is important to briefly describe what you did and report the results while leaving out the fluff.
For example, “Contributed to a 10% sales growth” vs. “Hired to help increase sales and was able to do the job successfully to contribute to a 10% overall sales growth”.

, It is important to keep your resume relevant to each job you are applying to. This means that you most likely cannot use a general resume for all your applications.


In order to figure out which information will be most relevant, read each job description carefully and determine the qualifications desired by each employer. Then, add or keep these qualifications in your resume.
Delete all other information that the employer will not care about if you want to keep your resume to one page.
For example, you are a recent graduate who completed an internship as a financial analyst. Prior to your internship you were a parking attendant. When you apply for a full time financial analyst position it is important to keep the internship information in your resume and delete your experience as a parking attendant.

It will also provide a study guide you can use to take the certification exam., Once you schedule your exam state, take the exam at the required time and place. Exam length varies by state and certification program. In some programs, you'll get your scores right away. In others, you'll have to wait a few weeks for your scores to come in the mail. Once you pass your exam, you'll usually receive some kind of certificate.

, After certification, you can start pursuing higher paid management positions. With a certification, master's, and a few years of experience you should have an edge over the competition.

This will help you prepare properly, as described in subsequent steps in this section. Although you are not necessarily limited to one field as a lab assistant, your chances of being hired are greater if you have the appropriate background for a given position. Here are a few examples of your options:


Medical sample testing. Lab assistants in this field usually work in hospitals or medical clinics, but can also find work with private companies to which physicians outsource their sample testing needs. A strong biology background would be helpful in this type of position.
Biological tissue analysis. Work in this field may involve preserving and testing tissue samples, harvesting tissue, and/or performing dissections. A background in anatomy or physiology with additional general biology training is likely necessary to perform this type of work.
Geological sample analysis. Some labs (often run by government agencies) are dedicated to the analysis of rock and soil samples. These labs usually operate with the goal of analyzing geological materials for evidence of pollutants or other abnormalities. These positions likely require some background in geology and/or geochemistry.;
, Most lab assistant positions will have basic educational requirements you will have to meet before being considered. Some positions may not require a college degree, but virtually all require a high school diploma or GED (at a minimum). You may also need a special certification to get hired.Browse job listings for lab assistant positions, even if you aren't ready to apply. Take note of the common degree and background requirements for jobs in your field of interest. This will let you know whether you need to complete some form of training or education before applying.
Look for relevant courses at your local community college. If you do not have a college degree but need to have education in certain topics in order to be competitive for the positions in which you're interested, you might be able to find relevant classes that you can take without being enrolled full-time.
Find a certification programs through local community or technical college. If your desired position is in a clinical lab, you will almost certainly need to be certified in order to be hired. These programs focus on medical sample acquisition and testing and may include training in phlebotomy, urinalysis, medical terminology, and/or laboratory standards (among other areas). You may also have to pass a certification exam to graduate., A lab assistant candidate with hands-on experience, even an unpaid internship, has a major advantage on the job market. Look for opportunities to intern in the area you wish to pursue. If you are enrolled in a certification program, this may even be a requirement to obtain your certificate.


You can ask your program director or college counselor to help you find these kinds of opportunities. If you are not in a program or taking classes, email or call labs near you and express your interest in gaining experience as an intern.
Work-study opportunities are an excellent option for college students who qualify for financial assistance from their college. Employers tend to like hiring work-study students because the student is paid by the college instead of by them.

, Some states require licensing of lab or medical assistants, in which case you will have to pass an exam in order to be hired (regardless of the type of job you seek). You can search online for your state's licensing laws or ask someone working in the field.


Be aware that you may be required to renew your license every few years. The requirements for license renewal also vary and could require additional testing, proof of continuing education, and/or fees.
Licensing exams often require nonrefundable fees, so make sure you are ready before you decide to take the exam. Even if you cancel an exam upfront, you might not be entitled to a refund of any paid fees.
Licensing exams might also only be offered periodically and at specific locations. Be prepared to adjust your schedule if necessary and arrange for travel to the testing site.

, If your state does require you be licensed in order to be a lab assistant, You will need to pass an exam (usually in addition to meeting other basic requirements, such as having completed a certificate program). Here are a few helpful tips for navigating this process successfully:Begin studying well in advance of the exam date. You should not assume that your previous education or training is sufficient to pass the licensing exam without studying.
Find out what topics are covered on the exam. Some exam sign-up websites (such as that of the National Healthcare Workers' Association website) provide content review resources free of charge.Get help in preparing for the exam. Ask fellow students who are also planning to take the licensing exam whether they would be willing to form a study group with you. As long as you stay on task, this can be a good way to ensure you cover as much information as possible while preparing.
Numerous study books and online tutorials exist for a broad range of lab assistant job fields. These could be valuable study resources, especially if you are in need of a content refresher before your exam.

, Use online job search sites (such as Indeed, Monster, or simplyhired.com, for example) to see what lab assistant jobs are available in your area. You can also inquire about positions at clinical offices, hospitals, or other facilities at which you are interested in working. You should also ask professors, program directors, or internship employers you already know if they can put you in touch with potential employers.


Apply to any position for which you are reasonably qualified. Don't worry if you don't possess every single preferred skill in the job announcement. As long as you meet at least the basic requirements, you will likely be considered for the position.
Be sure to follow up your application with a personal phone call or email to the job contact or human resources representative to introduce yourself and let them know you are interested in the open position. This gives the people reviewing applications a reason to remember you. However, don't do this if the job announcement specifically states not to!

, Virtually any job application process is going to require that you provide contact information for professional references (usually a minimum of three). Be sure to ask your intended references if they are willing to fill this role for you and don't forget to tell them about the jobs for which you are applying.


Current or former professors, supervisors, and colleagues are all great candidates for professional references. Just make sure that you don't choose a professor who you never interacted with or who gave you a poor grade, as his recommendation is not likely to be a strong one.
If you have worked with or under the supervision of someone who currently works for the company to which you are applying, be sure to get in touch with him or her and ask if they would be willing to 'put in a good word' for you to their boss. Potential employers are likely to value the opinion of their current employees over that of someone they don't know.

, When creating a resume or cover letter or interviewing for a lab assistant job, it is a good idea to highlight any supplemental skills or knowledge you possess that might be beneficial in your desired position. In an entry-level applicant pool, most candidates will be relatively similarly qualified. You can make yourself stand out by drawing attention to things such as:


Computer proficiency (especially in common programs like Microsoft Excel and Word).
Good written and oral communication skills.
Attention to detail.
Organizational skills.
Research experience.
Previous experience with specific laboratory equipment (especially if it is not common).

, In addition to ensuring that you will enjoy working for a given employer, becoming familiar with the history and specific services and goals of the companies to which you are applying will give you an edge against other applicants. If you can demonstrate some of this knowledge in an interview or cover letter, you will create a good impression on the hiring committee.


Learn basic details about the company, such as the name of the president or CEO, the year in which it was founded, and its mission statement. These facts may not seem important, but slipping them into a letter or conversation shows that you have taken the time to learn about the company.
Know what services the laboratory provides, and which ones you'll be expected to perform. The more aware you are of the job's requirements, the better prepared you'll be to do the work - which comes across to the hiring committee.

, Once you're hired, you'll likely have to undergo training specific to the job you will perform. Even so, it is in your best interest to know what sorts of potential hazards and/or difficulties you're likely to face while performing your assigned tasks. This way, you can determine whether there is anything about the job you are unwilling or unable to do. Ask yourself the following questions:


Will you be working around noxious fumes?
Will you be standing for long periods of time?
Will you be working in a facility with no windows?
Will you be operating dangerous equipment?
Will you have to lift or carry heavy objects?

, The primary role of the lab assistant is to do just that - assist. While some of your tasks may be unsupervised, most of your work will be carried out while working directly with a superior, such as a lab technologist of research scientist (depending on your field).After gaining some on-the-job experience, you may get antsy to do things on your own, but don't overstep your bounds.


If you would like to gain more independent experience, ask your immediate supervisor if it would be okay for you to conduct a test or experiment on your own. Just don't be too upset if your request is rejected.
If you are unsatisfied with your lack of independence, try thinking of your role as a foundation for the rest of your career. There is always the chance that you will one day be the one receiving assistance, so long as you make yourself eligible for promotion (as discussed in the final step of Part 3).

, One duty of many lab assistant positions is to prepare specimens for analysis by a lab scientist or researcher.This may involve repetitive tasks such as drawing samples with syringes and placing them onto slides for microscopy. It may also be the assistant's job to destroy or properly store materials once analysis is complete.


These tasks likely require that associated equipment/tools be set up and disassembled.
Since you will be likely be handling specimens yourself, you'll need to know how to properly deal with the types of materials your lab commonly encounters (which may include hazardous substances).

, Another task commonly performed by lab assistants is the cleaning and maintaining of laboratory equipment and workspaces.Because labs often have sensitive equipment and materials, there are usually no custodial services provided on a routine basis. That means lab assistants are often in charge of basic cleaning and maintenance procedures.


Sterilizing, cleaning, and calibrating equipment will likely be chief among your maintenance duties as a laboratory assistant.
Tasks in your lab will vary depending on the nature of your work, but may include tasks not directly related to specimen analysis. For example, you may be responsible for ensuring that lab materials (such as slides, pipettes, cotton swabs, disposable gloves, etc.) remain well-stocked, for wiping down countertops, and for emptying refuse bins.

, Part of working in a medical or research laboratory is keeping records and writing reports of work performed. These paperwork-oriented tasks will be specific to the job field and type of work being performed, but are often delegated to lower-ranking staff members (lab assistants). Examples of potential administrative tasks are:


Maintaining inventory sheets for consumable materials.
Filling out order forms for replacement equipment and supplies.
Writing reports and filling out forms in summary of work performed.
Keeping track of schedules and calendars.

, If you are fresh out of a certificate program and working as a lab assistant for the first time, you likely still have a lot to learn to do the job well. Don't be afraid to ask for advice or instruction from a more senior lab assistant or a supervisor. Your initiative and curiosity will likely be looked upon favorably by your boss and coworkers.


Ask a senior lab assistant to watch you perform a task and provide feedback. Some lab analysis techniques can only be performed one way, but others might have certain ways of going about them that are more effective.
Be willing to adjust your approach to the job so as to meet the requirements of your new employer. Your training in school might not be universally applicable to all areas of lab assistantship.

, Most lab assistant jobs are entry-level positions that can be a gateway to other roles with more responsibility and better pay (such as laboratory technologist and research scientist positions). In order to be eligible for these sorts of promotions, you might have to do more than just gain experience.Keep expanding your skills set to improve the likelihood that you will be selected for a promotion down the road.


Keep up with licensing and certification requirements and consider becoming certified for the job you may want in the future. If you already possess the qualifications for a higher-ranking position, you are more likely to be chosen when one becomes available.
Continue your education. Sometimes the next position up in the ranks requires education you didn't need for your lab assistant job. You can gradually obtain the necessary education by taking classes at night or online. Doing this will help fulfill any prerequisites and prepare you for when an opening emerges.
Periodically check to see if other companies are hiring more often for the position you wish to eventually move into. If your company doesn't seem to be offering as many opportunities to move up, perhaps it is worth considering a new employer.

Manage your career.",How to Become a Marketing Copywriter," A marketing copywriter understands and enjoys the nuances of words. You should think of writing as a passion and marketing as a major interest if you are to make it in this competitive market.;
, If you are unable to work under stress, then marketing copy writing is probably not for you. You will be forced to come up with great ideas and prose under deadline, and with plenty of competition.

, Perhaps the most successful copywriters out of college are those who combined their writing and business studies while still in college to create a stronger understanding of the concepts.

, Write for a college magazine and advertise for a local business. You will need to show businesses samples of your writing as well as taking a writing test to prove you have potential.

, You should have a well-rounded understanding of search engine optimization (SEO), branding and execution of marketing initiatives, even if you end up writing for the most part.

, Apply to write SEO articles online or do it for free, if you need to have portfolio builders very quickly. Make sure you have a professionally presented online and print portfolio by the time you graduate college.


Don't be afraid to use marketing or business projects that you are particularly proud of. If you can show a company how you were able to convincingly write to sell a brand, then it is a valuable piece of writing.
Since companies will ask for samples along with your resume, creating an online portfolio using a blogging site or a low-fee hosting site will put you ahead of your competition. Make sure to check for proofing errors, because your samples should be as well-thought out as your resume and cover letter.

, This is often the best way to break into the business, because you will be taught the intricacies of the job while earning a wage. Look for jobs in major cities, if possible, which is where most marketing agencies congregate.

, If you are being hired for a writing position, instead of simply an entry-level marketer position, you will probably be asked to take a timed writing test. These tests can take 1 to 48 hours and should be completed as carefully as possible.


In order to practice, find a professional website and try to emulate an article in an hour or less. Then, pick a product or 2 off advertisements or online and try to write a pitch and product descriptions in 1 hour or less.

, Many copywriters decide to freelance; however, you must have a good portfolio and work with top clients to command good prices in the freelance market.


It is a good idea to get 5 or more years of experience with 1 company before seeking a new job with a marketing agency. Unless you have already been promised a job, companies often look for people with 5 or more years of experience in the field before considering you above the entry level.

, Look to advance your career, if you have given 5 or more years of experience to a company. Seek promotions, such as Senior Copywriter or Project Manager as soon as you are ready to take on the responsibility.


Through promotion comes more money, a better portfolio and the ability to command your own team. Marketing is a competitive environment, so you must take opportunities when they come along.

Join a local plumbers' union.,
Enroll in a trade school.,
Contact plumbing contractors that provide apprenticeship programs.,
Obtain state certification.",How to Become a Journeyman Plumber," A union can provide a fast track to your ultimate goal of becoming a journeyman plumber. But because of the high demand for membership, they can be hard to get into. Unions offer apprenticeship programs that blend classroom study and hands-on experience. Most programs span 4 years, after which novice plumbers can apply for their journeyman's license. Some of the minimum standards for acceptance in a plumbers' union include:


Age: Most states require apprentice plumbers to be at least 18 years old.
Education: A high school diploma or GED is a condition of acceptance to most plumbers' unions.
Sponsor: Most applicants are required to have a union contractor as a sponsor.
Documentation: Applicants must be able to prove their legal right to work in the United States. Under most circumstances, a Social Security card and driver's license are acceptable forms of identification.;
, Because the competition for membership in plumbers' unions is so keen, many aspiring plumbers learn the skills of the job in a formal educational setting. Most trade schools provide the same level of instruction as unions and have job-placement programs, but they require tuition payments and don't pay apprentices like unions do.

, Small contractors look for motivated individuals, offering them plumbing apprenticeships that are geared toward the type of work the company specializes in. These training programs are often paid positions, but sometimes don't provide comprehensive instruction in all phases of the trade.

, Most states require aspiring journeyman plumbers to pass a licensing exam. Exam formats vary from state to state but generally test the applicant's knowledge of state and federal plumbing codes, blueprint and building-plan reading, and installation, maintenance and repair techniques over a broad range of plumbing systems. Before sitting for the exam, applicants must meet certain conditions, including:


Completion of a certification program through an accredited trade school, plumbers' union or licensed contractor. This covers most classroom work, including blueprint reading and familiarity with state code.
Completion of an approved plumbing apprenticeship of at least 4 years under the supervision of a master plumber. This affirms the applicant's hands-on experience in the field.

Make an impressive resume.,
Consider an HR consulting firm.",How to Become a Human Resources Consultant," People who work in human resources need to have strong analytical and interpersonal skills. They must also be able present proposed changes effectively to the human resources department and management teams. The following are all good questions to ask yourself when determining if a career in HR might be the right fit for you:


Are you the type of person who likes to organize and evaluate data?
Do you work well with people?
Do you usually have a good sense of character judgement when you first meet someone?
Do you try to put people at ease in tense situations?
Would you feel comfortable advising managers on organizational policy issues and recommending changes?
Could you develop, plan, and implement various HR initiatives like compensation, benefits, and performance management programs?
Would you like to analyze HR practices in a company to establish competitive programs and ensure legal compliance?;
, The national average salary for a human resources consultant is $67,413 per year, with a range of $42,243-$123,513. Experience and skills in project management have a moderate effect on income for this job. Your salary would also depend on the company you work for as well as the geographic location in which you reside and work., Educational requirements may vary depending on the company, your previous work experience, and the area in which you want to work. However, the minimum educational requirement will be the completion of a Bachelor’s degree. The type of Bachelor’s degree may vary, but typically a degree in human resources or business (administration or management) will best prepare you for a career as an HR consultant.

, There are schools all over the country that are in the top 25 schools for human resources careers, but a few are: Quinnipiac University (Hamden, CT), DePaul University (Chicago), Meredith College (Raleigh, NC), Illinois State University, Temple University (Philadelphia), Louisiana State, Colorado State, Oklahoma State, San Diego State, University of Alabama Birmingham, and California State.


These schools, as well as others, offer top programs in Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Business Administration degrees with concentration in Management or in Human Resources., Assuming that you were accepted into all the schools you applied for, there are many factors to consider when choosing where to go to school. The top factors to consider are:


Location - are you willing to move away from home or relocate? Be sure to consider expenses in getting back home if you do move, as well as other transportation costs, such as car or public transit expenses, that will vary depending on where the school is located in relation to where you live.
Cost - Cost is a huge factor to consider. Determine how much you can afford to pay for college, if you’re eligible for scholarships, and what types of financial aid is available. You may also want to consider your expected salary after graduation when determining the cost of the school, especially if you’ll be paying back loans after graduation.
Major and program – be sure the college you’re considering has the major you’re interested in taking, and consider if their program for that major is a competitive program for the field.
Career services – choose a college with a good career services program that will help you find a job that you love after graduation.
Safety, student life, and athletics – if you’re moving onto campus, you’ll want to be sure the campus is safe and that the student life (clubs and organizations) interests you. If you’re an athlete, take a look into the school’s athletic program for your sport and see if it would be a good fit for you., There are many different types of scholarships – the key is searching for them and seeing which ones you may be eligible for. You may need to write an essay, take a written exam, or complete a certain type of project. Spend time researching scholarships; a good central source to look for different scholarships available is SallieMae. Just be sure you follow the instructions carefully when applying and be mindful of deadlines., If you’re not able to pay outright the cost of your college tuition, and your scholarships haven’t covered the total cost, consider applying for loans. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is where many students go online to apply for student loans. There are also private student loans available through banks and other credit lenders., You’ll want to make sure that your costs for books and other materials are covered in your budget, as well as your costs of living especially if you are not living on campus. Loans will usually allow you to take out more than the cost of tuition, expecting that you cannot work full time and go to school full time, so consider borrowing money for your books and living costs when accepting your loan amount for the year.

, Now that you’ve gotten into college, you just need to do the work and pass each class! Be sure to allow plenty of time for studying so you can do your absolute best in your classes. There are other strategies to getting good grades in college – such as choosing courses you think you’ll do well in, not overloading your schedule, using the right types of sources for papers, pacing yourself throughout the course, and utilizing professor office hours., Most entry-level positions in HR require past experience, usually through internships. Toward the end of your schooling, look into internship opportunities. As an HR intern, you’ll have the opportunity to apply your academic coursework to real-world situations. Tasks for an HR intern range from preparing new hire paperwork, advertising open job positions, advising employees on safety issues, and more.


A good place to start for finding an internship is your school’s career services center, or the academic advisor for your major’s department. Also, your professors probably had to do internships themselves and could guide you in finding a good match for you., Once you’ve graduated (hopefully with high honors!) research different HR positions. There are generally two career paths to take in HR work: generalist or specialist.


The HR generalist has a wide range of responsibilities such as attracting and retaining employees, training, managing the workforce, and planning ways to meet HR needs. Generalists are usually found in small companies or in management roles.
HR specialists typically require deep knowledge of a particular (larger) company’s HR program, such as employee and labor relations, benefits, conducting interviews, or administering pre-employment tests., Writing a great resume is an art unto itself. Be sure that your resume is no more than one page, focuses on your individual strengths, and includes your education and experience background. There are several ways to organize a resume, just be sure to divide sections of education, work experience, and strengths. Remember, a resume is a marketing tool. You are trying to sell yourself to employers who have never met you. Use accomplishment statements and action words rather than plain descriptions of your role in previous jobs.


Many job positions also ask for a cover letter. A cover letter is an extension of your resume, but you don’t want to just repeat the same information from your resume. Instead, write about what you learned from past positions why you’re interested in the position you’re applying for, being sure to focus on skills and strengths needed for that particular. Cover letters will usually need to change depending on the position you’re applying for., When starting out, you may wish to start working for an HR consulting firm. It will often take some years of experience to be qualified for the high level consulting positions. Research types of consulting firms in your area to determine which type and which firm would be a good fit for you.


There are generally 3 types of consulting firms, and the type you work for depends on your interests and area of specialization: there are strategy consulting firms (focused in business strategy HR consulting), pure play HR consulting firms (who do work only in HR issues consulting), and big four / management consulting firms (HR consulting is one of many consulting offerings offered in these large consulting firms).

Decide if you have the temperament for collecting garbage.,
Consider the skills you might need to possess.,
Find out if there is an age limit.,
Understand that if you would prefer to be self-employed, contact your local small business association and seek help on setting up a garbage collection service.,
Apply for permits if necessary.,
Go for a job interview with a business,and you may need to sit a physical test.,
Ask your employer what equipment you have to fund yourself, if any.",How to Become a Garbage Collector," You must be able to lift heavy objects, handle difficult shapes (people throw out anything and everything) and you must be happy to get dirty. Be certain that you are not overly sensitive to smells. Do you mind working outdoors no matter whether it is boiling hot, sleeting rain or a blizzard? Do you mind the early mornings or late nights that might be expected of you? Do you have the temperament to deal with abusive and thoughtless homeowners who expect you to toss their unwanted gutted bathroom fittings into the compactor?;
, While formal qualifications are not usually necessary and most of your training will be completed on-the-job, you will need certain skills. Such skills might include a truck driving license, ability to drive a forklift, operate compacting equipment, mechanical repairs to devices used on the truck, etc.

, Some places will only employ people aged over 18. If you are a mature-aged worker, you should be able to apply as long as you are physically fit. If you're still at school, speak to a careers counselor about how to apply for a position. If you are already in the employment market, contact your local municipality to find out who it has contracted its garbage collection to. Or it may be as obvious as checking the Yellow Pages for phone numbers. Ring the businesses and ask them if there are any openings. Also ask them what skills are expected. Ask also if they provide on-the-job training in any of these skills.

, You may need to specialize in a niche not already serviced, such as industrial waste collection, recycling etc. The more open you are to different concepts of garbage and ways of reusing it, reducing it and recycling it, the more successful your own business is likely to become in this environment-conscious age.

, If you handle biological agents, toxic, hazardous or flammable wastes, you may need special licensing to prove that you have received adequate training in handling these objects. If you are collecting waste from a hospital, medical/veterinary practise or industrial site, this is most likely to be an issue.

, Ask the business what this consists of and consider if you need to ask your doctor any questions about previous ailments or illnesses that might cause problems.

, In the main an employer should supply safety equipment but you may be expected to fund some of it yourself. You're up for the whole cost of safety equipment if you run your own business. Such equipment may include steel-capped boots, heavy duty gloves, reflective jackets, hard hats and safety pants.

Find your first client.,
Build relationships with lending institutions and real estate agents.,
Consider learning other brokerage related skills.",How to Become an Independent Mortgage Broker," Before you decide to become an independent mortgage broker, its important that you fully understand the role and responsibilities of the position. There are two types of mortgage brokers: residential mortgage brokers and commercial mortgage brokers. Residential brokers work with individual home buyers to help them get funding from lenders for their mortgage. Commercial brokers work with companies, on commission, to help them fund mortgages for commercial spaces.In both specializations, your role is to advise your client on selecting the best loans for them from various lenders and to process loan applications. To process loan applications, you will need to obtain the client’s credit report or financial statements and confirm their income and assets.
To do this job well, you will also need an detailed understanding of government regulations around real estate financing to help your client decide if the property is worth purchasing.
You will also need to be willing to travel to meet clients and to meet lenders in person on a frequent basis.;
, To be an independent mortgage broker, you should have your high school diploma. Though the industry prefers you have a bachelor’s degree or vocational certificate in business, finance, or economics, it is not required.You will also need to get a mortgage broker license in most states and areas in order to become a mortgage broker recognized by lending institutions. You may also get certifications through the National Association of Mortgage Brokers to improve on your mortgage broker abilities and knowledge.
As of 2012, the median salary for a mortgage broker was $67,000. However, this amount may fluctuate for independent mortgage brokers.

, Experience in the real estate or banking industry will help you learn how to gather and analyze financial documents, use loan-underwriting software, and understand real estate market trends.The demand for loan officers and real estate agents are expected to increase by 8% - 11 % from 2012 to 2022. Starting out in a growing job market can also help to boost your mortgage broker career.

, The regulations for mortgage brokers varies from state to state. Use an interactive map of the US to find the legislation in your state by clicking here. To get more details on the licensing laws in your state, you can also contact the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB).Some states require mortgage brokers to have a mortgage license before they can become a broker and some states do not. There are also certain regulations, like whether a mortgage broker can process a loan on a client’s 1st and 2nd mortgages, and if a broker must have a physical office in the state to be a legal mortgage broker in that state.With the growing number of independent mortgage brokers working online, the licensing laws are less strict around having a physical office, but some states require a mortgage broker license to broker mortgages for clients.
In Arizona, for example, all mortgage brokers must have a physical office in Arizona and the broker must be an Arizona resident.But in New York, a mortgage broker can work online from a remote location as long as she has proof of experience in mortgage brokering and recent, original credit reports., Most states process mortgage licenses through the National Mortgage Licensing Center, which you can access online here. Approved courses for mortgage licensing are 20 hours or more and should contain three hours of Federal Law, three hours of Ethics, two hours of Non-traditional Mortgage Lending and 12 or more hours of elective, in addition to any specific content required in that state. You can take these courses online, from home.The licensing fee through NMLS for a mortgage broker in most states is $1500. Most applications also require you to submit a Surety Bond of $10,000.Some states also encourage mortgage brokers to get hands on experience in the industry, about three to five years total, before applying for their license., Once you complete your coursework, you will receive documentation showing you are now a licensed mortgage broker. You can then use this license to show potential clients you have certified knowledge of the industry.Many states also require licensed mortgage brokers to take continuing education classes once they have received their license, once a year, to keep their knowledge up to date.

, There are three levels of certifications that you can receive are: entry-level (Certified Residential Mortgage Specialist), mid-level (Certified Mortgage Consultant), and advanced. These certifications will expand your existing knowledge of the loan process and the real estate industry, and will allow you to better serve your clients.To apply for entry and mid-level certifications, you must have a certain amount of work experience and years in the industry. You will then take a multiple choice exam for each certification. Each certification expires after three years.

, Many mortgage brokers start at larger mortgage firms before branching out on their own. You could also gain experience in the mortgage arms of housing firms or banks to get a sense of the industry. Three to five years of experience at a larger firm is suggested before becoming an independent broker.Another option is to join an online mortgage service like LendingTree.com and gaining experience in an online based company. This is a good option if you are thinking about maintaining an online based independent mortgage brokerage. However, services like LendingTree.com are structured, meaning you will have to deal with overhead and other expenses as a broker in a large organization., Some states will not allow you to be a mortgage broker without a physical office or place of business, while other states allow brokers to exist online and work remotely from a home office. Check what your state allows and then decide if you would rather work from an office or from home.Many independent mortgage brokers enjoy the flexibility of working remotely from a home office, communicating with clients online, and meeting clients in person in a casual setting. #*Some independent mortgage brokers only work part time hours, so they do not feel the need to rent out an office space.

, Your start up costs will depend on if you have an existing home office you are going to work from or if you are going to rent an office space. You will also need to budget for transportation to meet clients and lenders, as well as office supplies, and a computer. Your start up costs can range from $2,000 - $10,000, depending on your office set up and needed supplies.Keep in mind most residential mortgage brokers make a profit by charging a broker fee that is between 1% and 2% of the mortgage. Most brokers charge the lenders this fee, but some broker may charge the borrower this fee if the mortgage brokering process is complex or the lending process requires specialized knowledge., Mortgage brokers work on commission via the lending institution that advances funds for the mortgage. The commission can range from several hundred dollars to thousands of dollars, based on the mortgage amount required by the client. In order to become profitable, you need to find and retain your clients. You want your clients to have a positive experience and to help them achieve their ideal mortgage, as they will then refer you to other potential clients.Often, mortgage brokers will bring their existing relationships with lenders from their time at a larger firm into their independent operations. These lenders will then refer clients to the brokers and foster a healthy, mutually beneficial relationship.
Some mortgage brokers will charge more for difficult or more complex funding situations for clients, or they may charge a fee from the lending institution.

, The mortgage brokerage industry thrives on repeat business and referrals. Focus on fostering a goodwill relationship with the key touch points in the industry: the lending institutions and the real estate agents. If you successfully fund a complex mortgage for a client, your client will be happy and the lending institution will consider you a dependable and reliable mortgage broker.Real estate agents can also help to connect you to clients if they consider you a solid broker who has a reputation for brokering mortgages successfully., As regulations around mortgage brokering shift and change, independent mortgage brokers must find ways to distinguish themselves and offer other skills to their clients. For example, an independent mortgage broker who is also a certified underwriter can help clients navigate tricky funding issues with the lending institution and be the go to broker for complex mortgages.As well, an independent mortgage broker who offers exclusive customer service and one on one attention to clients will distinguish herself from a sea of other independent mortgage brokers who may not be able to provide detailed client care."

Go to career fairs.,
Network with co-workers and industry professionals.,
Check online job boards.",How to Become a Gemologist," As with most professions, there are a number of areas you can go into as a professional gemologist, so you must decide what area of gemology you want to pursue before you can figure out the right educational path. Some common jobs include lab gemologist, appraiser, jeweler, and gemstone manufacturing, cutting, and design. Take some time reading about different career paths and consider which options sound most interesting to you., You’ll be happiest if you choose an area of gemology that you find interesting and that utilizes and enhances your current skills. In general, gemologists need to be detail oriented, have good interpersonal skills, hand-eye coordination, and finger dexterity to be successful in the field.Think about what other skills you have that could contribute to your success as a gemologist.


For example, are you a good sales person? If so, you could do well in a retail outlet or as a gemstone wholesaler.
If you are creative and have an interest in fashion, a position as a gemstone designer could be the right choice.
Or maybe you’re especially meticulous and detail oriented. You could do well as an appraiser or bench jeweler, which is someone who repairs fine jewelry.

, Different areas of gemology vary in salary, educational requirements, and job availability. Before deciding which area to pursue, consider your current lifestyle and if this is something you’re willing to change. Ask yourself:


What are my salary requirements? Am I willing to work my way up to get the salary I want?
Am I willing to relocate to find a job?
What lifestyle requirements do I have? Will I be happy working retail hours or would I prefer a more traditional 9-to-5 job?

, Now that you have an idea what area of gemology you’d like to work in, you can decide what type of education is best for your goals. Most jobs in gemology will require you to obtain a diploma, but there are some areas of gemology that will only require you to obtain a certification. Make sure you know what type of education your desired career path requires.In general, gemology schools offer a wide variety of course options, but if you are considering a more specialized area of work, ensure the schools you’re looking at offer this program.
It might help to talk to a representative from the school. They can help guide you as to what classes your degree will require and can answer any other questions you might have.
Inquire about distance learning options. If you don’t want or are not able to take on-campus classes, check that the schools you’re interested in offer distance learning programs.

, As mentioned, most careers in gemology will require you to receive your diploma from an accredited gemology school. Enrolling in these schools is similar to enrolling in any traditional college. Check with your enrollment representative to make sure you’re completing all the necessary paperwork.


At these schools you’ll learn about the analysis, grading, buying, selling, and pricing of gems and precious metals. These programs can usually be completed in a year or less.
A diploma from one of these schools will allow you to work in jewelry stores, jewelry manufacturing, and gemological laboratories.The Gemological Institute of America is an example of one of these schools. It has campuses in California and New York but also offers a distance learning program so you can complete your degree without relocating., If you decide you only need a certification to get the job you want, you’ll want to enroll in a respected gemologist certification program. Certification programs, in general, focus more on practical training and less on academic coursework. So when you complete a certificate program in gemology, you should have relevant skills to work in the industry, but you may not have all the academic information about gemstones many employers will want for more advanced positions.Certificate programs usually focus on more technical areas of gemology like jewelry design., What classes you take at gemology school will depend on your desired career path. In general, you’ll learn about the analysis, grading, buying, selling, and pricing of gems and precious metals. The number of classes required will depend on which degree program or certificate you are working towards.The most comprehensive degrees, such as Graduate Gemologist, generally require you to take five classes and three hands-on labs over the course of your training. These degrees usually take around a year to complete.
Less intensive certification programs can usually be completed over the course of several months., When you have completed all your necessary training, you will need to take a comprehensive final exam to earn your diploma in gemology. If you are completing a certificate program, this test is not required., As with other professions, most employers want their gemology employees to have at least one year of on-the-job training before hiring them on officially. Some employers will provide this training through apprenticeships or supervised on-the-job training. Completing an apprenticeship after you’ve finished your schooling can provide you with crucial hands-on experience that will help tremendously in finding a job.Inquire with your school to see if they work with any apprenticeship programs.
You can also search for apprenticeships through online directories. These directories usually separate apprenticeship opportunities into categories—by state, for example—to make searching for an opportunity more convenient.

, If you’ve obtained an apprenticeship after finishing school, there’s a good chance the company will offer you a full-time position at the end of your apprenticeship. Talk to your supervisor before your apprenticeship is over to discuss possible employment opportunities with the company.The company will be looking to hire someone who is reliable and trustworthy. They also want someone who is able to perform their job well. Make sure you demonstrate these qualities throughout your apprenticeship so you’ll be considered for full-time employment.

, Gemology schools also hold career fairs throughout the year for those looking for jobs in the field. These events are often free and allow anyone to attend, not just current students. Inquire at your school and any surrounding schools about upcoming career fairs they have planned. These will give you a good opportunity to network and learn about job opportunities in your area.Make sure you bring enough copies of your resume to hand out to companies you’re interested in working for.
Dress appropriately for the event. Most career fairs require attendees to wear business attire.

, Whether you’re still in school or doing an apprenticeship, make an effort to network with those around you. Networking with people in your industry is often one of the best ways to get a job. They often know of open positions or are willing to inquire with their friends and co-workers about any job opportunities on your behalf.


Carry some business cards with you so you can hand them out to anyone who might be of help. This way they can easily contact you if an opportunity arises.
Don’t forget to network through social media sites like LinkedIn and Facebook, as well. These sites may even have groups dedicated specifically to those already employed in gemology or those currently looking for jobs in the field.
Joining professional gemologist organizations and associations, like the American Gem Society, is another way to meet other gemologists and find out about job openings., When you’re looking for employment as a gemologist, online job boards can help you find leads in your area. Check these boards several times a week to stay on top of any available jobs opportunities.


You can create “alerts” through most job boards. Once you set up an alert, the website will email you daily with relevant jobs.

There are, however, certain steps you can take to prepare you for what comes next.Take as many classes as you can in sciences like biology and chemistry. If your school offers Advanced Placement classes, take them and do the best you can on the exams.
Learn more about genetics on your own. Read other books on genetics and read news articles both in papers and online about advances in the field. Genetics is a growing and rapidly changing field, and your classes may not be as up-to-date as you would like.
Look for volunteer positions as health clinics and genetics labs. Try to shadow a genetic counselor if you can.
When applying to college, look for schools that have strong programs in genetics, biology, and psychology. These can give you an advantage when applying to masters programs down the road.
For help with any of this, talk to your guidance counselor about classes to take and outside opportunities to consider. He or she can help you plan out your high school career to get the most experience you can before college.;
, Becoming a genetics counselor requires an advanced degree, but before that you need a bachelors degree. The most common major fields include the medical sciences, psychology, and healthcare.If you do not major in one of those fields, you should at least have completed undergraduate coursework in the fields of biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, statistics, and psychology., Graduate programs in genetic counseling will want to see practical experience in the field of counseling or genetics to go with your strong science grades. Look for opportunities to volunteer at clinics and shadow current counselors to make yourself a more attractive candidate, and see how much you really want to do the job.Look for volunteering opportunities with counseling groups. Support groups for terminal illness, disabilities or special needs, or peer counseling are all good experiences you can get in counseling. Volunteering to be a listener for a distress or suicide hotline is another good idea, and an experience that is very desirable to masters programs. Not only will these all look good when you apply to graduate school, they will give you the opportunity to help people directly.You can also consider shadowing a current genetic counselor. Try to find a local genetic clinic and ask if you can shadow one of the counselors. You may also be able to volunteer directly with the clinic for some more hands-on experience, depending on the clinic’s needs.Don’t be afraid to ask your teachers, professors, and guidance counselors if they know of any other opportunities for shadowing or volunteering in genetics work.

, Genetic counselor is a masters-level position, so you will need to be accepted into an accredited masters program. Your masters program will involve coursework dealing with the study of genetics and counseling techniques. You will also do fieldwork where you spend time working directly in a professional setting, probably during the summer. You will finish the program with a thesis or “capstone” project that should involve original research in the field that draws on the information you have learned in classes.Admissions requirements vary between programs, but in most cases you will need to have good grades in your undergraduate science classes, get a high score on the GRE, and have some practical experience.As of 2016, there are 35 programs in the United States and Canada accredited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling. A full list of the programs is available on their website.You do not need to apply right as you finish your undergraduate degree. Taking some time between finishing your bachelors degree and applying for a masters program can be a good opportunity to get some volunteering or practical experience.

, The centerpiece of your work will be studying and examining genetic science. Through work in high school, college, and post-graduate settings, you will study the field and develop a strong body of knowledge. Beyond this coursework, you should continue reading news articles and other sources for new developments in the field. The more you know, the more you will be able to provide good advice to your patients.

, In addition to learning about genetics, you will need to be comfortable in the role of a counselor. You should enjoy being compassionate and a good listener. Make sure you are prepared to give your patients your full attention when they talk to you, stay focused on the issues or symptoms they describe.Use positive and welcoming body language when patients speak with you. Lean slightly forward to let them know you are listening. Make eye contact and nod occasionally as they talk to keep your focus on them.

, Genetic counselors who work with people directly will need to be comfortable having difficult conversations about pre-existing genetic conditions or possible genetic disorders. You will need to be able to be compassionate and enjoy helping people work through their concerns and difficulties., There are a number of misconceptions about genetic testing, and you will probably need to convince patients of the benefits of getting tested. You will also need to be familiar with the testing process, to help alleviate any fears people may have.Remain calm and confident. Part of being persuasive is the ability to alleviate your patient’s concerns. You can do this best by not getting angry or upset if they have questions, but calmly showing that you know what you are talking about, and that you are sure it is the right decision.
Body language is another key to building a rapport and letting your patient know you can be trusted. Match your patient’s positions and mirror his actions as a way to subtly suggest you are both on the same page. Simple motions like crossing your legs like he does, or putting your arms in a similar position should be enough.As you work with patients, you will probably encounter many of the same concerns and misconceptions. Develop some basic responses to these common issues, so you are always ready. There may be additional questions, but at least you will have something to start with.

, The ABGC promotes the growth of genetic counseling, and helps to set high standards for the profession. Once you have finished your masters program, you will need to pass the board’s examination to become a certified counselor.The exam consists of 200 multiple-choice questions, and you will have 4 hours to complete it. The questions cover specific knowledge of genetics and your ability to address problems and situations that you may encounter while counseling. The ABGC provides content outlines and practice exams to help you prepare.
Your certification will be valid for 5 years after passing the exam. You will need to recertify at that point. This involves having taken a series of continuing education courses and paying recertification fees., Some states require genetic counselors obtain a license to practice counseling in the state. Licensure ensures the genetic counselor meets the minimum education requirements to work in the position. Make sure you know the rules and regulations in your state, and have filled out the proper forms to receive a license.


In Ohio, for example, a state license requires that you hold the proper masters degree, undergo a background check, and provide three recommendation certificates, including one from your current employer.
As of February 2016, 18 states require licensure for genetics counselors including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and Washington. In addition, Hawaii, Idaho, and Virginia are considering licensing laws., Genetic counselors work in a variety of settings. These include clinical practices in doctors’ offices and hospitals, or doing research for biotechnology companies, government agencies, or university laboratories.Patient-focused counseling. This will involve working directly with people, and discussing their needs and concerns. You can choose to work closely different specialties, including pregnant women, children, cancer patients, or heart patients. You will be based in a hospital or doctor’s office.Laboratory-focused counseling. This will involve creating a research agenda to study different aspects of genetic science. You may be involved in directing and studying clinical trials, or researching genetic conditions. You will work in a lab, either with a genetic research company or a university. This kind of work can be done part-time along with patient-focused work to still work directly with individuals.Community or public health focused counseling. These fields including working for non-profit organizations and government agencies to reach specific groups of people. You may work with Newborn Screening programs or patient support groups to reach people who may not come directly to clinics or hospitals., Depending on the type of work you want to do, look for openings with hospitals, laboratories, clinics, or other places seeking trained genetic counselors. You can find these through regular job sources like newspaper and online advertisement sites, by contacting hospitals and laboratories directly, or by looking through the websites of the ABGC and National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC).Genetic counseling is a rapidly growing field, so once you are certified and licensed, your job prospects should be very strong. New developments in genetics means that new openings, and even new types of work, are become available. Be prepared to be flexible with the types of genetic work you would like to do, as well as where you might want to live, to maximize your chances of landing a good job., In addition to your regular job as a counselor, there are a number of other opportunities to share what you are doing with others. This can be working with other professional counselors, or looking for opportunities to teach the next generation of genetic counselors.


Publish articles in professional journals. The most prominent journal for genetic counselors is the Journal of Genetic Counseling, published by the National Society for Genetic Counselors.Another good journal is the American Journal of Human Genetics.These are great opportunities to publish research you might be doing on genetics or counseling people on genetic disorders.
Join professional societies. In addition to being part of the ABGC, consider joining other professional organizations. The other prominent group in the US is the National Society of Genetic Counselors. Others include the American Society of Human Genetics, the Genetics Society of America, or the International Genetics Education Network. The best one to join will depend on the kind of work you do as a counselor.Find opportunities to teach others. In many cases, teaching future geneticists will involve introducing students to the basic science of genetics, and understanding how it fits into broader sciences like biology.If you are interested in teaching genetic counseling in a masters program, you will need to earn a doctorate in genetics, neuroscience, biology, or a similar field, and publish peer-reviewed research. You can also be open to allowing future genetic counselors to shadow you to help give them professional opportunities.

Low rates will risk lowering the quality of your client's services to avoid losing money.
Rates that are too high may force your client to sell their products/services through a niche market or an exclusive retail outlet.
A good middle ground might be to offer an average price for the goods/services being sold, while allowing individual representatives to offer discounts to customers if it means increasing sales during a slow period., A strong marketing plan should motivate your employees, lead your company down a clear path to success, and detail the specifics of how to implement those marketing strategies.A strong, coherent marketing plan should do each of the following:


assess your company or client's current situation (in terms of finances, resources, opportunities, threats, strengths, and weaknesses)
lay out your business mission/vision, your business objectives, your marketing objectives, and a description of your target market/customers
outline your product message, pricing strategy, and desired communication channels/methods
determine your restrictions (including budget/resource limitations)
outline your benchmarks and measurement process (including factors that will determine success, performance indicators/criteria, and desired technology solutions), If you want your company/client to succeed, you will need to coordinate the marketing and sales departments. Having these two departments work together will help streamline the process from reaching out to customers to making a final sale. It will also help keep your customers satisfied with the product/service they're getting, the lifestyle that product/service conveys, and the price they pay for it.Have your marketing team work together with your salesforce to ensure that timely, quality service and a streamlined process are carried out at all levels.
Make sure your salesforce knows how their products are being marketed. By the same token, ensure that your marketing department understands the challenges that your salesforce faces.
Understand the needs of your local market, and develop collaborative approaches between your departments to meet those needs and exceed expectations.Make your employees aware of the responsibilities and deadlines that are faced by both the marketing and sales departments, and work together to find strategies beneficial to everyone.
Consider coordinating policies in more practical ways. For example, you might have your salesforce work through various marketing and distribution channels, including telemarketing, mailed advertisements/offers, and catalogues.

, Begin exploring your interest in physical therapy by looking for after school jobs or volunteer opportunities that will give you some experience in the field, even if you are just answering the phone.It might also be helpful to gain some experience working with children. Consider looking for opportunities at daycare facilities, after school programs, summer camps, children's hospitals, or pediatricians' offices.

, Working as a pediatric physical therapist presents many unique challenges, so it's best to think about the requirements as early as possible to make sure this career is a good fit for you.


You must have a genuine desire to help and communicate with children in pain, which requires lots of patience and compassion.
You must have strong communication skills. As a pediatric physical therapist, you will need to explain conditions, limitations, and treatment plans to both children and their parents. Strong communication skills are vital because communicating with children is more challenging than explaining physical therapy to adults.
You must be prepared for physically challenging work. Pediatric physical therapists are on their feet for much of the work day and must often physically assist their patients., You have many different options, so do your research to choose the best undergraduate program for you. No matter what kind of program you choose, it is important to think about the prerequisite requirements for graduate school. Consider contacting graduate schools you are interested in applying to in the future to find out what undergraduate courses are required for admission. Common prerequisite requirements include physics, psychology, and a variety of science classes.One option is to major in a subject that is related to physical therapy, such as biology or physiology. There are also some programs that are specifically designed to prepare you for graduate studies in physical therapy, although you can certainly be admitted to a graduate program without this specific type of major.
Some schools offer programs that combine undergraduate and graduate studies, allowing you to earn a bachelor's degree and a doctorate degree in physical therapy from one institution without having to reapply.If you would like to start working in the physical therapy field as soon as possible, you may consider pursuing an associate's degree to Become a Physical Therapy Assistant.This is a great option if you want some more experience in the field before you commit to further education, or if you want to work as a physical therapy assistant while pursuing your more advanced degrees.

, Many physical therapy clinics hire aspiring physical therapists to work in the office or assist with the practice. This clinical experience will give you a chance to experience what it is really like to work in a physical therapy practice, and it will add to your resume.

, You will need to choose a doctoral program that is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE). These Doctoral of Physical Therapy (DPT) programs generally take about three years to complete and provide you with in-depth knowledge on subjects such as anatomy and pharmacology. You will also have the opportunity to focus your studies on pediatric physical therapy.Prepare for graduate school by taking the GRE while you are an undergraduate. These programs are competitive, so strong grades and test scores are important.
Master's degree programs are no longer available for new students wishing to become physical therapists, although they were an option in the recent past.You may be required to do an internship program as part of your DPT., You will be required to complete approximately 1,500 hours' worth of clinical practice in the specialization of your choice. Residencies are usually completed at university medical centers, and will give you the opportunity to practice physical therapy under the supervision of a certified physical therapist., You will need to take the National Physical Therapy Exam (NPTE), which assesses your knowledge and abilities in the field of physical therapy. Each state has its own requirements for issuing licenses to physical therapists, so check with your state to find out if there are additional exams you need to take. , This board requires that you complete 2,000 clinical practice hours in your specialty or an approved residency program. They also administer a test for certification that includes questions related to your specialty. Upon completion of this test, you will be certified as a specialist in pediatric physical therapy., Apply for jobs with hospitals, clinics, or physical therapy practices. Few pediatric physical therapists can start their own practice right away because they have a smaller pool of patients to draw from. A pediatric hospital or organization may be a great place to look for your first position.


You can also choose to begin working as a physical therapist after you receive your license, but before you obtain certification from the ABPTS.

, In order to keep your certification and license, you will have to complete continuing education credits every few years. Requirements vary by state, so be sure to check the requirements in your area."

Determine your physical capabilities.,
Locate warehouses locally to you.,
When you arrive at the warehouse, ask to speak with a supervisor.,
When trucks arrive, don't bum rush the driver.,
Ask the driver if they have no touch, or touch, freight.,
Agree on prices that are comfortable yet worthy of the physical effort.,
Get driver's contact information.",How to Become a Lumper," Although some dock supervisors may be kind enough to loan you mechanical pallet moving equipment, it should never be assumed they'll automatically do so. Therefore, you should prepare your body to handle unloading trucks, piece by piece, off each pallet. This process can take anywhere from a few hours or up to eight depending on how full the trailer is - it's best to discuss how much time the trucker has before picking up their next load to determine if you'll need to recruit some assistance.;
, You may need to trek several miles by car, bus or foot to get to the warehouse location. Yellow Pages, both online and offline, become useful in this situation as does Craigslist or truck driver social media sites. You can find the latter by searching Google.

, Loitering or trespassing is strongly discouraged, and could land you in jail. Simply request the opportunity to speak with truckers that have 'touch' (loads the trucker must unload) freight and help them unload their semis. If you're given the nod, ask about any safety rules or equipment needed to be around the dock to help the warehouse remain OSHA compliant. If told to scram, it's best you leave quietly and move on towards the next warehouse.

, Some drivers are armed, or may wish to engage in physical combat if they feel threatened. Since they'll need to hand their bill of lading to the dock worker to check while unloading, it's best to hang where the dock entrance is.

, If the former, you'll need to wait for the next driver because the warehouse crew will unload the goods. If the latter, engage in conversation by asking them if they'd appreciate some help unloading their truck so they can get back on the road. Most truckers will be elated to have such help, especially those with some age.

, Truck drivers aren't particularly 'rich', but they'll part ways with money provided you do the work as promised. Some drivers will pay you upfront; some will pay after the work is done, whereas an even smaller group of drivers may buy you lunch and pay you during your meal.

, Perhaps they'll call you when they come back into town, giving you residual employment for as long as they're employed by their current carrier.

Enter a training program.,
Get certified.,
Apply for work.",How to Become a CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant)1," Becoming a CNA requires a high school diploma plus some additional college-level courses, in almost all cases. You can typically sign up for a CNA program through your local community college.


Prepare for a time commitment. CNA programs vary in length, but average between six weeks and five months of extra school. The special CNA classes you have to take are set up so that you can take them in a specific order.

CNA classes are divided between study sessions and hands-on practice sessions.
Because CNA programs usually end with a special certificate rather than a degree, electives are not required.


CNA programs can be competitive. Consider volunteering at a hospital or nursing home to boost your chances of acceptance.

Volunteering is also a good way to gauge whether or not you will enjoy being a CNA, as some of the duties you're likely to perform are similar to those a CNA performs.

;
, Usually, an accredited training program will take care of some of the legal details for you, but because CNAs are health professionals, additional certification and verification is required before you'll be able to work as a CNA.


File your fingerprints. Most states require health care and education system employees to submit fingerprints to be kept on file in case of criminal investigations. Chances are your CNA program helped you to do this already, but check to make sure.
Take the certification exam. Again, this may have been integrated into your training program, but if it isn't, you will need to find out when tests are and sign up for one. The knowledge you gained in your classes will help you pass the exam and earn your certificate.

, Now that you're a fully-certified nursing assistant, it's time to get a job in the field. Prepare a resume and a cover letter, and begin looking for work.


Organize your resume. Write it so that your most impressive qualifications (such as your certification and related volunteer work) are near the top, and items that have less to do with being a CNA (such as unrelated jobs) are at the bottom.
Prepare a cover letter. Use your cover letter to put the information on your resume in context for potential employers. Always have a cover letter on hand in case you need one.
Look everywhere. Look for jobs in newspapers, online, and through word of mouth. Apply in person whenever you can; there is no substitute for a personal appearance.
Make a good impression. If you get an interview, show up well dressed and on time, speak clearly, make plenty of eye contact, and smile.

"
"
Follow the rules.,
Be a good listener.,
Be gentle.,
Be patient.,
Learn to prioritize.",How to Become a CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant)2," This might sound absurdly simple, but more than one CNA has been let go for not doing things according to code. This includes technical problems, such as forgetting to do something repeatedly, as well as more serious violations like drug theft.


Don't steal from your workplace. Being a CNA is stressful and can seem thankless at times, but stealing prescription medications for recreational use or illicit sale isn't the right way to ease the pressure. Find other ways to relax and focus yourself instead.
Do whatever the nurse says. Do it with a smile and without complaint. You'll make a strong good impression on the nurse, who is probably also feeling harried and overworked. If something sounds unsafe, feel free to ask why you have been told to do it; otherwise, just do it.
Take pride in your work. Even though you're probably a ways down on the healthcare totem pole, you're doing an important and vital job that helps save lives. Treat your job like it matters, because it does. Do everything as well as you possibly can.

, Take the time to talk to patients when you are able. Be gracious and respectful. Remember, the people you're serving don't usually want to be where they are. Having a kind and polite person around who will listen to them makes a powerful positive impact.


If you have any free time, swing back by your patients and make small talk with them. They'll love you for it.
Always take patient concerns and questions seriously. If you can answer them, do so; if you're not sure, bring their worries to the nurse. In a busy ward, your attentiveness might help catch a developing problem before it gets serious.
Develop thick skin. Sometimes your patients will be bitter or miserable and looking for a person to take it out on. Just let them vent and stay polite. People who are scared and in pain rarely mean what they say when they lash out.
Pay attention to body language. People communicate their emotions through body language. If you stay sensitive to changes in body language, you can better guess how to speak with your patients each time you see them.

, Speak clearly but softly, and approach your patients at a calm, measured pace. In nursing homes, where the people you take care of may be suffering from Alzheimer's disease, sudden movements and loud noises can cause severe agitation. Adopt a soft touch and keep things as pleasant as possible for your patients.

, Having patience is imperative. There may be times when you will have to repeat yourself multiple times when communicating with residents or patients due to an impairment. It is important to allow the resident to communicate at their own speed.


Be patient with your higher-ups as well. They may snap at you or forget to give you important information. If you remain patient, steady, and calm, they will usually catch themselves and stop treating you poorly.
Try creative communication methods. When trying to speak with a person suffering from Alzheimer's or another disease or condition that impairs communication, unusual approaches are sometimes required.

Try communicating using objects and body language instead of words, or by pointing and nodding at things.
Don't simply raise your voice as though the patient can't hear you. It's disrespectful and generally ineffective.



, There may be moments when several things need to be done at the same time. As in emergency medical treatment, it is important that you learn to triage them by immediate importance. Use your head and learn from experience which tasks are best done before the rest.


Don't rush your patients. Your time crunch isn't their fault; it's the schedule's. You can politely explain your situation, but don't put pressure on them to do anything faster than usual. It is unacceptable to cause them unnecessary stress or worry.
Never hesitate to ask for help. You may not always get it, but if you're feeling overwhelmed, it won't hurt to ask. You may find that there is another employee nearby who has a bit of free time and will be glad to split some of your workload with you for a little while.
Use your time wisely and productively. Downtime is precious, but unless you're on a lunch break, try offering to help out other CNAs instead or perform extra duties. Not only will this ease everyone else's load and make work go more smoothly, it will pay itself back later when you get swamped and other workers remember how you helped them out.

Have a backup plan.",How to Become a Cruise Ship Captain," Your high school education lays the groundwork for a successful higher education experience, which is necessary for a career as a cruise ship captain. There are several factors to keep in mind for a successful high school experience:


In the United States, many aspiring captains attend a Maritime High School, which are generally located on the coasts or Great Lakes. Maritime High Schools are competitive in admissions and follow a particular curriculum established by the U.S. Maritime Administration, emphasizing English, math, and science with additional courses in maritime skills, law, and career training.Because this is such a competitive line of work, a diploma from a Maritime High School is highly recommended to increase your chances of becoming a cruise ship captain.;
, Regardless of where you attend high school, focusing your studies in school can help you gain admission to a Maritime Academy and prepare you for the types of coursework you need.


The US Government recommends three units of math (algebra, geometry, and trigonometry); three units of English; one unit of physics or chemistry; and eight additional units in additional math and/or science, foreign languages, economics, and social studies.If you are in the United States and cannot attend a Maritime High School, visit http://www.marad.dot.gov/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Maritime_High_School_Curriculum.pdf for overviews of government curriculum for courses in General Maritime Studies and Careers, Introduction to Maritime Skills, Advanced General Maritime Studies, and Maritime Career Preparation.
If possible, look for part-time work (during evenings, weekends, and summer breaks) in a shipyard or on board a ship or sea-going vessel of any kind. You will learn about ship parts, worker roles, chain of command, and ship repair, as well as gaining experience on the sea, which will help you to know for sure that a career as a captain is ideal for you. If you do not live near the sea or large lakes, try to find summer work on board a ship.

, If you do not finish high school, you can get your General Educational Development (GED) certificate equivalent, or its equivalent in countries other than the United States. Be aware that a GED will make it harder, but not impossible, for you to obtain a career as a cruise ship captain.


A diploma and an above-average grade point average in high school are necessary for admission to a Maritime Academy, and even if you do not choose to attend an academy or college, you must have a high school equivalency to gain additional career experience at the helm of a ship.

, U.S. Merchant Marine Academies allow you to obtain four-year Bachelor of Science degrees. These degrees are monitored by the Coast Guard, and they teach engineering, maritime law and ship construction.


Attending a Maritime Academy is the fastest track to move up the ladder on a maritime vessel. Maritime Academies in the United States include California, the Great Lakes, Maine, Massachusetts, Texas A&M, and the U.S. Merchant Academy. These are funded by the United States Maritime Administration to ensure that the government has a steady stream of properly trained merchant marine officers.In the event that you cannot find a position as a cruise ship captain (which is unfortunately a high chance, given how competitive the industry is), a diploma from one of these schools can help you find employment with the US government or as a merchant marine captain. If you are based in another country, seek naval education or experience, according to the best path in your region.

, Most maritime students are required to get practical experience before graduation, and Maritime Academies have working relationships with the government and local mariners in order to help you find an ideal internship for your interests.


If possible, try to get an internship on a cruise ship. This will help you gain experience and determine that this is the right career choice for you. If you have the opportunity to do more than one internship while in college, try to get one on a cruise line and one on a commercial or government ship. This will help you to see the difference in these career paths.

, Most maritime academies offer placement services to help you find your first job and develop qualifications along your career path. You can also apply for an officer position the U.S. Merchant Marine Reserve, Coast Guard Reserve or Naval Reserve.


Although your career goal is captain, you have to start on the deck to gain needed experience. If you did not get a Bachelor's degree, you will have to spend thousands of hours -- and many years-- gaining experience as a deckhand before you can move up the ship hierarchy and become a deck officer or third mate, which qualifies you to take exams to become a captain. If you did get the Bachelor's degree, you can skip the deckhand stage altogether.The exams test your knowledge and readiness and also entail a thorough background check, including a review of your criminal record and citizenship as well a physical exam and vision and hearing evaluations. There are fees associated with these credentials, ranging from $50 to $100 USD., Before applying for a program, make sure the school offers courses specifically about captaining a cruise ship. Achieve top grades during your studies, because many cruise ships only hire captains who are in the top 5 or 10 percent of their graduating class.


A Master's degree is not always necessary to get a position, but because cruise ship positions are highly sought after, it might make a difference in your job search. Many cruise ship captains do not have a Master's degree. You will have to decide if your experience is enough or if you could benefit from a Master's degree on your resume; for instance, if you did not attend a maritime high school or Marine Academy, and/or if you have not had many years of experience on a vessel, you may need the additional education to be a viable candidate for a position on a cruise ship., If you plan to work out of the United States, you will be required to earn a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) and a Merchant Mariner Credential (MMC). Outside the United States, check with your local governing bodies to determine what certifications you will need.


Certification exams require physicals, vision tests, drug screenings and written and practical exams. Merchant marine academies train their students in the topics that will be featured on these exams. People who gain their qualifications through experience may need to take exam prep courses to ensure they pass the exams. There are fees associated with these credentials, ranging from $50 to $100 USD., This test is administered by the US Coast Guard, or another country's licensing agency. After approximately 10 or more years of experience, you may be qualified to take this exam.


The marine captain's license also qualifies you for positions with the United States government, including the Coast Guard., You must hold the position as marine captain for a number of years before applying to become a cruise ship captain. Develop an excellent track record.


In the vast majority of cases, marine captains are promoted after serving as deck officer or third mate on that ship. The time until promotion varies by organization and company, as well as by your own performance in each position.

, Most cruise ships hire people from their country of origin.


For example, most officer positions for Norwegian Cruise Lines are given to Norwegian citizens. The exception is their ship Pride of America, which only hires American citizens.You will need to check the website of cruise line companies to find out their hiring requirements for particular job openings.

, Because the field is so competitive, there is no guarantee that you will be able to find a position once you've obtained all the needed qualifications. There are several career paths that you can take while you wait for a job to open up as a cruise ship captain.


Continue working as a merchant marine captain. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs in this industry are growing with an expected rate of 14% growth between now and 2022, outpacing the number of new captains available, so the odds of finding a position in a freight ship are much higher than the odds of finding a position as a cruise ship captain.Consider joining the U.S. Armed Forces or working for the U.S. government. Particularly if you attended a State Maritime Academy, the United States seeks capable and well trained captains who can meet its national security needs."

Be open to learning.,
Advance your training.,
Consider the type of nurse you’d like to be.,
Earn an advanced degree.,
Move between hospitals.,
Try travel nursing.",How to Become a Better Nurse1," New practices and procedures constantly arise in the healthcare field. As a nurse you need to have expertise in a broad range of both scientific and personal skills. Recognize that you can learn from any person and any situation. Nurses who are open to learning new things, and see each experience as a learning experience, are more likely to perform well.;
, In addition to what you will learn from your daily work, there are several ways for you to continue to advance your training. Many states require that Registered Nurses (RNs) and Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) complete a minimum number of “continuing education” hours every few years to renew their licensure or certification.These hours are not part of a formal degree program, but they will help you stay in touch with new developments in the field. There are several training programs that will allow you to earn continuing education hours. Many nurses enjoy their CEU education. Some opportunities are quite popular, so don't wait until the last minute to sign up.


The American Nurses Credentialing Center has information on certification on their website, as well as an online account that helps you track your CEs.Nurse.com offers several free CE courses online. You should check to ensure that online courses will meet your state’s requirements.The American Nurses Association has a catalog of various CE courses available.You can also attend a variety of conferences to gain CE hours.NurseCEU maintains a directory of online CE courses.PESI HealthCare offers several CE seminars in various states.Some associations even offer CE through things such as cruises, where you can earn contact hours and (sometimes) credits.Make sure if you try this option that the cruise will count toward your state’s CE requirements.

, Some nurses love working on the floor as LPNs and RNs. Others may wish to expand the types of nursing they’re able to practice. There are several fields in which Advanced Practice Nurses (APNs) can learn to practice.


A Clinical Nurse Educator (CNE) is an RN who also teaches other nurses in academic settings such as teaching hospitals and nursing schools. In some cases, you can become a CNE with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), but in many cases you will need at least a master’s degree. Some teaching positions will require a Doctorate Degree in Nursing.A Nurse Practitioner is an RN with a master’s degree. NPs can diagnose and manage medical conditions. They can order lab services and X-rays, and many can also prescribe medications. They can also specialize in areas of care such as occupational health, child care, or emergency care.A Certified Nurse Midwife is an APN with a master’s degree. CNMs provide prenatal and OB/GYN care, including examinations, prescriptions, parenting and patient education, and reproductive health care.CNMs can deliver babies and provide postpartum (after birth) care.A Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) is an APN with at least a master’s degree. CNSs specialize in a particular area of clinical practice, such as geriatric or psychiatric care, or the treatment of chronic diseases.CNSs can diagnose and treat conditions within their area of expertise and can also work as expert consultants in nurse training.A Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) is an APN with a master’s degree and additional certification. They can administer anesthesia, and are often the primary providers of anesthesia in rural and underserved areas.A Nurse Informatics Specialist (INS) is an RN who has a master’s degree in informatics (computer information systems). An Informatics Nurse (IN) has informatics experience but not a graduate degree.INSs and INs help evaluate and select new technologies to adopt, as well as train others in how to use the technologies.
A Nurse Researcher conducts scientific research about nursing. NRs typically have at least a master’s degree, but more often have Ph.Ds in Nursing., Nurses are able to practice as LPNs and RNs with an Associate Degree in Nursing. To do some types of nursing, such as Advanced Practice Nursing, you will need to earn a Bachelor Degree or even Master’s Degree in Nursing.With a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), you have more career options. For example, you could become a public health nurse, where you focus on educating communities about health issues, or a nurse educator, where you help educate new nurses.In some cases, if you already have an Associate Degree you can complete a BSN in as little as 12 months through a “completer” program.RNs with associate degrees can often earn their bachelor and master’s degrees in a condensed degree program.To work as a Nurse Practitioner, certified Nurse Midwife, certified Clinical Nurse Specialist, or certified Nurse Anesthetist, you must have a Master’s Degree in Nursing. A master’s degree also opens the door to becoming a supervising or managing nurse. The names of these degrees vary, such as Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), Master of Nursing (MN), Master of Science with Nursing major (MS), or Master of Arts with Nursing major (MA). Full-time master’s degrees take around 2 years to complete, but may take much longer if you continue to work and attend part-time.Online degree programs can be a good option for some, especially if you plan to keep working as a nurse while you pursue higher education. However, these programs can be significantly more expensive than brick-and-mortar programs (between $35k and $60k).Look for degree programs accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) or by the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC).

, Nursing offers a lot of flexibility. Particularly at the beginning of your career, moving between hospitals can help you decide what you are most interested in. It can also help you decide in what environment you want to work.


You can also learn how different hospitals achieve patient safety and satisfaction.
You will likely learn different skills and use different products and technologies in the different hospitals. This increases your flexibility (and employability).

, When hospitals have nursing shortages, they choose travel nurses to fill them. Travel Nurses choose assignments all over the world. In addition to the excitement of living and working in new environments and cultures, travel nursing will allow you to work with different patient populations and different types of medical needs. You will also have the opportunity to work in a range of medical settings, from rural clinics to huge teaching hospitals.Learning different ways to practice nursing will help you become a better nurse.


Most travel nurses have health benefits, housing, and transportation, but you should check with the hospital where you’re applying.
TravelNursing.com has a US job search feature on its website.You can find other job listings with any major search engine, or by asking fellow nurses who’ve worked as travel nurses.

Learn to communicate clearly.,
Take time to explain.,
Be a team player.,
Develop cultural competency.,
Be confident.,
Ask for help when you need it.",How to Become a Better Nurse2," Nurses have to communicate with their patients and other medical staff, often in high-stress, fast-paced environments. It’s important that you learn to communicate clearly and effectively. Always ask your patients if they need anything. Even if they send you running for a million things, they will know you care for them.


Make sure, though, that you don’t sacrifice showing interest in your patients for efficiency. Even if you’re just popping in to check an IV bag, take the time to say hello to your patient. Don’t just run right back out the door.Body language and other forms of nonverbal communication such as eye contact are very important, especially for a caring-based profession like nursing. Make eye contact when you’re speaking and when you’re listening. Make sure that your body language isn’t sending the wrong message. For example, crossed arms or legs suggest that you’re closed off, and shifting your weight from leg to leg suggests that you’re not confident.Present yourself in a calm, respectful manner.
Give complete information. Sometimes, even a minor detail can be the difference between recovery and re-injury for a patient. For example, if you don’t tell an oncoming nurse that your patient fell a few hours ago, that nurse will not know to watch the patient so s/he doesn’t fall again.Remember that what you say isn’t always what others hear. If someone looks confused, or reacts in a way other than you expected, ask for feedback. It’s much better to catch miscommunications early than let them spiral out of control.You will often have to change tactics depending on the situation. If you work in an ER, for example, you will have to talk very differently with a 6-year-old girl than you would an adult man. Approach each patient with the same kindness and respect.

, Patients and their families can often be frightened when they're in a hospital. They may not understand what’s happening to them, or they may be uncertain about what to expect. Take the time to discuss the illness with your patient. Let the patient know what to expect from any procedures, but keep your tone approachable and kind.Stay away from jargon as much as possible. “Cardiac ischemia leading to myocardial infarction” is unintelligible to the average person. It’s better to use plain English when possible: “Your arteries were blocked, and this caused you to have a heart attack.”
Consider the person’s background when you're talking with him or her. Not everyone has the same level of knowledge or ability to understand. Ask questions! It’s a good idea to ask your patient things such as “What do you already know about such-and-such?” or “What questions do you have for me?”Once you’ve explained something, have the patient repeat it back to you to make sure s/he understood it. If there are inaccuracies, gently correct them without making the patient feel ignorant or stupid. For example, “That’s mostly right. But it’s really important that you only ice your foot for 15 minutes at a time, okay?”
Always tell your patients that if they have questions, they should call you. A patient should never leave your care feeling alone or isolated., Nursing is no place for egos. One-upmanship and trying to compare yourself to the other nurses will make you no friends, and won’t be good for your patients, either.Being a team player means that your patients will get the best care possible, and everyone’s jobs will run more smoothly. Collaborating is the key to keeping the staff happy and your patients cared for.Ask your charge nurse what s/he needs help with. Ask your coworkers what they need help with. Similarly, if you need help, ask for it.
On the other hand, don't overextend yourself or neglect your own responsibilities. It’s even more important to be able to help than it is to offer. If you're swamped at a particular moment, recognize your limitations. It’s okay to say “no”.Remember that nurses work with a multi-disciplinary team, and each person has a part to play. Stay in touch with the other people on your team and know what is going on with your patients at each step of the care process., Because you will likely work with patients from many cultural backgrounds, it’s important to develop cultural competency. This means you have an understanding of your own biases and values. You also know how to communicate with people whose English proficiency is limited, and you recognize and respect cultural traditions other than your own.For example, a person from an Asian culture may want to eat only hot food to replace the “vital heat” they have lost through illness. It’s important that you respect your patient’s culture and traditions, or you will communicate that you aren’t interested in your patient’s holistic well-being.If you are interacting with a person whose culture you’re unfamiliar with, ask before taking any actions. Use nonjudgmental open-ended questions, like “Could you tell me more about _____?” or “I would like to learn more about _____?”
Everyone makes mistakes. If you make a culturally inappropriate mistake, acknowledge it and apologize.
You can learn more about cultural competency by studying transcultural nursing assessment. Learn more at www.tcns.org.

, Patients are often scared. They're in a situation that they may not understand, and which may have huge ramifications for their lives. As a nurse, you will be the professional with whom they will have the most contact, and your expertise is invaluable. Speak assertively and with confidence when asked a question or explaining something. If you fumble for an answer or hem and haw with a lot of “ums” and “uhs”, the patient may feel as though you don’t know what you're doing. Being confident (and correct!) in your answers will help you gain your patients’ trust.


For example, if your patient asks whether it’s okay to lay her infant on his stomach, don’t reply “Um, well, I think it’s probably not.” Instead, give a clear, research-based answer: “No, it’s not a good idea. SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) kills many infants every year. Most infants who die of SIDS are usually lying on their sides or stomachs.”Your continuing education training can help you stay on top of the facts you need.
Tell yourself that you know what to do. It can be easy to doubt yourself, especially after a long hectic shift. Remind yourself that you have the knowledge and the skills you need, and what you don’t know, you can learn., Particularly if you’re new to nursing, you may feel worried that asking for help is a sign that you don’t have the necessary expertise to be a good nurse. Remember, though, that no one knows everything. It’s much better to ask when you don’t know something than to make a decision that could harm your patient.When you ask for help, be attentive when it’s offered. Note what your fellow nurses do, and how they handle the situation you were unfamiliar with. Learn from their experience. Repeatedly asking for help on the same issue suggests that you are not paying adequate attention, or that you don't value your fellow nurses’ time.

Demonstrate care.,
Be honest.,
Develop emotional stability.,
Practice flexibility.,
Show compassion.,
Remain calm.,
Practice patience.",How to Become a Better Nurse3," If you cannot care about the people you are serving, you will not excel as a nurse. Nurses deal with the sick and injured and their families on a daily basis, and you, as their nurse, need to be able to show them that you truly care about their situation. Showing you care can occur in a variety of ways, but they all involve attentiveness, responsibility, competence, and responsiveness.People believe that you care when you show them personal attention. For example, if you have a young patient who you know will be afraid to spend the night in the hospital, draw him a picture to cheer him up. If you know your patient prefers red jello to green jello, make sure to get her a cup of the red stuff.
Attentiveness to your patients' needs also shows that you care. For example, if your patient is feeling increased pain, contact the physician in charge of painkillers and get your patient's dosage increased. Then, check in with your patient and ask how s/he's feeling.Don't lapse into a formula with your patients. Make sure you personalize your interactions. Nobody wants to feel like a cog in a giant wheel, least of all people who are ill.

, Be completely honest with your patients, even if you don’t want to, even if you think honesty will upset the patient.Humans are often very good at perceiving when others aren’t being honest with us, and if your patients believe (or discover) that you’re being dishonest with them, it will destroy your patients’ trust in you.Honesty also means following through on your word. If you promise to revisit a patient or take a shift for a coworker, make sure that you follow through. Noting things in a planner or even on your phone can help you keep your obligations straight even in hectic circumstances.Ethics are paramount in nursing. When you make mistakes, own up to them and address them. Use them as learning experiences for next time and do better. Be honest with your team members and the other nurses and hospital staff as well.Patients are scared to be in the hospital, and the last thing they want is to be lied to. However, be wary of giving them a diagnosis, even when pressed; only doctors and nurse practitioners can diagnose.

, Nurses feel the joy of seeing a new baby born, followed by the pain of losing a long-term patient who had become a friend. Emotional stability is crucial in order to survive the roller coaster ride of emotions nurses must endure on a daily basis. Nurses who can’t control their emotions are more likely to experience burnout and low-performance. Nurses who know how to handle their feelings deal with stress better, make better decisions, and have better patient outcomes.Part of developing emotional stability is staying in touch with your feelings. Take moments to check in with yourself throughout the day. Know what you are feeling, and why. Think about the connections between your experiences and your emotions. Trying to bury your emotional responses will only make them explode later.Mindfulness may also help you keep your emotions from controlling you. Mindfulness focuses on noticing what you are experiencing and feeling, and accepting it without judgment. It can help relieve stress and anxiety and help you feel more in charge of yourself.There are many ways to practice mindfulness, but deep breathing and mindfulness meditation are common techniques.

, We're not talking about yoga here (although that can help you with your emotional stability!). Being able to adapt to widely different situations and patient needs is critical for being a good nurse. No day is quite like the next when you work as a nurse, so you need to be able to adapt to circumstances. People are unpredictable at the best of times, but under stress they become even more unpredictable. Nurses who are adaptable are able to handle multiple demands and swift change. They can shift their priorities and view situations from different perspectives.


Learning and practicing flexibility and adapting to change will also build emotional resilience. When you’re able to “roll with the punches,” you’re less likely to feel as though you need to control every facet of a situation. In nursing (and, honestly, life), you’ll never be able to exercise that kind of control., A crucial skill for nurses is empathy. You don’t have to understand exactly how people are feeling or coping with something to understand why they are having a hard time and that they need someone to care. Take the time to listen and ask questions. Sometimes, patients just need someone to acknowledge their feelings.Judgmentalism is the enemy of compassion and empathy. Try to see the situation from your patient’s perspective, even if it seems completely unfamiliar or even “wrong” to you. Even if you have no understanding of why a person would think or feel a certain way, acknowledge the importance of your patients’ feelings.

, Nursing can feel overwhelming and even terrifying sometimes. It’s important, both for your own health and your patients’, that you stay calm. Managing your stress in your personal life will help you with this. In stressful moments on the job, take a deep breath and count to ten. Remind yourself that you chose this profession because you want to help, and you can’t help your patient if you’re both upset.For example, if you are working in a labor and delivery unit, you might come across a woman who needs an emergency c-section to protect her baby’s health. This is an alarming and stressful moment for the mother, so it’s important that you remain the rock of calm in the situation. Clearly and quietly explain what is going to happen and why it’s necessary. Don’t raise your voice, shout, or become visibly upset. Watch to make sure your patient looks like she understands and ask for confirmation, such as “Nod if you understand.” If your patient doesn’t understand, try your best to clarify your explanation. Your cool and collected manner will set an example for your patient.

, As a nurse, you will encounter many situations that try your patience: lost charts, needy patients, overprotective parents. It’s important that you remain patient with your patients, but also stay patient with co-workers, physicians and family members -- even when you’ve been at work for 8 hours and the eighth family member from the same patient comes and ask you the same question again.Don’t give information that you don’t know or shouldn’t share. For example, a patient may ask you about test results that you know the results of. However, the doctor should call the patient to discuss the results. Calmly explain that you can’t give your patient that information.

Research the position and company to which you are applying.,
Keep it concise and specific.,
Give examples that illustrate your ability to learn, be mentored, and take on a new responsibility.,
Demonstrate your accomplishments and results.,
Avoid resume stunts.",How to Be Visible to Employers3," Understanding the job, a company’s history, and where the company is heading are all key to crafting a position-specific resume. Utilize the company’s website and social media profiles to conduct your research.

, You don’t need to put everything on every resume you submit. Keep a master list of all jobs and experience and use this to craft concise, position-specific resumes that market you as a great fit for the job. Three pages or less is more than sufficient.Start with your current or most recent job and list no more than a total of five positions.
For example, if you are applying for a job as a teacher you probably don’t need to include the pet store job you worked in high school.

, Be specific and to the point about how you progressed in a particular position. For example, if you gradually took on increased responsibilities over the course of your internship, highlight this in your resume., Employers don’t want you to tell them about what you accomplished, they want to see it demonstrated in a tangible way on your resume. Be clear about outcomes and how these contributed to the overall success of a particular project or organization. For example, if you designed an educational program at the local museum as part of your internship, include information on how many school groups and individuals participated. This will demonstrate a tangible outcome from your work.

, Flashy, over-the-top, and exceptionally lengthy resumes will do little to increase your odds of being hired for a position. Your efforts may instead come off as desperate, juvenile, or self-serving. Get back to the basics and craft a resume that illustrates results and authenticity, and pair it with a cover letter that demonstrates your understanding of what a potential employer wants."

Prepare for the interview.,
Dress professionally for the interview, even if it’s online.,
Be on time.,
Ask questions.,
Follow up.",How to Be Visible to Employers4," You’ll need to spend time researching both your future employer and the position itself. Think through possible questions and come up with responses. You should also come up with a list of questions to ask at the end of your interview.


Use internet search engines to research the people that might be interviewing you.
Ask a friend who just landed their dream job about what went well and what didn’t go so well during their interview.
Do a mock interview with a friend or family member. Have them ask you the possible interview questions you came up with.

, People can form their first impression of you in as little as 30 seconds, and what you wear to an interview can play a major role in whether or not an employer decides to hire you. Avoid dressing casually and instead, aim for a business professional look.Research the office attire at your future place of employment prior to the interview. If everyone shows up at work in shorts and flip flops, a three-piece suit might be a little over the top.
Generally speaking, suits, dresses, even dress pants or a skirt paired with a jacket are all professional choices for most interviews.

, This should go without saying, but it is critical you are punctual when interviewing for a position. Arrive at least 15 minutes early and allow plenty of extra time for unanticipated obstacles like traffic., Bring along a mental or paper list of questions about the job, the company, and the future of the position to which you are applying. Asking questions provides you with an opportunity to learn more and show employers you are curious and prepared.Try asking, “I’m excited to learn about new branches of the company opening up in Tulsa and Kansas City. Do this mean the position will require regular travel to these locations?”

, It’s important to send a thank-you letter after the interview, regardless of how you think it went. Whether or not you send a thank-you to your interviewers affects their decision-making process.While it’s permissible to send a handwritten letter, it may not reach your interviewers before they make a decision. Instead, try sending an email within 24 hours of your interview.
Your letter should thank the interviewer for meeting with you, state something you enjoyed about the interview and reiterate your interest in the company and position.

Keep in mind that any interview counts as good experience.,
Make an interview journal to keep track of your progress.",How to Assess Your Chances During a Job Interview," If the interviewer keeps strong eye contact with you throughout the interview, you can take it as a sign that the interviewer respects and is interested in you.If your interviewer avoids eye contact, you're probably not the top candidate. This holds true even if the interviewer is looking at your resume. Referring to your resume during an interview rather than addressing you directly probably means your interviewer is just going through the motions and doesn’t expect anything earth-shattering from you.;
, If your interviewer is fiddling with a desk drawer, texting on his/her phone, or speaking to other people in the office, it probably means that your interviewer is not allotting full attention to your words.Your interviewer’s distraction isn’t necessarily personal. HR employees are notoriously overworked, so it can be tough to get them to grant you their undivided attention. Overcome this attention deficit by inserting talking points which you’ve already identified into your answers., These are two of the most positive gestures one can make, so, while they don’t necessarily indicate you’ve got the job, they are good indications that the interviewer likes you and, at the very least, that you haven’t bombed your interview.Make sure you mirror the interviewer's smiles and positive body language. This shows the interviewer that you're engaged in the interview and eagerly interested in the job.

, If an interviewer has been rubbed the wrong way by something you said, that person will likely display closed body language, such as folded arms or leaning backward. Taking offense does not bode well for your interview. Don’t throw yourself off a cliff just yet, though. The key to addressing such a scenario is directness. Ask your interviewer how you could answer the question more effectively, or if there was something you said which upset him/her.

, This is a positive gesture that denotes respect and interest, so it's a good sign if your interviewer closes your interview with a solid clasp of the hand., A compliment from your interviewer is usually a good sign, especially if it pertains to something specific about your career experience or cover letter.


Watch out for overly vague compliments like, “Well you’re very well qualified for this position.” While it's not likely to be fake or underhanded, this kind of praise is so general that it doesn't reflect much regarding the interviewer’s attitude toward you., If an interviewer finds your answers to the warm-up questions smoothly handled and intriguing, he or she might shift into more complicated and specific questions to see how you acquit yourself.When fielding a tough question, don’t rush to say the first thing you can think of. Instead, take a few moments to contemplate your answer before responding. Your interviewer will take this as a sign of sincerity and thoughtfulness, and your answer will benefit from the extra consideration.

, Although it can be tempting, try to not read too much into any single thing the interviewer says. Pay more attention to the overall flow and feel of the interview, and not just to one or two seemingly negative or obscure phrases.


For example, just because the interviewer says, “I’m eager to speak with you more,” or, “Let me show you the office you’ll be working in,” doesn’t mean you’re a shoo-in. Often times these phrases are merely polite platitudes which your interviewer repeats to all candidates.If the interviewer says something like, ""Don't take it personally if you don't get this job,"" or, “We're interviewing many more candidates,” you should probably manage your expectations regarding this particular job. Don’t lose hope completely, but keep trudging along on the job trail and looking for more opportunities., Listen to the flow of conversation and watch how your interviewer responds to your answers. If the interviewer interrupts your replies, it probably denotes boredom or lack of interest.Try making your responses more concise and see if your interviewer stops interrupting. If that doesn’t work, focus on remembering the questions you’ve been asked so you can work to improve them later.

, Often times, an interviewer’s choice to guide the interview onto the personal plane indicates a strong interest. This is because an interviewer is unlikely to spend valuable time on chatting with someone who is not considered a serious candidate., On the one hand, if your interview runs short, you're probably getting passed over. On the other hand, if your interview goes long, it's a great sign that you've made a good impression and are a serious candidate for that prized position., If you can't read the interviewer at the end of the interview, work up your courage, smile, look him or her in the eye, and ask directly: ""I appreciate your taking the time to interview me. How did I do?"".


The interviewer will most likely be glad to discuss your performance candidly and give you some pointers. If not, though, don’t press your luck. Bid a gracious farewell, and think about what you can do better next time.
Take the time to ask some more general questions about the job and what makes a good candidate. Question the interviewer about what qualities they are seeking in a candidate, or what skills and values they most appreciated in the person who most recently filled the position.Thinking of your interviewer as a resource for future success will enhance your job prospects as well as make you less nervous during your interviews.

, Even if you’re pretty sure you’re not getting the job, remember that all interviews represent opportunities to practice your interview skills, responses, and poise.You’ll find that thinking about every interview as valuable practice will make you more open-minded about job listings and available opportunities. You’ll apply to a broader range of jobs and your chances of success will increase.

, Every time you come back from an interview, write down the questions you were asked and how you answered them. This will help you spot your weaknesses and prepare more effectively for the next interview.Take the time to jot down what you think you did well during the interview in addition to the stumbling blocks you encountered. This will ensure that you recognize your successes and keep thinking positively about your job hunt, rather than wallowing in your failures.

Request an informational interview.,
Use your cover letter.,
Follow up via phone.,
Visit the workplace.,
Research the company.,
Research your potential interviewers.,
Use your research to define your goals.",How to Ask for a Job Interview," Before you apply for a specific job, you can ask for an informational interview. During this type of interview, you present questions. It's a research-type interview through which you can learn more about the company. You might contact the HR person and ask for a phone interview. Alternatively, you could connect with someone you know who works at the firm.


Use professional social networks like LinkedIn or university alumni networks to find contacts within an organization. When asking these people for an interview, state that you are interested in learning more about the company and their particular role. Do not ask for a reference or job.
Make a list of questions beforehand. If possible, research the person's role as well so you do not need to ask basic questions. For example, ""What do you do?"" shows you have not done your research. Rather, ask ""what do you find most challenging in your analyst role?"";
, In your cover letter, you can be polite and direct about wanting to ask for an interview. In your last paragraph, mention wanting an interview. Be appreciative rather than demanding. Do not name a particular date, though. You also might mention that you will call the recruiter in one week to enquire further.For example, you might write, ""I am very interested in speaking with you as soon as possible. I would be available for an interview during the next two weeks.""
You also might try saying: ""I look forward to learning more about needs and how I could contribute to your team. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to set up an interview.""
Thank the hiring manager for taking the time to review your materials. Close with a statement such as, ""I look forward to hearing from you soon.""
HR workers can receive tens to hundreds of job applications for a single job. Make sure that your letter is tailored to the job at hand and shows your knowledge of the firm and how you can mutually benefit each other. See Write a Cover Letter for additional tips.
List your contact information clearly on your cover letter and resume. Include your telephone number, Skype address, times available, and email address. You want to make the HR person's job as easy as possible.

, If you have not heard from a recruiter after seven to ten days, take matters into your own hands. Call the listed recruiter. Ask whether she has seen your materials. If the person has been busy, it is possible she has not had time to review your materials. Be very polite and ask for a potential timeline. If she has reviewed your materials, ask whether you could have an interview. She might not be able to give you an answer yet but at least you will know what your current status is.


If there is not a listed recruiter, call the company's main office and ask for a transfer to the HR department.
Open the conversation by thanking the hiring manager for taking your call. Ask if he has time for a quick question or two. Acknowledging that the hiring manager's time is valuable will convey respect.
You might call and say, ""Hello, my name is Martha Owens. I submitted an application for the program manager position last week. I was wondering whether it would be possible to arrange an interview in the coming two weeks.""
Do not make a follow-up call is if the job posting explicitly states that applicants should not call.
You also can follow up via email.

, In many cases, this is not possible. But in some situations, like small, family-run businesses (e.g. ice cream shop, car lot, etc.), you might do well by visiting in person. Introduce yourself, say that you have sent in your materials, and ask whether they would have time to chat. People are busy and especially in smaller businesses, they don't always have time to process materials quickly.


Although entering a new setting can be overwhelming, stay calm. Aim to be confident and relaxed and consider saying something like, ""Hello, Mr. Smithie. My name is John Collins. I submitted an application to be an ice cream scooper last week. Have you had time to look at it?""

, Peruse its website. See what its mission and structure are. If it's a larger company, read its annual financial report. Also, research industry-specific information. Are their trade journals or professional associations related to what this company does?At this point, you should have submitted your application. Be sure to submit your application and all the necessary materials before asking for an interview. It is also wise to wait at least one week before expecting a response or following up.

, What are their backgrounds? What were their career paths? See if you can find their LinkedIn profiles. Look for any similarities between you and them. For example, you might share an alma mater or a major hobby. While these topics might come up, if they are relevant, mention them.Do social media searches anonymously if possible. For example, if you are not logged into LinkedIn, you can perform a public search.

, While doing research on the company or its employees, see how their values and projects connect to you. How can you demonstrate that their company fits into your career trajectory? How will this job help you achieve your goals. While it is important to emphasize how you can benefit them, think about how they can benefit you too."

Put it together.",How to Answer What Interests You About This Job," Before an interview, you should always take time to research the company. Find out everything you can from the company's website. You can also do an internet news search to see what the company has been up to lately. Don't forget to look at things like the company's mission statement to get an idea about what is valued there.Don't forget to read between the lines. Both mission statements and press releases can be intentionally dense. In mission statements, look for keywords, such as ""leading,"" meaning the company is or wants to be the top in the industry, ""innovation or innovative,"" meaning the company values creative new ideas and products, or ""targeted,"" meaning the company focuses the product within the industry. For press releases, look for the positive spin. That is, the company is always looking to put a positive spin on anything going on with the company. For instance, the company ""going a new direction"" could mean they had a product flop.;
, That is, when you're researching, don't just look at the mission statement. See if you can figure out what kind of culture the place is creating. Maybe they have a relaxed atmosphere that values creativity. Maybe they prefer a strictly professional atmosphere. You need to know about the culture so you can show how you fit in.One way to figure out the culture is to look at the social media the company puts out. You may be able to figure out the culture from the way they use language in posts or from pictures they have put up in the past.
Another way to figure out the company is to visit the company ahead of time. See if you can walk around to get a sense of how they operate.
For instance, many of the new (and even some of the established) social media tech companies are famous for having a laid-back cultures that push innovation through group work. However, if you're going into say, the banking industry, the culture is likely to be more professional.

, While researching, be sure to take some notes. Make an outline of what defines the company, and what's been going on lately. That way, you have something to refer back to as your prepare for the interview.

, Your interviewer will be impressed you did your research. However, you don't want to just spew out what you know. Use it to praise the company, and show you want to work there.For instance, you wouldn't want to just say, ""I like that you sell good products."" Instead, you should say something such as, ""I was excited when I saw this position was with XYZ Products. Your products are innovative, as proven by how much your sales have gone up the last year. Also, I like that you intentionally encourage a culture of creativity, as I think that pushes innovation.""

, Reading the job description is the best way to prepare interview answers that will speak to the company's needs. That is, the company is telling you exactly what they want from you. You have to show them why you meet those needs perfectly.For example, if the job description calls for ""time management skills and the ability to think outside of the box"" and specifies that you will be expected to work as a team player, then you know that the company may be looking for someone who possesses qualities like organizational skills, punctuality, creativity, inventiveness, communication skills, and cooperativeness.

, It is important that you choose realistically, as you want to be able to elaborate on your answers during the interview. Use your past experience to back up your claims.For example, if you claim to be a creative problem solver, think about positions or situations in the past that show you have been able to solve problems with a creative mind.
Make sure to provide an anecdote or statistics to back up what you're saying. For instance, if you want to show you solved problems creatively, bring up a specific situation in which you made that happen, such as when you had to redesign the base of a product to make it stand up properly.

, Once again, if you're going to remember what you want to say in your interview, you're going to need to go over your response a few times. Try printing out the job description and making notes on it, so you have it in front of you to review.

, Now, when you get in the interview, you must use your past experience to explain both why you're interested in the job and why you'd be a good candidate at the same time. That means that you have to phrase your answer as showing interest in the job while working in your good characteristics.Refer to the position you are applying for, along with the characteristics you have chosen to illuminate. For instance, you could say, ""I was pleased to find that you were accepting applications for a design expert with creative problem-solving skills because I have the perfect experience for this position. I have worked as a design expert for 10 years, and I have had to solve problems when designs didn't work quite right. However, I always came up with a solution to the problem. For instance, one time I had to come up with a solution for a product that wouldn't stand up correctly and I needed to rebuild the base. My boss was pleased with the final product.""

, For instance, if it's a design position and it's always been your dream to be the head of a design department, think about how those two are connected. Connect what you're doing now with what you want to be doing., One thing that you want to do with this step is prove that you are in it for the long haul. A manager will not want to hire you if she or he thinks you are going to be leaving in a year. Therefore, show that you plan to be there for awhile.However, if you are talking about how you want to advance, make it known that you don't expect to advance for awhile, and you plan to prove yourself and work your way up.

, Finally, put together your answer. Talk about how it connects to your career as the conclusion to what you have to say. Keep it concise. You don't want to ramble on too long.


For instance, you could say, ""I've always wanted to manage a small design department, so I would plan on proving myself in this position so that I could advance in the long term.""
Remember this part is just the final portion of your answer. You need all three parts included in this article to make a complete answer.

Ask questions yourself.,
Take your time.,
Keep eye contact.,
Avoid sentence fillers.,
Have a confident appearance.",How to Answer Questions on a Structured Oral Interview," If you received a list of the questions for the interview you have time to prepare your answers. Write your answers down for each question and memorize them. If you have memorized your answers you will be able to voice them in the interview with poise and confidence.If you do not receive a list of the questions before your interview you can prepare by asking yourself questions you think might be asked.


If this is a job interview for a specific position, ask yourself questions you think they might ask that would be relevant to the position and industry.
Write down your answers and memorize important sentences and words that have significance to the subject.;
, Do research on the topic of your interview - even if you do not know what questions are going to be asked. Researching will provide information you may not have known about the topic/industry and can help structure answers. Doing research will also show the interviewer you took time and effort in preparing for and better understanding the topic.


Researching can also lead to questions you may have for the interviewer after their questions are completed and it is now your turn.

, Some people tend to become overwhelmed in oral interviews and they forget to actually listen to the interviewer. Listening to every word of the question is very important and can help structure your answer. Listen for terms that sound familiar from your research… this can impress the interviewer if you answer using information from those terms.

, If you are confused about what the interviewer is asking in a particular question it is OK to ask for clarification. This can help you fully understand a question instead of assuming you can answer it correctly.

, Questions do not need to be answered immediately. Take your time and get your thoughts organized in your head before responding to the question. Some tricks to gain some time are:


Take a deep breath. Breathing stimulates the brain and calms nerves allowing you to devise words in a collected manner.
Smile and nod. Smiling releases tension and produces relaxing feelings in both the interviewee and interviewer, while nodding lets the interviewer know you were paying attention and understand the question that was presented.

, Keeping eye contact will let the interviewer know you are paying attention, alert and not easily distracted. Keeping eye contact can also help in understanding the question as you will have undivided attention to what is being said and will help keep your mind from wandering.

, Avoid words such as “like”, “um” and “you know”. We often utter these words unconsciously when we are thinking of what to say next but they unfortunately weaken the structure of sentences. Words and sentences can be much stronger and have a greater effect if these sentence fillers are avoided as much as possible.

, Although oral interviews are based on questions and answers it is always important to remember body language. Going into an interview with confidence will enhance your posture all the while relaxing your body and mind.

Come prepared.,
Avoid specific dollar amounts when possible.,
Discuss other forms of compensation.",How to Answer Questions About Salary1," It is important to do your research ahead of time to figure out what salary range is appropriate to expect for someone with your experience, level of education, and specific skill set. You need to have some idea what the position is worth and what your skills are worth in order to navigate the compensation question during an interview.You can search websites like salary.com, payscale.com, glassdoor.com, and others to find out information about what people are getting paid in equivalent positions.
You should also try asking around to various friends and colleagues, especially if they are in a related field, to figure out what an appropriate figure would be.;
, If you are asked about compensation for previous employment, use specific dollar values only if the situation requires them, and do so in a strategic and thoughtful manner. You do not want to appear as though you are boasting or prying into someone else's business.When in a professional setting such as an employment interview, avoid bringing up previous salary figures. Base your personal salary requirements on your education level, previous experience and skill set, and comparable industry statistics. Come prepared with updated and current data regarding average compensation for someone with your level of qualifications.
If the potential employer does ask you to provide a specific dollar value for a desired salary, be honest with your expectations. A common mistake occurs when employees propose a salary lower than they would really want to accept for fear of being turned away by the employer. Whether in a range or a single amount, a prospective employee should never offer an amount less than they are willing to take under the worst situation. A useful strategy is to offer a mid-range figure with the statement that is negotiable depending upon benefits, promotion opportunities, etc. That way, each party can save face.

, Let the interviewer know that salary requirements are not your only point of interest or concern. This will help you steer the conversation away from a discussion focused solely on dollar amounts. Express to the interviewer that aside from salary, other job-related issues such as career advancement, professional opportunities, or other benefits associated with the position are very important to you.If a potential employer asks you to disclose the salary level of your current or previous position, do not be afraid to include all forms of compensation. This could include health benefits, 401(k) contributions, profit sharing, or other benefits in addition to your base salary. State the amount of your ""total compensation"" including the value of the benefits package.
There is nothing wrong with this strategy, so try not to consider it misleading. In return, be sure to consider all forms of compensation when comparing a competing salary offer to your current or previous position. Employee benefits are an often overlooked but significant portion of a salary offer.

List examples where you've dealt with conflict.,
Think about the approach you took dealing with these conflicts.,
Find a way to articulate this succinctly.,
Consider how these conflicts were resolved long term.,
Communicate what employers want to hear.,
Practice telling your conflict/resolution story.,
Be specific.,
Avoid using negative language when speaking about a company or co-worker.,
Have several examples ready.",How to Answer Interview Questions About Conflict," For the most part, when interviewers ask about conflict they're looking for an example. An interviewer might ask a broad question like, ""Can you tell me about a time you've dealt with conflict at the office?"" As you're preparing for your job hunt, keep a running list of conflicts you've dealt with professionally over the years.


Workplace conflicts can range from small misunderstandings to large blowouts. You should pick something that is fairly easy to explain in a few sentences and stick to examples that highlight professional conflicts. Talking about how you and a co-worker had creative differences while working on a presentation is a better example than two employees dating and then breaking up.Pick only conflicts that were fixed. Interviewers respond best to narrative examples, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. You don't want to choose a conflict that was left unresolved as an open-ended closing is unsatisfactory to a potential employer.Your examples should highlight your own actions. Select a conflict that you took action to resolve rather than choosing a disagreement that was fixed by an outside party. Also, select a conflict that was somewhat substantial. While the conflict does not need to be cataclysmic, it should be an issue that lasted more than a day or two.One example of a good workplace conflict would be something like, ""I was working on a brochure for an upcoming charity auction our company was hosting. I was working with Ramona, a designer for the company, and she missed a few important deadlines. As a result, I was concerned we would not finish the brochure in time to do adequate advertising for the auction."" This is a conflict where there is something at stake, a brochure, and the resolution is not necessarily black and white.;
, Your interviewer will want to know how you dealt with this conflict. Consider this carefully. It can be helpful to jot down a few short paragraphs explaining how you dealt with a handful of work conflicts.


Focus on how you resolved the disagreement in a way that was both professional and productive. Emphasize overcoming any feelings of frustration to work on a solution that was beneficial to your workplace.Do not just talk about your actions. Also, talk about your mentality while coping with the conflict. What were you thinking, and why?Take the above example. A good follow up might be, ""When I tried to discuss my worries with Ramona, she blew up at me and I was taken aback. I tried to remain calm and consider her feelings. She explained she had a very specific plan for the brochure and did not feel the company gave her enough time to complete to project. I asked if there was any way I could help, and she told me if I would allow her to train me to do a few simple design tasks it would take a lot off her plate. I agreed and we managed to work together and complete the brochure in time."" This shows that you took action in the face of conflict and highlights your capacity to empathize with a co-worker's situation.

, You should make sure you can explain the situation briefly. A potential employer will be conducting many interviews throughout the course of the day and might not remember details if you include too much.


Try to write down the basics of the situation in bullet points and then practice telling the story a few times before your interview., A good narrative needs a satisfying ending. In addition to how you handled the situation, place focus on the long term. How did your actions affect future interactions with your co-workers? What did you learn from the situation?


Focus on the positive outcomes. First, talk about the outcomes specific to the situation. In our example, you could try saying something like, ""The brochure was received well by the community and the auction ended up having a very high turnout."":Say a few words about what you learned. Interviewers want to make sure you are proactive about trying situations and take them as an opportunity for growth. In regards to our example, you could say something like, ""My experience taught me differences can be resolved through patience and understanding and it's very important to see situations through another person's eyes."", You need to understand the intention of conflict questions to best answer them. Interviewers are using these questions go gauge your competence as a potential employee.


You should convey that you're aware of other people's sensitivities. Empathy and understanding are important to any work place, so always highlight what you imagined the other party was feeling in any conflict questions.Your interviewer also wants to make sure you follow rules set out by a company. Make sure you emphasis that you acted appropriately within the context of your company and followed procedure properly.Your interviewer wants to know how you avoided escalation. No potential employer wants to hire someone who's going to cause drama at work. Focus on situations where you remained calm and tackled a problem head-on in a way that addressed the needs of all parties involved., Before you go into an interview, you should practice telling your conflict story. Make sure you remember all the important details and can tell the story in a quick, concise fashion.


You should write your story down in bullet points and practice telling it a few times, talking out loud. You could even have a friend or family member listen to you tell the story and give you pointers. Ask them to be honest about whether or not they understood the details of your story.Conflicts can sometimes be sensitive subjects, even when resolved. It may be somewhat uncomfortable to talk about a workplace conflict, which is why practice is so important to get the story across in a way that's fair., An interviewer might not always ask for a specific example. He might say something like, ""Tell me about how you handle conflict in the workplace?"" Do not take this as an invitation to be inexact. Always use specifics when discussing conflict.


Talk about what strategies you use and why they work. You should use concrete examples, even if you don't launch into an entire narrative. Try something like, ""I try to see things from other people's perspective. For example, if I'm working with someone from a more creative background I try to make sure they have the time and resources they need to complete a project.""Talk about what tactics you use in communication to resolve conflict. Do you listen actively? Do you express yourself in a transparent way? If so, how? Go into further detail. Your interviewer is going to be seeing a lot of candidates and you want to make sure you stay memorable., Even if you were frustrated by a situation, it's considered bad form to speak negatively of a co-worker or employer. Always try to present the conflict in a fair manner, even if you still think you were right, and do not use disparaging language. Employers value loyalty and if an interviewer sees you're quick to bad talk your former place of business he will not want to hire you.Let's go back to our example. You may be tempted to say something like, ""Ramona made it difficult because she was lazy about deadlines."" Try to phrase that in a more positive light. For example, ""Ramona's creativity was her priority, which was helpful for our design department but as a result she occasionally forgot deadlines.""

, An employer may ask a variety of questions about conflict, so you should not just have one example of resolving a conflict on hand. Before you go into an interview, think of a variety of times you handled conflict at work. As always, stick to win-win situations where the conflict was resolved and you learned something in the process."

Familiarize yourself with company policy.,
Give your boss time to prepare.,
Act confident, but not entitled.,
Answer question efficiently.,
Accept the outcome.",How to Answer Questions About Salary2," While it is illegal in the United States to forbid employees from discussing salaries and compensation under the National Labor Relations Act, many businesses frown on such discussions and view it as a reprimandable offence.This means that you could be punished at work for discussing your salary with other employees or inquiring about your colleagues’ salaries. You might not be fired for this, but you still don’t want to get reprimanded at work.

, Since the discussion of money is a relatively sensitive topic, you don’t want to spring it on your boss as a surprise. They’ll need time to gather the necessary information (salary statistics, performance reviews, etc.) and to mull over what they want to discuss with you.If you have an annual performance review meeting, this would be a great time to bring up the discussion. Otherwise, give your boss a heads up that you would like to schedule some time to discuss your performance and compensation.

, Project an appearance of confidence and professionalism when the topic of salary negotiation arises. You want to show your boss evidence of why you feel that you have earned a raise, not simply that you feel you are entitled to one because a certain amount of time has passed since your last raise. Being able to speak confidently and openly about salary expectations will show your employer or associate that you are professional and confident. Getting embarrassed or nervous when speaking about your salary may give the impression that you are not capable of discussing complex issues with coworkers.
Remember that compensation is not a ""gift"" from an employer, but a negotiated exchange of compensation for expected value to be received by employer. If the employer did not believe they would get that value, they would not make that offer.

, Don’t try to give your boss a presentation about all the reasons you think you deserve a raise. Listen to your boss’s questions and comments and try to tailor your responses to what they want.Don’t offer a lot of extra information or get emotional.
Try responses like, “I feel that I am a valuable asset to this company for reasons X, Y, and Z, and based on my contributions to the success of our business, I feel that I should get a raise.”
If your boss asks you for a specific dollar amount, aim high (but be aware of any salary ceilings). This means that your boss can counter with a lower offer that you both could be satisfied with., If your boss says no to your request for a salary increase, accept their answer. Don’t get visibly upset or start an argument. Once you confidently present your case, the rest is out of your hands.Of course, you can also ask for other forms of compensation like more paid time off or other benefits.
Ask your boss for constructive criticism so that you can do a better job in the future and get the raise you want.
Don't burn bridges or quit even if you don't get the raise you feel you deserve. If you want to start looking elsewhere for a higher salary, remember that it is easier to find another position while employed than unemployed, so stick with your current job until you find something else.

Deflect the conversation.,
Consider the consequences.,
Limit your discussions about compensation to business mentors and family.",How to Answer Questions About Salary3," It is often considered a taboo to speak openly regarding specific figures of your salary, even among friends. If you are asked about your salary but don't wish to provide a specific dollar amount, simply make a generic response such as ""modest"" or even ""considerable."" It is also acceptable to calmly and confidently reply that you do not wish to discuss salary unless it is necessary.This is an especially good tactic if revealing your salary would make you uncomfortable or if you believe it would cause tension between you and the person asking.
You might say something like, ""I make about an average salary for someone with my job and experience.""

, Discussing your income with a friend or family member who makes relatively close to the same amount as you is probably a harmless encounter; however, if you disclose your earnings to someone who makes significantly more or less than you, this could become a source of tension in your relationship in the future.For example, feelings of resentment could arise if a friend discovers you make significantly more money than them. Or there could be disagreements over what activities you do together because one of you can afford it and the other can’t.
Additionally, people might judge your financial decisions more harshly when they know the specifics of your income. For example, your mother might chide you for buying a new car if she thinks your salary isn’t enough to support the decision.

, Circumstances are always different from one person to the next. Your friend might be in a similar position and make more money than you, but that friend might also have additional skills or education that you lack. Keep in mind that information gained from awkward conversation is rarely reliable.


Consider simply talking generally about salary with those close to you. You can ask for advice on how to negotiate for more money (strategies that have worked for them and those that didn’t work so well) without needing to disclose specific numbers.

If possible, learn examples from employees about the type of person that fits in well, so you can explain what a good match you will be.Use the internet to find out information. You may be able to find past employees to talk to through social media. Check the company's social media and financial reports.Look over the company's website to find out what they value; a great place to look for value's is in the company's mission statement.Also, look at recent news to find out what the company has been up to recently.;
, Several days ahead of time, take a good look at the job description. Use a another piece of paper to break the description down into groups.Break it down into a list of skills and experience the company wants. Match up your own skills with each of those on the list.It may be difficult to decipher what exactly the company wants from an employee because the company uses obscure language. You need to learn to read between lines. For instance, ""dynamic"" generally means someone who can tackle problems and project with confidence, while ""self-starter"" means someone who is able to take initiative when something needs to be done. A ""team player"" is someone who can work well with a wide variety of people.
If possible, divide it into two categories of ""required"" and ""nice to have."" Put most of your attention on ""nice to have,"" since if you get the interview, you likely have the required skills., Write out a detailed response next to each qualification the employer is asking for in the job description. Remember that you must describe why you are the solution to the employer’s problems. For example, if the job description lists managing a small team as necessary experience, list out the positions you’ve held and any achievements that you’ve earned.
Use any relevant experience, including jobs outside the industry. For instance, if you worked in fast-food restaurant in college and managed other people, that shows relevant experience.
You can also mention experience that wasn't for a paid position, especially if you hadn't had many jobs. For instance, running a club on campus or even acting as coach for an intramural sports team also counts as management experience.

, Once you've matched up your skills to the job description, choose the top 3 or 4 to focus on when you're giving your answer. You don't want your answer to be all over the place, so pick the ones where you experience best matches the most important parts of the job description., Try giving an answer in front of the mirror. Next, move up to a family member or friend. Just run through it a couple of times so you remember the main ideas. You don't want your answer to sound rehearsed, but the main ideas should be thoroughly committed to your memory., Don't think your preparation is done when you get to the interview. Have a piece of paper with you to take notes. Write down specific keywords, and identify specific traits and skills the company is looking for based on what the person interviewing you is saying., Maybe you haven't had a chance to highlight your people skills. Alternatively, maybe you haven't had a chance to talk about your computer skills. Make a note on your paper about these lapses, so that you can address them in an open-ended question later, such as ""Why should I hire you?"", For instance, you may notice the interviewer thinks you are overqualified if she keeps asking about your years of experience and how you would do with people younger than you being in charge. Alternatively, maybe the interviewer thinks you don't have the skills of the job, which you may have noticed when she asked about a specific skill that you're not strong in., If the job description wasn't particularly detailed, feel free to ask some questions yourself. That way, you have a better idea of what the job entails, so you can answer the question more directly.


Ask questions such as ""What goals will the person who’s hired be asked to focus on immediately?” or “What qualities do you usually look for in a new hire?”
You can also ask a question such as ""What is a typical day like in this position?""

, As you begin to answer the question, focus on how you match with the company overall. That is, talk about your years of experience and the objective ways that you can talk about how you were valued at your last company. For instance, you could talk about how you were the youngest person in a managerial position at your last company, as it shows the company that you could handle the position., Three achievement-based examples will show that you are uniquely suited to the task. In addition, this approach will give your answer structure instead of letting your ramble through an answer.Use the preparation you did before the interview to answer the questions.
Try not to get flustered. Take a deep breath and give a brief but thorough answer.

, Don’t give canned answers. Once you know the facts of why you should be hired, try to approach it specifically, rather than generically.For example, skip a generic answer, such as “An experienced manager will be better for employee morale and company growth.""
Instead, try an answer like this one: “You should hire me because I have managed a team for 10 years. During my time managing, I have lowered employee turnover and increased productivity by 10 percent.” This response lists specific reasons why you're a good fit, matched up to what the company is asking for in the job description.

, When answering, don't focus on why you want the job or why you think the position would be good for you. Instead, put the attention on what you can give the company. That's what the interviewer wants to hear.For instance, you may be tempted to say, ""It's always been my dream to work for an art gallery.""
Instead, say something to this effect: ""I know many people want this position, but I have worked hard to be the best person for this job. From my degree in art history to my extensive internships in art galleries, I have the skill set needed to be useful to you."" Follow that statement with some of the skills you have picked up over the years.

, Take this time to use what you've learned in the interview. Connect your skills to what the company wants. Similarly, use the time to highlight aspects of your skills that the interviewer has overlooked.For instance, maybe you heard that the company is really people-focused. Use the time to highlight your people skills with specific examples from your previous jobs.
You could say something such as: ""At my previous job, I handled all the service calls, and the numbers showed that customer satisfaction was up during my time there.""

, If the employer thinks you're overqualified, underqualified, or don't the right experience, take this time to reassure the interviewer that you're the right person for the job.For instance, if it's evident the interviewer finds you overqualified, note that you are trying to make a new move in your career, and you're willing to start from the bottom.If the person thinks you're underqualified, highlight other skills you have that would be relevant to the job.If you haven't proven you have enough experience for this position, highlight other experience in your past that is relevant. In fact, you can make almost any experience relevant. Say you worked as a sales clerk at a store in the past. That may not seem relevant to an office job, but it gave you the skills to work diplomatically with a wide range of people., An elevator pitch is a sales pitch that will sell someone on your cause, even in the most limited of time frames. This question is usually asked at the end of the interview and possibly your last appeal to show you are a good fit. Sell yourself as if you have been designed to solve the company’s problem. Stay on point. You may be tempted to tell everything you've ever done. However, tailoring it to the company will help you stay on task in addition to keeping the interviewer interested. Make sure your pitch isn't longer than two minutes."

, You can have the ideas in mind without coming across as having rehearsed a speech. Know what you will discuss and how.

, That is, if the job uses your computer skills heavily, don't choose your computer skills as the weakness you talk about. Choose subjects that are relevant but less important.

, Start with something positive (and related), state the negative information succinctly without dwelling on it, and then end with another positive.

, This could be a skill that you're good at or something you liked about a company, person, or job.

, Don't dwell on it, blame anybody, or overstate the problem.

, The best positive you could possibly state is how you dealt with the problem or difficulty, what you learned from the experience, or how you worked to improve matters.

, Describe how your efforts resulted in money saved, better communication, or some other solution to the problem, end on that note. This is similar to the ""SAR"" (situation, action, result) or ""PSR"" (problem, solution, result) technique used in behavioral interviewing.

Tell the HR manager about your working style.,
Provide a good ""Why should I hire you answer?"",
Ask good questions when asked if you have any.",How to Answer Human Resource Interview Questions,"


The interviewer will ask you to tell him/her about yourself. He/she doesn't want to hear your life story or an in-depth recap of your prior work history. Tell the interviewer what you have been doing lately and how you feel you are qualified for this position. Report where you received your education and how different jobs have moulded your work goals.
You will most likely be asked about your strengths and weaknesses. Be prepared to explain your strengths as they relate to the specific job for which you are interviewing. While explaining your strengths requires you to talk about things you do or have done well, you do not want to come off as egotistical or arrogant. When you respond to the answer about your weaknesses, do your best to make a strength look like a weakness. For example, you might say you sometimes get too caught up in your work. If you cannot think of a specific weakness to share, saddle the question by admitting that you are not perfect in every way but that you believe your strengths perfectly match the job's requirements.;

The interviewer might ask you what you would do in a certain situation. Try your best to relate it to a past experience and explain how you handled it then. The manager is trying to see how you operate in certain circumstances.

,


Explain your ability to work in all environments. Say you like working alone but that you also enjoy collaboration and teamwork.

Sell yourself.,
Keep your answers short and concise.,
Be specific about your experience.,
Demonstrate your mastery over the job.,
Maintain confident body language.,
Speak in a clear and confident tone of voice.,
Maintain good eye contact.,
Don't be arrogant.,
Show your interest in working long-term.",How to Answer Interview Questions1," ""Tell me about yourself"" is one of the most common things someone will ask you on an interview.While the question can seem overwhelming and open-ended, it's actually an excellent opportunity to sell yourself to your prospective employer. Think about the areas that you excel in and talk about experiences in which you used your skills to overcome a problem or solve an issue efficiently. Prepare a story before hand. Think about the skills that are required for the position you're applying to and frame your answers around what the employer is looking for.


Other questions that allow you to sell yourself include, ""Why should we hire you?"" and ""What are your greatest strengths?""
When applying to a sales job, you can say something like, ""I graduated from business school and got right into sales. I worked for Joe's Sales Inc. for three years before being promoted to sales lead. I consistently exceeded my quota and was the top in my team for most months out of the year. I have a love for communicating and closing deals."";
, If you plan on telling the employer a story about an experience which demonstrates your ability, make sure it has a clear beginning, middle, and end.Do not respond with a long-winded story that has a lot of useless information. Concentrate on things that the employer wants in an employee.


For instance, if an employer asks you to describe a challenging work situation and how you overcame it, you could say something like, ""When I worked at Sue's Grocery we had a very limited budget and broken equipment. I was able to look at the expenses and came up with cost saving strategies that allowed us to reduce our payroll costs. This enabled us to take the extra money and repair the equipment we couldn't afford to fix.""

, If you are applying for a highly technical position or a position that requires a particular type of experience, it's important to get into the details with the interviewer so that they know your experience is applicable and genuine. Communicate your experience in past jobs, where you've made mistakes, and how you've improved since then.When going for a computer related job, make sure that you cite all the software and programming languages that you have experience using.
When applying for a service industry job, knowing how point of sale systems and kitchen equipment works is a huge plus. Cite specifics.
You can say something like, ""I've worked with the POS system called Sales Force at the last restaurant and I worked in. I also have experience taking orders and using a deep fryer. I'm fast, clean, and committed to ensuring that the guest leaves happy.""

, Show your knowledge of the terms regularly used in the industry by using buzzwords in the conversation. When you can speak casually about your skills and experience, it shows that you have the experience and know how to fulfill the tasks that you'll need to undertake.


When going for a marketing job, make sure that you demonstrate your knowledge of both digital and traditional media. Cite all of the platforms that you have a following on and any networking connections that you may have.
You can say something like, ""I've worked with the Daily News, Inquirer, Local News, and the Chronicle with past events. I also have a huge following on Twitter and Instagram. I know how to determine trends before they trend.""
If you're a programmer you could say, ""I've created layouts for websites, worked with PHP and CSS as well as Javascript and Ruby. I am really a big fan of responsive design and functionality when creating a website or app.""

, Body language is an important aspect of an interview. Sit up, with your back straight and your chest out. Crossing your arms or hunching over can make you appear not confident or closed off.When your interviewer is talking, lean in, nod your head, and seem interested and engaged.If you catch yourself slouching over or looking off into different directions, try to reset your behavior by consciously changing the way that you're sitting and interacting.
When you first meet the person you're interviewing, it's customary to give them a handshake and to introduce yourself.
Do not fidget or play with something while the interview is taking place. This can make you seem uninterested or distracted.

, Do not slur your words, use slang, or speak quietly when you answer questions on an interview. To speak confidently, make sure that your voice is at a reasonable volume for the interviewer to hear your responses without having to concentrate. Do not raise your tone at the end of sentences because it can sound like a question and make you seem not as confident.Speaking loudly and clearly shows your authority over what you're talking about.
Try to leave out filler words like ""um"" and ""uh."" Think of your responses before you start to talk.

, A lack of eye contact can make you seem like you're uninterested in what a person has to say. Try to maintain eye contact with the person interviewing you, but don't stare them down.Break away from eye contact at times when you're thinking or responding to a question. Maintain a smile while you're looking at them to prevent yourself from looking confused or vacant.


Try to be as natural as possible, but don't look away while the person is talking. This can be perceived as rude and ruin your chances on the interview.
Another method is to draw a triangle on a person's face and adjust your gaze to each corner every ten seconds. This may make eye contact less awkward for you., Being overly confident can turn off a prospective employer and cost you the opportunity to work. Do not badmouth or complain about previous places of employment, because it could send a signal to your new employer that your attitude will not change.Never act like the job you're applying for is not good enough for you. Always remain optimistic and confident about the opportunity of your new employment.


Instead of bad mouthing a previous employer, say something like, ""I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the company itself. I felt like I was able to grow and learn a lot from those around me. While it wasn't everything that I wanted, it still gave me the mentality to succeed in the industry and I'm grateful for the experience there.""
Do not oversell yourself, or artificially inflate your accomplishments or ability. This could backfire if you actually get the job and are unable to fulfill your duties.
To reaffirm interest in the job, you can say something like, ""I think the company culture here is great, and I'd be grateful for the opportunity to work for you.""

, The cost of onboarding and training new employees can become expensive for a company.Therefore, many businesses are looking to retain talent. A common question an employer will ask is ""Where do you see yourself in five years?"" Make sure that your answer involves where you'd be with the company you're applying to in five years.


An answer to ""Tell me about yourself"" could be something like, ""I hope to grow within my position here and take on more responsibility. I hope to learn a lot within the industry and become better at my job.""
A temporary or contract position could develop into a full time job.

Research the company you are applying to.,
Prepare answers for the interview beforehand.,
Practice answering the questions in front of someone.,
Think of questions to ask the interviewer.,
Pick out your outfit beforehand.,
Look at the job application or listing again.",How to Answer Interview Questions2," A common question that some companies may ask is, ""What do you know about us?""Take a look at the company website, and look at related news on the company. Having an understanding of things like what they do, their company culture, their values, and competitive advantages will enable you to cater your responses to fit what they are looking for.


Being specific about the company will show the interviewer that you did your research and are serious about the job.
Find things about the company that align with your personal interests. For instance, if you're interested in sustainability, see if the company you're applying to has a sustainability initiative and read about it.
You don't need to memorize things like when the company was founded or specific details that don't go towards your position. While having this knowledge may impress an employer, concentrating on memorizing this information will give you less time to prepare for more critical aspects of the interview.

, Preparation will allow you to have a good idea of how to respond to the most commonly asked interview questions. Not preparing could increase your anxiety on the interview and cause your answers to be confusing and not concise. Record your answers by writing them down or typing them out in a word processor.


The most common interview questions include, ""Why do you want the job?"" ""What are your strengths and weaknesses?"" and ""Can you complete the tasks and duties of the job?""Other questions may include, ""Tell me about your past experience,"" ""What is your biggest accomplishment?"" ""Are you a team player?"" ""Why should I hire you?"" and ""Why are you the best person for this position?"", Don't memorize answers verbatim; instead, get the general idea from the answers that you've recorded. Allow your answers to flow naturally by practicing with someone beforehand. Try to work on your tone by staying positive and matter-of-fact. Raising your pitch at the end of a sentence could show a lack of confidence, while a very low or monotone pitch may make you seem uninterested.


Eliminate the amount you say ""uh,"" ""um,"" and ""like.""If you forget an answer to a question, refer back to your answers. Keep in mind that you won't be able to use your notes for an in-person interview.
Ask whoever is helping you practice to provide feedback after the faux interview.

, Typically an employer will ask you if you have any questions for them at the end of the interview. Take this opportunity to ask questions about your job or the operations at the company. Get specific and try to incorporate things that were explained during the interview. Not asking any questions shows a lack of interest and could hurt your chances of getting the job.You could ask a question like, ""So you said that I'd be writing headlines for new articles. Do you know what industry I'd be writing about?""
Avoid asking questions about benefits packages or salaries before an official offer is made or the employer specifically asks you for salary requirements.

, Employers will want to see that you're put together and organized. Your dress and appearance will be the first impression that you give to a prospective employer, and could influence their decision when hiring you. Always dress up and try to wear your best clothes even if the position is not in an office setting.


Avoid loud and flashy colors and any clothing that has text.
When in doubt, always dress more conservatively., Reading the job application or listing will refresh your memory. It's essentially what the employer is looking for and contains the essential skills and experience that you should have. Reading it again will also give you the opportunity to spot details about the job that you may have missed when you applied initially.

Turn off distractions.,
Prepare a cheat sheet.,
Speak clearly and enunciate your words.,
Listen and don't dominate the conversation.,
Take the interview seriously.,
Ensure that your phone and connection are reliable.",How to Answer Interview Questions3," If you're not used to working at home, then your environment may not be well-suited to take an interview over a phone call. Make sure to turn off any music, television, or alarms that may interrupt the interview.If you have children or pets, make sure they are in the other room so you can concentrate on answering the questions.
Do not have an instant messenger or website open while answering questions on the interview.
Get a pen and paper ready in case you need to write anything down. Keyboard clicks can be loud and distracting during an interview.

, A benefit of having a phone interview is that the employer won't be able to see you. This is a significant advantage because you can create a cheat sheet before your interview that will help you stay on track during the interview.Your cheat sheet can include valuable information about the company or the position you're applying to. Also, you can have your pre-written answers in front of you.


Do not respond to questions word for word by reading off your cheat sheet. Try to make your responses as natural sounding as possible.
Hit the major points that you've outlined in your cheat sheet and adapt depending on the interviewer's questions.

, Because the interview is over the phone, your speaking demeanour becomes even more important. The person interviewing you won't have anything else to go on other than the sound of your voice and the way that you answer their questions. Do not mumble and speak loudly enough so the hiring manager can hear you. Make sure to pronounce words and take your time to think about your answers., The person interviewing you may have a speech that's been prepared, so allow them to speak. Many times they will inform you about the company or describe the duties you'll need to fulfill in the position. Asking a few follow-up questions shows your interest and tells the interviewer that you're paying attention.


While a silence may feel awkward, it's better than going on an unrelated tangent and dominating the conversation.
Smile as you answer your questions. They won't be able to see it, but it will affect the way your voice sounds., A common mistake many people make on phone interviews is taking it too casually. Make sure that you're properly sitting at a desk and have gotten dressed for the day. The more ready you are, the more attentive and prepared you'll sound over the phone. Get in the right state of mind for the interview before your new employer calls you.The way you look and feel dictates your energy level during a phone interview.

, A faulty phone or weak cellphone connection are terrible reasons for a phone interview to go poorly. Before you go on the interview, make sure that your phone is in good working order and that you have good reception in the area where you'll be taking the call.

Don't let your interviewer shake you.,
Own up to shortcomings and offer a suggestion of how you work to improve.",How to Answer Tricky Interview Questions2," Before you even enter the room, make sure you are focused and relaxed. If you're already calm, great! Stay that way. Make sure you drink enough water, but don't spill any on yourself. This will keep your brain working at its best, and will also reduce the possibility of your mouth going dry.

, It may seem like an eternity of silence, but it's really only 10 seconds or so. However, be sure to acknowledge the question. Say ""Wow. That's a hard question. I've got to think about that for a second."" It's much better to wait a few seconds and come up with a good answer than to plunge in blindly and say something silly.

, Come in the door smiling and confident, and make sure not to trip on anything. Your interviewer will probably shake your hand; grip firmly, but just barely gentle enough to not hurt anybody. Remember that confidence is important, but so is humility.

, Remember, your potential employer is assessing you personally, and has interviewed many, many people in his or her career. He or she can smell a phony answer right away!

, Not just on the tricky questions, but on all of them: don't open your mouth until you know exactly what you're going to say. The human mouth has an amazing ability to say something incredibly stupid at the worst possible time. Don't let this tendency take advantage of you.

, Say, ""I want to make sure we're both on the same page. Were you asking for ?""

,, Keep in mind that one of the purposes of the tricky questions is to make you uncomfortable. Keep your cool at all costs; you'll need it for the rest of the interview. Besides, don't forget, your performance under pressure is being tested here.

Prepare for your first day at work.,
Arrive early and ready to work.Plan to be there at least 15 minutes early.,
Turn your cell phone off.Until you know the rules, assume that using your cell phone during business hours is grounds for immediate termination (this assumption is not far from reality).,

Stay confident and relax.It's a new job and there's a lot to learn, but don't let it intimidate you.,
Accept lunch invitations if offered.,
Stay in business mode.Whether you are at lunch with a co-worker or at home posting on social media you shouldn't relax too much.,
Work as a team player.",How to Behave at a New Job," Starting on the right foot is essential.People will form lasting impressions of you as early as the first day. You want to do your homework and make ample preparation. Without preparation, you may run into difficulties and find yourself unnecessarily aggravated or irritable. Being short or snapping at another co-worker is a terrible way to start a relationship.


Make sure to either bring or ask for a notebook to begin taking notes early in the day. Bringing one from home shows initiative. Don't be the new employee who doesn't write anything down.;
, Report directly to your boss or human resources contact.


If you don't know where to go, kindly let another employee know this is your first day and ask them for directions. They had a first day too so they will understand.

, The first day is all about first impressions. Any cell phone interruption signals a lack of professionalism.

, While your co-workers function in a variety of roles at work, they are still people with feelings. Being nice and leaving hand written Thank You'sbuilds positive working relationships.


Prepare to avoid joking or discussing race, gender, age, sexual orientation, or religion. These are sensitive issues for most people. Even if you are comfortable discussing these topics, many other people may feel uncomfortable if you discuss them openly.
Resist the temptation to ask or pry into people's personal lives. If your curiosity is tickled, ask yourself if the answer is work-related? If not, its best to not ask.
Drive carefully in the parking lot and don't be rude to others as you are rushing to clock in or out on time. Even if you are not on the clock, the people you are speeding past and bumping into are still your co-workers.

, Smile and take time to introduce yourself in the elevator or to colleagues at the desks across from yours. This small step will help you start developing a relationship with co-workers and let them know you're part of the team.


As you introduce yourself to others, make an effort to remember their names and positions. Write names and positions in your notebook to memorize. If necessary, note memorable physical features or personal characteristics to help you match faces with names. Quickly learning names shows others you value them., When you run into a problem, ask someone promptly. The first day it is better to ask and verify than to do something wrong. Since it is your first day, you have a license to ask too many questions. Remember to write down the response in your notebook for future reference.


If someone is going through a procedure too fast for you to write, ask them to slow down. This may seem rude, but they will appreciate it it. If you write everything down properly, they won't have to repeat themselves later.
When you've finished a set of instructions, repeat the process back to your instructor. This gives them a chance to ensure you have documented the process properly. They may also emphasize certain points you will want to highlight.

, You may know how to do something already, but follow their directions first. Ask before deviating from their process. There may be critical and clear reasons why their methods are different.


ISO-9001 and other standards have strict rules you may not anticipate. Using a pencil, white-out, or a colored ink pen could land you in hot water with your boss. Even benign changes to procedures can negatively impact your performance.
If you are given a computer, do not attempt to view webpages or download files without permission. This includes checking your personal email or downloading backgrounds. This may seem benign but may cause you to get in trouble with the computer services department.

, After the first day you are expected to remember what you've been repeatedly told. Anytime you have an issue, review your notebook first. Asking for directions only if necessary. This helps show you are capable of working independently. The sooner you can show this, the more respect you will earn from your co-workers.

, Continue to show up to work early, dressed appropriate, and ready to work. The first month people develop clear expectations about you. This will influence how they treat you as a co-worker.


If you are late or make a business dress faux pas, take responsibility for your mistake. Traffic may have been bad, but you could have accounted for it. Making excuses for your temporary lack of etiquette show immaturity.

, Anything your boss or human resources department hands you to read over, do so promptly. Ask questions where you do not understand. Make notes of any rules you think will be difficult to remember or that you think you might break accidentally.


For example, at most jobs, discussing pay is considered ""unethical"" and may be grounds for termination. Discussing politics and religion may also get you in trouble even if you do so off-the-clock.

, Many forms must be completed within the first week or month of employment. These include tax and health insurance enrollment forms such as a W-2. You may need to ask your human resources contact how to appropriately fill out these forms.

, People who you will meet face-to-face and department heads are particularly important.


If you are feeling overwhelmed learning people's names and positions, trying drawing a diagram of each department with the department head at the top and everyone under them below. As you learn people's positions, you can write them down and orient them vertically according to their role.

, Remember you earned that job due to your experience and let your workplace attitude display that confidence and experience. If you get frustrated or overwhelmed, take a deep breath and try again. Let your new bosses see that you work well in new situations and under pressure.


No matter how many notes you write you will still mess up. When corrected, say ""thank you"" and look over your notes for errors. Do not blame another co-worker even if you believe their instructions were incomplete. Review your updated instructions with the person correcting you.

, Even if you brought your lunch, your lunch break is more than food. Its about being social with co-workers and bosses. Being invited to lunch signals interest. This gives you an opportunity to develop a deeper, better relationship with this person.

, Whenever work is involved, stay in a professional mindset. Subtle or abrupt changes to your level of professional courtesy may be construed as a lack of respect.

, You're a new employee, but you're part of a team. Ask questions and accept criticism with a smile.


When you've completed your assigned tasks, ask your manager or superior what you can be doing to help the team. Don't be afraid to ask questions if you're asked to participate in a team or group function. Co-workers will be more likely to help you out and answer your questions if you establish yourself as a team player.
Engage your new co-workers in conversation when they welcome you to the team, but stay neutral in your opinions about them. You're just as likely to get welcomed into the office fantasy football pool as you are to get targeted by the office gossip, so remain objective until you know whose welcome is genuine.
Do not be quick to complain about your work even if asked what you do not like about the job so far. Focus on how you can improve your own job performance."

Get plenty of rest before your GED exam, and make sure to have a filling breakfast the day of your test.;
, Trade schools will provide students with the practical knowledge to operate heavy machinery and basic construction skills. You will learn how to read blueprints, install building materials, and inspect construction codes. Usually, trade schools take one or two years to complete.

You can enroll in trade school as a high school student if you have parental permission., Although you will receive much of your training in an apprenticeship, you will want to complete a crane operation training program. Crane operator programs can last anywhere from several weeks to several months and involves learning safety regulations and crane machine maintenance. It will also prepare you for the National Commission for the Certification of Crane Operators (NCCCO) exam.

Most crane operator training programs are not offered online because you will need hands-on learning., After you have finished trade school and a specialized operating program, contact local tower crane operators to ask if you can become their apprentice. Apprenticeship will help you gain on-the-job experience and increase your knowledge of construction work.

An apprenticeship program can take anywhere between 1-6 years, depending on what you negotiate with your supervisor.Construction apprentices are almost always paid a living wage., Most US states require tower crane operators to receive certification. Of those that don't, construction companies prefer to hire tower crane operators who are certified. To receive NCCCO licensure, you need to be at least 18 years old and be in good physical health.The NCCCO requires operators to complete certification within a 12-month timeframe.

, To gain your NCCCO tower crane operator certification you will need to pass the ASME B30 physical requirements. You will need strong optical health as well as keen hearing. You will also receive a psychological evaluation.To fully pass the physical exam, you will also need negative results from a substance abuse test.
If you have a history of epilepsy or loss of physical control, you will be disqualified for certification.

, When you've finished your training program and apprenticeship, you will need to take a written exam on tower crane operation to receive your license. The NCCCO exam consists of 55 multiple-choice questions within an hour.Before you can take the written examination, you need to meet the physical eligibility requirements.

Nothing is worth risking the safety of your fellow workers.

, While you're in trade school and up until your internship, work as a general laborer for a construction company. Gaining construction experience early-on will help you gain a good internship. Most general laborer positions do not require a high school diploma (though most apprenticeships do), so you can begin working while in school., Search for jobs online or in your local classifieds for tower crane operator jobs. Send your resume via email, and make sure to list your training programs and NCCCO certification. Most construction companies prefer operators with several years of experience, so describe any projects you completed as an apprentice.

If you have worked any other construction jobs, like a general laborer or other specialized worker, list these as well. Employers appreciate applicants with a wide range of experience.

, After you have years of experience working as a tower crane operator, you can apply for higher-level jobs. So long as you keep your certification, you can work as a supervisor or director. If desired, you could even take on an apprentice of your own.

Although bachelor degrees are not required for construction workers, you might consider going to university for a BS in Construction Engineering. This will qualify you for advanced positions within a construction company.

, After you have gotten certified, you will need to renew your license every five years. Recertification for tower crane operators is less intensive: you will need to pass a 30-question test within 45 minutes. Tower crane operators who fail to renew their license by its expiration date will need to re-take the full physical, written, and practical evaluations.Recertification candidates are allowed two attempts to pass the written exam.

Note that there are a number of key skills required by office based professionals.,
Have the appropriate attitude.,
Understand and use time management.,
Brush up your software skills and maintain them.,
Improve your memory.,
Keep up to date.,
Seek feedback.,
Practise self analysis.,
Act as if...",How to Become a Valued Employee," They are a fundamental requirement for all those that wish to succeed at work in their career and want to get promoted. It is therefore somewhat surprising that these specific skills are rarely taught directly at school.;
, Attitude in this context is how you approach and undertake the tasks required of you. Try to imagine what kind of employee you would want working for you. I think most people would want someone that was dedicated, hard working and that didn't moan. You must try to become more like this model employee.

, It’s important to know which task to do next, namely, how to prioritize and make the most use of your time. Failure to master this area will mean you spend your time working on urgent, unimportant tasks or helping someone else achieve their objectives.

, You should always seek to improve your software skills in order to do you work more efficiently. There are no end of helpful shortcuts in Word, Excel and Outlook which means your work can be done in half the time. Something worthwhile doing is learning to touch type. Buy a cheap teach-yourself typing programme and spend time learning. You'll get more work done in less time!

, One of the key tools for any successful executive is a keen memory. Imagine being able to rattle off the latest sales figures, to know all your key clients and quote relevant facts and figures at will. Who wouldn't want an employee like that! Well it is possible but (and no surprises here) it takes effort.

, Whatever field you are in, it's essential to keep up to date with the latest developments taking place. This applies at any level. For instance, if you work in Human Resources, it's important to keep up to date with the latest Employment Law changes. Usually the best way to do this is to read; regularly review relevant publications, on- line material and any other appropriate literature you can get your hands on.

, Feedback on your performance is like gold dust because it tells you if your on the right track and whether your efforts are focused in the most appropriate way. I've lost count of the number of times people faced with constructive criticism become defensive. Why?

, Constantly analyse your own performance. Ask yourself at the end of each day how you can improve.

, When looking to get promoted or to progress in your position it's important that you act and behave as if you have already achieved the promotion. By developing and mastering these core, foundation skills, your own work performance and productivity will increase. You’re far more likely to be recommended for promotion. Fortunately there’s wealth of supporting information out there. All these skills take time to master but nothing worth having in life is easy. Good luck on your journey!

Consider working with an accountant.

, You should purchase your domain name and make sure your site is easy to navigate.Include pages about what services you offer, information about yourself, contact information, and positive references.


You should also set up a professional email account that you can list on your website. This is a good way to separate your work and personal correspondence and shows professionalism.

, This can be done inexpensively through online printing. You should also make a brochure to provide to potential clients. Pack it full of tips, sample vows and a bio about yourself that is warm and welcoming.Don't print your business materials on cheap paper or use low-quality printers. Clients will be looking for quality, and professional materials will lend credibility.

, Money well spent on advertising will bring dividends your way. Place ads in newspapers, on community boards at the library, and other public places. Work with a wedding planner or event coordinator who can then refer couples to you.Attend wedding and event shows that feature informative booths. Be prepared with business information for prospective clients.

, Offer to officiate for friends and family in order to get some experience. Keep information and reviews to put in a portfolio which you can show clients.Start your fee structure a little below the going rate in your area. Once you have performed a few weddings, you will have letters of recommendation to include in your brochure or portfolio and you can gradually raise your fees.


Consider offering discounts to veterans and the disabled. You will feel good about your decision, and others will benefit and thank you for it.

Make S.M.A.R.T.",How to Become a Successful Professional," No matter what line of business you're in, sales are probably an important part of your field. Even if you don't actually work in sales, as a professional you will need to be able to sell ideas, project roles, and cooperation.Listen sincerely to others. Understand their needs, desires, fears, and frustrations.Don't bring your own agenda to your business interactions. If you want to be a professional and develop successful sales skills, you'll need to devote all of your attention to the person you're talking to.Instead of talking someone into something they don't necessarily want, try to allow that person to reach the decision on their own. Whether you're selling products or ideas, present your ""product"" with clarity, concision, honesty, and integrity, and highlight the benefits or advantages of that product.Understand what your customers or coworkers expect from what you're offering. Those expectations are more important than what you think they should need or expect.;
, Communication skills will help you in any professional arena, and may even benefit your personal life as well. How you communicate can affect the first impression others have of you, and may make or break your professional opportunities.


Resist saying the first thing on your mind. Instead, try waiting five seconds or so, and if you still think your input is relevant and contributes to the conversation, then voice your idea.If you're naturally shy or soft-spoken, challenge yourself to be more vocal and active in conversations.Be aware of yourself - not just your appearance (which is important), but also your words, your tone, and your body language.Understand your conversational objective(s) before you join a conversation.Be empathetic towards others. If someone (a customer, a coworker, a manager, etc.) is having a hard time, be understanding of their struggles. Put yourself in that person's place and try to think about what you might want to hear in that moment., Interpersonal skills are essential if you want to be part of any professional team. The ability to get along with others and work collaboratively is an important part of any business, no matter what professional field you work in.Be mindful of whom you're speaking with, and how you might be coming across, in every interaction with others.Accept that you may not agree with others all the time, and they may not always agree with you. That's okay - you can find ways to compromise, or agree to disagree. Just don't try to argue or fight with others, as this may result in hurt feelings and fractured professional relationships.Ask a trusted colleague to give you feedback on your interpersonal skills. Let him or her know that you're trying to develop your skills and would like to know how you come across to others., If you're hoping to become a successful professional, you probably have aspirations of earning a leadership role. The best way to prepare for that role - and prove to your superiors that you're a natural leader - is to develop your leadership skills before you get promoted to a managerial role.


Put the needs of others and the needs of the company ahead of your own needs.Empower others. Commend other people for their work and celebrate their success every day.Remember that every action contributes toward your identity as a leader. Instead of seeing every action or interaction as an isolated incident, think of them as a series of steps on the road towards success and leadership.Practice informed decision-making skills. Ensure that every decision you make will better you as well as the company, and/or create new opportunities for yourself and/or the company., An easy way to stand out to your colleagues and superiors is by offering help without being asked for it. If you're practicing empathy and working on your leadership skills, you should be able to notice when others are having a hard time on a project. Most people you work with will help when they're asked, but offering your assistance before anyone else has to ask will set you apart from your peers.Don't just offer general or vague help. Take note of what others are working on or struggling with and offer specific ways to assist on that project., Depending on the field you work in, it may be easy to feel that your job is more important than other peoples' jobs. However, that simply isn't true. No position at your place of employment could function without the tireless efforts of countless other workers, many of whom may remain largely unseen from your office. If you want to build strong professional relationships, you must respect and appreciate everyone you work with and everyone who works for you.If someone makes a mistake, don't jump right to confrontation. Let your colleague or employee know that you appreciate his/her efforts and understand that they tried. Praise that person for what was done correctly and offer guidance (rather than criticism) on how that task could be better completed in the future.Be sincere in your praise of others. Let others know that you appreciate the work they do and the effort they contribute towards all of the projects that come through your office., In many corporate jobs, it's easy for employees to feel like cogs rather than individuals. If you want to build and foster strong professional relationships, take a real interest in your coworkers' and employees' lives. Remember that each employee is a human who has meaningful experiences and has personal thoughts and feelings.Remain professional when you show an interest in others at work. Don't ask inappropriate questions and don't poke fun at anyone. Instead, ask whether your coworkers or employees had a good weekend/holiday/vacation, and if the individual you're talking to elaborates on what he did, use that as an opportunity to get to know him better.Practice listening instead of talking. Get to know what others in your workplace like or dislike, and try to understand them on a human level without judging them., Networking is an important way to build and expand on professional relationships. But a poorly-executed networking attempt smacks of desperation and desire. Instead of going into a situation hoping blindly for some kind of connection to form, go in prepared to network and equipped with the proper skills.Attend networking events in your field, and consider any professional get-together through your work as a potential opportunity to network with others.
Don't dismiss anyone. You may want to hone in on the person you perceive to be most ""valuable"" to you or your career, but there's a good chance that person doesn't want or need to network. Anyone you meet in any professional capacity could be important, and you could be important to that person.Have a plan, but not an agenda. It's important to know what you want to talk about and what kind of professional relationship you'd like to develop, but don't go into an interaction thinking you'll be able to walk away with an offer from a stranger.Be open, honest, and friendly at all times. This will help you come across as the kind of person others want to work with and invite into their own professional networks.Follow up with contacts you made, and be sure to follow through on any offers you may have made to others. It will show others that you're a person of your word and that you may be a mutually beneficial person to network with in the future., Taking responsibility for your actions cuts both ways: don't be modest about your accomplishments (though don't showboat, either), but you also need to take responsibility for your mistakes. Don't try to pass the blame, and don't be overly defensive about your mistakes. Simply accept that a mistake was made, acknowledge what you should have done differently, and use the incident as a learning experience.Trying to blame others for your mistakes may make you feel slightly better about yourself in the moment, but your coworkers or employees will resent you for passing the blame, and your supervisors/managers may lose respect for you if they're privy to what you're doing.
While it's important to take responsibility for your errors, it's also important that you don't beat yourself up over them. Try to find the lesson of what you can do different next time, and move on., In the professional world, no one will likely be there to help you budget your time or offer motivation on a project you've been dreading. You need to summon the strength and responsibility to be your own motivator. That means taking calculated and informed risks, coming up with new ideas, and keeping on schedule at all times.Don't wait for work to be assigned to you. If you're finished with a project, let your boss know and ask for more work. It will show initiative and strong work ethic.Manage your time. Plan backwards from the anticipated deadline and know in advance what portions of your project need to be completed by what date(s). That way you'll be able to stay on schedule (or even finish early), and you'll make a strong impression on both your colleagues and your managers.

, Whether you're asking for help, asking for clarification, or asking for a promotion, you've got to be willing and able to ask. Opportunities rarely come without any effort, and the same is true of professional opportunities. If you're unclear on a manager's instructions for a project, ask for clarification. If you need help with a project, ask someone whose work you trust if they can take a look at the plans with you. If you want a promotion or a raise, you've got to work up the nerve to ask for it.There's seldom any harm in asking. If you work with reasonable people, you'll probably get a reasonable response.
Asking for things, including asking for more responsibility or additional projects, will not only boost your reputation - it can also make you feel more fulfilled by your work., goals. Goals are important to better yourself, both in your personal life and your professional life. They give you something to work toward and they help fill your work and your life with greater purpose.But it's important that you make goals that are both beneficial and attainable. That's where it may be helpful to create and strive for S.M.A.R.T. goals, an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Results-focused, and Time-bound.Specific goals - be simple and clear with what it is you hope to accomplish. For example, instead of vaguely wanting to do better at work, have a clear goal in mind, like getting a raise or a promotion.Measurable goals - as you create your goals, be sure that they can be measured. That way you will have a clear idea of whether or not you've accomplished your goal. For example, if your goal is work-related, you may want to measure your goal by whether or not your salary or responsibilities have increased.Achievable goals - make sure your goals are realistic and relevant to your career. A good achievable goal should push you just enough to test your abilities, but ultimately be defined clearly enough that you can accomplish your end goal. For example, instead of hoping to become the CEO of your company, work for a promotion into a position that you are actually qualified for. You can always aim to move upward from there, but start with a position that is realistic and achievable at this point in time.Results-focused goals - create goals that measure the outcomes of your effort, not your activities. For example, create a goal with a clear objective that will produce some type of unambiguous result (like a better position at work or a higher salary, to continue with the previous examples).Time-bound goals - set up a timeframe that is close enough to create a sense of urgency that will spur you to action, but distant enough that you can actually accomplish your goal. For example, don't try to get promoted by the end of the week. A better timeframe might be to work hard over the next six to eight months, prove your worth to your boss and coworkers, and then approach your boss to ask about a raise or a promotion in six months to a year."

Make sure you're there early enough to get fully prepared and changed, if necessary, to start your shift. Be there ready to go 10-15 minutes before your shift starts.


If you have to take public transportation, or your new workplace is somewhere you're unfamiliar with, take the trip a few days ahead of time to make sure you know exactly how long it will take, and where it is.
Don't stay beyond the time you're scheduled. Leaving late may indicate that you aren't able to budget your time effectively. Impress your employer by arriving early enough to prepare for the day, then leave when you're finished.;
, You won't be expected to excel right away at most jobs, and most employers know that there will be a learning curve with new hires. So, don't worry so much about making mistakes and messing up your first day, but focus on learning as much as possible and listening closely to make sure you don't miss things.


Make it your goal to only make a mistake once. If your boss tells you how to do something, listen and remember so you won't have to ask again.

, Lots of new employees will be too sheepish to ask questions, and will blunder into doing things incorrectly. Know enough to know when you need help. There's no shame in asking for help, especially on your first day. It'll be better to have it explained once and be sure you'll do it right than to try to guess and get exposed later., The process of every workplace is very different. Even if you're skilled and talented, it takes some time to figure out what needs to happen, and in what order. The best way to stand out on your first day as a good worker is to try to analyze the situation and figure out what needs to happen next.


At some jobs, your first day can involve a lot of standing around and watching. Jump in when you see an opening. If you see another employee carrying a big stack of bags from one place to another, you don't need to be told that you could help out.
At some jobs, you'll need to ask instead of just acting. If you're starting at a kitchen and finish up with some dishes, it might seem obvious that they'll go to the dishwasher, but there may be some other process. Ask.

, One thing that's consistent at every workplace is cleanliness and safety. Straightening up doesn't usually need to be coached. Look out for things you can organize, or ways that you can clean up to make the workplace much easier.


If you work in an office, change out the coffee filter and make a fresh pot. Clean up the cups and spoons and throw away the refuse. Take the trash to the bin. Help straighten up other public areas if they need straightening.
If you work in a kitchen or a restaurant, keep an eye out for obstacles that someone may trip over, or help clean up dishes in the back. Take a turn at the sink if you need to. try to find a way to stay busy.

, It's not what you know, how talented you are, or even what you do on the first day that will make it a success. It's your attitude and behavior. Your employer hired you because there was something about your combination of skills and personality that will benefit your workplace. Have faith in your ability to succeed as yourself, and don't think you need to be someone you're not.


You don't have to act like your coworkers act, for good or for worse. It takes time for people to adjust to a new person in the workplace, so give your co-workers time to adjust to your personality rather than changing your behavior to match theirs.

, Being a good employee involves going above and beyond the call of duty. Try to be the best employee that you can be by setting personal goals in the short term to help yourself stand out. After a few days of work, try to identify the things you need to work on the most and make it your goal to get where you want to be.If you're working in a kitchen, make it your goal to have all the sandwich recipes memorized by the end of the month, so you don't have to consult your cheat sheet. Or make it your goal to get your plate time down to that of the other employees.
Focus more on the quality of your work and less on your efficiency in your first couple of weeks. Make every sandwich well before you worry about making it quickly. Worry about getting faster and producing more as you go on.

, Good employees are volunteers, willing to take on extra responsibilities and tasks when asked. If you want to cultivate a reputation as a reliable employee, then be willing to do things that need to be done.


It's also important to know your limits. If you've already got 10 things to do before you leave today, don't volunteer to do one more thing that's going to take several hours. Budget your time effectively.
Be cautious when you need to be too. If a fellow employee asks you to do something you're not sure about, it may be more helpful to think up an alternative plan. Be tactful and defer to your boss for help, if necessary.

, Good employees put their heads down and mind their own business. When you're at work, stay focused on doing what you need to do to the best of your abilities. Don't spend time getting into other people's work and other people's business. Stand out by getting everything done that you need to do.


Try to avoid workplace gossip. It's easy to group into little work cliques that can distract you from your responsibilities. Just focus on doing your work, not how well other people do their work.

, If you see debris littering the floor of your workplace, don't walk around it, then inform your boss that someone needs to do a little picking up. Just pick it up yourself. Do things for the sake of creating a better work environment, not looking like you're a better employee.

, Do your work well and complete it, then look for ways you can do a little extra to help the company you work for reaching its goals. Good employees come to the table with creative ideas for improvements and efficiency tactics to help make your workplace a better place.


Try to come up with a few creative ideas each couple of months, then keep them on hand in case they come in handy. Grab five minutes to chat about your idea in private with your boss, instead of bringing it up at a big group meeting.

, Where do you want to be in five years? Ten? How can this job help you get there? Set clear and achievable goals for yourself at your job, and work toward them each week. Knowing how your work relates to your ultimate goals in life will give you self-assurance and provide motivation for you to advance your company and yourself.


try to keep a list of what you're working toward, to help get you through the weeks. What you're doing right now might not seem that important, but how is this helping you get what you want? How is this moving you up the ladder?
The ultimate goals of the company you work for are also important, and should be kept at the front of your mind.

, Employers appreciate employees who support other good workers. When you work hard and consistently help further your company's goals, you become a trusted voice. Use your voice to help others who are worthy of praise and advancement.


If other employees mock or criticize a fellow employee, don't participate. It can be easy to form snarky cliques at work, but it can create a toxic work culture. Don't be a part of it.
If you play dirty in order to gain position in the company, you may gain ground in the short term, but lose it in the long term as you built up bad relationships with other employees. Allow your employer to evaluate your work and skills, and determine where you fit best in the company., Employers value employees who take pride in what they're doing. If you're doing something you're really passionate about, that's easy. But if you're working a job for the wage, it can be a little more difficult to find that passion. Find some way to get more invested in what you're doing, to let your passion shine through.


Stay focused now what this job affords you, and remind yourself that succeeding in this job makes all those things easier. If you're working to feed your family, or to pay your way through college, remind yourself that what you do at work has a direct impact on those parts of your life.

, While some people can be very difficult to interact with in the workplace, when you treat them poorly you should remember that you are negatively affecting your career opportunities with the company. Your co-workers were as carefully selected as you were, so showing contempt for and disrespect for any co-worker you encounter shows a disregard for the intellect of your employer.

Work your way up.",How to Become a Millwright," Millwrights tackle a variety of tasks related to industrial machinery. As a millwright, you should expect to install, maintain, and dismantle heavy machinery and equipment across a wide range of industries.


Millwrights log plenty of hours at manufacturing plants and construction sites, but they also assist in mining operations, power plants, and commercial sites. You could end up installing an escalator at the mall or a large conveyor belt in a nearby factory.
Most of the work involves physical labor, but you'll also need to know how to read blueprints and troubleshoot problems that arise during installation or maintenance.;
, For legal reasons, you'll need to meet a few basic requirements concerning age, working status, and related matters.You must be at least 18 years old or 17 years old with written parental consent before joining an apprenticeship program. There is no maximum age limit, however.
If you aren't currently a citizen or legal resident of the country you plan to work in, you'll need to go through the appropriate paperwork to achieve legal employable status.
When working in the United States, you need to be able to read and understand English. This is vital so that you can understand your training courses and on-site instruction. Fluent communication also makes the working conditions safer for both you and your future coworkers.

, Since so much of the work involves manual labor, you need to be healthy and in physically adequate shape. If you aren't strong enough to lift and move moderately heavy equipment, you won't be strong enough to complete many of the tasks you'll be assigned.


You should be able to lift at least 75 lbs (34 kg) on a regular basis, if not more. This will allow you to perform the lift, pull, and hold heavy tools and equipment necessary for the job.
Aside from lifting strength, you should also have the endurance to stand, stoop, and move around for long periods of time without rest. For these reasons, this may not be the right job for someone with joint troubles, breathing difficulties, or other chronic physical ailments.

, All millwrights must have, at minimum, their high school diploma or GED. You should earn your diploma or GED before you attempt to join an apprenticeship program.


If you're still in high school, it's a good idea to take courses that will help prepare you for more advanced training later on. Such courses may include advanced mathematics, drafting, mechanical drawing, metal/industrial shop, and other construction classes.

, While not strictly necessary, you should consider completing an appropriate program at a community college, vocational school, or technical school. Doing so may make it easier to find work.


Many millwrights opt for either formal education or training through an apprenticeship program, but you can improve your chances of finding work by completing both. The best way to progress is to complete a few courses at a technical school before looking for work as an apprentice. You can then complete the rest of your schooling and your apprenticeship simultaneously.
While completing a technical program, you should expect to cover topics like blueprint reading, hydraulics, mill maintenance, occupational job searching, industrial math, and welding., In addition to the skills directly required for the job, you should also learn knowledge and improve indirectly related skills you'll inevitably use while working as a millwright.Improve your ability to work through problems. This requires keen attention to detail, analytical thinking, and innovation.
Prepare to work both independently and in cooperation with teammates and clients. When working independently, you need to be dependable, eager to take initiative, and capable of exercising self-control. When working with others, you'll need to be patient and capable of showing concern for those involved in the project.

, Millwrights are members of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. It'll be much easier to find an apprenticeship and an actual job if you join this union when you first start searching.


When you join the union, you'll also get benefits like medical care, dental care, vision care, vacation hours, annuity, and a pension.
To join the union, contact the nearest UBC training center or regional council and proceed by following their instructions.Find the nearest UBC training center here: http://trainingcenters.carpenters.org/training.xml

Find the nearest UBC regional council here: http://regionalcouncils.carpenters.org/council.xml




, Most prospective millwrights break into the field by joining an apprenticeship program. These programs take four to five years to complete and combine classroom instruction with paid on-the-job training.


The easiest way to find an apprenticeship will be to contact your local labor-management committee. Call or visit your local millwright union for guidance and assistance.
During your apprenticeship, you'll work under the guidance of ""journeymen,"" skill workers who will teach you the things you need to know while on the job.
Most programs require you to complete 48 months and 4,800 work hours. You may also need to complete 576 hours of related instruction.

, Certain types of millwright work are in higher demand than others, so training in those areas will improve your chances of finding a full-time job after your apprenticeship ends.Job availability for the field is expected to grow at a slow rate of only one to six percent through 2016, which is slower than anticipated for most professions.
The installation of new machinery and removal of old machinery are the two tasks most needed in the current job market. As such, you should make sure that your apprenticeship gives you experience with machining, welding, and general mechanics.

, As with most jobs, you'll start at a fairly low rate when you first enter the field, but your wages will increase as you grow in experience and skill.


You will earn money as an apprentice, but typically, you'll only make roughly half the wage of the journeymen you work with. Your wage will increase every six months or so, and by the end of your apprenticeship program, you should reach the low end of the full journeyman's payment scale.The annual salary of most millwrights ranges between $46,658 and $62,166, but the top 10 percent of millwrights earn more than $72,375.

, After you complete your apprenticeship program, you will be eligible to find work as a fully trained millwright. Start by inquiring with the journeymen and company you've done your apprenticeship with. If they are unable to offer you full-time work, you can seek help from the union or state apprenticeship bureau. You may also need to search through the classifieds and other job ads.


Expect to work eight-hour days. You'll usually work indoors, but you may also need to work outdoors depending on the job.
Typically, you'll also need to travel long distances for work, especially if you don't live in a densely populated area. The union requires employers and clients to offer over-time pay and travel allowance for such circumstances, however.

, As you gain more skill and work experience, you may be promoted to supervisory and team leadership positions. These positions usually come with better pay and may include additional benefits.


To further improve your chances of promotion, you should complete additional coursework and continue to earn related certificates from technical schools, training programs, and other institutions.

Be pleasant and respectful to your coworkers.,
Treat your boss like a possible mentor.",How to Be Professional at Work," You should come into work every day clean and well groomed to ensure you have a professional appearance. You will also need to dress professionally based on the expected attire of your workplace. Avoid clothing that is too tight or too revealing and if you think something may not be appropriate for your workplace, don’t wear it.Gauge the dress expectations of your workplace by noticing what other employers are wearing. If everyone is wearing conservative attire, with suits, collared shirts, and long skirts, adjust your attire accordingly. Many workplaces have a business casual dress code, which may allow slacks or jeans as long as you still appear professional.
If possible, cover any tattoos and remove any piercings, unless your superiors are fine with you exposing them.;
, Note how your coworkers operate in your office to get a sense of how things are done. You may note how people dress, and how they lower their voices when someone is on the phone nearby, or that they go into the staff room to have more casual discussions. You may also notice how your coworkers interact with clients during meetings, and how everyone always shows up on time, or a few minutes early for a meeting. Pay attention to the behavior of others to get a sense of what is considered professional in your workplace., The majority of workplaces will expect you to be on time for all meetings, planned discussions, and to be at work by a certain time in the day. If you are not sure about the expectations around the start time for the work day, ask your superior. Most offices expect their employees to be in the office early in the morning to field any calls from clients and to ensure the office is functioning during regular business hours.If possible, try to get to meetings five minutes early to get settled and organized before the meeting begins. Avoid showing up more than ten minutes early for a meeting, as any earlier can throw off other people’s schedules and actually be inconvenient for others.

, Often, a professional attitude is a positive and motivated one. To be successful, you will need to demonstrate to others that you have the skills and knowledge to perform your duties and responsibilities. But in addition to expertise and know how, your employer will value a professional attitude that demonstrates character and integrity.Focus on being honest, reliable, a hard worker, and positive, day in and day out. Your job should be important to you, and you should value your successes, no matter how small or minor.

, Avoid forgetting any tasks or appointments by always writing it down in a work designated notepad. You can use a digital notepad or a pen and paper. Show your professionalism by taking notes during meetings to stay organized and on track., To communicate professionally, you need to show you can write and speak with confidence and clarity. Be an active listener during meetings and discussions and wait until someone is finished speaking to share your thoughts. Speak slowly and concisely so everyone can understand your points and make note of them.If you notice problems or issues around a certain project or client, speak up to your coworkers and your superiors. Don’t ignore or avoid these conflicts. Instead, face them head on by alerting others to the issues and working together to try to problem solve.

, Most workplaces encourage managing your time effectively by using email or a phone call to discuss minor decisions or issues. Avoid calling a meeting for topics that could be addressed in five minutes with a quick email exchange or phone call. Wasting other people’s time with unnecessary meetings can be seen as unprofessional.There may be an instance where you need to call a face to face meeting to discuss a major issue. If this is the case, send a meeting invitation by email to your coworkers and/or clients. Check your coworkers’ calendars to ensure they are available during the proposed time.

, Another key way to demonstrate professionalism is to be willing to learn from feedback. Remember that good feedback should be about your work and your results. It should never be personal. Getting angry or defensive about feedback can make you appear unprofessional. Instead, focus on learning from feedback and using it to improve the way you do things at work., It can be hard not to get sucked into the office gossip mill, especially if you are new to the workplace and are starting to get to know your coworkers. But staying out of office politics and gossip will ensure you maintain a professional reputation and do not get too involved personally with rumors or hearsay.Not talking about your coworkers behind their backs or based on gossip will also show you respect your coworkers and are willing to be honest and straightforward with them.

, This includes coworkers you may not get along with or see eye to eye with. If you have a coworker who you cannot work with, avoid working directly with them, if possible. You may consider talking to your boss or superior if you have constant issues with the coworker’s work attitude and performance. Avoid gossiping behind the coworker’s back or being openly rude to the coworker as this can seem unprofessional., If your boss sees potential in you as an employee, she may try to act as a mentor to you. So its important to maintain a relationship with your boss that is professional and humble. Avoid acting like you know more about the job than your boss does or that you are not willing to learn new skills or to take her advice. Having a mentor as your boss can lead to bigger career opportunities and the ability to expand your existing skill set."

Consider taking an entry level position.",How to Become a City Planner," If you have not already done so, you will need to earn your undergraduate degree in a relevant area. Some universities offer undergraduate degrees in planning; however, most students who go on to earn graduate degrees in planning have backgrounds in areas such as sociology, architecture, geography, or urban studies.If you already have an undergraduate degree in a relevant area, you will very likely need to continue on to earn a graduate degree.


Research the specific job you want to pursue. Learn about the expectations regarding education and experience for the specific jobs you are interested in. This can help you determine what education requirements you still have to complete. While about 80% of city planners hold a master’s degree,the specific job you are interested in may have opportunities for candidates with undergraduate degrees to enter the workforce as well.
Understand that while it may be possible to become a successful city planner without a graduate degree, the competition will be higher, and opportunities for advancement may be smaller.;
, While there are many programs available, not all of them are accredited by the Planning Accreditation Board (PAB). The PAB reports that, as of January 2015, there are a total of 72 master's programs and 16 bachelor's programs with accreditation. Throughout North America, there are 76 universities with PAB accreditation.A list of these universities is available on the PAB’s website.


If you find a program that is interesting to you, but is not accredited, first find out why they are not accredited. You may still able to become certified and get a job with a degree from a non-accredited university, but it may require more time and effort on your part.
Consider what area you might like to specialize in. Many schools allow you to choose a specialization in an area such as land use, environmental planning, economic development, transportation or housing. When considering a program, think about whether or not they can offer you specializations you might be interested in.Consider the costs of attendance of each program. Some programs will be significantly more expensive if they are not in your state, or if they are offered by a private university. Calculate the costs you will incur in each program you are considering, and keep this under consideration when choosing the program that is best for you.Search for programs that assist students in finding internships and jobs, both during the program and after graduation.Consider the make up of the faculty. Will you be able to form relationships with the program faculty? Is the faculty made up of practicing planners, who can provide you with real world information and contacts?, Most US states do not require licensure or registration. However, as of 2013, New Jersey and Michigan require planners to become licensed or registered. In both cases, this requires passing an examination., Having good connections with other people involved in the planning community can lead to new opportunities and ideas you might otherwise miss out on. You never know who might be able to help get you your dream job.


Attend annual planning conferences, such as the APA National Planning Conference. Doing so can also help keep you up to date on current trends and new ideas.Keep in touch with professors from your studies. If you are able to form good relationships with your professors during your studies, do your best to maintain that relationship and ask them to help you get in touch with other practicing professional planners.

, If you did not complete an internship as part of your degree, now is the time. An internship offers the opportunity to gain real world experience, can help with establishing connections, and may sometimes even lead to a job.


Even if you did complete an internship during your studies, it may be valuable to look for other internship opportunities, especially if you struggle to find a job right away.

, If an opportunity arises to assist people working in your local government office, take it! You may end up doing the work nobody else wants to do, without getting paid, but you will open yourself up to gaining valuable experience, seeing what the reality of your job will be, and getting to know people who might be the key to getting you the job you want later on.

, This certification attests to your skills and professional experience. While not formally required, employers often look for this certification when considering someone for a planning position or promotion.,


The exam consists of 170, multiple choice questions and covers: history, theory, and law; plan making and implementation; functional areas of practice; spatial areas of practice; public participation and social justice; as well as the AICP code of ethics and professional conduct.The AICP exam is offered twice a year:

For the exam offered in May, you must submit your application in December of the previous year.
For the exam offered in November, you must submit your application in June.,


Become a member of the American Planning Association (APA).
Have experience in professional planning.
Have an eligible combination of education and experience, as explained on the AICP website.

, This can all be accomplished directly on the AICP website., In order to be approved for the exam, you have to submit proof that you have met the education and experience requirements. This usually means submitting a letter of reference from previous internships and employers., This normally takes between 8 and 10 weeks; however, be aware that it can sometimes take longer., While you are waiting for your application to be approved, begin preparing for your exam. Be sure that you understand what content will be on the test. You can review your old notes and textbooks from your studies, and the AICP has multiple resources to help you prepare.

, Specific requirements can be found on the AICP website

, Be sure that you are well rested on the day of the exam. Eat a nutritious breakfast, and be sure to use the bathroom before sitting down for the exam. Prepare a folder with all of the documentation you will need to take with you to the exam.

, Once you have earned your certification, be sure to keep it current by earning continuing credits through the American Planning Association. Doing so will help keep you connected and up to date on current trends and policies., It may possible to find a job in your local community, if you wish. However, if you are having trouble finding positions in your area, consider jobs in areas that are: affluent, rapidly growing suburbs or urban areas that are being revitalized.


Consider what type of job you want to do. Most planning jobs are located within local, state, or federal governments. However, planners might also be hired by non-profit organizations, and in the private sector, for example, as consultants.Search the internet for job postings that may interest you.

, The American Planning Association offers a job search board on there website with many different opportunities.

, They might know of job openings not posted online, or have ideas about where you should look.

, While the outlook for planning jobs is expected to grow up to 14% over the coming years,the competition for good jobs can be fierce. If you are struggling to land your dream job, consider jobs that may be less prestigious, but can help you work towards your dream job.

Understand the salute is done on the behalf of the Queen.,
Salute with your right hand and an open palm.,
Acknowledge your superiors with a salute.",How to Salute (UK Armed Forces)1," When an officer salutes another officer in the UK Armed Forces, he is in effect saluting Her Majesty the Queen. So, if a subordinate airman salutes an officer, the officer will return the salute on behalf of the Queen., Officers in the Royal Air Force and the Army both salute the same way. When RAF and Army personnel do a hand salute, they display an open hand. They position their right hand so their fingertips almost touch the band of their hat.The RAF and the Army do not wear white gloves as part of their uniform, so they will salute with their palm facing forward.

, Taking the word “salute” literally, it is a way of offering a salutation or a greeting. In the military, you must show respect by saluting your superiors, and your superiors must reciprocate by saluting you.If you are not sure who is your superior officer based on your rank, you can use this chart here to determine who you should be saluting in the RAF and the Army. In the RAF, a Corporal will always salute an Air Marshal, for example, and in the Army a Private will always salute a Major.

Keep a positive attitude.,
Keep your personal problems at home.,
Learn to listen better.,
Be yourself.,
Show your confidence.,
Admit your mistakes.,
Discover passion for your job.",How to Be Popular at Your Office Job1," Keep a positive while you’re at work. Remember to smile. Positive attitudes are contagious and will rub off on your coworkers. Positive attitudes can also help to increase your own motivation, and the motivation of those around you. Other people tend to feel inspired by those with positive attitudes.Being positive doesn’t mean you have to be that super happy and peppy person that people find extremely annoying. This type of attitude will end up having the opposite of a positive attitude on those around you.;
, Personal problem belong at home. Try not to bring them to work if you can help it. (And try not to bring your work problems home.) Your coworkers, while they may care about you, don’t deserve to suffer the bad mood you may have from those personal problems. If you find you’re unable to leave your personal problems at home, it may be a wise decision to stay at home with those problems until they’re resolved.

, If you want to be popular at work, you can start by listening to your coworkers, especially without any distractions. This undivided attention will make your coworker feel more confident about what they’re talking to you about. And paying attention to your coworker without distractions conveys the message that you are taking your coworker seriously.When talking to your coworkers, put down the smartphone and give your undivided attention to your coworker.
Being a good listener will become a part of your new popular reputation. Coworkers will remember you as someone who listens and will seek you out more often for your advice.
Use active listening techniques when talking with coworkers. Those techniques include: make sure you understand what your coworker is trying to say, ask clarifying questions if needed; wait to express any judgement associated with what your coworker is saying until you fully understand their perspective; don’t interrupt if your coworker goes silent, allow them time to think., Your popularity at work should be based on the fact that your coworkers like YOU, not someone you’re pretending to be. Don’t hide behind a façade at work, be yourself., People are naturally drawn to confident people. Confident people can help others feel confident too, and take away worries and uncertainties. When at work, be confident in yourself and in your abilities. This will not go unnoticed and your coworkers will think of you as a competent, 'go-to’ person who makes them feel comfortable. Some ways to show your confidence are:Use your positive attitude to be a role model for others. Demonstrate your positivity by being able to do your job without listening to office gossip.
Don’t react negatively to the things your boss or your coworker’s do.
If you’ve already decided on a particular option, don’t hesitate when asked about it.
Know your strengths and use them to your advantage.
Avoid projecting any kind of territoriality.
Use body language to express your confidence — stand up straight, smile, keep your hands out of your pockets, don’t fidget, make eye contact, avoid crossing your arms in front of you, don’t talk fast., One of the hardest things to do is admit you’ve made a mistake about something. But people who do own up to their mistakes are remembered as being honest and trustworthy. If you make a mistake, admit it. Apologize if necessary. Don’t dwell on your mistake other than to treat it as a lesson of what not to do next time.Admitting your mistakes also means forgiving your coworkers for the mistakes they make.

, Passionate people tend to be happier and positive, because they have a passion that drives them. The passion you have for your job can rub off on your coworkers when they see how happy and positive you are. Plus your passion is a great motivator for you and your coworkers.


If you don’t already know what you’re passionate about, stop and think about it for a while. Even if you aren’t passionate about your job as a whole, there must be a specific task or responsibility you have that you are passionate about.

Understand the origins of the Navy salute.,
Salute with your right hand and your palm facing down, towards your shoulder.,
Acknowledge your superiors with a salute.",How to Salute (UK Armed Forces)2," In the 1800s, naval officers would salute by raising their cap or by touching the brim of their cap with their index finger and thumb. This became the standard Navy salute, done with the right hand. The salute was done with the hand at a diagonal to prevent exposing the palm, as naval officers did not want to show their tar-stained hands to their superiors.In the Navy, officers can salute with their left hand if their right hand is engaged or occupied.

, Make sure your forearm and hand stay in a straight line. Tilt your hand so your palm does not show as you salute. Keep your hand to the side of your face, just below your cap., The word “salute” means to offer a salutation or a greeting. In the military, you must show respect by saluting your superiors, and your superiors must reciprocate by saluting you.If you are not sure who is your superior officer based on your rank, you can use this chart here to determine who you should be saluting in the Navy. For example, in the Navy, a Petty Officer will always salute a Lieutenant.

Use your Transfer Data Sheet (TDS).,
Find out your flight window.,
Get a Final Physical.,
Get a checkout sheet and make your rounds.,
Fly out on your scheduled date, bring all paperwork with you.",How to Separate from Active Duty (Marine Corps)," They will be able to sign you up for the Transition Readiness Seminar (TRS). You will need to complete a lot of work before attending the seminar, including a written budget, webinars, Verification of Military Experience & Training (VMET), DD Form 2586, DD Form 2648 to be signed by your Unit Transition Counselor for the class. Do this Twelve months out from starting terminal leave or EAS.;
, With the Veteran's Opportunity to Work (VOW) Act of 2011, it is now the Law that every transitioning military member attend this training prior to separating active duty. It must be done no later than six months prior to EAS, or commencement of terminal leave. The class is a how-to for adjusting to aspects of civilian life. It teaches service members valuable skills like job hunting, resume writing, interviewing, finding the right college, using Post 9-11 G.I. Bill benefits and other useful information. You are not allowed to miss any portion of the five day class. Any missed sections will need to be repeated at a later date, possibly disrupting your flight window. You will need to complete all of the pre-work (webinars, DD Form 2586, DD Form 2648 prior to attending, this will be stamped ""Complete"", after you have met all of the requirements of the seminar and you will need to return the original to your Unit Transition Counselor.

, You get this from S-1 or IPAC separations section. Start this at six months out.


Inside the TDS are ten (10) pages that must be filled out completely. If the page does not apply to you, draw a diagonal line through the page and write N/A, similar to a log book.
The TDS is also where you request terminal leave and flight window. To calculate how much terminal leave you can take, add current leave to leave accruable (2.5 per month) and count backward from your EAS. Do not count half days, they will reimburse you for those.
Per the order you must be at SEPS ten (10) business day prior your separation date, however, honorable discharge Marines are typically separated in three (3) business days. Your flight date may be pushed right by IPAC to reflect this. Marines from overseas can be separated immediately if they have less than 90 days on contract. If you are not taking terminal leave, refer to the dates on your orders or fifteen (15) days to the left of your EAS if you do not have them yet.

, Your flight window is just a suggestion to IPAC. They have a chart to figure out when you need to fly. Request your ten day flight window ten days left (minus) from your terminal leave date. Your chain of command up to your CO need to sign this, use a routing sheet and give it to you SNCO. Make a copy when done.

, This is a multi-part step. It can also be complete to earlier than six (6) months from you EAS/Terminal leave date. Fill out DDFORM 2808 and 2807, ask your Corpsman if you need help or can't find them.


Schedule optometry, audiology, dental and a blood draw, bring both DD forms to the appointments to be signed. Make sure you get the print off of each exam.

Turn them in to IPAC PCS/Separations section. They typically take two to three weeks to schedule your flight date, but can take much longer.



, Do not procrastinate this step. You need to have a complete checkout sheet to pick up your tickets from IPAC. You will receive your SRB at the same time, photocopy it completely.

, Arrive at separations platoon, where they will type your DD214, give you terminal leave and organize your final payment.

Respect the time and priorities of your coworkers.,
Support your coworkers.,
Have good manners.,
Give compliments.,
Do not become the office gossip.,
Pretend everyone can read your emails.,
Work out conflicts on your own.",How to Be Popular at Your Office Job2," The last thing you want to add to your new reputation is being known as ‘that’ person who wastes everyone’s time. The priorities you have at work will not likely match those of your coworkers. Because of this, you must respect your coworkers' time and not waste it by making your priorities more important than theirs.Try not to show up at a coworker’s desk unannounced, especially if you need to talk about something detailed and complicated. Instead, email or call ahead and arrange a specific time to stop by and talk.
Learn to read the body language of your coworkers. If they start to show signs that they’re becoming impatient or worried, wrap up the conversation and let your coworker get back to work.
If you work in an open, but quiet, office environment, keep your voice at a level that doesn’t project too far beyond your own desk. Respect the fact that some of your coworker’s may need quiet in order to do their work.

, The business world is about making deals. Some of those deals are done by doing favours for other people so that one day they’ll do you a favour in return. The sort of deals and favours being referenced here aren't the underhanded or ruthless kind, but rather the kind where you take the opportunity to support a coworker when they need it. In return you’ll have earned that coworker’s respect and trust, and hopefully one day you’ll be able to call upon them for some support of your own. The following are a number of ways you can show your coworker’s support:Offering to help with a task or assignment when you notice your coworker is overwhelmed or falling behind.
Showing visible support for a coworker’s idea or project in a public setting like a meeting.
Offering to fill in for a coworker who may need to go home early because they have an appointment or aren’t feeling well.

, In general you should always treat everyone with respect. But at work you should try to go a little further by making your coworkers feel important and relaxed. If you’re making small talk around the water cooler, talk about things your coworker would be interested in. If you don’t know what your coworker’s interests are, ask them.When listening to a coworker tell you a story, follow-up with questions during or after their story. The questions show you were paying attention and thought what it was important.
When talking and interacting with your coworkers, be sincere.
Remember to do small, friendly gestures for your coworkers when you can. For example, if you’re going to get coffee, offer to pick one up for them.

, It is often assumed, especially by managers, that if they haven’t told you you’ve done a bad job, you’re doing a good job. In other words, no news is good news. But this assumption isn’t good enough. Human beings need to hear praise, it makes them feel good and boosts their confidence. The next time a coworker does something great, compliment them.While complimenting is great, be careful about the types of compliments you give out. Because it’s a work environment, you should probably avoid compliments about physical appearance so as not to make your coworker uncomfortable.
Good compliments to use in an office setting would be: praising a coworker about a great presentation or speech they gave; telling a coworker you really liked a report they wrote; commenting to a coworker about the excellent way they handled a specific situation; etc.

, Chances are you don’t like it when your coworkers talk about you behind your back, so why would you do that to them? Office gossips develop the wrong kind of reputation, and it’s one you should work to avoid., Emails, just like anything on the internet, can never truly be deleted forever, and can probably be seen by more people than you realize. When writing emails on a work email account, pretend the whole company can read them. Not from a business content perspective, but from the perspective of your tone, how you talk about and to other people, and how you word requests.Avoid using work email to talk about specific people, especially to someone outside of your organization. If you need to vent about someone who has upset you, do so in person or with personal email.

, Conflicts are inevitable at work, but it’s how you handle them once they’ve occurred that will play a part in your reputation. If you have a conflict with a coworker, whether it be personal or work-related, speak directly to that person about it. Be open and honest and work to resolve the issue together.Of course, there may come a time when you are unable to resolve the conflict on your own and it affects your ability to do your job. In a case like this, talk to your own manager about the situation and ask for advice. In some situations your manager may need to handle the issue directly.

Be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.",How to Receive a Congressional Medal of Honor," To be eligible to receive the Medal of Honor you must be a member of the U.S. military. The Navy, Air Force, and Army all award medals with unique engravings depicting their particular service branch. The Marine Corps and Coast Guard medals follow the Navy design. Both officers and enlisted men can receive the Medal.Women are generally eligible to receive the Medal, although only one woman, Mary Walker in 1861, has had the honor.;
, In 1963 Congress refined the requirements of the award to specify that a service member must be involved in a military action or conflict in order to be eligible. If you are working alongside “friendly forces,” you are also eligible. This makes the actions taken in more small-scale conflicts recognizable as well., If you’ve received other prestigious awards while serving, you are far more likely to make it into serious Medal contention. The award process favors those individuals who have established a career of service with one particular moment of valor being particularly noteworthy.


For example, Byers received his Medal after being a five-time Bronze Star awardee, along with two Combat Action Ribbons and two Purple Hearts. This was after completing 11 deployments., To be in contention for a Medal, you must perform a service action that goes above and beyond the norm. It has to be an act of exceptional valor, one that often involves saving the lives of other people and placing yourself in personal peril. Your actions must distinguish you and set you apart from others.For example, in February 1945, seventeen-year-old Jack Lucas saved three fellow marines by diving on top of two grenades and lived to receive the Medal. As you can tell from this story, it is best to not search out opportunities to earn acclaim, instead simply serve your fellow service members to the best of your abilities at all times., If you are a service member interested in receiving the Medal, it is a good idea to find out a little more about its history. This will help you to craft the best possible nomination package. You can go to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society website for lots of good information surrounding the Medal.You will find that the total Medal recipients count stands at 3,498 as of December 2016. This number will slowly rise as Presidents present new Medals.
You may also learn that the Medal was created during the Civil War period and was signed into law by President Lincoln.

, Descriptions and official reports regarding your action will then be grouped together into a nomination package. Some nomination packages are very compressed and contain as few as 50 pages, while others are quite lengthy and grow to well over 1,000.You can request that particular persons provide letters of support, however, the initial process often starts without the nominee's direct knowledge. As the investigation continues, official accounts of the action and personal interview responses become important pieces of evidence.
At any stage in the process an official can reject or pause your application by citing the lack of evidence regarding the incident in question. For example, in 2003, Air Force Gen. Richard Myers, sent back one application requesting additional eyewitness accounts., Your word alone is not enough evidence. Eyewitnesses, your fellow service members, or higher officials, must also provide numerous and substantial accounts regarding your actions and their importance. Eyewitness statements, in particular, are favored by the award process.This requirement, in particular, has presented difficulties for those persons trying to submit a posthumous award application for a deceased service member.

, Your statement will most likely begin with your fellow service members writing down sworn statements, which will then be carried on to the unit commander. If your action took place within the past two years, then the paperwork will proceed on upward to its next stop, depending on your service branch. If your action took place more than two years ago, you will need to seek out a congressional nomination.For example, Army applications that fit into the two-year window go up to the Army Human Resources Command before being sent even deeper into the chain., If more than two years have passed since your action, then your nomination package will need to be sponsored or championed by a member of Congress. This politician’s office will then submit your package to officials within your service branch, such as the Secretary of the Army.Relatives of the service member often write letters to politicians requesting that attention be paid to the actions of a particular service member. This is one way to get an application started. The more details that are provided regarding the incident itself, the better.

, Officials will ask the applicant to provide a list of persons who they would like to have contacted as part of the investigation process. This list should include any eyewitnesses to the action as well as character references. Members in the chain of command will also add names to the interview list based upon official reports. The investigation will focus on the incident itself, but also the overall character of the service member in question.


Many of these interviews will occur face-to-face with questions being repeated multiple times to get an exact timeline and story established. For example, an opening question might be, “How did you learn of this action?” All of these answers will then be compared to official reports.
These investigations are often made even more challenging by the injuries sustained by the people involved. It is not unknown for investigators to talk with a nominee and their fellow service members in the hospital, if necessary. In some cases, the Medal nominee is medically unable to speak and their actions must be described by others.The interview transcripts are then added to the nomination packet and are made available to other individuals in the chain of command as the nomination moves upward.

, Your package may be “in play” for two years or more. Throughout this time a series of officials will look over your documents and decide whether or not to pass your package along with an approval, or suggest you for another lower-ranking award. The Distinguished Service Cross is a likely alternative being the second-highest medal awarded for valor.For example, if you package moves through Army channels it will need to pass through the: Army Human Resources Command (Army Decoration Board), Manpower and Reserve Affairs, Chief of Staff of the Army, Secretary of the Army, Secretary of Defense, and President. The President has the final say (for all service branches) regarding the approval or disapproval of the nomination., Because of the number of offices and individuals involved in the approval process it is unusual for a nomination package to pass through in fewer than 18 months. You must stay patient throughout this entire time and be available to answer any and all questions. The lengthiness of the process has come under some scrutiny of late, but shows no signs of speeding up., A press release comes in advance, but this will be your official introduction as a Medal awardee. The President will speak at length about your actions and then will present you with the Medal. If a service member is deceased, their relatives usually receive the award in their place., There is a good possibility that your hometown or local area will plan a celebration in your honor. There could be a parade, a presentation of honors, or even a reception at the local school. You should soak up all of this attention while also looking for ways that you can help in the long term., As a Medal winner, every time that your story is recounted you will have the opportunity to discuss the valorous actions taken by your fellow service members. Many Medal winners, in particular, choose to highlight the actions of those who lost their lives, especially if those losses took place during the awarded incident., Some Medal recipients choose to partake in speaking tours. They might travel around to schools or businesses recounting their experiences and providing larger lessons in service. The CMOH website provides a clearinghouse for these opportunities and is one way to match interested organizations with service members.Veteran health is a cause close to the hearts of Medal recipients and you can often find them speaking to post-traumatic stress support groups and the like., Your pension coming from the Department of Veterans Affairs will be raised up from the standard amount (depending on the year) and provided monthly. You will also receive at least a 10 percent increase in your general retirement funds. You will have access to free flights on military aircraft and free admittance to various other military facilities (pools, golf courses)., This is not a hard-and-fast law, but it is suggested that service members should recognize and salute Medal recipients, when possible. The salute can occur whether or not the medal winner is in uniform or wearing their medal. Even higher ranking member are encouraged to offer a salute.


In addition, Medal recipients are granted uniform privileges and can wear their uniforms as often as they choose.

, Many service members are buried locally when they die. However, Medal recipients have the option, and privilege, of interment at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, alongside other service members. Due to space limitations, this is an honor offered to only a few people.The Department of Veterans Affairs will also provide an engraved headstone for those Medal recipients who have passed away.

Attach.",How to Properly Align Rank Insignia on Marine Uniforms1," Enlisted marines are required to wear different uniforms, depending on the occasion. Generally speaking, there are three “types” of uniforms worn by enlisted marines. The field, utility or combat uniform is worn during active operations. The dress or blue dress uniforms are worn to formal occasions. Finally, the service uniforms are worn much like business suits, for military inquiries, appearances in court, meetings with officers, etc., Chevrons, which signify an enlisted marine’s rank, are worn on the sleeves and collars of all dress and service uniforms. While wearing utility or combat uniforms, enlisted marines only wear small, black chevrons that pin to the collars of their uniforms.The sleeve chevrons are stitched to the dress and service uniforms, so this article will deal exclusively with how to attach collar chevrons.

, An enlisted marine’s chevrons should always be positioned with the tip pointed up. Chevrons come in different sizes, depending on the rank of the marine, but are always placed on the collar with the points up., The bottom edge of the insignia (no matter what rank) will be 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the side of the collar on both sides. Thus, a sergeant major's chevrons will protrude higher up than a PFC, because it is much taller., Chevrons for enlisted persons attach to the collar with a built in pin. Remove the backing from the pin, push the pin through the front of the cloth on the collar, and reattach the backing on the underside of the collar."

Attach.",How to Properly Align Rank Insignia on Marine Uniforms2," Warrant officers don’t wear chevrons on the collar. Instead, they wear a rectangular pin whose colors alternate between red and silver or red and gold, depending on the rank. These pins are worn on both the left and right collar. , A warrant officer’s rank insignia should always be positioned lengthwise, with the longer portion being positioned horizontally. Regardless of rank, warrant officer pins are the same size., The bottom edge of the insignia (no matter what rank) will be centered from the side of the collar on both sides. The rank insignia for warrant officers is positioned vertically 1 inch above the bottom of the collar., Rank insignia for warrant officers attach to the collar with a built in pin. Remove the backing from the pin, push the pin through the front of the cloth on the collar, and reattach the backing on the underside of the collar."

Align generals’ stars.,
Align the oak leaves.,
Position and attach the bars.,
Attach colonels’ eagles.,
Attach chevrons to utility uniforms.",How to Properly Align Rank Insignia on Marine Uniforms3," Generals in the USMC wear stars of gold and silver to represent rank. Generals' stars will have a single tip pointing up, centered vertically, 1/2 an inch from the sides and one inch from the bottom, on both collars.On service uniforms, the stars are attached to a general’s epaulets and shirt collar.
On dress uniforms, generals wear their stars on the epaulets and an insignia of an eagle on top of a globe, with an anchor running through it, on their jacket collars. To position the eagle/globe logo, position the insignia so that the eagle is vertically upright, and the head of the anchor is facing inwards towards the neck. Attach this insignia 1/2 an inch from the side and 1 inch from the bottom of the collar.

, Lt. Colonels and Majors will wear oak leaves of varying colors as a sign of rank. Always center the oak leaves on the collar, with the stem pointing downward. Like with other rank insignia, the oak leaves need to be position 1/2 an inch from the sides and 1 inch up from the bottom of the collar., Captains and Lieutenants wear bars on their collars to represent their respective ranks. Center the bars 1/2 inch from the sides of the collar. Position the bars 1 inch above the bottom of the collar and attach., Colonels will wear their eagles with the wings perpendicular to the deck and looking inboard (towards the neck). Attach this pin 1 inch from the bottom of the collar and 1/2 an inch from the sides on the dress jacket collar., When in combat or in the field, commissioned officers are not required to wear any sign of their rank on their uniforms. However, they may choose to signify their rank wearing small chevrons on the collar. These are attached in the same way as on enlisted marine uniforms.To avoid standing out and making themselves a target in the field, officers often choose to wear black or brown “subdued” chevrons rather than shiny gold or silver ones.

Give yourself a NO-BULL**** assessment on your career so far.,
Now, how your superiors rate you.,
Constantly check outside ""the wire"" for a way out.,
Check to see about your MOS if the job is consolidating or downsizing.,
Consider your current MOS's future in promotions.,
Career Counselors may not consider themselves ""recruiters"" yet they are.,
Soldiers have a ""Re-enlistment Window"" to decide whether they continue to be in the Army or shuffle off to Fort Living Room.",How to Reenlist in the Us Military1," What are your feelings in being in the Army. Do you like doing Physical Fitness (PT) early morning at the crack of dawn? Do you like the travel? Do you like the regimental way of life? Consider about the Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) you are in right now. Do you like the job? Realize that whatever you decide, you alone decide. If you choice right, it's your reward. If you choice wrong, it's your punishment. You get what you pay for.;
, In practice, your first line supervisor should provide you monthly counseling statements on your performance. They should give you a realistic assessment of their perspective about you. In the real-world, by now, you can sense if your superiors like what they see in you. If they push you to do better, it might be good thing because they see potential. If they dismiss you, it means they won't invest in you. That is a bad thing.

, ""The Wire"" is the fence line between military and civilian life. A lot of soldiers who leave the Army for numerous reasons regret leaving because they do not have anything lined up outside in the civilian world. If you're going to college, check on your school on enrollment. If you got a job, better be sure you have an offer letter in hand before leaving for the Freedom Bird.

, Case in point, the military is downsizing food specialist positions and would like to move excess people to other jobs. Consider your ASVAB scores as your Frequent Flyer Miles you've obtained coming in. The magic number for any soldier in the Army to get any job is GT score 110. (circa 2000-ish, please consult your recruiter to verify) If you have a lower score, consider enrolling yourself in the Basic Skills Education Program (BSEP) to improve your Armed Service Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) scores. Consult with the Base's Educational Services or your S-1 for more information.

, By now, you're probably itching to become a Non-Commission Officer (NCO) yet, somehow, it's seems to be a chore to advance to a specialist (E-4) rank. If you are a specialist for a considerable amount of time (2 plus years in rank), and you are doing everything humanly possible to better yourself like attending college courses at night or submitting correspondence courses up the wazoo and no one in your unit is getting promoted? Better look for another job.

, They will give all the necessary information that you need to get what you ask for. So, with that in mind, it's crucial that you learn as much as you can about what the Army can offer. Of course, ensure you are still marketable also. If you are a model soldier, these soldiers can perform feats to keep you in. If you are a substandard soldier or ""oxygen thief"", they may brush you aside as a low priority.

, Soldiers have an opportunity of between 3 months and 1 year to make the decision to re-enlist. If a soldier decides to re-enlist after his 3 months expired, you better have a damn good reason you waited that long. By then, it's up to powers to be to decide. Do not wait till the last moment."

, Depending if your MOS is a critical, the career counselor can provide you an enticing bonus to stay at your job. Soldier might get more money if they re-enlist in certain places where the Army needs you.

, This is usually reserved for people who either do not have a high ASVAB score AND whose MOS may seem to be disbanded. If the Soldier wants to continue in the Army, the Soldier would give free reign to Uncle Sam to put the Soldier where the Army needs them. The Army can put them anywhere they are needed in whatever job in where ever place.

This type of action is given to soldiers who have not conformed to military standards, (ie. fail a Physical Fitness Test, have done a punishable crime, etc).

, This date should be a special date for you. Be warned, if you decide to place your date further into the future, you run the risk of having things happen. (see #1)

, Do not accept anything Handwritten or White-out. Question anything that seems odd to you. The Army expects 100% success from you, you best expect 100% success from them too. THIS IS YOUR LIFE.

Practice doing pull ups.,
Work up to pull ups by practicing flexed-arm hangs.,
Practice doing as many sit ups as you can in 60 seconds.,
Increase your ability to execute curl ups by practicing partial curl ups.,
Incorporate the V-sit reach into your cool down.",How to Prepare for and Pass the JROTC Cadet Challenge1," Consistency in your workout regimen is vital. At minimum, make sure you’re practicing the specific skills needed to pass the challenge three times a week. These should be done in addition to other weekly workouts. In roughly half an hour, you can warm up, work at a competitive pace, and cool down. Include aerobic and anaerobic exercises in your workouts, as well as muscle strengthening exercise and stretching.;
, Spend a few minutes stretching your muscles and joints to prepare for a safe and productive workout. Immediately preceding whatever specific exercise you’re about to perform, go through the motions at a moderate pace.See this articles section of stretching for specific stretches you can incorporate into your work out.

, Aerobic, anaerobic, and strengthening exercises should be completed during this period. These will help prepare you for the endurance, speed, and strength-related components of the challenge. Be sure to take specific steps to improve your ability to excel in each exercise of the challenge., The first event of the Cadet Challenge is the one mile run. To prepare for this event, find a track – which are almost always ¼ mile around – or consult a map to establish a running route that is precisely one mile long. Always time yourself, and try to beat your own time from the previous run.If you have to walk for part of the mile, don’t be discouraged. Minimize the amount of walking by taking short walking breaks only when absolutely necessary.
Don’t worry too much about hills, as the test will be conducted on a flat surface. However, training on hills may get you better prepared by making flat runs relatively easy.

, The second event of the Cadet Challenge is a 30ft shuttle run. You will be required to sprint 30 feet from a starting position, pick up a block from the ground, sprint back to the starting location, and set the block down. You’ll then repeat this process, and conclude the test upon returning to the starting location for the second time as quickly as possible.Practice the shuttle run by measuring out a 30ft distance or going somewhere that already has two parallel lines 30 feet (9.1 m) apart. For example, a regulation volleyball court is 30ft wide.
Don’t forget to time yourself every time and try to beat your personal best time each run.

, The third criteria by which you will be tested during the Cadet Challenge is simply the number of pull ups you can perform. To practice doing pull ups properly, start from a hanging “dead weight” position. Use a secure, straight bar 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter that you can easily and safely grip, and that is far enough from the ground that your feet are not touching. Pull yourself up until your chin clears the bar.Use either overhand or underhand grip – put your palms on whichever side of the bar you prefer.
After each pull up, lower yourself to a fully hanging position, with your arms almost all the way straight. Do not go so far that you hang loosely, or as far as would allow your elbows to lock out.
Avoid jerking or swinging your body during movement, and do not kick or bend your legs up to assist you.

, If you are unable to do any pull ups, build strength by hanging from a bar with your palms towards your face and your chin above the bar. Use a ladder or step stool to reach a bar, and grasp it shoulder width apart. Have someone remove the ladder or kick it away. Try to hold your chin above the bar for as long as possible.Don’t allow your legs to swing around, rest your chin on the bar, or tilt your head backwards to raise your chin.

, Referred to by the JROTC program as “curl ups”, the fourth exercise included in the Cadet Challenge tests the strength of your whole body, particularly your abdomen. Start by lying on your back and raising your knees while dragging the soles of your feet towards you. Position your feet about 12 inches (30.5 cm) from your bottom, with your soles flat on the ground.If you go not have an exercise partner to hold your feet down, tuck your toes under something immobile, such as the bottom of a slide on the playground.
Cross your arms across your chest so that your hands are touching the opposite shoulder throughout the exercise. Keep your elbows against your chest.
Pull your upper torso upwards until your elbows touch your knees or thighs.
Lower your torso all the way down, so that your shoulder blades touch the ground.
Repeat this bend as many times as you can in one minute to mimic testing conditions.
Do not bounce off of the floor, as this is dangerous and will not be allowed during the challenge.

, If unable to do full curl ups, partial curl ups can help you get there. Lie down with your knees bent, and flat feet positioned about 12 inches (30.5 cm) from your bottom. For partial curl ups, do not secure your feet. Extend your arms forward and rest your hands on your thighs. Do a partial curl up by leaning forward and sliding your hands up your thighs as far as you can reach. Repeat the process as many times as you can muster., The final component of the Cadet Challenge measures your flexibility via a V-sit reach exercise. Following a full-pace work out, keep your muscles working at a more mellow pace for 4 to 6 minutes.Wind down slowly, and then stretch your muscles again. Make sure to practice the V-sit reach in particular.


Remove your shoes for the V-sit reach.
Sit with your legs outstretched in front of you, with your feet 8 to 12 inches (20.3 to 30.5 cm) apart.
Align your heels along a baseline, such as the edge of the carpet or mat, and position a yardstick extending from the baseline.
Clasp your thumbs together with your palms facing downward.
With your legs flat, lean forward, reaching beyond the soles of your feet as far as you can.
During the actual challenge, you’ll get three “practice” reaches; your fourth reach will record your score according to the distance of your reach.

"
"
Stretch carefully before and after every workout.,
Stretch out the side of your body.,
Do a hand grasp stretch.,
Get your lower back limbered up.,
Stretch your calves.,
Keep your hamstrings stretched out.",How to Prepare for and Pass the JROTC Cadet Challenge2," After you’ve warmed up and your muscles are feeling limber and engaged, stretch to help prevent injuries. Avoid stretching before you’ve warmed up, as it is not only ineffective, but potentially harmful.Never rush a stretch. Schedule and use a full few minutes to stretch out the muscle groups you’ll be working out.
Avoid “bouncing” while stretching. Allowing yourself to bounce in and out of a stretch can tear muscle fibers detrimentally.

, Stand with your feet apart and your knees bent. Put one hand on your hip, and extend your other hand all the way overhead, reaching as far across as you are able. Hold this stretch for 15 seconds, and then repeat it on the other side.Do five repetitions of this stretch on each side.
If you cannot hold the stretch for 15 seconds for 5 reps, start slowly with 2 or 3 reps on each side.

, To stretch a bunch of your muscles at once, clasp your hands behind your back and keep them clasped. Standing with your feet shoulder width apart and your knees bent, lean forward from the waist. Lift your arms backwards and upwards towards your head.Hold the stretch for 15 seconds. Do five repetitions, or as many as you are able.

, Extend your legs straight out while lying on your back. Bring one knee all the way up to your chest. Pull the leg closer to your chest with your hands on your hamstring just above the back of the knee. Once you’re leg is pulled up, roll your shoulders slowly forward towards your knee.Do five repetitions of this stretch for each leg.
If you cannot hold the stretch for 15 seconds for 5 reps on each leg, start with 2 or 3 reps on each side.

, Stand with one of your legs in front of the other and your hands on your hips. Lean your upper body forward, bending your front knee and putting your weight on your forward foot. Extend the rear leg straight back. Keep you back toe on the ground; your heel will naturally rise off the ground. To stretch the calve of the back leg, push that foot’s heel to the ground and hold for 15 seconds.Do five repetitions of this stretch for each calve.
If you cannot hold the stretch for 15 seconds for 5 reps on both calves, start with 2 or 3 reps on each side.

, Sit on the floor with your back straight and your legs outstretched in front of you, toes upward. Pull one foot in towards your groin, tucking the sole of your foot against the inside of your other thigh. Bend at your waist over the outstretched leg, sliding your hands down your leg until you’re feeling the stretch.Hold the stretch for 15 seconds and do it twice for each leg.

Focus on improvement at first.,
Shoot for competitive mile and shuttle run times.,
Know the necessary number of curl ups and pull ups you’ll need to complete.,
Work to improve your flexibility.",How to Prepare for and Pass the JROTC Cadet Challenge3," The preparation required to achieve success on the Cadet Challenge is meant to familiarize you with the process of maintaining a physical fitness regimen. The specific components of the challenge are selected to reflect your development of strength, cardio-vascular endurance, flexibility, agility, and speed. Success on the challenge indicates your ability to maintain a healthy physical condition – a necessary component of personal growth and healthy adulthood., While your particular organization may require you to achieve certain marks for advancement or other achievements, national JROTC awards are determined on a percentile basis. The Cadet Challenge follows the benchmarks to earn The Presidential Physical Fitness Award. To earn this award, you’ll need to score in the 85th percentile or above on all five exercises included in the challenge. The National Physical Fitness Award is earned by scoring in the top 50 percent of each category., When you first begin training for the Cadet Challenge, do not worry about your initial scores. Monitor your times, etc., in order to set goals for improvement and recognize personal achievements as you approach them.Record your progress. Records your scores for each exercise each time your practice.
Set specific goals to achieve for each exercise. Use the expected 85th percentile marks as especially significant goals to shoot for, though these don’t need to be your initial goals.
Get more detailed explanations of each exercise from a JROTC-affiliated publication, many of which are available online. Furthermore, electronic and printable forms are available online to help you keep track of your training regimen and progress towards your goals.

, For the shuttle run, boys of 16-17 years of age will likely need to complete a shuttle run in 8.7 seconds to match the 85th percentile, and the mile in about 6 minutes and 6 seconds. Girls of the same age will need to complete the shuttle run in about 10 seconds, and the mile in under 8 minutes and 20 seconds.


For the shuttle run, you will be allowed to run twice, with the better of your two scores being used as your official score.

, 17 year old boys will need to complete around 55 curl ups in 60 seconds to score in the 85th percentile, while girls of the same age will need to complete around 44. 17 year old boys will likely need to be able to complete 13 pull ups to score in the 85th percentile. 17 year old girls will likely achieve this percentile with 1 pull up.

, This can be an especially challenging exercise, so don’t overlook stretching. 17 year old boys who score in the 85th percentile of the V-sit reach usually attain a score of 7 inches. Girls of the same age and percentile usually reach 8 inches.

Enlist.",How to Prepare to Join the Military," People leave the military because of retirement, pursuing higher education, pursue a civilian occupation and more. Whatever the reasons for these people who leave the military must be replaced. An estimated 353,000 new recruits are welcomed by the U.S. Army. The army must attract qualified candidates and train them to be able to accomplish its mission. Recruiters play an important role in this process. Advertising is not enough to win recruits. These are the people who go and watch schools, communities, youth groups and where this can be achieved to maintain its strong numbers.


Each branch of the armed forces used different criteria for the selection of its recruits. The common denominator is that they employ experienced enlisted personnel to sell their product. Military recruiter is an expert on and advocate for its product. Thus, he or she can provide every information, guidance, opinion and stories about the U.S. Army. They are mechanics, cooks, administrators, electricians or whatever you can name work within the group. They know the enrollment criteria and have good public relations skills;
, Although most of the first interviews with recruiters occur in the recruiter's office, there are cases where the recruiter might suggest another venue. However, the best setting would be the recruiter's office. Meet with your recruiter to his own office gives you the opportunity to see for yourself its environment.


Before the interview, your recruiters have asked you to bring more possibly a social security card, birth certificate, driver's license or high school diploma. You can start the process by providing your social security card.
Dress appropriately for the day and know the company you are interviewing.
Most information can be seen in their websites. Write down any questions you may have.

, Addressing the moral demands of enrollment is easy as any law-abiding citizen is qualified to join the army. If you have any previous violations of the law (only minor cases can be tolerated), immediately reveal this to your recruiter (see below).


Check out some more specific guidelines for joining each branch of the service. Requirements vary form branch to branch and between different countries, so reading up on the specific requirements, application process, and joining procedures is vital. Here are some articles to help get you started:

How to Join the SAS



, If you have violated the law, you can still join the army by providing a moral waiver. Waivers are not granted automatically. The recruiter can offer help for you if you receive a waiver.


If a particular recruiter refuses to help you with the legal disclaimer, you can find another recruiter who can help you with your concerns. The level at which an exemption may be granted depending on the weight of the offense(s). The process can take some time depending on the level of the approval authority.
Write a statement about your violations of law/abuse. You need to write a statement about the violation of the law. To do this, it is essential that your letter appears to be sincere and well thought out. It's the only way you can tell the authority to grant exemption on yourself.
Never look like you blame others for the offense. Take responsibility for your actions. Take your time, write legibly, read the grammar and check your spelling and grammar. Be polite and do not make derogatory statements about the authority (police, courts, judge, etc.); stress that you can provide the army (U.S.) as competence, work ethic, and more.

, Most, if not all, militaries around the world require physical screening tests and medical examinations, so you'll need to make sure you're in good shape to pass. Ask your recruiter for specific details on what the test is likely to include for your desired branch and position.

, Your family's position on the military shouldn't in itself affect your decision, but military life is likely to be easier with the support of loved ones. If they're reluctant to see you join up, explain your reasons for wanting to join, talk with them about your options and career path, and ask for their understanding (and even enthusiasm).

, Some people who join the military are only looking to do a set number of years and move into another field; others seek to spend a career in the army and even become an officer. Talk to your recruiter about the options available to you, and what education, training, and signing commitment is required for each one. If you prepare with some idea of what you want out of the military career before you even join up, you'll likely feel more dedicated to your choice.

, For most militaries around the world, bootcamp is recognized as a time of ""diving right in,"" and does involve some intense training to get you ready for military duty. Know what to expect and prepare yourself for the process.

, By this time, you will likely have worked through all of the steps of preparing with your recruiter and have a clear idea of what more you need to do to officially enlist. When you've fulfilled the requirements for preparation, it'll be time to sign on the dotted line and serve your country with pride!

Know the cutoff scores.,
Take a pre-ASVAB.,
Review your results.,
Know what to work on.,
Study in the test-taking environment.,
Quick review.,
Take another diagnostic.,
The test.",How to Pass the ASVAB,"  The minimal passing scores for each branch of military service varies and they are also subject to change.  There may be waivers available for scores that aren't high enough to pass: check with your recruiter or career counselor for more information.  Also, know that if you are interested in a particular military occupation specialty (MOS), each job requires a certain score.;
,  If you're worried about possibly failing the ASVAB, take a pre-ASVAB to gauge your performance.  Your scores on these practice tests do not count; this is simply a diagnostic tool that will give a pretty accurate determination of whether or not you will pass the actual ASVAB.  You can take a pre-ASVAB with a military recruiter and you can also find them on the internet and in some books.

,  If you pass: great!  If you don't: no worries.  The ASVAB covers a lot of material but what really matters to you are the scores that contribute to the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT).  The AFQT score is comprised of the results of four subtests on the ASVAB: (1) arithmetic reasoning (AR), (2) paragraph comprehension (PC), (3) word knowledge (WK), and (4) mathematics knowledge (MK).  Your AFQT score determines whether or not you can join certain branches of military service.  If you have a particular MOS in mind, check with recruiters or career counselors about what specific additional ASVAB subtests are used for admission which could include general science (GS), electronic information (EI), auto and shop information (AS), mechanical comprehension (MC), or assembling objects (AO).

,  If you scored poorly on some of the subtests, you will need to study the basic knowledge that the section covers.  The best way to figure out what ""basic knowledge"" each section covers is to consult books that specialize on ASVAB test-taking.  Look for books that present material on the nine subtests (mentioned in the last step) and a sample ASVAB test.  Also, if you can, make note of the questions that you answered incorrectly on your diagnostic test and include those in your study routine.

,  The ASVAB is administered in a quiet room with other people testing at the same time.  You should study in an environment similar to the one that you'll be testing in.

,  When you have time, quickly review some material that you haven't quite mastered.  This gives your brain time to process the information and the techniques you need to exercise on the test.  Do this on a daily basis.

,  When you feel ready for the ASVAB, take another diagnostic to be sure.  Set a timer and take the test in a quite area to really simulate the conditions of the ASVAB you'll be taking.  You should have made improvements in the subtests you studied for.  If you don't pass the diagnostic, however, don't be discouraged.  Complete steps three through seven again with these new results in mind.  Your dedication will serve you well: both on the test and in your future endeavors with the military.

,  The ASVAB is different than most tests you've probably taken.  There are a few things that you need to consider when taking the ASVAB: 


Points are not deducted for wrong answers: you get points for answering questions correctly.  So, when taking a pencil-and-paper format test, read through the questions, first, and then answer the ones that are easiest for you, first. 
With the paper-and-pencil format of the ASVAB, try not to leave any questions unanswered.  If time permits and you are still struggling with tougher questions, venture an educated guess.
Nowadays, ASVAB tests are mostly being administered via computer.  With this format, you only get one question at a time, so there is no need to scan read the test or organize your test taking strategy.  When you answer a question correctly, you get a slightly more difficult question after that.  When you get a question wrong, you get a slightly easier question after that.
When working on a tough question, plug in the multiple answer choices to see if they fit.  The question itself may be difficult, but by weeding out the obvious wrong answers, your improving your chances of getting it right.

Listen and pay attention.,
Act with confidence in everything you do.,
Don’t show signs of frustration.,
See the entire picture.,
Drill Sergeants are human too and, believe it or not, are there to help you.,
Do not aspire to be a Drill Sergeant's friend.,
Do not attempt to try on a Drill Sergeants hat.,
It helps if you are a ""Military Brat"", since you'll be used to military life at an early age.

",How to Make It Through Military Boot Camp," This might sound easy, but Drill Sergeants will deliver many commands to you in a short time period. Naval Sea Cadets, JROTC or Civil Air Patrol can help if you are in high school. Also, when you first meet your Drill Sergeants, there will be a lot of activity around you. Some recruits will be doing push-ups and others will be running in place. Make sure you are only listening to your Drill Sergeant and not other recruits. Some recruits pretend like they know what the Drill Sergeant wants and will command other recruits to follow them. Do not listen to them, only listen to your Drill Sergeant.;
, If your Drill Sergeant asks your rank, don’t whisper your rank. Instead, take a quick deep breath and let your answer ""explode"". Drill Sergeants like motivation and confidence; it exemplifies a person’s strength.

, Drill Sergeants are going to give you tasks that are designed for you to fail. When you fail, you feel broken, and when you feel broken, they are able to build you up again. Essentially they are breaking down your civilian attitude and building you into a soldier. That doesn’t come easy, at least in the U.S military. Even if you're facing the ground about to accomplish what seems to be your 500th push-up, continue on and sound motivated.

, If you are about to leave for basic training, all of this advice might scare you- do not let that happen. Boot camp/basic training is a jarring experience, but not a long one. Completing your basic training will fill you with a well-deserved sense of accomplishment.

, They are charged with turning you from an individual citizen into a member of your country's fighting forces. Drill Sergeants themselves go through a rigorous training program just to become Drill Sergeants. They already have been broken down many more times than you will ever be in basic training, so they know what it feels like.

, If a Drill Sergeant does his job right, you will leave basic training without ever knowing if he liked you or not. Do not get on a Drill Sergeant's bad side. He will turn your own recruits against you. Without your fellow recruits to help you through basic training, your next couple months are going to be lonely.

, This should be blatantly obvious. You don't want the punishment you would have coming to you, no matter how fun it looks.

Make sure your references know that you will be using them as references.,
Use a separate page for your references.,
Start your reference list with a heading.,
Under the heading, add a clear title.,
List your references and their relevant information.,
Format any additional references in a similar way.",How to Include References on a Resume," Do not give out their contact information to potential employers unless they give you their explicit permission.


When asking your references for permission to give out their contact information, make sure that they plan on giving a positive recommendation.
It’s also a good idea to ask your references how they would prefer to be contacted (ex. email, work phone, cell phone, etc.).

, You don't need to have ""References available upon request"" at the bottom of your resume. Employers will assume you have references and will ask for them specifically - usually at the end of the hiring process.


Unless you are applying to be a nanny, personal assistant, or something with a similar level of one-on-one interaction, the main body of your resume should not even mention references.

, The heading should include your name in a clear, bold font. In a slightly smaller font beneath that, you should include your address, phone number, and email. For aesthetic reasons, you can align your contact information to the opposite corner, as below.


You may also want to add a line underneath the heading in order to clearly separate it from the rest of the document. If you include a line, choose one that is simple and elegant.
For a more cohesive, professional look, maintain the same style and formatting that you used in your resume.

, The title should be in a slightly larger font - about the same size as your name is in the header.


Choose a simple, clear title that reflects the content of the page. ""Professional References for (Your Name)"" is a good example.

, There are no hard rules for what order to list your references. It can be handy to list your ""best"" references first - that is, references that are extremely positive and that have worked with you for the longest.


Begin your reference list by listing the name of the first reference in bold. In the line beneath that, write their relationship to you and the company you both worked at.
Include the work address beneath that – provided that they still work at the company where you both worked together; If they do not, leave the work address out and remember to check to make sure that your contact information is current.
If your reference has agreed to be contacted by phone, list the phone number next. Remember to indicate whether the number is for a work phone or cell phone.
If your reference has agreed to be contacted by email, include the e-mail last (as email is less personal than a phone call).

, If you have experience in multiple fields of work, breaking your reference list into several subsections, one for each field, will make the page easier to read for your employer.


Keep in mind that references that you gained while working in a field of work that differs greatly from the one you are applying for shouldn't be listed.

Put the salary history at the bottom.,
Know it gives you less to bargain with.,
Be smart about including it.,
Look for full disclosure requirements.,
Don't make a separate sheet.",How to Include Salary History on Resume," You don't need to include the exact amount you made at every job. Instead, you can create a general range for your last couple of jobs, rounded to the nearest 5,000 or 10,000.For instance, if you made $34,500, $46,000, and $51,000 in your last three jobs, you could write, ""I have made $35,000 to $50,000 in my last three jobs."";
, Some companies will check up with past employers to see what you actually made. Therefore, you should tell the truth about what you made., Just like your history, you should make your requirement a range, too. A $10,000 range is usually a good bet. Try placing what you want to make in the middle. For example, if you want to make $50,000, you could say your requirement is $45,000 to $55,000. However, make sure you are actually willing to accept the lower end before putting it on your resume.When create a salary requirement, look at job listings that have salaries on them in your industry; look for similar level positions with your education and experience. That process will help give you an idea of a range, if you don't already know. You can also use salary surveys to help you. Don't forget, salaries vary by location, as cost of living will make salaries higher in some areas than in others. One reason to look for positions similar to your education and experience is that you can ask for more money if you have more experience or more education than other candidates. For example, if you have a master's degree, you can ask for more money than if you have a bachelor's degree.
Don't add benefits and bonuses into the salary. The salary requirement range should be just your base salary., You can put the salary history and requirement on the cover letter or the resume. However, you don't need it in both places. Just pick one or the other. Most advisors recommend including the salary history in a statement in your cover letter rather than on your resume.In your cover letter, include it near the end of your letter.
On the resume, you can add it as a section under your experience.

, You don't want to imply that your salary range is set in stone, especially if you are willing to take a little less in return for better benefits. Therefore, you need to state that the range you gave is flexible., You do want to be flexible on the salary, but you want to be compensated well. Therefore, you can also include a note about benefits. For instance, you could say, ""I am flexible in my salary range, especially if I am compensated well with other benefits."", Add your salary history to the bottom of your resume. Make it its own section titled ""Salary History."" Make a bullet point underneath, and put in your range. You can add ""(negotiable)"" in parentheses after your range.

, If the employer doesn't know what you make before you come in, you can barter back and forth on your salary. However, if the person who looks at your resume thinks you expect a certain salary, she may not call you in if it's too high, and if it's lower than the company was planning on giving out, you may not get all the money you deserve because you've already named your price.Essentially, you want to sell them on your services and skills before you tell them how much you want them to pay you., Really, the only time you need to include a salary history or requirement is when the company specifically requests it. You can leave it off even when the company asks, but you may not get an interview then. However, if it's not requested, don't add it.

, Some companies may expect you to give your exact salary for each job you've had. Usually, they will note this requirement in the job description. Other business advisers suggest that this approach may be the best anyway, since you are providing exactly the required information.


When using this approach, you can show how your salary has increased for each job by putting a starting salary and an ending salary. That way, you show your salary progression., If you include your salary range and requirement on a separate sheet, you draw attention to it. Incorporating it into your resume or cover letter makes it just one more part of your whole package."

Other individuals, such as the original writers of this article will tell you If you have an Objective section, delete it. It rarely helps and can easily hurt you by needlessly pigeonholing you. Thus, you, the job applicant need to decide if you should have an objectives section. If you do have such a section, please be 100% sure that the section clearly maps your skills and experiences to the employers needs. A section simply stating: Seeking entry level position where I can learn... will not help you.

, Hiring managers will usually skip it because they're more interested in seeing your skills in context, which is in the bullet points of your Experience section.

, If you're a recent graduate without extensive work experience, you should plan to put it at the top. If you have had more than one career relevant professional position, you need to consider the relative importance of your job experience vs. your academic experience in deciding where to place the Education section. If applying for an academic job, the Education section should, most likely, always remain at the top of your resume.

, Extraneous information will divert attention from the heart of your resume. Be objective when deciding what information is truly relevant to the hiring manager. 1-2 pages is a great target for many non-academic resumes.

, Bullet descriptions for your current job should be in the present tense (unless it's describing a completed project) and descriptions for past jobs should be in the past tense.

, Do not bold one job title and italicize another. Do not italicize one former employer's name and underline it for another. Pick a single style for each element and stick with it. If you make changes, check to make sure the changes are done consistently across the board.

, For example, Garamond is a crisper, more refined font than Times New Roman. Also, make certain to choose a font that most PCs and Macs will have installed. See this list of fonts common to most PCs and Macs . TIP: If you choose an uncommon font, you can save your file as a PDF and embed that font in the PDF document. You should also choose your font based on how your resume will be presented; sans serif fonts like Arial are best for viewing a resume on a monitor, where serif fonts like Garamond look better when printed on paper.

, Studies have shown that maximum reading comprehension is attained when spacing is set at around 1.15x of the font size. For example, an 11 point font should have 13 point spacing. TIP: To automatically adjust line spacing in MS Word, select the text you want to adjust, then go to Format > Paragraph... Then, in the Paragraph window, change 'Line Spacing:' to 'Multiple' and then set 'At:' to 1.15 (you can tweak this number a bit if you are having trouble fitting a resume onto 1 or 2 pages). This method will give you perfect spacing regardless of what font size you choose.

, Many potential employers require that your resume and cover letter be emailed or uploaded in PDF format. PDF stands for Portable Document Format; this type of document is widely requested because it maintains its appearance both on-screen (of nearly any computer) and in print. Documents may be saved in PDF format from many editors including Microsoft word. One might also buy Adobe Acrobat software or other conversion software such as Tweak Word To PDF 3.0. To start the conversion, you can either from the converter or from the file by the button.

A box will appear with the employer's preferred method of contact and the link to an ""@job.craigslist.org"" email address that has been generated specifically for this post (e.g. 96qw4-4936276763@job.craigslist.org). Copy and paste this address into your own email client. The Craigslist system will relay your email to the employer.
To copy the employer's email address, highlight the text with your cursor and right-click to summon a list of options. Click ""Copy"".

, Click ""Compose"" or ""New Email"" to begin a new email.

, To paste, right-click in the ""to"" field and select ""Paste"".


Double- and triple-check that the email address is correct. You may not be considered for the position if the employer does not receive your resume.

, This is important-- it is the first thing that your potential will see, so it must be both eye-catching and to-the-point.


If you are applying for a specific position, name it in the subject line. For example: ""Editorial Internship"", or ""Delivery Driver"".
If you have already been in contact with the hiring manager and they have just asked for your resume, include your full name and the word ""resume"" in the subject line. For example: ""Jack Johnson's Resume"", or ""Jack Johnson Resume"".

, Some employers will specifically ask that you paste your resume into the body of your email, and some employers will specifically ask that you attach your resume. When in doubt, attach the resume so that the employer can easily download, view, and share the document.


To attach: Locate the ""Attach"" button on your email interface-- the icon may resemble a paper clip. When you click ""Attach"", you will be prompted to select the correct file from your computer. Locate your resume document and double-click it to attach it to the email. The recipient of the email will now be able to download this version of the document onto their own computer.
To copy-and-paste: Highlight the text of your resume document. Right-click and select ""Copy"". Now, right-click in the body of the email, and select ""Paste"". You should keep your resume at the end of your email, as if it were an attachment.

, Be polite and concise. Explain who you are, why you are emailing this person, and why you want the job.


See the sample email at the bottom of Step 2.
Gauge the tone of the job posting. If it is very formal, then your email should be very formal. If the tone is casual, then it is okay to relax a bit. If you are not sure, use a formal and respectful tone.
Personalize your email. If you are excited about the job, then say so. If you have any unique skills or experience that make you stand out from the crowd, make sure to mention them. An employer will be more likely to remember you if you impress them with your passion.
If you are applying for a specific position, then say so. If you are only inquiring about the sorts of positions that are available, say so.

, List a phone number at which you can be reached during the day, and an email address that you check frequently.


The world's strongest resume is useless if an employer cannot get in touch with you.

, If possible, have a friend or a family member read over what you have written.


Look out for spelling and grammar mistakes. Many email clients mark mistakes using a squiggly red underscore line, but you may also consider copying and pasting the text of your email into Microsoft Word or another word processor. Microsoft Word features a ""Spelling and Grammar"" button in the ""Review"" toolbar (or the ""Edit"" toolbar, for Word 2003 and earlier) that will spell-check your entire document.
Make sure that you have attached your resume!
Double-check the recipient (""To:"") address of your email. Cross-reference this address with the address that you found in the job posting. Make sure that you have used the right suffix-- that you haven't typed "".com"" instead of "".org"", or vice versa.

,


If you sent the email to the wrong address, do not worry. Find the right address, repeat the steps above, and send the email again.

, Your potential employer may be dealing with a flood of emails from job applicants, and he or she may not respond immediately.

, If you don't hear back from the employer within a week or so, do not be afraid to send your resume again. Your email may have fallen through the cracks, and this does not necessarily mean that you will not be considered for the position


This time, write a polite note explaining why you are sending the resume again. See the example below.
If you send a follow-up email and you still do not hear back from the employer, feel free to keep trying- but do not count on a response. Move on and consider other employment opportunities.

, When the employer responds to your email, he or she may ask for more information-- you may need to explain your past experience, or you may be called upon to fill out an application.


When this happens, respond politely and promptly. This will demonstrate that you are easy to work with and that you are truly excited about the position.

, While you are waiting for a response, keep looking around for jobs that interest you, and continue to send out your resume. You can always turn down one interested employer for another-- but you can never have too many options.

Be patient.",How to Create Your Acting Resume," This is your introduction to the world of directors and talent agencies. It's what they'll refer to when reviewing potential fits for a role. Whether you are working as an amateur at the local level, or going for the lights of Broadway, it pays to have your head shot done professionally.


Black and white, or color? Color is the norm, but talk to a local agency and see what is best-received in your area.
Change your photo if your appearance dramatically alters.;
, An acting resume is completely different from a business one. Don't try to make your acting skills fit into a business type resume. Know the difference and proceed accordingly.


Your professional name. This may be your stage name, or your real name. This is how you will be known in the industry, so pick one and stick with it.
Union affiliations, if any. This is important. If you are in a union, you will not be able to work as an amateur.
Your contact information. This must be current and accurate if you want to have people reach you.
Your parts. List the roles you've played in movies, TV, and theatre. If they're extensive, include the most relevant ones on the page: where they were performed and in what category (industrial film, advertisement, stage, dramatic film, etc.).

Doing a secondary role for an important venue is better than doing community theatre leads. Training credentials don't hurt, but they aren't terribly important for certain venues, like voice-over work.


List any professional training you may have taken, including acting, voice, improv, dialects (accents), and physicals skills such as dance, acrobatics, or boxing.
List all skills. Anything you can do that might come to bear in the world of acting should be here. That includes such things as dancing well, or being able to throw knives at a target blindfolded. You may be able to gain or lose weight for a role quickly. You might be able to sing the alphabet backwards while balancing on a plate—include it! You want to put anything that makes you unique.
Your personal information, including your age (required if you are a minor); your height to the nearest inch, without shoes; and weight to the nearest 5 lbs.

Include your hair and eye color as well, even if you are including a color head shot. The head shot may become separated from your resume, or the director might be color blind. Whatever the case may be, having that spelled out eliminates guesswork.



,


Use a clean design and legible, professional fonts. Times and Helvetica are always safe choices. Mistral or Comic Sans, not so much.
Do not submit a five-page resume with everything you've ever done. Like any hiring executive, they want to see the relevant information right away, and if they like what they see, they'll call you to find out more.
Try to keep your resume to one page if at all possible. Don't go over two pages.

, If you are seeking a role on the stage, put your stage experience first. If you are seeking a role in television, put the television category first. Update it each time you have new experience to add.

,, Realize that the selection process can be very opaque. A ""look"" can trump all other considerations, as long as you don't come off being brain dead or an ego-maniac, like for a commercial. Sometimes the auditioners don't know what they want and will even use what you invent in auditions, without necessarily casting you.


It's up for debate whether a stellar resume will get you far in the beginning. These people are going through tons of these things and frequently. They are looking for competence, professionalism, and some unknown quality that matches their particular project. The format and selections of your credits and training is the last thing on their minds.

"
Provide identifying information.,
Include a headline or title.,
Add three to five essential or unique skills.,
Create a summary statement.,
List skills and core competencies.,
Remember to list both your hard skills and your soft skills.,
Make a heading called “Professional Experience” or “Relevant Experience”.,
Create a section for “Education, Certifications & Training”.,
Include additional sections when relevant.",How to Format a Resume1," Within your header you must include personal information like your name and phone number. Place this information into a header so that it appears on all of the pages of your resume (if you have more than one page). You should include:


Your name.
Address.
Phone number.
Email.
Link to social media profile, website, or blog (optional).;
, The first thing a reader should recognize after your identity yourself is the headline or title of your resume. Consider using the title of the position you are applying for as your headline and write it in all caps. Make it a larger sized font than the rest of the resume and consider making it bold. If you have not previously held this same title at a previous job, you can write “Qualifications for” above your headline. This allows your resume to stand out by speaking directly about your intentions to prove your qualifications for the position. Examples are:


MARKETING MANAGER
Or: Qualifications for MARKETING MANAGER

, Directly under your headline, write several essential skills that you possess that are needed to do the job you are applying for successfully. Separate each skill by using a “ / “. You can determine which essential skills to add here by evaluating your skill sets and reading over the job description to choose the most important qualifications. If you possess an essential skill that is needed to do the job successfully, add it here. For example:


Headline: MARKETING MANAGER
Directly under your headline: Strategic Marketing / Social Media Marketing / Search Engine Optimization

, After your headline and essential skills, you should write a short paragraph (called a summary statement) that briefly highlights your skills and experience. This section should be three to five sentences long and should highlight your most relevant skills, experience and accomplishments in relation to the job you are applying for. Be sure to use short, effective sentences when writing this section to tell the reader who you are and what you are capable of. Consider including the following:


A statement expressing who you are and your best soft skills that are relevant and essential such as “Motivated and results oriented”.
Your years of experience, key titles, industries and sectors. For example, “Sales Associate with over 5 years of experience in sales for the software industry”.
Notable awards and recognitions. For example, “Awarded Top Sales Associate in the western region”.
State education that is either of graduate level or above (such as MBA) and certifications that are essential or preferred by the employer (such as Six Sigma Black Belt).
Cite key accomplishments that are most relevant. For example, “Contributed to yearly sales growth of 25% year over year”.

, Below your summary statement, you should include a list of skills you possess that the position you are applying for also requires. Just as you have already listed a few essential skills in the beginning of your resume, you need to expand on this list by choosing the most relevant skills and qualifications needed to do the job that you hope to be hired for. Your skills section must:


Use bullet format with multiple columns. Choose professional looking bullets that go with your resume template. Examples of professional bullets are,,, , or -. So as to not have a long list of bullets on your first page, use 2 or 3 columns to keep your resume length shorter.
List skills using only one to three words for each. This will keep each skill easy to read and allow the reader to quickly scan through.
Contain no more than 15 skills. Although the length of someone’s skills list varies from job to job and person to person, it is suggested to keep this list from getting out of control. The more skills you add, the more likely the reader will naturally pass over some listed skills.

, Hard skills are skills that can be taught in order to do the job successfully. Soft skills are personal traits or attributes that can affect a person’s ability to perform tasks.


Examples of hard skills: lead generation and market research.
Examples of soft skills: problem solving and interpersonal skills.

, You should use the term “Professional Experience” when your career path thus far coincides with what you are applying for. You can use the term “Relevant Experience” if you are a recent graduate and using your education and projects as a way to show your ability to do the job. When listing your experience, use reverse chronological order with the most recent position listed first. It is also recommended to list only jobs held within the past 10 years. For each position listed try to include the following:


Write the name of the company, its location and dates you have worked there such as: ABC Company – New York, NY. June 2006 - Present
State your title held in bold on the line below such as Sales Associate.
Add a brief description below your title. The description should provide a general idea of your responsibilities you had at the job.
Highlight your accomplishments with a bulleted list of the most relevant information that will be appealing to the recruiter or hiring manager for the job you are applying for.

, You must list all relevant education completed or currently working on beyond high school. Do not add high school to your resume unless you are currently in high school. If you have completed or are enrolled in certification or training courses from a professional organization, include these in this section as well. When creating your heading only add the words that best suit you.


For example, if you have a college degree and completed a professional training course, but are not certified in anything, your title should read “Education & Training”. Just as with writing your experience section, use the following format:
Write the name of the university or company and its location such as: Santa Clara University—Santa Clara, CA.
On next line write the degree, course name or certification followed by the date of completion: Bachelors in Science Business Administration, May 2000.

, Although the following sections listed are not essential for every resume, some sections may need to be included in yours. Whether or not these sections are relevant will be determined by the type of position you are seeking and your experience. Again, if the job description mentions it and you have the experience, add it to your resume! These sections could include:


Awards. Awards that are significant to show your accomplishments such as achieving the President’s list, can be listed in this separate section.
Presentations. If you are applying for a job that requires you to be an expert on a certain subject or one of your main tasks will be presenting to other, add your experience with presentations in this section.
Publications. Add this section if you are considered an expert and have published articles or other documents on a subject which is key for the position.
Languages. Only add this section if you speak, read and/or write another language other than your native language and the position requires it.
Affiliations. Noting your professional affiliations and memberships shows your dedication to your career.
Community Involvement. It may be good to list any volunteer experience that shows you like to give back and describes your interests. This is especially true if you are applying for a job at a company that is involved in the community.

Read each job posting carefully.,
Highlight the job duties and desired qualifications.,
Think about relevant qualifications not listed in the advertisement.,
Tailor your resume to the particular job.,
Include only relevant information.,
Exclude any information that is clearly not relevant.,
Eliminate “fluff.” By keeping your sentences concise, you will be able to create more impact.,
Leave out part-time or irrelevant work.,
Consider eliminating the “objective” section.,
Focus on the last ten years.,
Remove reasons for leaving a job.,
Keep references in a separate document.",How to Decide What to Leave Off Your Resume," Every posting will provide specific information about the company, the job, and the kind of candidate the employer is seeking. If you pay attention, the job description and the language used to describe ideal candidates will help you determine what to emphasize on your resume.


For example, a job ad may say that a particular company is looking for “an IT Project Manager with strong networking experience.” In this case, you would know to include whatever information reveals your ability to do that job successfully. You’d highlight relevant past experience (“worked with a team to improve networking capabilities”) and leave off irrelevant accomplishments (“top insurance sales agent”).;
, As you read the job posting, take the time to highlight the duties specific to the job and the qualifications that the company wants applicants to possess. You’ll then know to include any matching experience and qualifications you may have.


For example, if the job posting asks for applicants with “at least 3 years of IT Project Management experience,” highlight that information. If you have, say, 5 years experience in that area, be sure to include it on your resume.

, Don’t assume that the list of required skills and experience is an exhaustive one. Consider what other qualifications might be relevant to the job, so that you can include those as well. This might involve reading between the lines a bit or doing some research on a particular company or job.

, You should not send identical resumes out to all of your potential employers. Rather, using the information you’ve gleaned from reading each posting and highlighting relevant qualifications, you should construct a resume tailored to each job.

, Based on your review of the job posting, include any information that will present you as the right candidate for the job.

, Information that does not add value to your candidacy for a particular job does not belong on your resume.


If, for example, you are applying for a job as an IT Project Manager, you can feel confident that the recruiter or hiring manager does not care if you are an investor in two restaurants or if you sometimes freelance as a sales consultant.

, Your reader will understand your qualifications immediately, and your resume won’t seem overly long or cumbersome.


Avoid excess verbiage whenever possible. Consider, for example, the following sentence: “Was able to manage the operations of large teams of 15 and 20 to successfully work on complex projects.” You could make this sentence shorter and more effective by revising: “Successfully managed teams of up to 20 to complete complex projects.”

, Most recruiters and hiring managers will not care that you worked three nights a week delivering pizzas. Do not include every way that you ever earned a paycheck.

, Standard resumes used to feature a short description of your career objective, but this practice is now outdated. Your resume should simply provide the information a potential employer needs and wants.

, When you go back beyond ten years, even if your jobs were relevant, your resume will become unnecessarily lengthy. Besides, much may have changed in that particular industry and job role. To look current, focus more on the present.


If you held a job, say, seven years ago, but you started working there fourteen years ago, go ahead and include it. You want accurate dates.

, In general, you do not need to include your reasons for leaving each job on your resume. Adding this information will only add excess bulk to your resume while opening you up to questions you might feel uncomfortable answering. Don’t write that you quit or that you were fired or asked to resign, and certainly don’t feel the need to say that you were in prison or institutionalized.


The main exception to this rule is if you have a reasonable explanation for a major gap in your employment. In this case, it is fine to write that you had to leave your job to care for a family member, go back to school, or recuperate after a major illness or injury.

, Do not include a list of references on the resume itself. Have an updated list of references ready to go, but wait until a potential employer requests them.


Many people include the line “References available upon request” on their resumes, but this is no longer considered necessary. Employers know that you will provide references when requested.

Choose appropriate paper size.,
Format your margins.,
Select your font and font size.,
Set spacing.,
Choose a border to break up sections.,
Add page numbers if your resume is longer than one page.",How to Format a Resume2," Most likely the appropriate paper size will be set as default in whichever program you use. The two most likely paper sizes are 8.5” by 11” used in North America and A4 used in most of Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania and South America.


If you are applying for a job outside of your country, it is important to verify which paper size in standard. If you are using Microsoft Word you can change your paper size under the “Page Layout” tab.

, Next, you must set your margins. Your margin default may be set to 1”, but you can reduce this size to as little as .25”.


When choosing margins smaller than 1”, it is important to be sure all information will be printed on the page.

, Simple and easily readable fonts are a good choice for a resume. The most recommended fonts to choose from are Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman or Verdana. Once you have chosen your font, you must keep it the same throughout your resume. It is also important to choose a font size that is not too small to read or too big and takes up unnecessary space.


Try to choose a font size that is between 10 and 12 point (pt) for the main parts of your resume and 14 or 16 pt for your name and resume title. Using different font sizes to distinguish titles and headings will help the reader recognize the different parts of your resume. For example the heading “Education” can be 1 to 2 pts larger than the information provided under that heading.

, While still under the “Page Layout” tab, you can adjust your spacing throughout your resume by selecting a section of your resume and adjusting the “Before” and “After” spacing. Try to set the spacing between lines in the same paragraph or between bullet points to single or 0 pt but no more than 1.5.


For spacing between sections or headings, it is recommended to stay between 4 and 8 pt so the section breaks and headings are easily noticeable.

, When defining your sections and headers, placing a boarder in that area will further help each section stand out. Borders can be chosen to go either above, below or around the heading (whichever you feel looks best). There are also multiple styles, colors, and thickness of lines to choose from. Feel free to try a few out before committing.


Remember to use the same border throughout your resume.

, It is important to add page numbers to your resume so the recruiter or hiring manager knows they are looking at the full document. Since you will have a header on top of the page with your personal information, the page number will stand out well in a footer section.


There are various ways to note the page number and you can feel free to choose one that fits your personal preferences. However, it is recommended that you specify how many pages there are total, for instance “Page 1 of 3”.

Write down what bothers you about teaching.,
Make a list of all of the things you enjoy about teaching.,
Identify the secondary advantages.,
Reflect on how your attitude towards teaching has changed.,
Use your lists to help you identify ways to improve your situation.",How to Love Teaching1," If you have been feeling dissatisfied with your job lately, then you might find it helpful to identify what is causing you to feel this way. Try making a list of everything that you dislike about your teaching job. Include small and big things on your list.


For example, you might list something like having to deal with a particular student’s parent, which might only happen a few times every month, or something like grading, which is a more regular part of your job.
Try ranking the items on your list from most frustrating to least frustrating by placing numbers next to them. For example, if grading is the most frustrating part of your job, then you could place the number 1 next to it.;
, After you have created your list of what you do not like about teaching, make a second list about what you do like. Making this list can help you to see if the positive aspects of your job are outweighing the negative aspects. It can also help you to identify things that might make teaching more enjoyable for you.Include minor and major things on this list as well. For example, you might include something small, such as seeing a student’s face light up when he or she grasps a new concept. Or, you might include something that you do every day, like reading aloud to your students.
You might even rank this list as well to get an idea of what aspects of teaching are the most enjoyable for you. That way, you can look for ways to incorporate more of these enjoyable activities.

, You may also enjoy some secondary benefits of teaching that are making the job a positive thing for you. Secondary benefits are those that are related to your job, but that are not part of teaching specifically. Make a third list where you identify and list all of the secondary benefits that you enjoy because of working as a teacher.Include anything that you see as a secondary benefit of teaching. These may include things like great coworkers, a good healthcare plan, and summers off.

, Sometimes something will change in a workplace or in your personal life that can affect the way that you feel about your job. If you have been teaching for a while, then it might be helpful to look at what has changed recently and consider whether that might be affecting the way you feel about your job.For example, you might have recently had a baby and feel sad about not being able to spend as much time with the baby as you’d like. Or, you might have switched to a different grade level and be having a hard time adjusting to the differences in your older or younger students.
Note anything that has changed since you stopped enjoying teaching. This may help you determine what you can do to improve your situation.

, All of the things you have listed about what you love, hate, and appreciate about teaching may help you to find a way to love your job again. Review the lists and pay special attention to the items that are most and least enjoyable to you. Try to think of ways that you can use this information to appreciate your job more.


For example, if you identified that you enjoy reading aloud to your students, then you might try to incorporate more of this into your teaching.
If you identified that you dislike speaking with a certain student’s parent, then you might talk with your supervisor about the problems you have been having and ask for advice on dealing with the parent.

Engage more with your coworkers.,
Maintain a positive attitude for your students.,
Note the impact you are having on your students.,
Try to keep an open mind when you are criticized.,
Find sources of inspiration.,
Avoid negative discussions about teaching.",How to Love Teaching2," Having a positive work environment can also make a big difference in the way that you feel about your job. If you are not too close with your coworkers, then you might consider spending more time getting to know them. Some things you can do to get to know your coworkers better include:Attending social functions, such as meeting up with other teachers for happy hour or going to a barbeque at someone’s house.
Eating lunch with other teachers in the teacher’s lounge instead of alone in your classroom.
Asking other teachers questions about their lives, interests, and teaching.

, Your students will look to you each day to set the tone in the classroom. One way to help keep your students in good spirits is to set a positive tone for the class every day. Some things you can try include:Putting an inspirational quote on the board.
Telling a joke for the day.
Greeting each of your students with a smile when he or she enters your class in the morning.

, Sometimes you might feel like you are not making a difference, which may get you feeling down about teaching. To help yourself stay positive, try making a list of all of the ways that you are having an impact on your students’ lives. Some things that you might list include:Being a source of encouragement for a child whose parents rarely provide any encouragement.
Teaching vital skills to students that will help them to find jobs and succeed in life.
Providing a positive, safe space where students can share honestly and be themselves., All teachers have to be evaluated throughout their careers. These evaluations are meant to help you find ways to improve and be the best teacher you can be. Try to stay open minded when you are criticized or advised to change something about your teaching.Even if you are an experienced teacher, try to use your evaluations as opportunities to broaden your knowledge and become even more experienced.
For example, if you are criticized for going too quickly when you lecture about something, then you might look into ways to pace yourself better keeping in mind that this will benefit your students.

, If you are down on your job, then you might also find it helpful to seek out daily sources of inspiration. Try setting aside 10 to 15 minutes every day before you start your day to get inspired.For example, you might read an inspirational quote every morning, journal about someone you admire and whose behavior you would like to model through your teaching, or just watch a video online that inspires you.

, While it is fine to want to vent now and then, if you find that you are surrounded by negative discussions of teaching, then this could be wearing on you.To stay positive about your job, it is important to focus on the positives and avoid conversations that are just about criticizing your profession.


If a conversation becomes negative, then try changing the subject. Try saying something like, “Yeah, that sucks. Oh, I just remembered. Did you see the local news last night? There was a really cool story about one of our students!”
If a coworker is always complaining or talking negatively about teaching, then you might want to try to distance yourself from him or her. Try eating lunch with a different group or go for a walk on your lunch breaks instead.

Look for ways to reduce the stress of grading.,
Plan ahead.,
Give yourself a break.,
Collaborate with other teachers in your subject area.,
Say no if you do not have time for something.",How to Love Teaching3," Grading can be a stressful part of teaching, especially if you teach English or another subject where you are evaluating student writing. You might feel obligated to provide extensive feedback to help your students, or you might simply feel panic when you get a large stack of papers on your desk.Some things you might do to reduce your stress about grading include:


Setting a limit on how much time you can spend on each paper, such as 7 to 10 minutes.
Grading in a pleasant environment, such as at a coffee shop, while listening to some relaxing music, or while sitting outside.
Taking frequent breaks, such as 5 to 10 minutes every hour.

, Being well-organized can also help you to manage your workload and reduce your job stress. You can do this by keeping track of your responsibilities, appointments, and other important information in a planner.You might also plan ahead by getting as much work done as possible in advance. For example, instead of writing one lesson plan, you might write three to get a jump on a new unit. Instead of postponing some recordkeeping for the weekend, do it right away so that you can enjoy your weekend instead.

, Taking breaks is essential to staying sane in any job, but teachers often tend to bring their work home with them. Some things you can do to ensure that you get regular breaks include:Setting aside at least one weeknight and one weekend day every week where you do not bring any work home with you.
Taking your personal days, sick days, and vacation days as needed.
Making the most of your summer vacations and doing as little work as possible for the coming school year.

, Working with another teacher in your subject area can also help to reduce your workload. By finding out what another teacher has used with success in his or her classroom, you may be able to save yourself the time and hassle of trying to come up with something out of thin air.If your school has a mentorship program, then take advantage of it. Get to know someone who has more experience than you to get resources and lesson plans that you can use in your teaching.
You might also just ask another teacher if he or she would be interested in meeting to swap teaching ideas sometime. You might be as helpful to this other teacher as he or she is to you.

, Another important part of managing your stress is knowing when to say no. You may be asked to help out with all sorts of special projects and events, but it is not possible for you to do it all. If taking on these obligations stresses you out, then say no for a while.Try saying something simple like, “I’m sorry, but I can’t help you with that. I am just too busy this week.”
Avoid listing multiple excuses or trying to explain yourself. Just be straightforward and say no.

Ensure that your classroom setup allows for collaboration.,
Aim to give students adequate access to efficacious tools.,
Use technology to its full potential.,
Assign group projects.,
Remember that you are not just a teacher; you are the main resource.,
Focus on integral life techniques to be taught with projects.,
Establish an association to the outside world with projects.,
When it comes to the final product, give students the opportunity to be imaginative.",How to Incorporate Project Based Learning Into the Classroom," This is especially essential if you plan a group project, as the group members should be close enough to one another in order to work together effectively. Set up spaces in which everyone can see and hear one another, such as a couch or a large table, and refrain from setting up multiple desks that all face a whiteboard.;
, Project-based learning takes much more than pencil and paper. In order to complete a quality project, is necessary for project-based learners to access a variety of supplies. Effective tools include research tools, such as encyclopedias and electronic devices, that project-based learners could use for their research and

, Most regular classrooms do not use technology, but technology can be an extremely powerful tool in project-based learning, as the Internet is a research tool and there are many applications used to produce high-quality components of a project.


For example, if the project requires the collection and analysis of data, have your students use Numbers or Excel to create spreadsheets and analyze data. If you choose to require a video, iMovie is an effective application in creating and editing videos.
Keep in mind that although technology can be a beneficial learning tool, it can also divert students from the learning experience. Advise your students on how to prevent technology from becoming a distraction. For example, it is not a good idea to install applications that have no educational value, such as games.

, It is important for everyone to be independent learners, but that can be difficult when people are working on components that they are not very ""expert"" at producing. There will most likely be peers that can work on those components.


Encourage students to collaborate and assign specific roles to each other. This will help with communication skills, as well as team collaboration.

, You are there to help your students complete high-quality projects. Explain the expectations of the project, as well as the components and deadlines. Another responsibility that you will have is to make sure that your students have access to necessary items and resources.


Keep in mind that in regular classrooms, teachers are the leaders. They are required to go along with a certain curriculum. In most PBL classrooms, however, students are the main leaders; they choose what they want to learn about, build up on necessary life skills, and take responsibility for their own learning.

, This can be more effective that assigning particular project topics, since students are restricted in their capability of being imaginative when they complete projects on specific topics. For example, you could have students focus on a project in which they apply problem-solving skills (where the students would need to choose a project in which applying problem-solving skills is necessary, such as having a student act as a detective to solve a mystery, and explain how he or she solved the mystery).

, Helping the world is a very beneficial act that all students need to learn. For example, you might want to try having students take on different roles to organize a fundraiser that gives the school an advantage, or perhaps even a fundraiser in which all proceeds go to a local charity. This is an example of an integral life skill.

z`, A poster is not too original, and it may be considered overused, so it is advisable to refrain from having your students create a poster board. Think outside the box - perhaps a short movie, magazine or spreadsheet (preferably produced with the use of technology) would be a more imaginative final product and encourage people to enjoy the project presentations.

Play selection.,
Build interest by building on prior knowledge and experience.,
Integrate pop culture whenever possible.,
Begin Reading.,
""Translate."",
Begin viewing.,
Get your students up and moving.,
Assess Learning.",How to Get the Entire Class Engaged in Reading a Play," Maybe you are in a school system that lets you choose your texts. If this is the case, try to make the first play you introduce students to one that contains action sequences and themes such as unrequited love, jealousy, or simply blatant comedy. This will tend to draw in interest starting at your introduction. If, like many others, you work in a school system where you are told what plays to teach, then you will have to work with what you are given. For the rest of this article, let's assume that you did not get to pick the play. Let's assume that you were assigned to teach ""Hamlet."" ""NOOOO!"" scream your students, ""I HATE Shakespeare!"" Do not lose hope.;
, This step should happen even before you have passed out the copies of the play. Start by asking the class, quite simply, ""Has anyone ever heard of the play 'Hamlet'? What do you know about it?"" You might get responses ranging from ""Um...no."" to ""Isn't that the one where they go all 'Lion King' and Simba kills Scar except with a sword?"" to ""Ah, yes, Ms. Smith. I know it well. Written in 1601, the play was not originally published until 1603. William Shakespeare utilized source material from the ""Histoires Tragiques"" of famous French writer Francois de Belleforest. Would you like me to recite the first act?"" It takes all kinds to make a classroom. Nevertheless, record the relevant facts that they know concerning the author, plot, and context on a poster that will hang in the room as you read the play.

, A great way to warm students up to an intimidating work is to relate it to something they are familiar with to draw connections. A good example is ""The Lion King."" Many teachers hesitate to do this, especially in a high school class, for fear of insulting their students with childish material. However, students appreciate the mental break, and the reminder of a childhood treasure they might have forgotten. Do not devote an entire class period to a ""Lion King"" screening party, but show clips of key scenes so that they see the course of action:Old King is murdered...New King takes over...Son of Old King leaves...New King is Bad...Son returns...Avenges his father. Make sure you map out the basic plot line of ""The Lion King"" with students in a way that includes these key events. Tell them to keep these in mind as they read ""Hamlet,"" because things will start to feel familiar.

, For a playwright like Shakespeare, try reading as a class when time permits. This way, you can check for understanding with your students, making sure they are able to decipher the difficult language. Remember, never force a student to read in front of his peers unless you are certain that he can. One sure way to turn off any student's excitement about a topic is to force them into public embarrassment. Take volunteers at first for readers. It is better, at least at the beginning, to have in mind students that you know will passionately read the text with feeling. This will aid in the other students understanding and engagement.

, Try doing a group or pairs assignment where students find their favorite passage (20 lines) and ""translate"" it into modern vernacular. Some of your students will be tempted to use the ""No Fear Shakespeare"" books to do this for them. These books are a great tool for students who struggle to understand the language, and it is good to use this kind of aid to avoid needless frustration. However, for this ""translating"" assignment, encourage students to put their aids down and take their best stab at it themselves. They will surprise themselves with how much they can understand.

, Notice this step does not necessarily come at the end of reading the play, but rather is interspersed throughout the process of reading. Plays are meant to be seen, and that when we write them down we are just freezing them until they can be seen again. After you get through the first act with your students, or sooner if you think it would be helpful, show your students a clip of a famous production of ""Hamlet"" up to the point they have read. This will serve as a reward for reading so much, and will help students develop a sense of the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Remember hearing the lines helps students to visualize the metaphors and unusual terminology much better than reading it on paper.

, Fortunately, ""Hamlet"" is a very physical play. Have your students work to block the basic fight scenes and climaxes of the play. Not only will this help them visualize what is occurring, but it will also help them to think about character. How would the character they are playing react to what is happening? Would they be afraid of the fight? Would they be chomping at the bit to get involved? You can use wrapping paper rolls as a safe alternative to actual weapons, but, of course, take your own classroom climate into consideration before making the decision to stage sword fight. If this might prove too stimulating for your class, instead act out an emotional climax, such as a shouting match or a dramatic exit to similar effect. After the reenactment, discuss as a class how it went, and if this helped them make any insights into character, plot, and so forth.

, After you have finished reading the play, make sure you offer a variety of ways for students to show you what they have learned, by working in groups or individually. Perhaps you might have one option be to write a ""deleted scene"" in iambic pentameter. For this assignment, students would write a scene that did not appear in the play, but that might have happened in the story. For example, what if Gertrude ran into Ophelia alone after Ophelia's mental break. How would their conversation have gone? Or what conversations did Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have when they WEREN'T with Hamlet? Anything goes as long as they can justify how it would fit into the world of the play. Another assignment option might be to create a Vine video that each of the characters might have posted. The video would include their REAL reaction to what is going on, versus how they pretend to the other characters. One final example of an assessment option might be to create a ""found poem"" from the lines in the play. Poems are created by cutting lines from the original text and pasting them together to form an entirely new work. The poem would serve as a personal reflection on the play.

Learn your students’ names.,
Greet your students at the door or during the day.,
Take time to socialize with your students.,
Use surveys and presentations to your advantage.,
Listen to your students' thoughts and opinions.",How to Get Your Students to Like You1," Because you're a teacher, students automatically respect you by default. By learning their names and using them on a regular basis, you are showing your students that you care and that you don’t take their respect for granted. This makes them feel good and respect you even more. If you’re not good with names, or if you have a big group, don’t hesitate to pass out blank name tags to each student at the start of class to help yourself out. This will also help students get to know each other, as well.;
, Once you’ve learned your students’ names, use them on a daily basis. If students feel welcomed into your classroom, they’ll want to stay and learn.

, This can happen before or after class or during class breaks. Socializing with students takes time on your part, but it’s a worthwhile investment. From a student's point of view, socializing makes you seem more approachable, less intimidating, and easy to talk to.

, Students will like you if they feel like you want to know who they are. To jump-start the “get to know your students” process, hand out a student survey at the beginning of the term that asks general interest questions.


For younger students and smaller class sizes, invite each student to prepare a short presentation about themselves that they can share with the entire class.

, Students like to be heard and understood, just like teachers do. If you want your students to be engaged, ask questions, and take risks, they need to know that you listen to them and care about what they have to say.


To encourage dialogue from your students, set designated discussion or debate sessions in your class and encourage everyone to speak their mind.
For younger students or smaller classroom sizes, invite students to pick a topic on something they are interested and make it their task to teach you something new.

Complete a master’s level teacher preparation program.,
Register in the TEACH portal.",How to Get a Teaching Job in New York1," Choosing what you wish to teach can make preparing for a teaching job easier. This is in part because there are different requirements you’ll need to meet in order to teach at different levels. Most importantly, decide roughly what age group and subjects you want to teach. Make these sorts of decisions before beginning a teacher training program, especially a program that allows you to take other college course in pursuit of a bachelor’s degree. That way, you can select courses that will prepare you for the classes you hope to teach in the future.Visit the New York State Education Department (NYSED) website for information on what types of teachers are in greatest demand currently. Ensure you have a competitive advantage by preparing to teach these subjects.
Teachers with specializations in bilingual education, business and marketing, technology, and computer programming are commonly in high demand.
You can also supplement your knowledge of certain disciplines by taking specific courses outside of or after your teacher preparation program.;
, Enroll in a teacher preparation program designed to prepare you to become a teacher and earn a bachelor’s degree simultaneously. These programs include traditional courses, as well as experience student teaching.The NYSED provides an Inventory of Registered Programs on their website. Consult this resource to ensure the programs you are considering are accredited by the state of New York.
Reach out to admissions officers at any institutions you are interested with specific requirements for admission or other questions.

, Enroll in a “Transitional B” teaching program if you already have a bachelor’s degree, but did not complete an accredited teacher preparation program. Eligibility for these programs usually requires a 2.5 GPA for your undergraduate degree. Like the traditional pathway, you will also have to pass state specific teaching exams before receiving a recommendation from your program to be certified., If you already have your bachelor’s and want to go to graduate school and become eligible to teach, there are programs that will allow you to do so. These programs, much like alternative teaching programs, will focus on teaching experience, and will provide an accelerated version of the coursework that will prepare you to teach.A master’s program is likely worth your time and effort. Not only are you more likely to be hired, you’ll likely receive better pay to teach.

, This is an online portal managed by the NYSED. You’ll use the TEACH portal to apply for a New York teaching certificate. It’s best to register and familiarize yourself with TEACH while still in your teacher preparation program.Indicate which pathway you’re taking to get accredited. For example, register as a student in an “Approved Teacher Preparation Program"" if this applies to you.
A school official from your program will also use this portal to submit a recommendation on your behalf once you’ve met the program’s requirements.

Allow your students to get to know you.,
Be relaxed in the classroom.,
Share your passion with your students.,
Use your personal creativity to teach in dynamic ways.,
Admit when you’ve made a mistake.",How to Get Your Students to Like You2," Students don’t need you to be something you’re not. You don’t have to be known as the funny teacher or the cool teacher to be liked – just be yourself. This means that you have to allow students to get to know you.Don’t be afraid to open yourself up while you teach – it’s okay to express personal opinions, make jokes, make light of pet peeves, and even comment on your personal life. The more personable you are, the more students will see you and like you for who you are. , Teaching can be daunting, especially in front of a new or very large group of students. It’s natural to be nervous about presenting the material or making a good impression, but don’t let that make you uptight. If you’re on edge, your students will be, too.


If you have trouble relaxing in front of a large group, try starting your class off with a group breathing or stretching exercise. This not only boosts group morale, but it will also help everyone relax and become more comfortable together.

, You’re a teacher for a reason – it’s because you have a passion for it! Be sure to let your students see you smile and enjoy yourself as their teacher and the material you want them to learn. Learning should be fun, so set the tone by showing off your passion for being there.

, No one wants to listen to hours and hours of lectures day after day. Keep learning fun and dynamic by getting creative with your personal style and incorporating different ways of teaching to break-up the monotony. Organize group activities, play relevant videos and podcasts, do experiments, and encourage class discussions, even when you have lots of material to cover.


If you’re worried about students missing important information, you can create study guides or distribute notes with additional information that students can read on their own.

, Everyone makes them. Just because you are the teacher, it doesn’t mean your students expect you to be perfect. Owning your errors will show your students that accountability goes both ways in your classroom. If students feel like there's a double standard, it could cause resentment.

Be an example to your students.,
Be consistent with grading and discipline.,
Believe in your students' ability to succeed.,
Don’t give pop-quizzes.,
Offer extra credit.,
Don’t overwhelm students with homework.,
Don’t intimidate with tests.,
Provide student-satisfaction surveys.",How to Get Your Students to Like You3," As their teacher, your students will naturally look up to you. Be the person you want your students to be in the classroom.This means that you should extend to them the same respect, attention, care, and dedication that you hope to receive in return.


To encourage curiosity, for example, dig deeper into the material you are teaching. Ask open questions that you, yourself, don't know the answer to and encourage your students to help you search for the answers.
To encourage hard work and dedication, assign a class project that you participate in, as well. By working hard alongside them, you will be teaching by example.
To encourage attentiveness, have students take turns in front of the class giving presentations or demonstrations, and then stay alert and engaged. Be sure to ask questions and be generous with praise to show that you really connected with the material being taught.

, It’s okay to be strict or have pet peeves, but only if you’re open about it. Students like to know what to expect. Decide on your grading and classroom-conduct policies before the semester begins, discuss them at the start of class, and enforce the rules. If adjustments are necessary during the term, make them known, so that students are aware of the changes.


You can post rules and grading policies in your classroom or distribute them as handouts at the beginning of a term so that students have them available at all times.
This will also help settle disputes if a student tries to argue with you. Instead of looking like “the bad guy” for enforcing a rule, you can simply refer to a public poster or the handout for diplomatic back-up.

, If students are made to feel smart and capable, they tend to rise to that expectation.Don’t be afraid to set high expectations in your classroom, but be sure to give students the help and the tools they need to meet them. Most importantly, make sure your students know that you have faith in their abilities. , No one likes a pop quiz, as they tend to create both fear and anxiety among students, which is not conducive to learning. Some students may also view them as a threat, which can make learning feel like a punishment.


If you need to motivate your students to do their homework or learn material in a hurry, try offering rewards or prizes for good work. Pop-quizzes provide negative incentive for learning, but rewards or prizes offer positive incentive, which is much more effective. Plus, your students will feel flattered when you acknowledge their accomplishments.

, Students have good days and bad days, just like you. Give your students chances to make up for a bad grade or a bad day. If students make a mistake and aren’t given the opportunity to recover, they won’t have a reason to try. They will also resent you for limiting their chances at success.

, If students are overwhelmed with homework from your class, they will spend more time in class worrying about the homework than they will about learning new material. They will also resent you if your homework begins to heavily interfere with their after-school life.


Be modest with homework assignments and never assign busy work.
If you are going to assign homework, make it meaningful.
Appropriate homework loads will depend on your students' grade level, but make sure they don't go home with homework every single night and try to avoid giving homework on long weekends and Holidays. Not only does it give students a mental health break, but it gives you one, too, because you don't have endless grading!

, Tests are a fact of academic life, and students know this. Administering tests won’t make you less likeable, but be sure to use tests as a positive affirmation of knowledge. You don't want your students to see them as a threat or feel afraid or intimidated by the material you are asking them to learn.


Present tests as stepping blocks, not as traps or trip-ups.

, Throughout the term or semester, offer students the chance to anonymously express their opinions about what they like and don’t like about your class. This makes them feel heard and gives them a chance to help make their classroom experience more enjoyable. It also helps you, as their teacher, to know what you’re doing right and wrong, and how to improve.

Plan your class.,
Create a detailed outline.,
Complete the research.,
Create the presentation.,
Write a handout.,
Include an exercise.,
Get the room ready.,
Get yourself ready.,
Get your materials ready.,
Finish strong.",How to Give a Training Class," It is important to jot down exactly what the objectives are for the training.  What do you want the class to know or do when you are done with the presentation?  What are the most important topics and how much time do you think you'll spend on them?  If you are unsure about this, do some research before you begin writing the objectives.;
, Put your objectives in the order that they should be covered.  It's OK to change the order or even the objectives as you develop.  Sketch out the class in a detailed outline, thinking about images you'd like to include in the presentation, videos you'd like to show, exercises and other elements of the class.  This is your detailed draft. If it needs to be approved, you'll have enough on paper to show a manager, but not so much that you've wasted time developing something that doesn't get used.  Keep in mind that this stage can take considerable time because you have to know the topic to produce a detailed outline.

, If you are not already an expert, now is the time to become one. Don't short change your prep time or you will not be comfortable in the classroom. Know more than you need to know.

, Begin creating your PowerPoint or other presentation.  Check to be sure that you are spending the right amount of time on each objective.  Many presenters take way too long on background information and run out of time for the most important topics.  For example, if you are giving a four hour class on Conflict Management, learning about the theory may be somewhat helpful, but only a short time should be given to that so that the focus can be on the skills needed and the role play practice.

, Be sure to use a style sheet in MS Word or whatever program so that your titles and bullets remain consistent in format.  Create a simple handout, copying slides into the handout that have important information.  Your slides and handout should not be too detailed or the focus will be on reading rather than on you.

, Your content should have a discussion, exercise, video, or some kind of activity about every 15 minutes.  People lose attention when pushed to 20 minutes, and tune out lecture shortly after that.  Add interest to the handout and presentation with short video clips, humorous cartoons, interesting quotes, and exercises.  Have small group discussion to reinforce the material, and quick exercises where people get up and move around to meet others, talking about something related to the content.  Don't neglect breaks every 90 minutes or so.

, Make sure you have all equipment ready and tested.  Have extra copies of your handout.  If you are presenting off site, make sure you have a laptop and a thumb drive with your presentation.  Also, carry a copy of your slide set just in case there is a technical problem and you have to resort to paper.

, Get sleep the night before.  Wake up early and eat a normal breakfast.  Dress so that you'll feel confident.  Don't wear anything that is uncomfortable, including high heels.  Arrive early so you'll have a chance to do a quick review of the material and the room.  Make sure there are enough seats, handouts, extra pens and whatever other supplies are necessary.  Test your mic if you will wear one.  Don't allow people in the room until you are set up and ready... they will want to talk with you and it will stress you that you can't focus on preparation.

,  Your handout should have big, bold notes on it to remind you of what you want to say in that section.  One or two keywords to help you remember a personal story or an interesting quote is all you need.  You won't have time to read long notes while you are talking.  Also, have a copy of the slides printed out so that you can see what slides or exercises are coming up.  Make sure your presentation has been set up to guide you.  For example, put a slide in that says Exercise with an interesting picture related to the topic to help you remember when you will assign an exercise.  As they do an exercise, walk around to check on the class, and then glance at the topics coming up next.  Make rough notes before you give the class on the time you think you should start each main topic so you can pick up the pace or slow it down if you're not hitting the mark.  As you give the presentation, write the actual times for each section in case you have to give the presentation again. (Put your initials on the front cover of your handout so you don't mix it up with the participants' guide as you walk around.)

, Have a fun exercise, short powerful video, or group activity at the end to summarize what was covered.  Finish on an upbeat note.  Let the class know that you'll be available if they have questions after the presentation.  Thank the group and tell them they were a great class!

Ensure that the child can see the 5 music lines, with 4 spaces in between.,
Check to see whether the child can remember the 5 line names, immediately, a week later, and so on.,
Introduce the spaces.,
Demonstrate the naming of lines and spaces by pointing with the fore-finger of your other hand, and have the child copy you - always working from bottom up.,
Practice the naming of notes by pointing at a finger, or finger space.,
All other activities will reinforce this foundation, and make take several weeks.,
As well as flashcard games, you could spell out simple words using only letters A - G, such as BAG, BEE, DAD, etc.,
In conjunction with the pitch, you also need to teach rhythm.,
Clap a pattern for children to echo back to you.,
Using the principle of learning to speak before reading, let children become familiar with the shape and appearance of note symbols, as early as possible.,
A long way down the road, they'll be able to take rhythm dictation.,
These two main elements, pitch and rhythm, are the foundation for teaching children to read music.",How to Help Children Read Music Notes1,"  While this may seem obvious, it is not always the case.  Model how to turn your hand sideways with fingers spread wide (with your palm towards you) and name each finger-line from the bottom going up. I.e. little finger is E, ring finger - G, middle finger - B, pointing finger D, thumb is F. To help you remember, use a mnemonic that appeals to the child: Every Good Boy Does Fine - old and trusted, but try others.You might mention that this is why music is written on 5 lines, called the musical staff or stave.;
,  Frequency of practice will help. Possibly set a task to come up with an original mnemonic, such as:Elvis Goes Bopping Down the Freeway, Every Good Boogie Deserves Flicking (teenage boys seem to have no trouble remembering when I use this one!)

, Depending on the age (concentration span) of the child, I may introduce these at the same time.  Ask: ""How many spaces are there between the five finger lines?"" If the answer is NOT four, emphasize IN BETWEEN, and have them check again. F A C E in the space is used to help them remember the letters of the spaces.  I.e. F lies between the little finger and ring finger,A is the space between ring and middle fingers, C lies between middle and pointing fingers, E is between the pointing finger and the thumb

,  Ensure that the hand is correctly positioned sideways, palm towards the face.E G B D F, then F A C E, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F. When this is secure, show G above the space (touching the top of the hand) and ask ""What do you think this note name will be? Explain that the alphabetical pattern, A- G, continues above and also below the staff or stave.

,  Make it a game, especially if you have several children together.  Get them to explain and review to each other.  Can they do it backwards? Quickly?Most music books for children teach reading very slowly, but there is no need for this.  Eventually, children will be able to recognise the notes used in their practical lessons, or be happy to explain what they understand whenever music notes are introduced.

,  Regular exposure helps, again with continual praise and rewards for those who remember easily. Use flashcards, each with a note of the Treble Clef, that children can handle and maneuver easily on a table, or floor space. They should be able to separate lines from spaces, then to put these in order (beginning with the lowest).

, using the high and low letter position.  A challenge would be, who can get the longest word (BADGE, CABBAGE, BAGGAGE).  There is also the Treble Clef Crossword, to be found online, and other similar quizzes.

,  The first step is to keep a steady beat.  Explain that you can think of the beat in groups of 3, or 4.  Demonstrate by marching, or by dancing a waltz (marching on the spot or swaying side to side).  Again, play games with this.  Let them listen to a variety of music, and try to move in time with the beat.

, Clap a simple pattern 4-beat one or two bar pattern, such as ta, ta, ti-ti ta; or ti-ti, ti-ti, ta, ta,  (where ta is a crochet/ quarter note, and ti-ti a pair of quavers or eighth notes). Use other body percussion (finger clicks, thigh-slaps, foot stamps, shoulder taps etc.)

,  Don't be afraid to call them by their proper names, but let children associate them with their values.  In this way they'll be able to use 1 beat, walk, 2 count (minim/ half note) stand, 4 count = wait, faster notes (quaver/ eighth note) run-ning - where the quavers are always in pairs holding hands. Ask children to identify the correct answer via multiple choice.

,  Limit this at first to just 2 note values.  Children will only be successful if they are encouraged to have a go, and not afraid of making mistakes.  To get them to this stage, play lots of music notation games.  Rhythm flashcards, Rhythm Bingo, word-rhythm association, tapping on the shoulder, improvisation over a steady beat and others. Whichever system you choose to use, make it a regular activity so that it becomes a familiar and enjoyable activity.  Keep it short and lively.  Give encouragement, and prizes.

,  They can be taught separately, but will eventually meld into one as concepts are understood.  Taught using a cyclical method, where information is given in full, some of it used in practice, then information given again for another activity, is one of the best ways to cement this knowledge.  It should be non-threatening environment for children, so that they can have fun while learning, hands on.

"
"
In this method, each note value is associated with a word (ti-ti, ta, ta-a, ta-a-a, etc.)",How to Help Children Read Music Notes2," or perhaps run-ning, walk, stand, wait.  Words and phrases are learned which can easily be translated into practical rhythms, and then eventually read.  This can be used in conjunction with word names, but this is usually added later.  The important thing to remember, is that you will need to point out that faster rhythms like 'helicopter' use shorter sounds.  That is to say that stand = 4x helicopter. Using this method, it is easy to get children performing cross rhythms in 2-4 parts, because of the strength of the word-rhythm associations.

"
"
There is some discrepancy as to the effectiveness of this method, but it works really, really well for some children.",How to Help Children Read Music Notes3,"  Each pitch is associated with a specific colour- when you see that colour, you name/ play the pitch.  The downside to this is that studies show, colour pitch association can be very subjective, and so if incorrect for that student, it may not work.  It is possible to purchase simple musical instruments that use this system (xylophone being the most common) and to learn to play quite complex melodies, through developing this memory.  Check out synesthesia for more information on cross sensory connections.

Provide the motivation.",How to Help Children Achieve Better Grades," In a school system surrounded by mediocre teachers, it can be difficult to find a great teacher but a lack of this can be counteracted by use of a tutor and choosing a good school. Moreover, a child instilled with a love of learning for its own sake in the home environment will thrive regardless of the teaching, as there will be more self-responsibility and less tendency to pass the responsibility elsewhere.


There is no such thing as a perfect teacher. Every person has strengths in different areas. All teachers have something to offer in some way, so it pays to help your child learn how to make the most of the teachers' best skills. After all, in life, this is an essential skill, particularly for persons in a role of delegating or advising others on working together; no harm in starting to learn this skill early.;
, Establishing a social connection with a teacher creates a sense of responsibility for the child to complete school activities. It also gives them the confidence to ask the teacher for help when they fail to understand something.


Not all children find speaking up in class time easy. It is just as important to find other ways for the quiet child to gain the teacher's attention, such as talking to the teacher during a quiet time, after class or even by email. Quietness is not a sign of a lack of interest; it is often a sign that the child is processing but needs time to fully digest. Sometimes being pressured to ask questions can interfere with that reflection process and place undue stress on the child. If your child is inclined to be quiet, avoid badgering them into asking questions openly but help them to find constructive ways to get the teacher's attention.

, Exposure to multiple learning sources can increase a child's learning capacity to a great extent. This means learning subjects using visual, literary and acoustic aids from the internet and books. This includes diagrams, watching educational videos and listening to lectures. A combination of these resources will increase the learner's interest and give school subjects a holistic approach, making learning easier and more interesting, as well as relevant.

, Children function better in stress-free environments, so any domestic upheavals can affect their concentration and cause their focus to stray. Of course, no home is perfect and things happen. Be realistic and accept that some exposure to life's uncertainties is as much a lesson about life as aiming to run a perfect household. What does matter is that the children know that they matter, that they can come to you for help and clarification and that the bad times are temporary and soon roll back to an even keel.


If you are going through financial, relationship, work or other hardships, ensure that the children have stability of some sort so that the studies come first and they are aware that you expect this, no matter what else. It may be a quiet study area away from parental stressing, or occasional trips away for the whole family to relax away from the source of challenges. In other words, times of hardship can't be simply wished away but you can provide workarounds to help your children to feel less stressed by the adult issues confronting the household. Shielding them completely is both impossible and unhealthy––children learn by example how to cope with hardship just as much as they learn how to cope with the good times.

, Good time management is essential. An outline of how to spend the day should be made by children and slightly moderated by the parents, in order to ensure that it is effective.

, This must account for sports practice, activities, hobbies and leisure time too.

, Before children take examinations, they need to work with past year papers and exercises to familiarize with the questions. Sometimes, it is not that children do not know their work, rather they do not know what the question requires of them.

, This is essential for good focus. Taking nutritional supplements, especially to counter our unhealthy modern diets, is essential to improve focus.

, The age- old ""pay attention in class"" as well as punctuality is a valuable way to improve comprehension of lessons and get exam tips from teachers.

, Physical activity is essential for stress relief. Children should also try studying in serene settings.

, Parents need to be active in children's studying. Parents need to share their own studying experiences with children or enroll them in a study group to increase interest.

, Children need to be motivated to study. Sometimes, interest is hard to generate, so they need to be physically rewarded as well.

Delegate tasks.",How to Prove You Have Leadership Qualities," Just as good leaders lead by example, you can learn from the leaders around you. Try to understand their acts and attitude that makes people willing to follow them. Doing so will teach you important lessons that would probably have been learned the hard way.Choose a leader in your daily life, or a famous leader you know of. For example, you could choose a successful businessman like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates. Examine their life stories to see what they did in similar situations. Think about famous leaders you read about in college. Who did you identify with the most?
Note that leadership and popularity are not synonymous: leader inspire and managers direct. Observe the leader and try to understand what makes people follow them.;
, You need to develop yourself as a leader, even if you are born with a strong personality or knack for leading.One way to do this is to choose a role model from your daily life and Ask someone if they would be your mentor. This way you can ask them for advice.


You might ask a mentor for advice about learning, growing in your position, and so on.
It can benefit you to have multiple mentors. Leaders don't fit into a specific mold, so more experiences, observations, and interactions are beneficial.
Do what your mentor does and go to them for advice when you encounter situations that you don't know how to handle.
If you are a supervisor in a corporation, you might select a manager one step above you to be your mentor.

, Leaders step up to the bar without being asked. Be willing to take justifiable risks before you ask others to take the risk. A leader should be ready shoulder the blame for mistakes and defer the credit for victories to others., A mark of a good leader is knowing how to receive criticism without getting angry about it. When a supervisor gives you feedback, respond positively by thanking them and then implementing their suggestions. This demonstrates humility and willingness to learn.


Keep a positive attitude when receiving feedback. Your morale reflects on your team.Avoid anger, over-reaction, and indecision. These create lack of confidence in a leader that make followers question their decisions.
When someone tells you how you could be less aggressive with your athletes when coaching a sports team, don't get upset. Smile and thank the critic.

, Although as a leader you often direct others in their tasks, doing your fair share is important. If you aren’t willing to do the grunt work that you assign, your subordinates won’t be willing to do it either. How much work you are willing to do is important in leading by example and proving that you have leadership qualities.For example, you may have “cleaning the bathrooms” on your list of team tasks. Place yourself in the rotation of people assigned to clean them.
If you're coaching a sports team, go out and demonstrate the play that you're describing.

, Show confidence and don't be afraid to be yourself. Lead from the front, not from behind. Leaders who are confident are usually noticed by those in authority. In other words, don’t change your personality to fit a leadership role; make the role fit your personality.Look for challenges to take on. Managing small projects shows you have leadership qualities, especially when you are successful.Try doing a few things to be more confident. For example, give yourself a pep talk in the mirror before work each morning.

, Proving you have leadership qualities means you must prove you are also honest. Leaders must show and inspire humility, transparency, and truthfulness through their actions. Lead by example by freely admitting your mistakes and shortcomings.For example, if you send an email to the wrong person, immediately send a follow-up email correcting the mistake. Don't try to pretend it didn’t happen.
Own your failures, downplay your successes, and let others take the credit. Being humble is an important part of proving you have leadership qualities. It demonstrates that you are all about helping others be successful. A leader helps others grow.
Also try to celebrate in private. If you land a big success as a leader, don’t gloat or boast. Leaders simply don’t do this.For example, if you were coaching your child's little league baseball team and they won the #Be adaptable. Another important element of proving you have leadership qualities is being able to adapt to circumstances. You must be able to think out of the box, even being able to choose between two bad options. Adapting allows you to look beyond the easy decision.You will have to make different types of decisions according to the circumstances. Quick decisions as well as deliberative, objective decisions are called for at different times.
For example, you may be required to decide on a last-minute revision to a project to meet a crucial deadline. This would require quick prioritization and decision-making skills.
However, deciding on a new direction for a product line might require more deliberate and planned style of thinking.

, Leaders inspire their followers to accomplish specific goals or objective. Before taking others to a place, you need to know where you are going. Create clear objectives for yourself and make sure you can describe them easily and passionately to your subordinates. Make sure goals are measurable, specific, and time-bound so that you and your team can track progress., Pay attention to the people you lead when you give instructions. For example, if you are met with a blank stare, take the time to make sure they fully understand. Being a good communicator is an important part of showing you have what it takes to be a leader.When you are training people under you, for example, adopt an “open door” policy, or allow them to come to you whenever they need help.
When leading a committee on enacting social change, tell your team your ideas and invite them to contribute.

, You can build relationships with your team by listening carefully and asking intelligent questions. Listen more than you talk. Be willing both to ask your subordinates questions to help them stay motivated, and ask questions of your supervisors.




For example, ask questions and call on others while you speak rather than giving a solid monologue. Call on people to answer questions when no one volunteers an answer.


It can be tempting to jump up in front of your team and prove that you know what’s going on by talking a lot. However, good leaders promote conversation amongst their team members. Listen when people present ideas.Repeat back an instruction in your own words when someone has finished speaking.
Nod while others talk, and make steady eye contact.
Keep your body language open by fully facing the person you're talking. Focus on their face instead of glancing around the room.



, To demonstrate your leadership qualities, show that you aren’t afraid of to resolve conflict.You should also focus on being objective and showing followers that you are trustworthy. To successfully navigate conflict, you must have the respect of your peers and the people skills to address the needs of those involved. Watch the body language of those in conflict to determine what they need.


You can find ways of resolving conflict by simply jumping in and seeing what works with different people.
It may also be helpful to read books on conflict resolution when working with groups of people.
Try to remain calm when someone gets agitated, deferring your negative reaction until you can be alone.
Work with your colleagues to find a compromise. If you have to resolve the conflict between two of your members, help them negotiate.
In all situations, eve outside of conflict, be equitable in your treatment of coworkers.

, Delegation is the best way to show someone they are important and you trust them. It also demonstrates your ability to let others handle small tasks. This shows that you have the wisdom to allow others to do work that they may be better suited for.Figure out the strengths that each team member has and assign tasks to fit each person.
Hire team members who are strong where you are weak. Give them tasks that are suited ti these strengths.

For example, if you run a website, hire writers who produce quality articles since your strengths are likely more in web design or customer service.

Really think about why you want to be a mentor before you actually take it on.,
Talk to mentors who have experience with teenage mentees.,
Talk to mentees about their mentoring experiences.,
Arrange some form of schedule of appointments, in which you will see your mentee(s) and make sure that you're keeping to said schedule.,
Build up trust with your mentee.,
Listen to what they have to say with respect and understanding.,
Ask them about anything that's concerning you - even if they don't say it first.,
Encourage them.,
Have faith in them.",How to Mentor a Teenager," Realise that some teenagers are easier to work with but others will be a handful at first or even from time-to-time. You really need to be clear with yourself on whether you have the time, patience, mentality and maturity in order to mentor a teenage because you never know what their situation may be. Evaluate the reasons why you want to be a mentor and be honest with yourself on whether they are good enough reasons or not. You might, for example, feel motivated to help out teenagers with their education if you particularly struggled with education but managed to overcome that struggle. 

, You can talk to people that have previously mentored teenagers or even currently mentor teenagers. Ask them questions about how they find/found the job and how they handle/handled different situations so that you have a better understanding. Avoid asking them questions based on hearsay that not only relates to but also identifies an individual i.e. ""I heard that kid, John, was (insert problem here). What exactly was his situation and how did you deal with it?""- even if they aren't reluctant to discuss it with you. Unless ""John"" himself is present and doesn't mind talking about the benefits of mentoring to you, it's best to respect the confidentiality aspect of the mentoring process. A more appropriate question would have just been, ""What was your experience with and how did you deal with it?"" Those questions were much better to ask because they don't refer to a particular person and don't suggest that an individual's name has to be mentioned either but if the mentor does mention names, make a good start and keep it to yourself.

, This means that you can talk to people who were mentored as teenagers - or even teenagers that are currently being mentored. Once again, ask them questions about what they found helpful and what helped them feel comfortable about talking to their mentors. Think about questions that you could ask beforehand that could help you get an idea on whether you may be capable of becoming a mentor for a teenager or not.

, This means making sure that you and your mentee are seeing each other when and where you both plan on seeing each other, and also making sure that the time is spent efficiently by giving them the opportunity to talk about what's going on for them and any problems that they may have. If you're mentee isn't turning up, then you should find out what's really going on; they might not be turning up because something is happening. You will need to be seen as a reliable person so make sure that you turn up too and show them that extra mile of respect too by being punctual.;
, This is a two way thing, not only do you have to trusted by your mentee, but you will need to trust them too. You can start off by making sure that you're at least on friendly terms with each other. You can achieve this by, for example,  contacting each other every now and then and start talking about general things and/or things that aren't too personal for them. You could even try to encourage them by mentioning any problems that you had during your teenage years. Once you're at that level with them: keep your promises, tell the truth, be reliable and most of all motivate them and give them advice where ever and whenever possible.

, Wait until they've finished speaking until you start speaking yourself. Show interest in what they're saying and empathise with them where necessary; some teenagers don't really want too much pity but to know that they can just talk about it anyway can make them feel that little bit better; it will then up to you to give them guidance and it will furthermore be up to them to listen to you and take on your words of wisdom in order to make them feel better.

, If you notice any change in their behaviour or any signs of physical harm, encourage them to talk about it to you and take action by intervening where and when necessary. Let them know that you do care about them and that you'll always be prepared to listen to them no matter what.

, This could be a lot of things, you could encourage them to, for example, plan their career, stop smoking, start attending school daily, have faith in themselves etc. With encouragement, comes confidence - the confidence that they can change and be exactly who they want to be. Some teenagers wouldn't mind if you set them with challenges that come with rewards, while others may find it ""childish"". Find out what methods works best for them and adapt to it. It helps to give them the mindset that if they live their lives ""the right way"", good things will come their way.

, Believe that they do have the power to change and that it sometimes takes more than just a push but a great leap. Showing that you genuinely believe in them will help you build your relationship with your mentee, which will give them the confidence to confide in you more often and listen to what you have to say, which in turn would motivate them to become a step closer to change and/or figuring out their problems.

Teach your students to express themselves.,
Get them to work as a team.,
Teach the value of being aware of what's happening around them.",How to Teach Leadership1," At work and in school, pressure or anxiety may lower a person's confidence, which will often keep them from sharing their opinions and ideas. As a leader, sharing ideas and feedback is crucial. If you let others take over the setting or you, you aren't the leader in the situation.;
, Leadership is being able to be a leader in groups. You have to handle issues by working with people. To be a leader in a group, you need to pitch ideas and be able to get the team through rough spots. Teach your students to be the one to call who is always available and willing to help.


Use group projects and seminars to encourage students to be able to work together. Team settings can be a challenge, but you can't have a leader without a team.

, As a leader, you should know as much as possible about your group and what's happening within it, even the most confidential information available by/to the other members. Make sure they don't force yourself themselves into knowing and don't push or threaten the rest of the team, but encourage them to be aware of their surroundings and the team dynamics.

Focus on problem solving.,
Encourage experimentation with reverse psychology.",How to Teach Leadership2," Freaking out is a sign of weakness, showing that you cannot handle the pressure of being involved in an accusation. Practice techniques with them, like breathing and thinking before they begin.

, If they're going to be leaders, they can't drop issues and walk away. Guide them in practicing social problem solving through role play and examples. A leader needs to tell the person assertively how they feel without being completely and straight-out rude. It shows that they can be in control of what's happening, and take the other person's valid impressions and feelings into account, too.

, Teach your students, that, if somebody is (per say) refusing to speak with them for any reason whatsoever, they can be silent as well. This can turn the tables on the situation and result in more compromise and communication.

Work individually on your own time.",How to Stop Following and Lead," Does someone think they can control you without authority? Do they often give you unjustified orders and expect you to do things for them?;
, When someone tells you to do something you are not comfortable with, say ""No."" Start with small requests, if saying no is difficult for you.

, Show your friendly, nice side so that people will look up to you. Practice good judgment. Make people want to look up to you and look to you for advice.

, When someone makes a suggestion and tries to get you to do something, think about why you want to do it. Do you want to do it because you enjoy it or because that person wants you to? Do not use another person's goals and ambitions. Seek liberty for yourself.

, Instead of always going along with someone else's plan, take initiative and plan things for yourself.

, It's never too late to figure out what you want, and pursue it— or to revise what your goals once were.

, If the people around you have been dragging them down, cut ties with them. You may have been discouraged from dreaming, or acting in a certain way, or been accused of acting better than your status. Anyone who does that is not someone you should be around often.


Of course, it isn't always possible to completely cut ties with these people. Some are coworkers that you need to tolerate, or close family you can't cut out. Ignore those people, and interact with them as little as you can.

, One common mark of a ""follower"" is being complacent and avoiding change, sticking to the same old drudgery. Don't get caught in your comfort zone.


These changes can be as small as the genre of books you read, to where you vacation, to as big as your place of employment. Don't be afraid to make changes and try things out.

, Both freedom to pursue your own goals and freedom to have and pursue your own ideals are important to have.

, You probably don't need to attain politician-levels of leadership skills, but communication skills and public speaking skills, but those skills are important for any leader.

, Don't hold yourself back because of what others will think. If success, to you, means retiring later and being productive for longer— do it. If success to you means working long hours to get stuff done— do it. If success to you means having a strong work-life balance— do it. If success to you means focusing on moving upward at all costs— do it.


Cooperate to achieve goals, but don't compromise on your objectives.

, Having the skills you need can greatly improve both your confidence in yourself, and others' confidence in you. Both continuing education and your first education are very important.

, Speak out about politics, and any causes that matter to you. Obviously, not everyone will convert to your viewpoint, but leaders should be active and engaged members of society.

, Be a hard worker at your job, and do extra activities outside of that such as volunteering.

,, Make sure everyone who wants to contribute to the rule making process is present, since objections tend to lead to failure to follow rules. If the group you are a part of has a designated leader, he or she will be in charge of making the rules, but should be able to listen and give good guidance to the process.

, Ask them for input in each rule considered.

, For some clubs, for instance, rules against sharing secrets may be very important, for an adult work team, allocation of resources may be an example.

,, For a club, for instance, a rule may require each person contribute dues at a set interval, or each person might be required to bring snacks and drinks every so often.

, After a discussion of each rule, allow the group to vote whether to accept or reject the rule in question.

These influences may stem from a specific religious upbringing, philosophical beliefs or general observations about the types of behaviors that accelerate progress and development in society.;
, For example, a person might value truthfulness, but withhold important information when truth telling may interfere with being hired or promoted. To manifest integrity, behaviors must be aligned with moral beliefs.

, Whether you are leading a sports team, managing a group of engineers or parenting children, leading with integrity requires outlining a standard of behavior by which others can abide.

, Adhere at all times to the behavioral standard you have established for the group.

,


Communicate authentically. Be open with group members regarding issues and policies that affect them. Keeping secrets or hiding important information can lead to an environment of mistrust.
Listen attentively to others. Open communication involves the exchange of information. Leading with integrity requires hearing what others have to say and creating an environment that fosters open sharing.
Practice tolerance for divergent views. Group members will inevitably have different opinions and thoughts, and may not always agree with you or your decisions. Allow them to hold their opinions without fearing ridicule or rejection.

, Gain the trust of group members by acknowledging their contributions.

, It will be difficult, if not impossible, to practice integrity in a position in which you are pressured by upper management to conceal important facts or engage in immoral or illegal activities.

, Some environments lack integrity due to inattention to the company's moral code or values. Suggest to upper management to increase attention to integrity issues by offering mandatory classes or holding relevant discussions in company meetings.

, This may mean that you change jobs, limit time spent with certain colleagues or make a special effort to hire honest and trustworthy employees.

, Gain inspiration by learning about leaders who delivered difficult news, chose honesty over financial gain or refused to take credit for other people's work.

Generate a need.",How to Persuade People1," Knowing how to persuade people isn't just in words and body language -- it's also in knowing the right time to talk to them. If you approach people when they are more relaxed and open to discussion, you will most likely achieve faster, better results.


People are most persuadable immediately after thanking someone -- they feel indebted. What's more, they are at their most persuasive after being thanked -- they feel entitled. If someone thanks you, it's the perfect time to ask for a favor. Sort of a what-goes-around-comes-around thing. You scratched their back, now it's high time they scratch yours.;
, A large part of whether or not persuasion is effective is based on the general rapport between you and your client/son/friend/employee. If you don't know the person well, it's imperative to start building this rapport immediately -- find common ground as soon as possible. Humans, in general, feel safer around (and thus are more fond of) people that are similar to them. So find parallels and make them known.


First talk about what interests them. One of the best ways to get people to open up is to talk about what they're passionate about. Ask intelligent, thoughtful questions about what interests them -- and don't forget to mention why those interests interest you! Seeing that you're a kindred spirit will tell that person it's okay to be receptive and open to you.

Is that a picture of them skydiving on their desk? Crazy! You've just been looking into taking your first dive -- but should you do it from 10,000 or 18,000 feet? What's their seasoned opinion?



, If you say to your son or daughter, ""Don't mess up your room,"" when what you mean to say is, ""Tidy your room,"" you'll get nowhere. ""Don't hesitate to contact me,"" is not the same as, ""Call me on Thursday!"" Whoever you're talking to won't know what you mean and therefore won't be able to give you what you want.


There is something to be said for clarity. If you're obfuscating, the person may want to agree with you, but doesn't necessarily know what you're looking for. Speaking in the affirmative will help you maintain directness and keep your intentions clear.

, You know how in college you went through that Lit course that taught you about Aristotle's appeals? No? Well, here's your brush up. The guy was smart -- and these appeals are so human they remain true to this day.



Ethos -- think credibility. We tend to believe people whom we respect. Why do you think spokesmen exist? For this exact appeal. Here's an example: Hanes. Good underwear, respectable company. Is that enough for you to buy their product? Well, maybe. Wait, Michael Jordan has been sporting Hanes for over two decades?Sold!

Pathos -- relies on your emotions. Everyone knows that SPCA commercial with Sarah McLachlan and the sad music and the sad puppies. That commercial is the worst. Why? Because you watch it, you get sad, and you feel compelled to help the puppies. Pathos at its finest.

Logos -- that's the root of the word ""logic."" This is perhaps the most honest of the persuasion methods. You simply state why the person you're talking to should agree with you. That's why statistics are used so prevalently. If you were told, ""On average, adults who smoke cigarettes die 14 years earlier than nonsmokers,"" (which is true, by the way), and you believed you wanted to live a long, healthy life, logic would dictate that you stop. Boom. Persuasion.

, This is rule #1 when it comes to persuasion. After all, if there's no need for what you're trying to sell/get/do, it won't happen. You don't need to be the next Bill Gates (though he definitely created a need) -- all you have to do is look at Maslow's Hierarchy. Think about different realms of need -- whether it's physiological, safety and security, love and belongingness, self-esteem or self-actualization needs, you can certainly find an area that is missing something, something only you can improve.Create scarcity. Apart from what we humans need to survive, almost everything has value on a relative scale. Sometimes (maybe most of the time), we want things because other people want (or have) these things. If you want somebody to want what you have (or are or do or if they just want you), you have to make that object scarce, even if that object is yourself. Supply in demand, after all.Create urgency. In order to get people to act in the moment, you have to be able to invoke a sense of urgency. If they’re not motivated enough to want whatever you have right now, it’s unlikely they’ll change their minds in the future. You must persuade people in the present; it's all that matters."

Gain relevant work experience.,
Complete an apprenticeship.,
Check licensing requirements in your state.,
Study for the licensing exam.,
Complete the licensing exam.",How to Become a Funeral Director1," Depending on your state's requirements, a formal education may not be necessary. Many funeral directors in the United States were born into the trade, or gained entry via a local business early on. If a local funeral home is willing to provide you training, informal training may be enough to eventually obtain an apprenticeship and a license.Keep in mind, most funeral homes will only provide training to those with formal education. However, if time and money are an issue, check with local funeral homes.
Arrange a meeting in which you discuss your interests in becoming a funeral director. Convey your willingness and excitement to learn. If you seem dedicated, a local funeral home may provide you with training.
Even with informal training, you do need at least a high school diploma or GED.
In the UK, however, an online course is required before hand, which you can take through the National Association of Funeral Directors. Only after taking this course can you receive on-the-job training.;
, In most cases, formal education is required. A bachelor's or associate's degree in a field like mortuary sciences is usually necessary to becoming a funeral director. Programs range from two to four years.If you're working in the UK, however, a degree is not as necessary as there are specific training classes provided through the National Association of Funeral Directors.Most schools accredited with the American Board of Funeral Service Education (ABFSE) offer associates programs, frequently through community colleges. A few schools do offer four year tracks. Check your state's requirements to see if an associate's or bachelor's is needed in your state to receive your license.
During your time in school, you will study things like ethics, grieving, and business law. You will also learn the basics of embalming a body and otherwise preparing it for burial., While you're pursuing your education and training, work on your resume. The kind of training you make for yourself matters. Take on part time jobs that will help diversify your resume and increase your chance of employment.In many funeral homes, a small amount of office management experience is needed. Look for administrative work. You can, for example, work as a secretary or assistant part time as you complete an apprenticeship or associate's degree.
You should also look into jobs where you work with others. Interpersonal communication skills are vital to becoming a funeral director. Try to work in an environment where you may deal with death or grieving. For example, you could work in an emergency room.

, Most states require you complete an apprenticeship with a local funeral home to become a licensed funeral director. You will need to find a licensed funeral director willing to sponsor you. Your college or training program may provide you with a sponsor. You may also have to ask around at local funeral homes.During your apprenticeship, you will work under the supervision of a licensed funeral director. You will shadow the funeral director and participate in work in a real funeral home. Lengths vary between one and three years.
Make sure to work hard during your apprenticeship. You want to leave with a good recommendation. You may also eventually find work at the funeral home where you apprenticed.

, Every state's licensing requirements are different. Make sure you contact ABFSE to check requirements in your state. You will need to work as an apprentice for a number of years. Each state has a specific exam you must pass to become a funeral director.Some states more education than others, and fees vary. In California, for example, you need an associate's degree in arts and sciences. You cannot be educated formally. The application also comes with a $100 filing fee.How you sign up for the licensing exam varies by state. There may be some fees required to take the exam.

, The funeral director licensing exam is not easy, so study hard. You should be able to find study materials and guides online, as well as practice tests. Make time each day to study the material to ensure you get a passing grade.Find a good place to study. You should find an area free of outside distractions with good lighting and plenty of room. You should not bring any distracting materials, like a cell phone, to your study space.
Make sure to stick to a study schedule. Find a time each day when you can reasonably study. Sit down at that time every day for a study session.
Take breaks. You cannot study for hours on end without burning out. Make sure to give yourself 5 minutes every hour or so to unwind.

, The licensing exam is usually multiple choice, and you must take it at a testing center near you. You usually take your exam electronically. There will be a brief tutorial prior to the exam instructing you on how to use the computer.There will be a fee to register and take the exam. Fees very by state.
You usually have to leave personal items, like electronics and drinks, outside the testing area.
You will receive your score as soon as you complete the exam. In the event you don't pass, you will have to take the exam again and pay any fees.

Talk fast.,
Be cocky.,
Master the body language.,
Stay consistent.,
Be persistent.",How to Persuade People2," Yep. That's right -- people are more persuaded by a fast, confident talker than accuracy. Sort of makes sense -- the faster you talk, the less time your listener has to process what you've said and question it. That and you create the feeling that you truly grasp the subject by running through the facts at warp speed, confident of them all.


In October of 1976, a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology analyzed talking speed and attitude. The researchers spoke to the participants, trying to convince them that caffeine was bad for them. When they spoke at a turbo-charged pace of 195 words per minute, the participants were more persuaded; those given the lecture at 102 words per minute where less convinced. It was deemed that at higher rates of speech (195 words per minute is about the fastest that people speak in normal conversation), the message was viewed as more credible -- and therefore more persuasive. Talking fast seems to indicate confidence, intelligence, objectivity and superior knowledge. Speech at 100 words per minute, the minimum of normal conversation, was associated with the negative side of the coin., Who would have thought that being cocky was such a good thing (in the right moments)? In fact, recent research has said that humans prefer cockiness to expertise. Ever wondered why seemingly clueless politicians and big wigs get away with everything? Why Sarah Palin still has a gig on Fox News? It's a consequence of the way human psychology works. A consequence, indeed.


Research done at Carnegie Mellon University has shown that humans prefer advice from confident sources -- even if we know the source has a not-so-stellar track record. If someone is aware of this (subconsciously or otherwise), it can drive them to exaggerate how confident they are on the topic., If you seem unapproachable, closed off, and unwilling to compromise, people won't want to listen to a word you have to say. Even if you're saying all the right things, they're picking up the words from your body. Watch your positioning just as much as you watch your mouth.



Stay open. Keep your arms unfolded and your body pointing towards the other person. Maintain good eye contact, smile, and make it a point not to fidget.
Mirror the other. Once more, humans like those they perceive to be like them -- by mirroring them, you are, literally, in their same position. If they're leaning on an elbow, lean on the mirroring elbow. If they lean back, lean back. Don't do this so consciously it draws attention to it -- in fact, if you're feeling a rapport, you should do this almost automatically.

, Imagine a quintessential politician standing in his suit at a podium. A reporter throws him a question about how his support mainly comes from those 50 and older. In response, he shakes his fist, points, and aggressively says, ""I feel for the younger generation."" What's wrong about this picture?


What's wrong is everything. His entire image -- his body, his movements -- go against what he says. He has the appropriate, soft response, but his body language is hard, uncomfortable, and fierce. As a result, he's not believable. In order to be persuasive, your message and your body language have to match up. Otherwise, you straight up look like a liar.

, Alright, so don't badger a person to death when they keep telling you no, but don't let it dissuade you from asking the next person. You won't be persuasive with everyone, especially before you get over the learning curve. Persistence will pay off in the long run.


The most persuasive person is the one who is willing to keep asking for what they want, even when they keep getting turned down. No world leader would have gotten anything accomplished if he would've given up at his first rejection. Abraham Lincoln, one of the most revered presidents in history) lost his mother, three sons, a sister, his girlfriend, failed in business and lost eight separate elections before he was elected president of the United States."
"
Go for an economic incentive.,
Opt for the social incentive.,
Use the moral route.",How to Persuade People3," You want something from someone, we got that much down. Now, what can you give them? What do you know is something they could want? The first answer: money.


Let's say you are running a blog or paper and you want an author to do an interview. Instead of saying, ""Hey! I like your work!"" what would be more effective? Here's an example: ""Dear John, I noticed you have a book coming out in a few weeks, and I believe my readers, over at my blog, would eat it up. Would you be interested in doing a 20 minute interview, and I would feature it to all of my readers? We’ll also be able to end with a pitch for your book.""Now John knows that if he does this article, he'll reach a wider audience, selling more of his work, and making more money.

, Alright, alright, not everyone is concerned with money. If that's not an option, go the social route. Most people are concerned with their overall image. If you know a friend of theirs, even better


Here's the same topic, only using a social incentive: ""Dear John, I recently read that piece of research you published, and I couldn’t help but wonder “Why doesn’t EVERYONE know about this?” I was wondering, would you be interested in doing a quick 20 minute interview where we talk about this piece of research? In the past I’ve featured research from Max, someone I know you’ve worked with in the past, and I believe your research will be a big hit on my blog.""Now, John knows Max is in the mix (alluding to ethos) and that this person feels passionately about his work. Socially, John has no reason not to do this and plenty of reason to.

, Arguably this method is the weakest, but it may be more effective with some people. If you reckon someone wouldn't be moved by money or social image, give this one a go.


""Dear John, I recently read that piece of research you published, and I couldn’t help but wonder “Why doesn’t EVERYONE know about this?” As a matter of fact, this is one of the reasons why I launched my podcast Social Triggers. My big goal is to bring the insights from academic papers to the general public. I was wondering, would you be interested in doing a quick 20 minute interview? We can highlight your research to all of my listeners, and hopefully we can both make the world a little bit smarter.""That last line ignores the money and the ego and goes straight for the moral high road.

"
Utilize the beauty of guilt and reciprocity.,
Harness the power of consensus.,
Ask for a lot.,
Use ""we.,
Start things off.,
Get them saying yes.,
Be balanced.,
Use covert anchors.,
Up your expectations.,
Frame with a loss.",How to Persuade People4," Have you ever had a friend that says, ""First round on me!"" and your immediate thought is, ""I got the second then!""? That's because we're conditioned to return favors; it's only fair. So when you do someone a ""good deed,"" think of it as an investment in your future. People will want to give back.If you're skeptical, there are people using this technique around you all the time. ALL THE TIME. Those pesky women in those kiosks at the mall handing out lotion? Reciprocity. The mint on your tab at the end of dinner?Reciprocity. The free 1800 Tequila shot glass you got at the bar? Reciprocity. It's everywhere. Businesses the world over employ it.

, It's human nature to want to be cool and to ""fit in."" When you let the other know that other people do it too (hopefully a group or person they respect), it reassures them that what you're suggesting is right and lets our brains off the hook of analyzing something for whether it's good or not. Having a ""herd mentality"" lets us be mentally lazy. It also keeps us from being left behind.


An example of the success of this method is the use of information cards in hotel bathrooms. In one study, the number of customers who reused their towels increased by 33% when information cards in hotel rooms read ""75% of customers who stay in this hotel reuse their towels,"" according to research conducted at Influence at Work in Tempe, Ariz.It gets more intense. If you've ever taken a Psych 101 class, you've heard of this phenomenon. Back in the 50s, Solomon Asch conducted a whole bunch of conformity studies. He put a subject in a group of confederates who were all told to say the wrong answer (in this instance, that a visibly shorter line was longer than a visibly longer line (something a 3 year old could do). As a result, a shocking 75% of participants said the shorter line was longer and completely compromised what they actually believed, just to fit in with the norm. Crazy, huh?



, If you're a parent, you've seen this one in action. A child says, ""Mommy, mommy! Let's go the beach!"" Mom says no, feels a bit guilty, but doesn't have the option to change her mind. But then, when the child says, ""Okay, fine. Let's go to the pool, then?"" mom wants to say yes and does.


So ask for what you actually want second. People feel a sense of guilt when they refuse a request, regardless of what it is generally. If the second request (i.e., the real request) is something they have no reason not to comply with, then they'll grab the opportunity. The second request gives them freedom from guilt, like an escape route. They'll feel relieved, better about themselves, and you get what you want.If you want a donation of $10, ask for $25. If you want a project done in a month, first ask for it in 2 weeks.

, Studies have shown that the reassurance of ""we"" is more productive in persuading people than other, less positive, approaches (namely the threatening approach (If you don’t do this, I will) and the rational approach (You should do this for the following reasons). The use of ""we"" conveys a sense of camaraderie, commonality and understanding.


Remember how we said earlier that it was important to establish rapport so the listener feels similar to you and likes you? And then how we said to mirror your body language so the listener feels similar to you and likes you? Well, now you should use ""we""...so the listener feels similar and likes you. Bet you didn't see that one coming.

, You know how sometimes a team can't really seem to get going until someone ""gets the ball rolling?"" Well, you need to be that person. If you give the first bit, your listener will be more inclined to finish off.


People are more likely to be willing to finish a task as opposed to doing the whole thing. Next time the laundry needs done, try throwing the clothes in the washer, then asking if your significant other would pick up your slack.It's so easy they can't justify saying no.

, People want to be consistent with themselves. If you get them saying ""yes"" (in one way or another), they'll want to stick to it. If they've admitted they'd like to address a certain problem or are a certain way and you offer a solution, they'll feel obligated to see it out. Whatever it is, get them agreeing.


In a research study by Jing Xu and Robert Wyer, participants showed that they were more receptive to anything if first shown something they agree with. In one of the sessions, participants listened to either a speech by John McCain or Barack Obama and then watched an ad for Toyota. Republicans were more swayed by the ad after watching John McCain, and Democrats? You guessed it -- were more pro-Toyota after watching Barack Obama. So if you're trying to sell something, get your customers agreeing with you first – even if what you talk about has nothing to do with what you’re selling., Despite how it may seem sometimes, people do have independent thought and they're not all idiots. If you don’t mention all sides of the argument, people will be less likely to believe or agree with you.If weaknesses are staring you in the face, address them yourself -- especially before someone else does.


Over the years many studies have been done comparing one-sided and two-sided arguments and their efficacy and persuasiveness in different contexts. Daniel O’Keefe at the University of Illinois went through the results of 107 different studies (50 years, 20,111 participants) and developed a sort of meta-analysis. He concluded that two-sided arguments are more persuasive than their one-sided equivalents across the board -- with different types of persuasive messages and with varied audiences., Ever heard of Pavlov's dog? No, not the 70s rock band from St. Louis.The experiment on classical conditioning. This is just like that. You do something that subconsciously evokes a response on the other's part -- and they don't even know it. But know that this takes time and a whole lot of diligence.


If every time your friend mentioned Pepsi you groaned, that would be an example of classical conditioning. Eventually, when you groan, your friend thinks of Pepsi (maybe you want them to drink more Coke?). A more useful example would be if your boss used the same phrases for praise with everyone. When you hear him congratulating someone else, it reminds you of the time he said it to you -- and you work just a little bit harder with the surge of pride lifting your mood.

, If you're in a position of power, this method is even better -- and an absolute must. Make it known that you have full confidence in the positive attributes of your underlings (employees, children, etc.) and they'll be more apt to comply.


If you tell your child he is smart and that you know he'll get good grades, he won't want to disappoint you (if he can avoid it). Letting him know you're confident in him will make it easier for him to be confident in himself.
If you're the boss of a company, be a source of positivity for your employees. If you give one a particularly difficult project, let her know that you're giving it to her because you know she can do it. She's exhibited X, X, and X qualities that prove it. With the boost, her work will be even better.

, If you can give someone something, great. But if you can prevent something from being taken away, you're in. You can help them avoid a stressor in their lives -- why would they say no?


There was a study in which a group of executives had to make a decision on a proposal involving loss and gain. The differences were huge: Twice as many of the executives said yes to the proposal if the company was predicted to lose $500,000 if the proposal wasn't accepted, compared to the project leading to a profit of $500,000. Could you be more persuasive just by outlining the costs and skimming over the benefits? Maybe.This works just as well in the home. Can't pry the husband away from the television for a nice night out? Easy. Rather than packing for your guilt trip and nagging him about needing ""quality time,"" remind him that this is the last night before the kids get back. He'll be more persuaded knowing he may be missing out on something.This one should be taken with a grain of salt. There is opposing research that suggests that people don't like to be reminded of negative things, at least personally. When it hits too close to home, they freak out at the negative implications. They would rather have ""attractive skin"" than ""avoid skin cancer,"" for example.So keep in mind what you're asking for before you frame it one way or another.

Maintain eye contact and smile.,
Know your product.,
Prepare for any contradictions.,
Don't be afraid to agree with the person.,
Use indirect communication with leaders.,
Detach and stay calm in conflict.,
Be confident.",How to Persuade People5," Be polite, cheerful, and charismatic. A good attitude will help you more than you think. People will want to hear what you have to say -- after all, it's getting in the door that's the hardest part.


You don't want them thinking that you want to force your point of view on them. Be suave and confident -- they'll be more likely to believe every word.







, Show them all the benefits of your idea. Not for you, though! Tell them how it will benefit them. That always gets their attention.


Be honest. If you have a product or idea that just isn't necessary for them, they'll know. It'll get awkward and they'll stop believing even the words that may have truth to them. Address both sides of the situation to assure them that you're rational, logical, and have their best interests at heart.

, And be ready for any that you may not have thought of! If you've practiced your pitch and have sat down to give it a thorough evaluation, this shouldn't be a problem.


People will be looking for something to nay-say if it seems like you get the greater gain from the transaction. Minimize this. The listener should be the one who benefits -- not you.

, Negotiation is a huge part of persuasion. Just because you had to negotiate doesn't mean you didn't win in the end. In fact, tons of research has pointed to the simple word ""yeah"" having persuasive powers.


While ""yeah"" may seem like an odd candidate for a persuasive word, it seems to have power because it makes you seem agreeable and amicable and that the other person is part of the request. Framing what you're looking for as if it were an agreement, rather than a favor, may lead the other person to ""helping out."", If you're talking to your boss or some other person in a position of power, you may want to avoid being too direct. The same goes for if your proposal is rather ambitious. With leaders, you want to guide their thoughts, allowing them to think they came up with it themselves. They need to maintain their sense of power to feel contented. Play the game and feed them your good ideas gently.


Start of by making your boss feel a little less confident. Talk about something he/she doesn't know much about -- if possible, talk outside of his office, where it is neutral territory. After your pitch, remind him who’s the boss (he is!) -- thus making him feel powerful once more)-- so he can do something about your request., Getting wrapped up in emotions never makes anyone more effective at persuasion. In situations of emotion or conflict, staying calm, detached and unemotional will always give you the most leverage. If someone else is losing it, they'll turn to you for a sense of stability. After all, you're in control of your emotions. They'll trust you in those moments to lead them.


Use anger purposefully. Conflict makes most people uncomfortable. If you're willing to ""go there,"" making the situation tense, that is, it's like the other will back down. Don't do this often, however, and definitely don't do it in the heat of the moment or when you've lost a grip on your emotions. Only use this tactic skillfully and purposefully., It cannot be stressed enough: Certainty is compelling, intoxicating and attractive like no other quality is. The guy in the room who's spouting off a mile a minute with a smile on his face reeking of confidence is the one persuading everyone over to his team. If you really believe in what you do, others will see that and respond. They'll want to be just as confident as you are.If you're not, it is seriously in your interest to fake it. If you walk into a 5-star restaurant, no one has to know you're in a rented suit. As long as you don't walk in in jeans and a t-shirt, no one asks questions. When you deliver your pitch, think along those same lines.

As a Police Officer III, you enforce the laws. You can make arrests, but you will continue to write reports on what you witness as a police officer.

, After four years (total) of serving on the police force, you are allowed to compete to become a detective. You will need to take an exam and be interviewed for this position. The exam will test your knowledge on what you'll need to know to be a detective. Your local precinct can provide you with what you'll need to study to pass the exam.
, After you pass the exam, you will need to pass another interview. The interview panel will assess whether you have the necessary skills to become a detective.

, Spend your free time designing and creating new arrangements. Keep a sketchbook of designs that you plan to create. Include the materials and techniques that you would like to use to create the design as well.This will help build your confidence and help you learn new techniques.

, Floral design is a creative field. Customers rely on florists to recommend different designs, arrange displays, and execute their vision. Having your own point of view will set you a part.What colors are you drawn to? Do you prefer paring unexpected flowers together? Do you like delicate arrangements? Monochromatic arrangements?

, As you study floral design (on your own or through formal training), you will find that there are foundational techniques that all florists learn. However, by combining and merging different styles, you can come up with something that is all your own. Look at designs created by other florists and identify the elements that you like. Think of ways that you can combine those different elements into something that reflects your personality. Do not be afraid to try something unusual or out of the box.


Play with different textures, shapes, and materials.

If you really want to become a customs inspector but you’re only 18 or 19 years old, beef up your resume with relevant degrees, internships, or volunteer work and familiarize yourself with the application process in order to speed through it once you’ve reached the required age., While there are sometimes exceptions for those with a lot of relevant job experience, you’ll need to acquire a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college to make sure that you meet all educational requirements.Any bachelor’s degree is acceptable, but getting one in criminal justice, law, or another related field will best prepare you.

, Since becoming a customs inspector is heavily related to national security, you’ll need to apply through the government. To get more information and apply for positions in the United States, visit https://www.usajobs.gov/.To have a complete application, you’ll also need to submit necessary documents, such as transcripts and your resume., You’ll be required to take an initial entrance exam, which tests whether or not you have the mental ability to become a customs inspector. The exam typically takes 4-6 hours and involves assessing your work style, arithmetic reasoning skills, logic based reasoning skills, and writing skills., You’ll have to pass a thorough background check before becoming a customs inspector. Three elements typically go into making a final decision: preliminary vetting checks, a polygraph examination, and an investigation.The purpose of this is to make sure that you are who you claim to be and don’t have a history of felonies., Customs inspectors are required to be medically and physically healthy enough to handle daily duties safely and efficiently without causing harm to themselves. You must meet the basic heath standards in order to move forward in the application process.You must also meet specific vision and hearing requirements.

, Also as part of your application process, you’ll be required to pass two different physical fitness tests. These tests include running, sit-ups, and push ups. To pass these tests, you’ll have to:

Complete at least 25 sit-ups in one minute.
Complete at least 17 push-ups in one minute.
Run 1.5 miles (2.41 km) in 17 minutes and 15 seconds or less., Others who work in the field will interview you to determine whether or not you’re competent enough to be successful as a customs inspector. In this interview, the interviewer will ask you questions in order to get a sense of your judgment skills, emotional maturity, interpersonal skills, cooperativeness, and sensitivity.For example, you may be given a specific dangerous scenario and then asked to explain how you’d handle the situation.
You’ll most likely also be asked typical interview questions about your strengths and weaknesses, your salary expectations, how you’ve prepared for the position, and more.

, As a customs inspector, you’ll frequently be exposed to illegal substances. At some point during the application process, you’ll have to take a random drug test. If you fail, you’ll be disqualified., Once you’ve passed all necessary tests and interviews, the final requirement is completing a training program in preparation for the job. These usually take place at state police academies and are typically 1-2 year programs.

Training will entail both classroom instruction and hands-on exercises.
If you’re assigned to Florida, Puerto Rico or the southwestern U.S., you may be required to complete an extra six weeks of training to learn the Spanish language (unless you pass a fluency exam)., While you only really need to have any bachelor’s degree, studying criminal justice, law, or security management will increase your chances of employment. Get a master’s degree in one of these fields to really stand out on your resume.

Social science and language degrees such as French or psychology are also viewed as beneficial and useful in the customs inspection field.

, While it isn’t always required, you’ll really increase your value if you have decent knowledge of a foreign language. Those who work as customs inspectors interact with foreigners on a regular basis, so knowing another language is a major asset in the workplace.

Definitely consider studying Spanish if you want to work in border patrol.

, Physical fitness is a necessity for becoming a customs inspector as well as working as one. Stick with a workout routine that incorporates both strength training and cardio.Work up to jogging 2 miles at least three times a week.
Focus on strengthening your abdominal, chest, arm, leg, and back muscles by doing exercises such as: crunches, planks, bench presses, squats, bicep curls, and rowing.

, Since you’ll have to do a background check during your application process, any indiscretions are going to come to light, whether you’ve gotten a parking ticket or done something much more serious. Stay out of trouble and keep your record as clean as possible. You don’t want to lose your opportunities because of one mistake you made a long time ago."

Read below and decide what kind of counseling interests you.,
Set up an interview with a counselor.,
Prepare for the informative interview.",How to Become a Counselor1," Different counselors have different schooling and experience requirements. The most common counseling positions include: Social Worker, Guidance Counselor, Career Counselor, and Drug Counselor.


There are two main types of social workers:

Direct-service social workers are people who work directly with others to help solve and cope with problems in their everyday lives. Direct-service social workers usually work for organizations as part of larger outreach programs.
Clinical social workers diagnose and treat mental, behavioral, and emotional issues. These people often work in clinics or hospitals.



Guidance or school counselors provide academic, career, college readiness, and personal/social advice to children and adolescents. Guidance counselors usually work at elementary, middle, and high schools, catering to students from kindergarten to Grade 12.

Marriage or family counselors help people improve relationships with spouses and among family members. These counselors typically have a masters degree in this specialty, as well as additional training to become licensed.Career or vocational counselors work with clients to help them prepare for careers. Career counselors help clients identify their unique interests, strengths and talents, as well as capitalize on them to find their best career path. Career counselors may work in universities to support faculty development, for large corporations, or open private counseling practices.

Drug abuse counselors help patients identify the underlying causes of their addiction. Drug abuse counselors are often responsible for following patients completing comprehensive drug treatment. It is arguably one of the most challenging career choice for mental health counselors, as drug addicts often have a variety of other mental health disorders . Drug counselors commonly work in halfway houses, homeless shelters, hospitals, jails/prisons, and drug/alcohol treatment centers .

Some states require, and many organizations prefer, that you be a former addict yourself.

;
, Interview a counselor or counselors in the areas you are interested in. The best way to decide if a career is a good fit, is to interview someone who is already in that career. Contact local schools, clinics or rehab centers (wherever your counselor of interest would work) and express your interest in becoming a counselor. Ask if they would put you in contact with their counselor for an informational interview. Not everyone will accept, but you should be able to find someone happy to talk about their career.

, When interviewing someone about their job it is important that you properly prepare. Remember that the person you are interviewing is doing you a favor, so be respectful of their time.


Be considerate of the counselor's time, schedule the meeting on their side of town, and at a time that works best for them. Common places to meet are coffee houses, but the counselor may also prefer to meet during the day at their office.
Make a token gesture. If you meet at a coffee shop or restaurant, make sure you pick up the tab. If you meet in the office, consider bringing a small token, such as a $10 gift card for coffee or the movies.
Prepare questions ahead of time. Again you do not want to waste their time, prepare question ahead of time, so that you use the time efficiently. Common questions you may decide to ask are:

What is your education background?
How did you decide to become a counselor?
Is your education/career path typical?
What is your favorite part of the job?
What is the most challenging part of the job?
What do imagine the future is like for your career?
How is the work/life balance?
If you had to do it all over again, what would you do?


Make sure you bring a pen and paper to write down any important things gleaned from your conversation.
Be professional. Do not underestimate the power of informative interviews. It may be nothing more that a one time conversation, but you never know when you might make a lifelong ally and friend in the field. Therefore, dress and treat the informative interview like the real thing. Dress appropriately, keep your jokes clean and your attitude professional.
Bring a business card to exchange.
Update your LinkedIn account and clean up your Facebook page. Being professional does not end at an interview. Keep your online presence professional as well. It is common for prospective employers to google your name.

Find the best location for your work.,
Apply for cosmetology openings in and around your community.,
Develop the skills you need to be a great cosmetologist.,
Keep your skills current.,
Develop a strong client base.,
Expand your business.",How to Become a Cosmetologist," Most cosmetology programs require you to be at least 16 years of age and to have a high school diploma or a GED to enter. But every state has slightly different regulations and requirements, so before you proceed, you should check with the cosmetology boards of different states to see what you need to do.In some cases, different cosmetology schools will also have stricter requirements than the states, so you'll have to look into those on an individual basis as well.


Some high schools even allow juniors and seniors to enter vocational programs for cosmetology. These programs give students a jump start on being full cosmetologists and give them valuable hours and experience that can count toward their hours for cosmetology school.;
, Cosmetology students enroll in state licensing beauty schools, job skills beauty schools or degree granting beauty schools. Tuition and fees for cosmetology schools range from $10,000 to $20,000, depending on the courses offered, the school's location, hours of education required and the facilities and equipment available. You can enroll in cosmetology school at a private school, community college, or a for-profit cosmetology program.Make sure that you look at at least three different schools in your area and compare the prices, the percentage of students that find jobs, and the duration of the program.
Talk to the admissions counsellors at each school to find which school is the best fit for you.
Some schools offer courses for part-time students or night courses so that you can get the education with a more flexible schedule. If this is important for you, it should be a priority.

, Most schools take between 9-15 months to complete. While most states require around 1,600 training hours before you get your license, some require a lot more or less, falling in the range of 1,000 hours and 2,300 hours. You'll have to put in long hard hours and learn a variety of subjects that range from hair coloring to human anatomy. You'll have to attend class, pass exams, and get many hours of hands-on practice. Here are some of the things you may have to do in school:Take courses that teach you about human anatomy and chemistry and how to wash, cut and style hair.
Learn about the chemicals used in coloring, straightening and making hair curly or wavy.
Learn how to give facials and facial massages.
Learn about the chemicals you use when you give a client a facial chemical peel.
Learn how to wax the different areas of your clients' bodies--including the upper lip, eyebrows, underarms, legs and pubic areas.
Learn about microdermabrasion.
Learn how to administer a microdermabrasion on your clients' faces.

, Finding a specialty can also help you land a job; it typically takes about 600 extra hours of coursework to specialize. Though your job title can be ""cosmetologist,"" there are a wide variety of specialties and job titles that you can take on after additional training. And remember that cosmetologists can also work as magazine editors or consultants or as marketing specialists, though getting some years as a cosmetologist under your belt can help you land one of these careers. Here are the variety of job titles that you can hold in this position:Beautician
Hairstylist
Wedding stylist
Barber stylist
Nail technician
Manager stylist
Salon assistant
Spa manager

, All 50 states require cosmetology graduates to take and pass a licensing examination. Licensing requirements include meeting the individual state's guidelines for licensure. Each licensing applicant has to pass written questions and practical testing in skin care, applying makeup and hair care. Applicants can earn a cosmetology, esthetician or nail technician license.You can also get your cosmetology license and then continue to pursue other specialities.
When you pass your exam, you'll still have to pay a licensing fee.

, This is a great way to get your foot in the door and to gain more valuable experience. And if you're having trouble finding a job, this can also help you become a better applicant. To do this, you'll have to register for an apprenticeship at a local beauty salon and gain the experience for up to 2 years.


You should still get paid for the apprenticeship, but you wouldn't get paid as much as a full cosmetologist.

, Not every cosmetologist works in a beauty salon. In fact, many cosmetologists are self-employed or even work part time. This allows them more time and flexibility throughout the week. If you want to have your own practice, you'll need to put in some hours at another business first. But you have some flexibility in choosing where you can work. Here are the most common locations:Beauty salons and barbershops
Day spas, hotel spas, resort spas
Retail beauty supply locations
Nursing and residential care homes

, Applying for a position at a salon as a cosmetologist is much like applying for any other job: you'll need to write your resume, make phone calls, check which salons have openings, and leave your resumes with salons that don't have openings just in case a job opens up at a later time. You can also search for open positions online. Just remember that even if you submit a resume, it's best to follow up in person or over the phone so you are more likely to get noticed and to look serious about the position.


As with any other profession, it helps to have connections. If you make a connection to a beauty salon during cosmetology school or know someone who works at a salon, you'll be more likely to get a job.
If you're open to relocating, then it may benefit you to move to an area that has particularly high employment for cosmetologists. The five metropolitan areas with the highest employment for cosmetologists are Palm Coast, FL, Ocean City, NJ, Longview, WA, Mansfield, OH, and Springfield, OH.

, It's one thing to snag a job as a cosmetologist, and another to be truly excellent in your career. If you want to be a great cosmetologist, then you have to put in the hours to learn how to work with different hair and skin types. But it takes more than that. Here are some other skills you'll have to develop as you move forward in your profession:Stellar communication skills. If you want your clients to be happy, then you have to be able to talk to them about what vision they have for their hair and skin and to know how to give them what they want (within reason).
Great social skills. This is different from being able to talk to a client about what hairstyle she wants. You'll often have to spend more than an hour working with each client, and you'll need to know how to make small talk, make your clients feel comfortable, and even how to make them laugh. If you want your clients to keep coming back to you, you have to know how to socialize with them.
Business and financial experience. This is crucial to have, especially if you are or are thinking about being self-employed.
Artistic skills and ability. The more hours you put in, the better sense you'll have about what will and won't work for all of your client.
Ability to multi-task. You will have to work with many clients in one day and will often have to use a variety of skills at any given point.

, If you want to succeed in your profession, then you have to keep your skills up to date and to be aware of current trends in your industry. What's popular in hair and makeup today is very different than what was popular ten -- or even five -- years ago, so it's important to know how to give your clients exactly what they want in this day and age. Here are some ways to keep your skills as current as possible:Attend trend shows
Enroll in continuing education classes
Subscribe to popular style magazines
Read style blogs

, Without your clients, your career won't add up to much. If you want to be a great cosmetologist, then you have to develop a loyal and growing client base and make sure that the people who see you want to see you again -- and again. To develop a strong base, you need to know how to talk to your clients, make them feel at home, and to let them know how much you value your business.


Whenever you finish with a client, you have to encourage him or her to book his or her next appointment. Say, ""If you want to keep up that new haircut, you'll have to come back in one month. Make sure you book an appointment.""
Ask for referrals. Your clients can also send their friends and acquaintances your way, often for a discount. This is another way to grow your client base.
Make your clients feel important. Remember the names of their kids or husbands and ask about them the next time you see them. Show them that you don't just see dollar signs when they sit in your chair.

, Once you've gained enough experience working for someone else, you can consider opening up your own salon or beauty establishment. It'll be much easier if you build a strong client base first so you know you'll have clients in your new business, and it'll also help to make connections with other cosmetologists that you can potentially hire for your business. Though having your own business will be more work, you will reap more rewards if you succeed.You can also consider moving up to a managerial position at a beauty salon or a spa. This will also give you a pay bump and less hands-on work.

Know the responsibilities of a CNA.,
Ask to shadow a CNA for a day.,
Educate yourself on career expectations.",How to Become a CNA1," CNA stands for certified nursing assistant. Being a CNA means being a member of a health team and working under the supervision of a certified nurse.


A CNA's job is hands-on. You provide care to patients, residents, clients, and customers. It's a busy job and hours are usually long.A CNA's work is generally in the realm of non-invasive procedures. Assistance is a big part of the job. You will help with bathing, toilet issues, dressing, eating, and oral care when patients cannot perform these tasks alone. You will also monitor vital signs and assure a patient's dietary restrictions are met.While the job is not glamorous, it is important. You're essentially responsible for assuring patients are treated with dignity and respect and bridging the communication gap between doctors, nurses, and patients. Important information is transferred from patient to nurse/doctor via the CNA.;
, A CNA is not like other professional pursuits. It's highly rewarding work but also very challenging. As so much of the profession involves hands-on care, the best way to know if you're up to the task is to witness a CNA in action.


If you are a high school or college student, your school might have a program where you can shadow professionals. Check with your principle or with the Office of Student Affairs and see if you can set something up with CNA in your area.
Call local hospitals. Even if they don't have pre-existing programs for shadowing nursing assistants, they might be willing to work with you if you express interest.
This is also a great way to make career connections that could be vital in finding a job down the line. Stay in touch with the CNA you shadow and do not hesitate to ask them for career advice.

, While some people choose CNA as a longterm career, others use it as a stepping stone to other medical professions. Figure out why you want to become a CNA and whether you hope to advance to other positions. Carefully consider what a career as a CNA looks like before making any major decisions.


Compassion is key to becoming a successful CNA. You must have a genuine desire to help people that will fuel you through difficult times. The environment of a hospital or nursing home is fast-paced, and many young CNA's feel initially overwhelmed by the position.A CNA is not a high paying job, especially when compared to the salaries of nurses and doctors. However, on the upside CNA's are always in great demand. The lack of direct care has been a major issue in hospitals across the country. While the position may not pay as much as others, job security and availability is greater.You might not plan to stay a CNA forever. A CNA is often used as a stepping stone to becoming a nurse or doctor and the experience of working with patients hands-on is invaluable to a medical career. Your capacity for bedside manner, compassion, and communication can be greatly enhanced by having years of CNA experience going into the medical field.

It's slightly harder to study for the clinical skills test, as it's more hands-on, but brushing up on procedures is a good way to prepare.Ask CNA's you worked with during your training about the exam. Ask them what areas they found most challenging and anything you can do to improve your chances of passing.

The clinical skills test, where you perform medical skills in front of evaluators, will take about 35 to 45 minutes., Yet again, requirements vary from state-to-state but you can retake the exam.


Depending on which portion you failed, and your score, some states may require you to wait a period of 2 weeks to 90 days before retaking the exam. Check with your local certification board.Some states are stricter about the CNA exam and require you to redo your training in addition to retaking the test.

If you’re currently a student or planning to get an undergraduate degree, you should consider majoring in a computer-related field so you’re sure to have the necessary knowledge that employers look for.In addition to computer science, you might earn a degree in computer engineering, software engineering, information systems, information technology, and mixed discipline fields, such as computer science and math or bioinformatics.
You can still be a CIO if you didn’t major in a computer science related field as long as you have a detailed and comprehensive knowledge of computers and information technology.
If you want to earn a bachelor’s degree while working, many online colleges and universities offer computer science programs, which can make it easier to fit classes into your schedule.

, In addition to an undergraduate degree in a computer field, many CIOs also have an advanced degree in business administration, such as a Master’s of Business Administration (MBA).

A full-time MBA program typically takes two years to complete.You don’t necessarily have to get your MBA or other business-related graduate degree right after your undergraduate degree.

, In order to be an effective CIO, employers will expect that you have significant work experience in the IT field. They want to know that you not only have the necessary IT knowledge, but that you understand how the department functions and the role that it plays in the success of a business. Start out in an entry-level position, such as a software developer or network analyst, and look for opportunities to advance into higher level roles.In general, you’ll likely need between 10 and 15 years of work experience in the IT field to be considered for a CIO role. The type of positions that you’ve held and the amount of management experience that you have will likely determine how much is necessary.
It’s particularly helpful to take on roles that combine IT and business responsibilities, such as a business analyst. In that role, you’ll analyze how the company’s software, hardware, and other IT equipment and systems are working and what the best options for the business are.
You should also look for positions that allow you to oversee large scale projects, so you have experience managing an IT team and seeing a task through to completion.

, In addition to IT experience, employers want a CIO who has management skills. You’ll likely have to oversee your company’s IT managers, project leaders, and other key IT personnel, so it’s important to have experience managing a team and motivating employees.You might start out managing a single project, and move on to full-time management role, such as IT security manager. The goal should be advancing to an overall IT manager or director position.

, Some CIOs have experience working in a management consultancy capacity. That means they’ve worked with companies to help improve their performance by using their IT expertise. A consultant role is impressive on your resume because it shows employers that you know how to combine IT and business roles, and allows you to provide concrete figures on how you’ve worked to improve a company’s performance with your knowledge of IT.You can work as a freelance consultant, but it can be difficult to build up a client base unless you have many contacts in the business world. It’s usually best to look for a position at a consultancy firm if you want this type of experience.

, Communication skills are crucial for an effective CIO. Not only do they have to be able to communicate with their staff, they must be able to translate highly technical IT information into clear language that other executives and staff can understand. You must be comfortable speaking in front of large groups too.If you don’t have experience with public speaking, you may want to join a local Toastmasters club so you can become more comfortable and confident when you’re speaking to larger groups.
Strong writing skills are also important for a CIO. Take a business writing class if you need help improving your writing.
Depending on the industry that you’re in, being multilingual can help improve your communication skills. Languages such as Spanish, Chinese, and French can be helpful when you’re an executive. Look into classes in your area, online courses, or software programs.

, A CIO must have strong leadership skills in order to oversee the IT team and motivate the staff to work for the good of the organization. Make sure that you listen effectively to others so you can get a better sense of what they’re feeling and how you can help them become more invested in the work.It’s also important to be able to resolve conflicts among staff. Make sure to listen to both sides of the conflict and act responsibly, so your staff respects you.
If you want to improve your leadership skills, you may want to attend a leadership workshop, which can help you learn to communicate, motivate, and manage employees more effectively.

, If you’re a CIO, you’ll likely need to be on call around the clock in the event that there’s an IT problem. You must be devoted to the job and willing to sacrifice your personal time if you’re going to succeed in the role. Make sure that you’re ready to make that type of commitment before pursuing a CIO position."

Ask yourself if porn is the right industry for you.,
Remember that you must be 18 years old to act in pornography.,
Know how much you will be paid.,
Know where porn is made.,
Know that it is very hard to become a porn ""star.""",How to Be a Pornstar1," On the outset, porn seems like the perfect career for adventurous, sexually-active actors. You get paid to have sex almost every day, and the pay is actually pretty good once you get started. But porn comes with a series of risks as well, and they may outweigh the perceived benefits. Things to remember include:


Your image, once filmed, will be online forever, even if you try and switch careers.
You need to take the time every day to stay in shape, eat well, and keep clean and hygienic.
You are not having sex for fun, you are doing it for your job. Expect the intimacy and spontaneity of sex to disappear during a 4-hour video shoot.Maintaining a committed relationship while in porn can be almost impossible, as jealousy is only natural.;
, This is a heavily enforced rule in the porn industry because breaking it can lead to years of prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. Even if you are a consenting, willing participant, you must be 18 to be in porn in the United States.You must bring proof of age (valid passport, ID, etc.) to with you to a shoot in order to act. Producers are required to copy this proof and keep it on record for years., The average rate for a straight porn star in Brooklyn, NY, is $500-600 for one video shoot. Gay porn stars, however, make three times that, no matter the gender. The general rule of thumb is that the weirder it is from “average,” the more you will get paid. So a straight, guy-girl scene might make $800 while an intense bondage or novelty scene can make $2,000 or more.The average female porn star averages $50,000 a year, but can make upwards of $350,000.
Top male performers can make more than $100,000 each year, but average far less., Strictly speaking, it is only legally possible to make or act in porn in Los Angeles and New Hampshire.That said, most videos are not location specific, making it impossible to determine where it was shot, so producers will often make videos anywhere. There is a porn industry in many major cities, but to have the best chance of breaking in you need to move to LA. Some major hubs include:


Los Angeles, San Fernando Valley, California. This is the porn capital of the world.New York City, New York
Orlando, Tampa, and Miami, FloridaSan Diego and San Francisco, CA
Portland, OR, The porn industry is inundated with young talent that flocks to Los Angeles hoping to make it big. The sad reality, however, is that not everyone can be a well-known, marketable star in any industry. If the only reason you want to be in porn is to be famous, pulling in a six-figure salary every year, you will be sorely disappointed. The porn industry is at its most competitive thanks to the explosion of internet porn, so be ready to work hard to make a name for yourself. Porn is not a lavish lifestyle, it is a job, and you need to treat it as such.


While no one should ever force you to do something, having wider preferences and being willing to try more things will lead to more gigs and greater success."

Remember that all body types are beautiful, and lucrative, in porn.,
Take flattering photographs, both nude and clothed.,
Get a full HIV and STD test.,
Set personal boundaries about what types of sex you will willingly engage in.,
Check out modeling forums to look for casting calls.,
Petition porn studios with your photos.,
Bring a friend or chaperone with you to your audition to prevent scams.,
Be ready to perform.,
Alternatively, make your own videos and post them online.",How to Be a Pornstar2," One of the most interesting facets of porn is how inclusive it is. Since there is a desire for almost any type of man or woman on the internet, almost any type of man or woman can find a niche in the porn industry. What matters most is confidence on camera, not your look.That said, make sure you show your best side for the camera. Exercise, a healthy diet, and a good posture will all help you go far on camera.

, Producers are most concerned with your look as they cast porn, so they need to see if you will fit in their next video. Capture as much of your body as you can, showing off your best assets whenever possible. If you have an incredible chest, puff it out slightly and make it the center of the photograph. If you are proud of you booty, curve your body so that it is in the frame. The shots you absolutely need are:


Full body, clothed scantily (tight t-shirt and shorts, lacy tops, etc.)
Full-body, nude. Men should have a full erection.
Headshot.

, One of the benefits of the modern porn industry is its insistence on safe, healthy sex. Any porn shoot you get will demand a current (under 30-days old) STD test to make sure no one contracts a dangerous disease while shooting. You can get an STD test at:


Your local Planned Parenthood.
Your physician.
The hospital or health clinic.

The CDC has a free search engine to find clinics across the country that will test you for HIV and STDs free of charge., If you wouldn’t do it for free at home, you shouldn’t do it for money. Keep this in mind as you book gigs, as it will help you stay happy and healthy as your career begins. Know your limits and “no-go” areas and be honest with producers before taking a gig. Some of the most common types of porn include:


’’’Fetish:’’’ Fetish porn is made to fit a specific, often odd, desire. It can feature almost anything, from costumes of famous TV shows to a predilection for feet.
’’’BDSM:’’’ Standing for “Bondage, Discipline, and Sado-Masochism, this extreme variety of porn features whips, chains, handcuffs, masks, and black leather.
’’’Sexual Acts:’’’ There is a variety of sexual acts and specialty porn genres out there, and you need to know what you are signing up for before showing up. When in doubt, do your research on the large list of porn terms and vocabulary.


, Online forums, found easily with an online search for “Adult Modeling Forums,” allow you to post your pictures and search for casting calls. Never give your real name or address on these forums, and instead wait until you are contacted back by a producer who is interested in you.You will have to begin in amateur porn before you will be paid for professional porn.

, Go directly to nearby porn studios and send them your information through their website’s “contact us” button. Go online and research “Adult Film Studios + your area” to find nearby studios, or check out aggregate sites like Sexyjobs.com to find potential listings.

, If a producer says that you cannot bring a guest because it is a “closed set,” then don’t take the audition. You need to protect yourself against scams, and the best way to do this is to have a partner to watch your back.For detailed information, classes, and up-to-date changes on laws in adult education, you should sign up for a free National Association for the Advancement of Science & Art in Sexuality (NAASAS) membership online.

If a gig seems too good to be true (paying 1,000s of dollars for minimal work) or does not give you concrete details (what you’ll be doing, where, for how long, and for how much), don’t take the gig.

, An audition will be more than just showing up and snapping a few pictures. You need to be ready to get in the sack and be professional and cooperative. If you’ve booked an audition, you need to know that you’ll be on camera for your first gig. Prepare accordingly.


Look nice – wear clean clothes, shower, and groom your private areas.
Be on time.
Have proof of age and a recent (2-weeks old or less) STD test.
If you’re a man, show up with a girl. Ron Jeremy famously said that the only way to get into porn is to bring a woman with you. Make sure she is willing to take part as well., The internet age has made it possible for anyone to break into the industry with a camera and a consenting partner. The site MakeLoveNotPorn.tv, for example, let’s you post your videos online and make 50% of the profits when people download it. This can be a great way to get comfortable on camera, test your limits, and gain traction in the porn industry.Focus on what makes you happy. Be natural on camera and the audience will enjoy it.
You can point potential producers to these videos later as a sort of “porn resume.”

Sign with a talent agency for porn stars.,
Invent a screen name for your porn persona.,
Be a professional on-set.,
Know that you will have to conform to someone else’s standards.,
Never sign a modeling release form until you’ve been paid.,
Diversify your options.",How to Be a Pornstar3," Agencies help you book gigs, protect you in case of contract disputes, and put you in touch with other stars and producers. A list of licensed adult agencies can be found on the LATATA website, where you can contact them with your pictures, past movies, or questions. Search around their websites to find one that fits your boundaries and desires. Some large, famous agencies include:


LA Direct
OC Modeling
Burning Angel
Spiegler Girls
Lucas Entertainment
World Modeling, While there is no law saying you cannot use your real name, it is usually easier to keep your career under wraps if you make up a new name, or ‘’nom de porn.’’ While you can choose anything, from the normal sounding Ron Jeremy and Jenna Jameson to the more absurd Moe the Monster or Brick Steel, you should try and keep things relatively simple.


The most common first names are Lisa, Angel, Nicole, Jessica, and Vanessa (female), or David, Tony, Mike, Steve, and Jason (male).
The most common last names are Love, Star, Foxx, Rose, and Sweet (female), or Lee, James, Stone, Steel, Black, and Williams (male)., Much like a typical movie shoot, porn requires an enormous amount of coordination between cameramen, directors, sound engineers, lighting crews, and actors to succeed. Don’t walk in expecting to be a king – you should be ready for a full 3-4 hours of shooting, re-shooting, and posing. You may have to shoot the same scene 5 times, and you need to deliver and lines and show up at the right place every time. This will be harder than you think after 3-4 hours of near constant performance in the bed.


Hit your placement – there is usually a place on the ground, marked by tape, that you have to find and stand on without looking down.
Show up on time, with the proper paperwork documenting your age and STD test.
Be open and honest on set. Tell the producers your limits beforehand and ask for some time if you have trouble getting it up, getting in costume, or setting a scene., Porn is entertainment for other people, and the director, writers, and producers will all have a vision for what is the most appealing scene. You need to be flexible and willing to change, whether that means putting on costumes, working frequently, or using shots and pills to enhance your “goods.” This won’t always be pleasant, but is necessary to develop a strong, lasting career.

, This may anger producers, but you need to look out for yourself to avoid getting scammed. Wait until you have cash or a check in hand to before signing the contract to make sure your rights are respected., A straight male or female who only does one type of porn is, unfortunately, not going to get a lot of work. The porn industry is constantly changing and evolving, and it requires actors who are flexible, eager, and willing to try new things. While you should always respect your boundaries, test out new gigs as you become comfortable in the industry to take your career to the next level.Remember, the weirder the shoot, the more you usually get paid.
Scenes with multiple or same-sex partners often pay the most.

Be approachable.,
Avoid lingering.,

Exchange business cards.,
Follow up with an email.",How to Attend a Career Networking Event," Trade associations and industry events can be an effective way to learn more about your field and get the inside scoop on current trends. However, you aren't likely to generate leads at trade association events, where everyone is competing for the same business contracts. If your goal is to increase sales, consider events where several different industries are represented.In addition to business-focused networking events, consider non-profit, social, cultural, and athletic events.;
, Potential business contacts will appreciate hearing about your business, but will be turned off by a sales pitch. Be prepared to share your company's mission with a concise description. To help people remember you, provide an interesting example of a current or recent project.Prepare your response ahead of time so that you don’t fumble with your words or make the description too lengthy.

, Before you attend the event, create a list of goals that you can focus on while you’re at the networking event. This will help you stay focused on the task at hand and remind you of why you’re going in the first place.

Some good examples might include finding a new job, making new contacts in a specific niche in your market, or expanding your business’ revenue by opening up new sales markets.

, A crucial aspect of any networking event is making contacts and giving out your business cards to those contacts. Showing up sans business cards can look unprofessional, and will decrease the likelihood of being contacted by the people you connect with at the networking event.Make sure to reorder your business cards when your supply is running low. You don’t want to realize you’re out of new cards as you are heading out the door for a networking event.
Try to bring at least 20 business cards with you to each event. You wouldn’t want to run out before the event is over!

, Even if your daily work environment is casual, jeans and other casual clothing are often not acceptable for networking events. When in doubt, call the event organizer and ask about suggested attire.For men, slacks with a button-up shirt and a blazer should work for most events. A tie is probably not necessary, but it never hurts to go that extra mile.
For women, a work-appropriate pantsuit or a mid-length dress with pumps and hose would be suitable for a networking event.

, When you meet a new contact, you should introduce yourself by stating your name and giving a brief description of your affiliation with the event. Try to continue the conversation by asking questions of the new person and listening when they speak. Maintain an air of professionalism during the introduction.

Try something like, “ Hi, I’m Ben. I work in marketing at XYZ Telecommunications.”

, Making eye contact is crucial when meeting new people. It conveys confidence and likability, which is part of the good first impression you want to make. It also lets people know that you are engaged, interested, and listening to what they say.When you meet a new person at a networking event, make eye contact with them as you introduce yourself, shake hands, and continue the conversation.

, At events like this, it’s important to seem friendly and approachable. Otherwise, you might walk away with zero extra contacts. Keep a smile on your face and be sure to ask questions about the other person. This will make you appear more sincere and likeable.

Avoid lugging around a huge portfolio of your work with you, as this makes you seem less approachable.

, When you meet a new person, don’t stick with them for the rest of the night. This might be tempting, especially if you’re attending the event alone, but you don’t want to overstay your welcome. Once you have finished your conversation and exchanged business cards, move on to another contact.This will give you (and the person you’re talking to) a chance to make more contacts, meet more people, and be more successful overall at the event.
Even if you really hit it off with someone, move on to another contact so you can network as effectively as possible. You can always return to those contacts that seem especially beneficial. You don’t want to appear as if you are hogging one person’s attention for the entire event.

, You can strike up a new conversation with another event attendee by simply introducing yourself. Give the highlights of your professional situation, but try to devote a bit of time to asking questions about the other person. People love to talk about themselves, so this will seem very engaging to the other person.Spend about five to ten minutes with each new contact, and try talking to as many people as possible.

, After you've made some connections, hand out your business cards and ask for theirs in return. This exchange is important in developing reciprocal relationships in the future.Keep these cards in a rolodex or some other place for safe keeping. You never know when you may need to refer back to an old contact’s business card.

, For contacts that you find particularly beneficial, don’t wait too long after the event to contact them with a follow up. You don’t want them to have a hard time remembering your conversation.If you don’t have something to discuss at the moment, you could just send a short email saying you enjoyed meeting them, and giving a brief recap of your discussion.
Try something like this: “Hi, Greg. This is James from the trade convention. I wanted to send a quick note to tell you that it was a pleasure meeting you. I really enjoyed our conversation about my company’s accounting software, and I look forward to the possibility of a future collaboration.”

Don't feel your job search and your job is all about you.,
Stay upbeat.",How to Avoid Sabotaging Your Job Search," Be proactive. Follow up inquiries, take the opportunity to broaden your network, and put yourself 'out there'.;
, Don't take what you may have heard someone say, as gospel. You aren't too old, too young, too experienced, too inexperienced.

, Your unemployment will not last forever. The job that you may be blowing off as not the perfect job could very well lead to one that is. Even if it doesn't, you can valuable experience with every position you hold.

, Remember that you need to be the answer that someone is seeking. Make it all about them.

Talk to the right person.,
Take the direct approach.,
Send an email.,
Schedule a time for a sit down.",How to Ask Someone for a Job1," Do a little research to find out who’s in charge of making hiring decisions for the company you wish to work for. For small private businesses this may be the owner themselves, or it may be a human resources officer or staffing director at a big corporation. Going through the appropriate channels is the first step toward gaining an audience.With most retail and service jobs, you can simply walk in and request to speak to a manager.
If you have a friend or acquaintance that works for the company, see if they could give you some advice or help set up a meeting between you and one of the higher ups.;
, Once you get a chance to speak to someone with some influence, let them know up front that you’re interested in working for them. Show them that you’re eager, enthusiastic and ready to work hard. Chances are, they’ll be impressed by your initiative.The key is to be assertive, but not too forceful. Never make demands of an employer or come in with a sense of entitlement.
Open with a statement like ""I think I would be a very good fit for your company"" or ""I believe my ideas and ambition could be of real service to your operations."", Be sure to attach your resume, an original cover letter explaining why you're interested in the job and a link to the open position, if it was posted online. These days, most established companies screen potential employees electronically, so this will be your first opportunity to make contact with the people you could be working for in the future. Emailing an employer directly is much more personable than mass-posting your resume to various job search websites.Be explicit about the purpose of the email with a subject line like ""Senior Editor Position.""
Always be cordial, professional and prompt in your email correspondence. Hiring supervisors pay close attention to the way prospective employees communicate., In some instances, the person offering a job might be a family friend, acquaintance or former business associate. If this is the case, it will usually be okay to meet with them casually to discuss the details of the job. Find a time that fits the employer's schedule and be prepared to tell them a little about yourself and what you're looking for.Set up a meeting by calling or speaking to the employer in person ahead of time.
Even if it's not a formal interview, you should plan on showing up early and looking respectable.Don't assume that you'll be guaranteed a job just because you know someone. You should treat the sit down with the same respect and consideration you would any other professional situation.

List your qualifications.,
Demonstrate your usefulness.,
Show an interest in the business.,
Establish a mutual connection.,
Use plural language.,
Find out how you can follow up.",How to Ask Someone for a Job2," Describe yourself and your experience in the field. Include an overview of your recent job history, as well as any relevant education and volunteering opportunities. Don’t assume that the person in charge of hiring will recognize the value of your skills immediately—make them see how they will prove useful.Don’t just recite what’s on your resume. Explain to the employer how those qualifications can be applied and adapted: ""as you can see, my four years as a teacher have provided valuable experience in working closely with groups of all different ages.""
If you don’t have any experience to speak of, focus on the aspects of your personality that you think would make you a good fit for the position.

, Don’t wait until you’ve been hired to start being an asset for the company. Be proactive and tell your contact or interviewer exactly what sort of things you would bring to the table. Doing this shows resourcefulness and makes it clear that you’ve put serious thought into filling the position you’re seeking.Entice the employer with an idea on how to boost productivity, a writing sample or an example of a program you helped develop.
This is often as simple as mentioning past accomplishments like ""at my last job I helped overhaul the new employee training program,"" or hinting at future ones like ""I look forward to seeing how working in a more organized kitchen will help me improve my skills as a cook.""
Providing a preview of the kind of work you do can help you showcase your practical abilities, allowing the company to feel confident in their decision to hire you.

, Read up on the company’s history, goals and product or service to familiarize yourself with what they’re all about. Then, tailor your pitch to highlight the qualities of yours that are consistent with their business model. Many employers will be more willing to give you a chance if they think you have the best interest of the company at heart.Make it evident to the person you’re meeting with that you want a job with their company, not just any company.
Avoid saying things like “I need a job” or “I heard you were hiring.” You’ll make a much better impression if you appear to be actively pursuing the job you’re asking for., Point out the things that you have in common with your contact, such as a close friend or associate. If somebody you know referred you to the job, be sure to mention them by name as someone that can vouch for your character. Networking is an important part of the job search because it suggests that you can be trusted.Bring up your relationship with your connection in a way that sounds organic. For instance, you could say “my friend Christina told me that she loved working with you” or “my uncle has always been a satisfied client of yours.”
Don’t rely on namedropping to get you hired. You should be able to secure the job on your own merits—having a friend or two in common just helps., Instead of referring to yourself in the first person, use words like “us,” “we” and “our.” When you talk like you’re already a part of the team, the person you’re speaking to will begin to see you that way. This may make them more likely to seal the deal and bring you onboard.Listen for the other person to start using plural language as well. This is a good sign that you’re winning them over.

, If you’re uncomfortable with the thought of boldly asking for the job, you can try moving things along in another way. Before you leave or hang up the phone, see if you can get more information about the next phase of the hiring process. Ask questions like ""when would be a good time for me to call you back and go over some of this information in more detail?""Request feedback to get an idea of how you did, or what you could do differently next time.For most employers, the fact that you’re already looking forward to what you can do next will be taken as a promising sign.

Put some effort into your appearance.,
Communicate clearly and effectively.,
Be tenacious.",How to Ask Someone for a Job3," Before you show up for an interview or friendly sit down, take some time to pick out a set of attire that fits you well and is appropriate for the occasion. You want to look sharp, but don’t be too casual or make a spectacle of yourself. Remember to comb your hair, brush your teeth and make sure that your clothing is free of dust and wrinkles.

In addition to the obvious, be sure to wear deodorant, clean beneath your fingernails and keep facial hair shaved or trimmed.As the old saying goes, “dress for the job you want.” If you look the part, potential employers will be better able to envision you in the position.

, Aim for a tone that’s relaxed and friendly yet professional. When you’re not talking, listen attentively without interrupting. The person you’re speaking to should be just as comfortable with you as you are with them. Give detailed answers to the questions you’re asked, but resist the urge to boast or talk about yourself at length.Do your best not to stutter, mumble or use a lot of filler noises like “um” and “ah.”
If you’re asking for a job via email, take care to use proper spelling, punctuation and grammar. Proofread the message carefully before you send it., Just because you don’t get a job offer right away doesn’t mean that you never will. It may be that the specific position hasn’t opened up yet, or that whoever’s in charge needs more time to interview other applicants. Follow up with a phone call or email within a few days to let someone know that you’re still interested and hopeful to hear back.Confidence speaks volumes. Sometimes, what you lack in direct experience you can make up for in being self-assured.While determination is a good trait to have, you should learn to take no for an answer.
Don’t be too discouraged if you don't get the job—thank the person for their time, then redouble your efforts and make sure you’re prepared for the next opportunity that comes along."

Ask about next steps at your interview.,
Don’t ask if you got the job right away.,
Send a thank you note after your interview.,
Time your follow up email.,
Remind the hiring manager who you are.,
Let the hiring manager know if you’ve had other offers.,
Limit your check-ins.",How to Ask if You Got the Job," At the end of your interview, the hiring manager will likely ask you if you have any questions. This is a great time to ask more about the company or specific job, but you should also ask what happens next.For example, ask the hiring manager how long the post-interview process might take, if you can expect to hear from the company whether you got the job or not, and when you might hear something. You can also ask what the best way is of contacting the hiring manager if you have questions.;
, If your interview goes well, you might be tempted to ask the hiring manager on the spot if you got the job. Don’t do this. It can make you look desperate, which can be a turn off for the hiring manager.It’s also likely that the hiring manager won’t be able to give you an answer right away. They may have more candidates to interview, or they might need to discuss all of the candidates with a larger group of people.

, This isn’t directly related to asking if you got the job, but it will keep you on the mind of the hiring manager. In your note, remind the hiring manager of who you are, what you interviewed for, and something that excites you about the company or position.For example, you can say something like “Dear Jim, I wanted to thank you for the opportunity to interview for the assistant manager position at Jim’s Bakery. I really enjoyed the interview, and I’m so excited about the new products that Jim’s Bakery is innovating!”
Don't ask for an update about the position in this note, just use it to thank the manager for interviewing you.

, Give the hiring manager or recruiter some time to go over all of the interviews they did. They might also need to speak to other people in the HR department, and are often prevented from discussing the opening until they’ve been given the green light to hire someone. Give them about a week to deal with those issues before you write a follow up email.If the hiring manager gave you an actual date by which they’re hoping to make a decision, wait a few days after that to follow up. The dates they give are usually optimistic, and other things may have come up.

, Your email should include your name, the position you applied for, and the date of your interview. The better you can remind the hiring manager who you are, the more likely you are to get a response.You can say something like, “Dear Jim, I hope things are going well. I was wondering if you could provide me with an update on the assistant manager position I interviewed for on May 5, 2017] Please let me know if I can provide you with any other information; I look forward to hearing from you.”

, If you’re interviewing for a new position, chances are you’re in the middle of a job search. If you’ve received another offer while waiting to hear from your first choice, let the hiring manager know. This gives you a solid reason to need to know and increases the likelihood that you’ll hear back.You can say something like “Dear Emily, I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to check on the status of the coordinator position I interviewed for on January 10. I’ve since received an offer from another company, but I’m still eager to hear from you about joining ABC Consulting. Could you offer me any update on the position? Thanks for your time.”

, If you’re waiting to hear about a job you’re really interested in, it can be tempting to check in until you get an answer, especially if the hiring manager encourages you to continue to do so. You should, however, give yourself a limit for check-ins, usually no more than three. If you don’t get an answer by then, move on to the other positions.If you don’t hear after three check-ins, it doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t get the job. But it does mean that the timeline is definitely longer than you initially thought, and you don’t want to waste energy on it when you could be working on following up on other leads!

Find their mission statement and understand what their overriding goals are. Also look at the descriptions of current employees and of positions so you can learn more about the kinds of people they hire and what their employees’ responsibilities are.Use LinkedIn, the company website, and other social media for this research.
Identify things about the company that appeal to you before you call in case you’re asked why you’re interested in working for them.

, If you plan to reach out to multiple companies, organize your information about each company in a spreadsheet. Make the contact information most prominent, so you can easily access it. Once you start calling, include the dates of each call, the outcomes, and the person you spoke with in this spreadsheet so you can refer back to it for any follow-up.

, Start by making bullet points to cover the main things you want to say. Include the phrases you plan to use to introduce yourself, some information about your experience, and the type of position you’re seeking. If you need to write a script, use words and expressions that reflect the way you really speak so you’ll sound natural.Introduce yourself. Use your full name. For example: “Good morning, Ms. Smith. My name is John Doe.”
Discuss your accomplishments if they’re pertinent to your inquiry. For example: “I am an experienced web designer and IT specialist with ten years experience, looking for new challenges.”
Say why you’re calling. For example: “I would appreciate a minute of your time to ask about vacancies in your IT department.”

, In preparation for the call, list the questions you have about the company. For example, you might ask about the types of positions that are available in your field and the best ways to follow up with an application. Inquire about other information that the company might need from you.Also think of questions you think you might be asked and prepare your answers for those questions.
For example, you may be asked why you’re applying with them, where you heard about the company, when you’d be available to interview or start work, and what salary range you’re looking for.

, Sit down in a quiet place with your script and list of questions and practice making the call. Try different ways to phrase things so that what you’re saying sounds natural. Time yourself to see how long it takes and try to keep your main points under a minute.Practice speaking clearly.
Also practice smiling when you speak. This will help you sound more confident.
Record yourself and listen to how you sound. Fix anything you don’t like about how you sound, like saying “um” a lot or speaking too quickly or in a monotone.

, Use the company’s website and your own knowledge about where you’re applying to work out the best time to call. Place your first call at the start of the workday. Try not to call during when you know will be busy times in the middle of the day. Also avoid calling during lunch., Make your call from a quiet space where you can focus on a professional conversation. Make sure you won’t be distracted by noise on the street or in your building. If there are other people around, tell them that you need peace and quiet for a phone call and can’t be disturbed.

, Lay out a pen or pencil and paper for taking notes and be sure your spreadsheet with contact and company information is in front of you so you can quickly reference it. Use a landline for a clearer connection and to reduce the risk of calls or texts interrupting your call. Have a glass of water with you in case your mouth gets dry.Don’t put the hiring manager on hold if another call does come through.
Aside from your water, don’t eat, drink, smoke, or chew gum during the call.

, Refer to your resume when answering questions about your experience. This way the information you provide during the call will be consistent with what the hiring manager sees on your resume. Make sure to update your resume before the call so the information you share is most current.Having your resume handy will also help you answer questions more fluently if you’re nervous during the call.

, During the call, record every detail you can. Include who you spoke with, their title, the time and date of the call, what they said, and what you promised you’d do for follow up. Also jot down any questions that surprised you, so you can research them and be better prepared for your next phone call.Put this information in your spreadsheet.
At the end of the call, review what you said you would do and confirm the person’s contact information from your notes.
For example, before saying thank you, say: “As promised, I’ll follow up with my resume and list of references in the next two business days.”

, Don’t reply to suggested times for interviews or follow-up meetings with an unprofessional and tentative “whenever.” Directly answer about when you’re available, for example: “I am free until noon on Tuesday and Wednesday and in the afternoon on Friday.” Have your calendar open during the call to make this easier.Prepare for the call by figuring out your availability for the two weeks following the call.
Don’t change appointments once you’ve made them unless you have a legitimate emergency.

, Be polite to everyone you speak with, including administrative staff and assistants. The boss could hear about it if you’re rude. Address the person you’re calling as “Mr.” or “Ms.” unless they tell you otherwise. Listen attentively when they speak and don’t interrupt. At the end of the call thank them for their time and attention, even if you aren’t successful.Preface your phone call by asking if the person has a few minutes to speak with you. If not, offer to call back later and ask the best time to do so.

, Write the person you spoke with a formal email to thank them for speaking with you. Send this the same day you make your phone call. Don’t delay sending the thank you by more than one day after the call. Unless you’ve been told not to pursue a job with the company, attach your resume and a tailored cover letter with information you learned from the phone call."

Assess your availability and ability.,
Check the prices for doing general handy work.,
Select the right neighbors.,
Ask in various ways whether work needs doing.",How to Ask if People Need Yard Work Done," The extent of work you're capable of will depend on the time you have available as well as your strength, so have a think about this before asking if anyone has work available––having a quick answer will be more impressive than asking whether you can think it over. For example:


Are you strong enough to lift heavy objects such as garden rocks, equipment and machinery?
Are you okay in all types of weather, rain, hall or shine?
Will you bring your own tools or only use those already on the property? Are you skilled in using all sorts of tools or only some? Are your old enough/qualified enough to use power tools?
What sorts of things do you like doing by way of yard work? You could specify just the exact jobs if you're really picky, or be open to all suggestions if you're willing to pitch in and work hard across a range of things.;
, Don't be too expensive or too cheap but do try to offer your services for less than professional competitors or you won't get a nibble.

, It's only going to be helpful to ask neighbors who have a yard, for starters. Also, if it's clear that someone keeps their yard immaculate already, they may not be interested in help; however, it can't hurt to ask if there is anything additional they need doing, such as winterizing the pool, shifting a load of logs or cleaning out the garden shed.


Ask the neighbors you know first, to get experience. You can then get references from them to start branching out to other houses. Moreover, by starting with people you know, you will be able to explain that you're on a learning curve about what you can and can't do by way of yard work. They're likely to be more understanding and give you some leeway if you over-extend yourself. The good thing is that you'll know for next time.

, There are different possible approaches, depending on how personal you'd like to make the approach, how many houses you're reaching out to and how many neighbors are likely to even be at home at the times you're thinking of calling. One or several of the following ways are good to use:


Simply knock on the door, introduce yourself and explain that you're looking for yard work. Dress neatly, look professional and have ready the types of yard work you're able to do.
Make flyers and put them in people's mailboxes. Ensure that they look professional and provide ample details on what you will do and at what cost, without being overly lengthy.
Run an ad in the local paper or on the local community or supermarket bulletin boards. A simple: ""Will do any yard work for $X per hour, ph. Johnny on XXX"" will do. It helps to provide pull-off numbers for people to take home.
Ask family, friends and neighbors if they know of anyone looking for yard work. This can be done by way of a casual conversation.

Bringing that up in conversation at the fair will make a good impression with the organization.

, Employers like it when you seem interested in the company and its background. Ask intelligent questions that can't be answered online and that make it look like you researched the company beforehand.Some good questions to ask are, “How is this company different from companies in the same industry?” and “What type of skills and experience do you need to have to work for this company?”, Know what days you are available in case a potential employer asks you for an interview.Look into the hours of operation for the companies that interest you so you'll be even more prepared to answer any scheduling questions at the career fair.

, When meeting with potential employers, a strong handshake is the best etiquette.Be polite when talking to career fair representatives; listen to what they have to say, don't interrupt, and avoid using slang language, as it will make you seem unprofessional.

, Use your pen and paper to write down important details like phone numbers and contact names. Creating a contact list will make it easier for you to review the positive and negative aspects you learned from various career recruiters and follow up with representatives after the fair. You can also collect business cards and company brochures.

, Talk about your skills, past jobs, and school background.Remember that you'll need a wow factor to really impress the employers, so be prepared to tell them what it is about you that makes you different from the other prospective candidates.Your tag-line should set you apart from the other candidates and explain how you can benefit their company.
You could say something like, “I helped a previous company I worked for save money by implementing a strategy I came up with.” Then, explain that strategy in depth., Even if you're nervous, try not to look intimidated by the number of recruiters or applicants at the career fair.

Walk up to the prospect, introduce yourself, and say something like, “I would like to discuss the possibility of lending my skills to your company through a full-time position.”, Pay attention to everything you've read about the company, and listen closely when your potential employer is speaking to you. You may discover that you two share a passion that is relevant to the company's interest.If you're able to find a common ground with your potential employer, let them know just how passionate you are about it and they'll be more likely to remember you., Be sure to follow up a few days after the event with a phone call, email, or thank you note to each representative you spoke with at the career fair.

Keep in touch.",How to Apply for a Job in Person," In today's digital world, the vast majority of job applications are accepted on-line. Similarly, the corresponding job advertisement for the position is usually posted on the company's web site as well as popular job postings site such as Monster, Indeed, and Glassdoor (non-profits tend to use Idealist and Opportunity Knocks).Always check the company's web site to make sure they are currently hiring. You can usually find these listed under tabs labelled ""Careers"" or ""Employment Opportunities."" Do not just drop by a business if there is no job opening.
Check the job ad for information on how to apply. If the job states you should apply in person at their store or office, then it is acceptable to do this.
If the job ad says ""No calls,"" it is safe to assume that they also do not want you to show up in person unless they ask you to.Employers who commonly accept applications in person include restaurants, grocery stores and other retail businesses. These employers often have an immediate need to fill and are therefore eager to expedite the hiring process. ;
, Some businesses will post a sign on their entrance stating ""Help Wanted"" or some version of that. If you see a sign like this, it is a clear indication your can inquire about a position in person.Make sure you look presentable when you go inside, even if you just plan on asking about a job instead of submitting a resume or cover letter. Have clean, brushed hair, fresh breath, and non-wrinkled clothes.
While you don't need to wear a full suit simply to receive an application, you should look pulled together: slacks, a business skirt and blazer, and a tucked in, button down shirt would be appropriate.

, If you have applied for a job, you might think it will give you a competitive edge to actually stop by the office. Perhaps you believe that this will show your sincere interest in the job. But the hiring manager could easily see this as an inconvenient or even disrespectful act.Keep in mind that when a hiring manager has to sift through dozens -- if not hundreds -- of applications for a single position, they are looking for candidates who can follow instructions and respect their hiring system. Breaking their rules will most likely make them remember you for the wrong reasons.

, You have to provide the required materials in order to be considered seriously when you apply for a job. Most jobs will require a resume, which is a catalogue of your professional experience, and a cover letter, which is a letter in which you explain your interest in the position and why you are qualified to fill it.For your resume, list your relevant work experience chronologically. Include the name of your employer, the title of your position, and the dates you worked there. As you describe your duties at each place, use active language such as ""created,""""executed,""""met target,""""designed,""""produced,"" etc. for each entry in your history.Include your transferable skills. If you are applying for a job that is in a new field or discipline, focus on skills from your previous experience that you can apply to this position. This would include things like conflict resolution, customer service, verbal and written communication, problem solving skills, etc., A cover letter is an opportunity to let your employer know more about you as a person and why you are interested in the company. It should not simply re-state all of your experience listed in the resume.Your cover letter should be just a page in length and clearly organized. Most examples include roughly three paragraphs, with each paragraph covering a main point.
In the first paragraph, you should introduce yourself and explain what position you are applying for. Include one or two sentences on how you are a good fit for the company generally.In the second and third paragraphs, you should include a specific example of a time you accomplished something in your career that will make you a good fit for the demands of the job. Provide detail in your examples. Did you organize a seminar at your most recent job? Did you find creative ways to meet your quotas?Be sure to thank the reader for their time and also include any contact information, such as an email or phone number.

, These might vary depending on the requirements of the job, but it might include a writing sample or a portfolio of creative work.You should also include a list of references or even letters of recommendation if they are requested.Keep these documents in a folder or portfolio so they will not get wrinkled as you carry them with you.

, If you are dropping off your resume and cover letter, you want to look professional and competent. While you don't need to be dressed for a full interview (a suit and tie), you should look like you could professionally represent the company.Business casual wear such as slacks or khakis and a button down shirt and blazer will be appropriate for men. Women can also wear business slacks, a button down shirt or blouse, a pencil skirt or a more professional dress.
Make sure your footwear is also professional. Leave the sneakers and sky high heels at home.

, When you enter the office, smile and introduce yourself to the administrative assistant at the front desk or reception area. Explain that you want to submit your application materials for the position. The administrative assistant might take these from you or he will direct you to the appropriate person for submitting these documents.Do not be rude or talk down to the person at the front desk. Often the boss will ask the receptionist for their impressions of the applicants; you don't want to stand out for the wrong reasons.

, Do not ask to take a tour of the office or meet with your potential boss. This will be viewed as an imposition on the workers at the office.


Similarly, do not harass the secretary about the status of your application after you have submitted it. If the company wants to interview you, they will contact you. Do not contact them.

, If there is a business or an industry you would like to work for, but there are no current openings, consider asking for an informational interview.An informational interview is an opportunity to talk to someone whose career you admire. Perhaps they work in an industry you are interested in transitioning into or maybe they work for your dream company.
Remember that the informational interview is not a job interview. It is an opportunity for you to get advice from someone whom you admire, to learn more about their career path, and for you to put yourself in their professional network., Perhaps you have someone in mind that you would like to talk to, but if you don't, you can always start by looking within your network. Consider people who have graduated from your high school, college or graduate school. You will automatically have something in common with this person and it is likely they will want to help you.While you can search alumni directories from your school, you can also search for alums on professional networking sites like LinkedIn.
You an also ask friends of friends or contacts other colleagues may have for an informational interview.

, Send an email or LinkedIn message to the interviewee asking them for an informational interview. Tell them you are interested in learning more about their work and career path. You can offer to take them out for a cup of coffee or ask to meet them at their office.It might feel a little awkward to contact someone you've never met before, but it is likely your interviewee will be flattered to receive such a request. , Even though the informational interview is a casual meeting, you should still be prepared with different questions. Ask things such as ""What does your typical day look like?"" or ""How did you get into this profession?""


If your interviewee works in a more advanced or specialized role in your profession, you might ask them for details on their route to that position or what kinds of responsibility they take on there.
Having questions prepared lets the interviewee know that you respect their time and want this to be a productive conversation.Keep the interview short. You should budget somewhere between 20-30 minutes unless your interviewee states a longer time.

, After your interview, be sure to send a thank you note or email to your interviewee. It is very important to let your interviewee you know you appreciate that they took time out of their schedule to share their wisdom with you., Informational interviews are especially helpful because they allow you to expand your network. If you see your interviewee at an industry event or a conference, be sure to say hello and keep in touch.Most importantly, when a job opens up at your dream company, you will already have a contact in place.

In the search bar, type “intern” and any phrases that relate to your specific career field like “finance” or “medicine.”
There will also be an option for setting a geographic location for your search so you can find jobs near you.;
, There are sites that cater specifically to interns and entry-level job seekers. Try sites like internships.com, LookSharp, Internmatch, and YouTern.Look for message boards or sites that are specific to your preferred career field.

, Colleges and high schools often hold career fairs that will include a number of internship opportunities. These are a great option for finding internships because you can make a personal impression on the recruiter and ask questions about the position. If you are a student, ask someone in your school’s administrative office or career services office when these take place.Ask the recruiter questions like what kind of work you’ll be doing during the internship, what kind of opportunities it could lead to, and what the company culture is like.
Most career fairs that aren’t held at schools will be for full-time jobs. If you do plan to attend one of these fairs, ask the event organizer if any internships will be available.
Think of your conversations with recruiters as interviews. Bring a resume, dress nicely, and exude confidence at the fairs so you make a good impression.

, Teachers and professors often know of internship or assistantship opportunities that may not be published on a job site. They themselves may be looking for an assistant to help out with certain tasks. If you are in college, you could also approach the administrators or your major’s department.It’s best to approach a teacher you know fairly well and whose subject matter you are interested in. Say something like “I am really enjoying our class. Do you know of any relevant internship opportunities?”

, If you’re applying for an internship, it’s likely you don’t have much job experience. However, you’ll still need a professional-looking résumé to demonstrate your background and interests. If you don’t have much professional experience, try to think of other experiences that could be relevant.


Include information about volunteer work and extracurricular school activities or teams you participated in. Include the courses you have taken in school, your GPA, and standardized testing schools as well, especially if you feel like your résumé is too short.Be descriptive in including your job functions, not just the names and dates of your employment. Instead of just saying that you served as an office assistant, describe duties like sending company-wide emails, drafting press releases, reordering office supplies, receiving and redirecting phone calls, and handling mail intake.If you do have a lot experience to fill up your résumé, try to be concise. A résumé should be no longer than two pages long.Design it so that the information can easily be gleamed by a skim read. Bullet points are a good way to emphasize the most important information.Ask a teacher or a professional to read your résumé and give advice.

, Many employers desire references to back up the information they’ll see on your résumé. Contact teachers, previous employers, or professionals that know you well ahead of time and make sure they are okay with being contacted by the employers you apply to.Have at least 3 recommenders in mind. Provide no more than 5 per job application.
Try to give your recommender some guidance as to what qualities you want emphasized in the letter.

, For certain job fields, a work sample portfolio will go a long way toward landing you an internship. If you’re applying for something related to writing, art, computer programming, research, or a performance field like dancing or acting, your work samples will likely speak louder than your résumé or cover letter.Provide a short description for each sample that gives the context for its creation. Describe the sample’s purpose and whether you made it for a job, school assignment, or recreation.
If you have a large number of samples, be selective about what you include. Choose 3-5 samples of your best work. Consider changing your portfolio around for different jobs if certain samples are more directly applicable than your best.There are numerous free and premium online platforms for developing portfolios. Portfolio Gen, Carbonmade, eFolio, and Coroloft are some free options. Big Black Bad, Parade, and Pixpa are some premium options.
If you have some web design skills, you could use an open source site like WordPress, Blogger, or TypePad., Cover letters are an opportunity to make a personal appeal to potential employers. Discuss your background, your interests, why you would be a valuable to the employer, and why the experience would be valuable for your long-term pursuits.Avoid repeating the content from your résumé. Instead, express exactly how your experience prepares you for the internship you’re applying for.Write a unique cover letter for each internship you apply to. Employers can easily tell if you’re using a cookie cutter letter and may reflect negatively on you.Try to find a specific person to contact and address the letter to them. If you can’t find a specific contact person, address it as “Dear wikiHow hiring manager.”

, Looking clean and professional is essential to demonstrating that you belong in a work environment. Consider the appearance of people working at the company you’re applying to and try to replicate that as best as possible. For some internships, you can dress more casually.Always shower, brush your teeth, and comb your hair before your interview.
For men in a corporate environment, a suit is most ideal. If you don’t have a suit, wear a dress shirt, dress shows, and dress slacks with a tie. Make sure everything is properly laundered and ironed.
For women in a corporate environment, pantsuits or a professional dress should be worn. You can wear high heels or flats, as long as they are professional looking.
Try to conceal any tattoos and remove nontraditional piercings., One of the biggest things employers are looking for in an interview is composure and confidence.Sit upright, maintain eye contact, and speak up.


If you think you may come off as nervous, try to practice some potential answers in front of mirror beforehand.
Try to think positively and imagine yourself succeeding in getting the internship to build confidence.

, Consider the questions you’ll be asked ahead of time. You’re more likely to be nervous if you have to think of your answer on the spot.


“What are your strengths and weaknesses?” “What made you decide to apply for this internship?” “Describe a time when you had to meet a deadline,” “Describe a time you had to work with a team,” “Describe a time you had to deal with a problem customer,” are common questions you’ll hear in a job or internship interview.
While it’s good to be prepared, don’t overthink your answers. The main purpose of these questions is to see how well you think on your feet and sounding over-rehearsed can reflect negatively on you., A common mistake internship and job applicants make is overemphasizing how great the experience will be for them. Try to phrase all of your answers in ways that demonstrate your value to the employer.Instead of saying “This would be a great opportunity for me to learn more about sales,” say something like “I think my passion for developing sales skills will really contribute to your team’s goals.”

, Interviews will almost always end with the interviewer asking if you have any questions. Even if you don’t have anything particularly pressing to ask, coming up with a question or two will demonstrate that you’re engaged.


If you can’t think of anything specific, ask something like “When do you think you’ll be making your hiring decision?” “How long has the company been around?” or “What is the typical day-to-day like in the office?”, Job and internship-seekers often send a follow-up message to thank the potential employer for their time and restate their excitement about the position. You should wait two or three days before sending the follow-up.A good follow-up should say something like “I just wanted to reach out and thank you for your time the other day. I sincerely enjoyed learning more about the company and position. Please let me know if you have any additional questions about my background or need anything else from me. I look forward to discussing further.”

Lean on examples in your own experiences to support your response.,
Write down your response and then recite it out loud.,
Practice responding to the questions with a friend or peer.",How to Answer Ethical Interview Questions," In a job interview, ethical questions are used to determine if you can be a responsible and sustainable employees. As an employee, you also want to feel like you are working for an ethical employer. So when you are asked ethical questions during your interview, this is a good sign that your employer cares about your morals and values as an employee.In an interview for medical school, you will likely be asked ethical questions as a way to determine if you have sound ethical decision making. This is an essential element of being a good and responsible physician, especially in situations of life and death.;
, Before you head to your job interview, you should prepare for ethical interview questions by reviewing several common questions used by potential employers, including:What would you do if someone in management asked you to do something unethical?
Tell me about a time you faced an ethical dilemma.
If you saw a coworker doing something dishonest, what would you do?
If you knew that your supervisor was doing something unethical, what would you do?

, The process for getting into medical school usually involves an in person interview, where you will be asked several ethically based questions, including:You observe a fellow medical student cheating on an examination. What would you do?
How would you tell a patient just diagnosed with cancer that he has only a few weeks to live?
Would you get out of your car to help a victim after observing an accident?
What are your thoughts on euthanasia?
A pregnant 15-year-old unmarried teenager comes into your office asking for an abortion. What would you do? Would you inform her parents?

, One of the golden rules of answering ethical questions in a medical school interview is to always focus on how you can put your patient’s needs first. You should place the patient’s welfare above all else, as your role as a physician is to serve your patients, first and foremost.

For example, to answer the ethical question in a medical school interview: What are your thoughts on euthanasia?, you may consider how you can put the needs of a patient on life support first. If the patient is suffering unduly and there is no medical way to save her life, you may advocate for the use of euthanasia, as this will be in the best interests of the patient. As well, if the patient specified that she wanted to be euthanized once her health deteriorated to a certain point, you have an ethical obligation to fulfill her wishes, especially when there is nothing more you can do to save her life as her physician.

, When answering ethical questions in a job interview, you should try to put the needs of your employer first, where you are not putting your employer at risk in any way.To answer the ethical question in a job interview: If you saw a coworker doing something dishonest, what would you do?, you may consider how the coworker’s actions puts your employer at risk. You may then respond by noting that the coworker is putting himself, the company, and other employees at risk, as his actions affect the ethics of everyone around him. As a result, you would confront him about his dishonesty and report him to your supervisor so he is held accountable for his actions.

, The interviewers are asking you ethical questions to test your ability to act with integrity and honesty. Your responses should reflect the importance of these attributes in your decision making and how much you value them.For example, if you are answering the question: If you knew that your supervisor was doing something unethical, what would you do?, you may think about how the supervisor’s actions conflict with your ability to act with integrity and honesty. You may respond by noting that the supervisor was not acting with integrity or honesty, which is very important to you. To resolve the situation, you would confront your supervisor and report her to her supervisor or to the Human Resources department. This will ensure that your workplace remains honest and ethical.
If you are answering the question:You observe a fellow medical student cheating on an examination. What would you do?, you may note that your peer’s actions do not reflect your values of integrity and honesty. To resolve the situation, you would confront your peer and report her to the medical school. This will ensure the examination remains honest and ethical, and that you can act as an honest person moving forward in the examination process.

, Often, using examples to support your response to an ethical question can show the interviewer how you can put your ethics into action in a specific situation. You should prepare one to two strong examples that explore an ethical dilemma and your response to it.For example, you may receive a more open ended question such as: Tell me about a time you faced an ethical dilemma. You can respond by using a situation where you discovered a colleague was cutting corners on a group project, leading to nearly missing the client deadline. You may note that you waited for the project to be handed in and then confronted your colleague by expressing your disappointment and frustration with their unethical handling of the project. You may then suggest that your colleague speak to your supervisor to discuss how and why he cut corners, as this could put you, the team, and the company in jeopardy. If your colleague refuses to do this, you may decide to talk to your supervisor yourself.
This response shows that you are trying to stay true to your ethics and show your colleague the courtesy of speaking to her one on one. By giving her the option to speak to your supervisor herself, you are extending trust to your colleague. It also shows you are willing to try to work out the issue among you and your colleague first, before going to your supervisor.

, It can be helpful to write down your response on a piece of paper or on your computer and then read it out loud to yourself to ensure it flows and makes sense. This will allow you to better prepare for the actual interview, as you will have a lower risk of babbling and long winded responses if you write down your thoughts first.


You can recite your response to yourself in front of a mirror so you can gauge your body language and your eye contact. You should have relaxed body language with your arms at your sides and your body facing forward. You should also maintain eye contact, and display happy facial expressions, like smiling or laughing.

, You can practice your responses to ethical questions by having a friend pretend to be your interviewer. Have a friend or peer ask you a series of ethical questions to determine how well you can respond to each question naturally, but concisely.


You should try to respond to the questions from memory, so you may need to memorize some of your written answers. You should also be willing to get feedback on your responses from your friend or peer and adjust your responses based on their feedback.

Think carefully about your reasons for contemplating any position that is less than what your qualifications could get you.,
Realize that the interviewer is most likely asking this question because he or she has already reached a conclusion that you're overqualified.,
Address the question with good reasons.,
Feel free to question the interviewer's assumption if you don't believe it's true.",How to Answer an Interview Question Suggesting You're Overqualified," If you haven't already thought it through, it may be a surprise question that unhinges you. For the most part, however, it'll be clear to you that you're interviewing for a job that you're overqualified for and you should already have a good sense of the reasons as to why you're taking it. If you're not clear that this is a good decision, you may feel a sense of resentment or need to walk sooner rather than later, and that's what will worry your interviewer. Some of the personal reasons might include (these are for your own rationalizing, not necessarily for the interviewer):


You've been out of the workforce for a while and feel you need to regain your skills and strengths gradually.
You hated being in management and want to return to more involved work that doesn't require looking out for other people's stuff ups and needs.
It's a dream job or something you've always wanted to try to your qualifications are neither here nor there.
Any job will do in the current economic climate!
You like the workplace culture better than somewhere else.;
, In this case, you'll need to do some persuading to overcome their prejudice.


The interviewer is genuinely worried that you're going to be taking this job as a stand-by position until something better comes along, or that you may ruffle feathers by trying to make the role more than it is. If you end up being disappointed or unable to sit happily within the hierarchy, you pose a risk to the organization from the interviewer's perspective.
Treat this as an opportunity to explain why this job isn't ""beneath"" you and why it is a good role for you.

, While your personal reasons as listed above may be motivating you, the directness of some of those reasons won't be appropriate to give as reasons to the interviewer, who isn't keen to employ Mr or Ms Desperate. While you'll need to do the hard thinking on this in relation to the position and your personal motivations, consider the following response to give you an idea of how to answer this question from your own point of view:


""I realize I was a senior manager in my last role and I learned a great deal from it and will continue to apply that learning. However, I've decided that I am best suited to dealing direct with the creative work/clients/writing/inventing, etc. and I am at my strongest when delivering in this way. For me, this isn't about stepping down the ladder, it's about ensuring that I am doing what I am best suited to do, which ensures that I feel fulfilled and that I do the best by my job. I feel that my previous role has enabled me to have a greater understanding of the bigger picture and how everything works but I know I'm happier doing this work direct.""

, But be polite; this isn't a time for being antagonistic and comparing your qualifications with a whole raft of other people or positions. Just keep it simple and state that you're not really sure why the interviewer believes this to be the case and ask for clarification. Take your cue from their answers.


If, after clarification and discussion with the interviewer, you are genuinely concerned that this role isn't for you, don't be shy in saying so. Thank them for their time and be polite. Leave a good impression because you never know when they might remember you or when you might need to reapply at the same company again.

Explain the result.",How to Answer Behavioral Interview Questions1," This is a common behavioral interview format. ""Tell us about a Situation or Task that you encountered in a past position. Describe the Action you took, and explain the Result."" An example of this might be, ""Tell us about a time where you were confronted by an angry customer. What did you do, and what was the result?"" The panel may then ask further, more in-depth questions about the details of the situation that you describe.Listen carefully to the question the interviewer asks. Be sure that you are giving him or her an example that will demonstrate the skills he/she is looking for.
Clarify what is being asked by rephrasing the question back to the interviewer. Demonstrate that you understand the question. This way, the interviewer can put you back on the right track if you didn't fully understand what the question was asking.;
, The interviewers will usually prompt you to think of a specific type of situation: e.g. a time when you had to resolve a conflict between members of your team. Pick a situation that paints you in a positive light. Provide an example of a time when you previously demonstrated a certain competency or behavior, preferably in a work situation: for example, your problem-solving ability.You don't need to pick a ""success,"" necessarily. If you can explain how you learned from failure, then you may impress employers with your honesty.
Try to think of relevant situations ahead of time. Make a short list of challenges that you've overcome in past jobs that might also be applicable to this new job.
The situation doesn't need to be something that occurred at a job. If you don't have much relevant work experience, try to draw from situations that occurred while you were at college or school, playing on a sports team, volunteering, or performing any other extracurricular activities., This task might be a project, a repeating role, or a special mission. The task may be something that you encountered on a regular basis at a past job, or it may be the account of a request that took you out of your comfort zone. Think back to a project that challenged you to grow.

, Tell the interviewers about the steps that you took to resolve the situation. Explain your thought process and how you knew what to do. Make sure to focus on what you as an individual did. If you refer to ""we,"" then it will not be clear what your specific contribution was. Do not inflate your own importance, but be sure to own your actions.If you are describing a customer situation, then explain how you handled that customer. If you are answering a question about a team conflict, then explain what you said to each member of the team in question.

, Clearly detail the outcome of your actions, including what happened and what you learned from the situation. It is very important to frame the example as a learning experience."

Think about the situations that you might encounter in the course of this job.,
Study common behavioral interview questions.,
Prepare, but don't over-prepare.",How to Answer Behavioral Interview Questions2," If you are interviewing for a specific position, then any behavioral interview questions will probably relate to common challenges that you'll face while working. The questions will prompt you to explain how your personal attitude and skill-set will apply to this new job.If you are applying for a job that involves customer service, then you will probably be asked questions about past experiences handling customers. How have you dealt with angry customers? How have you gone out of your way to satisfy customers?If you are applying for a job that will entail working in a team, then some of the interview questions may revolve around your past experience working in teams. How have you taken charge or helped balance a team?If the potential job involves emergency response or high-pressure situations, then many of the behavioral interview questions will seek to understand how you behave under pressure. Think about times when you have reacted calmly and decisively to a high-pressure situation.

, Read over lists of the most common interview questions.If you are applying to a big-name company that fields a lot of applicants, then search online for the accounts of others who have interviewed for the same job at the same company.

, You don't need to rehearse and regurgitate a scripted answer. You only need to be able to reference examples that paint you in a positive light. Before the interview, make a short list of situations and projects from past jobs that might be relevant to this new position.


Try to remember the details. If you cannot clearly explain what you did in a situation, then you should not use that situation as an example.
Consider sketching out potential answers beforehand. Again: no need to memorize them! Simply use the writing as a tool for exploring how a given situation relates to the new job.

"
"
Be ready for further probing.,
Do not make up fake examples.,
Answer honestly.",How to Answer Behavioral Interview Questions3," It is common behavioral interview practice for the recruiters to ask follow-up questions that explore the situation in more detail. The recruiters want to use the example as a stepping-off point for understanding the way that you work. Thus: make sure that you've used an example that you can talk about in greater detail.


The recruiter might say, ""Tell me why you did that,"" or ""Can you explain what was going through your head at that moment?""
Follow-up questions might ask you to explain the long-term consequences of your example action. You may wind up explaining much more about the role in which the example took place.

, Prepare complete and actual examples of behaviors that you know relate to the position. The follow-up questions will request you to explain the situation in great detail. Indeed, they are designed to root out answers that have been fabricated. If you haven't thought your answer through, then the recruiters may dismiss the example as a fake.

, Own your successes and your failures. Even if the example that you used was a great ""success"" from your professional career, the follow-up questions might prompt you to explain other similar situations in which you were not so successful. Try to own your mistakes and frame them as learning experiences. Show that you can handle both good and bad situations in a mature way."

Do your research about the position for which you’re interviewing.,
Remark on things you enjoyed about your last place of work.,
Phrase any dislikes tactfully.,
Focus on your desire to work for the interviewing company.,
Speak kindly of your previous or current employer.,
Be humble and honest when addressing a lay-off or termination.,
Highlight previous job skills that are applicable to the new opportunity.,
Give an example of how you handled issues at previous jobs.,
Identify what you consider your biggest accomplishments thus far.",How to Answer an Interview Question on Your Previous Job Experience," You need to know everything you can about what your responsibilities will be, what skills you’ll be expected to know or learn quickly, and the environment you will be working in. Most importantly, you need to know how it is similar and how it is different from your previous or current job. This is critical so that you don’t step on any toes while you are discussing your experience at your previous job.


You may not want to rave about how much you enjoy your small and intimate company if you’re applying at a huge corporation. The more you know about the opportunity, the easier you can tailor your response to show how well you’d fit in at the company interviewing you.;
, Give specific examples, and make sure they align with the position you’re interviewing for. The interviewer is trying to determine how well you will fit in at their company, and also trying to determine your character. It’s important to show that you’re a team player and loyal to your employer, while highlighting specific things you enjoy in your previous position that will be similar in the new position., This is not a time to meaninglessly bash your current or previous employer. Rather, use it as another chance to show how perfect you’d be for the position you’re up for. If you’re interviewing for a position that is different than the one you currently hold, you can simply explain why you’re a much better fit for the former. You can also use this as an opportunity to explain what your old company lacked and what the new company offers.For example, if you’re attempting to make the move from accounting to sales you could explain that you didn’t like the lack of face-to-face communication you had in your previous role.
If you’re moving from a large company to a small company, you could discuss your desire for a more intimate office setting.
Don’t speak derogatorily about co-workers or your company. This will not show you in a positive light, and the interviewer would much rather see loyalty, dedication, and optimism.

, Clearly there is a reason why you are interviewing for a new job, and your explanation should flatter the interviewer. Let them know that you want the opportunity they’re offering, and that’s why you are leaving your current position.You may be totally and completely satisfied at your current job, but you view this opportunity as even better.

, This point should be stressed. There is nothing to gain from insulting your previous company. Even more importantly, this can tell the interviewer that you’re flighty or entitled. For example, if you tell the interviewer that you didn’t like your boss or one aspect of the work, it may indicate that you’ll take off whenever anything displeases you.You don’t need to degrade your previous place of work to explain why you’re leaving or why you left. Just state that you are better suited somewhere else or you’re ready for a new challenge.
Make sure to offer only important reasons. Dress code, scheduling issues, and interpersonal drama aren’t typically good reasons.

, Your interviewer may reach out to your past employers or references, so your honesty is crucial. Typically, an interviewer will be understanding about a lay-off, especially if you are transparent about what exactly occurred. If you were fired, make sure you are very careful about how you explain it. Maybe your role changed and you were unable to meet demands, maybe you weren’t fully aware of the job requirements when you accepted the job, maybe new management took over and you were no longer a great fit for the role. Whatever your reason, make sure you offer a lesson that you learned through the experience.If you were fired or laid off, there may be a gap in your employment that the interviewer will be curious about. If you try to avoid the topic or gloss over it, you may be raising more red flags than if you simply explained it.
You can use this difficult and awkward situation to show integrity and sincerity.
Keep it simple! Offer the pertinent information, but don’t go into any nitty-gritty, dramatic details.

, Tell the interviewer about any and all areas of expertise that would be transferable to the new job. If there aren’t many specific skill set overlaps, you can speak more generally about how quickly you learn new things, adapt to new situations, and master new skills. Personal qualities such as a strong work ethic, being dependable, and being a great communicator are great to discuss as well., While it would be nice to tell the interviewer that everything was perfect in your previous job and you were Employee of the Month every month, that is probably not believable. You can and should bring up challenges you faced in your old position, and how you rose up to them. Use a concrete example where you can show how you keep cool under pressure, make tough decisions, or exercise strong leadership skills.The key is to show the interviewer that you’re a critical thinker focused on solutions and results.

, It is imperative to brainstorm your answer beforehand, as this is your chance to discuss your most important success story to date. Think about a time where you overcame a huge challenge, made a big positive change at your place of employment, or received outstanding results or feedback after completing a task.Make sure that whatever your accomplishment was, it relates to work you would be doing in the position you’re interviewing for.
Rather than focusing on exactly what you accomplished, focus on how you accomplished it.

Be aware of what the interviewer is seeking to do with this line of questioning.",How to Answer an Interview Question About Your Last Performance Appraisal1," You should ask people before you use them as a reference. Not only that, but you should have some idea about how they might represent you. By contacting your references before you go to the interview, you make sure no one is surprised.;
, Look online and talk to friends and family about potential interview questions. This will help you to think about how the interviewer might question your past performance reviews. By taking the time ahead to think about it, you can be more prepared to answer the questions an interviewer asks. Getting flustered may make it appear that you are not confident in your answers., In some cases, an employer can be contacted in order to request information regarding past performance reviews. Generally, employers are limited in one way or another in terms of how much information they can provide. For example, in Arkansas former employers are able to divulge quite a lot of information, whereas in Illinois employer disclosure is rather limited., A performance appraisal will usually contain at least one suggestion for improvement and interviewers can use the appraisal process question as one means for getting you to talk about the areas that were assessed as being in need of improvement. The problem with this is that it can get a little negative.

Tell the truth.,
Focus on the good things.,
Address problems if asked.",How to Answer an Interview Question About Your Last Performance Appraisal2," Your employer has more than likely read your performance reviews. They will know if you are lying or misrepresenting yourself. If you try to give false impressions, it may reflect poorly on you. If you're seeking an internal appointment, it's very likely that the interviewer has already read your performance appraisal and may well have it before them. They might still check the appraisal with your reference providers., Don't deny the bad things. Highlight all the positive perceptions about your work. If you know anything about your interviewer, choose references that you know the interviewer will respect. If faced with challenges, use them as examples of times when you succeed in the face of adversity.


Keep the balance focused on the positive aspects of the appraisal. It's important to focus on what was good in your appraisal and to highlight how you are continuing to achieve the positive aspects. As for the negative aspects, minimize these by focusing only on one and, at the same, talking about what you've since done to overcome the limitation (for example, training, changing work practices, working from home some days, etc.). Keep it straightforward and don't go into too many details on the negatives. For example:
""My last performance appraisal was positive confirmation that my skills are well suited to the work I have been undertaking and that I am ready to move into a higher position. The appraisal showed that I am good with clients, supportive with my colleagues, and always meet my deadlines. It was suggested that I have a tendency to over-explain the procedures to clients, so I have taken great care since to ensure that I don't bury clients in the details and I believe that this demonstrates that I respond well to feedback and have learned how to ensure the best client experience, which is why I believe I am well placed for this promotion.""

, Take responsibility. Don't become embarrassed or shy away from faults. This will reflect poorly on you. By taking the reigns, you show authority and a desire to strengthen your worth as an employee. Entrepreneurs value employees who seek to better themselves."
"
Present things in the best light.,
Offer references you know will say positive things.,
Explain that you've had good verbal feedback.",How to Answer an Interview Question About Your Last Performance Appraisal3," Your potential employer will not likely have access to your previous performance reviews. You and your references may be their only source of information regarding your previous employment. In order to be accurate regarding your previous performance reviews, as well as to prepare to address your professional development, make sure you know what makes you a valuable employee.

, When you apply for a position at a new company, you have the luxury of providing to them all the information about you. You get to choose the people who attest to your diligence and qualifications.


Typically, it is corporate policy not to give any sort of negative reference.In cases of harassment, discrimination, defamation, retaliation or disparagement you may wish to pursue legal action., This is important where your organization doesn't have a formal feedback structure in place but it's important even where there is one. Give factual examples of praise done for work from your supervisor and colleagues and how it has helped the firm or your team.

You should never go into an interview making assumptions about the nature of teamwork in a given company. You want your response catered to a specific company's values.Review the job description carefully prior to the interview. See what information is provided about teamwork and working with others. These descriptions can give you insight into that company's idea of teamwork.
Different positions require different types of teamwork. A startup company may want to make sure they hire someone who can wear different hats and work with a variety of different people. An entry-level position may simply want someone who gets along with others easily. For a managerial position, a company may want someone who can work with others as a leader.;
, Team player questions are not always obvious. While an interviewer may ask something like, ""Are you a team player?"" directly, team player questions are typically disguised. Make sure you know common questions asked to assess your skills working with a team prior to an interview.An employer may ask you to describe something related to teamwork. He or she may say, ""Tell me about a time you had to work with others"" or ""Tell me about a teamwork experience that was rewarding for you.""
Employers may not ask for examples directly, but teamwork questions are always best answered with examples. An employer may ask something vague, like, ""Do you prefer to work in a group or individually?"" or ""What is the most challenging part of being a team member?""

, When an employer asks you a teamwork question, they are trying to assess specific things about your personality and ability to work with others. In order to answer the question most effectively, understand what an employer hopes to learn.These questions test your ability to work with others. Teamwork is almost always part of a job, so employers want people who are capable of working with others. Make sure you showcase an example or examples where you have worked successfully with a variety of people.
There are no right answers to the question, but employers want to know that you can handle conflict, communicate effectively, and collaborate with others.

, Prior to going into an interview, do some brainstorming. You should think of a number of examples you can use to answer teamwork questions. Think of a variety of recent, real life situations in which you had to work as a team.Jot down jobs you have had in the past. From there, jot down teamwork experiences. Did you have to make a presentation alongside a co-worker at your past job? Were you required to work with an editor when writing a press release? Were you a member of a project team? Do people report to you? How did you interact with your superior?
Have several examples in mind. When the question is posed, you will be able to draw from the best example you have. If an employer wants to know how you handle conflict, one question should deal with a disagreement you had with a coworker. If an employer wants to assess your ability to lead, you should have an example where you took on a leadership position.

, Teamwork questions are best answered through what is known as the STAR system. This is an acronym that outlines the four part answer you should give to a teamwork question.""S"" stands for ""situation."" This overviews the situation in which you had to work as a team.
""T"" stands for ""task."" Explain the task you needed to complete as part of a team.
""A"" stands for ""actions."" What actions did you take as a team member to successfully complete the task?
""R"" stands for ""results."" Give some concrete results here. How did your actions help the company? In what ways was the situation resolved due to your efforts?

, Introduce your answer to a team player question by telling the interviewer what type of person you are. Are you process-oriented or results-driven? Are your comfortable relinquishing decisions to a team? Are you patient or impatient? Do you accept or give criticism well? This gives a brief overview of how you function as a team player, which will be followed with an example illustrating this personality trait.The answer should start with ""I am the type of person who..."" after which you explain your general personality. Then, you should say, ""I like to..."" and explain how your general personality manifests itself in action.
For example, ""I'm the kind of person who likes to focus on what someone does right over what they do wrong. I like to explain how a team member can use their good qualities in a situation in order to outweigh their flaws.""

, From here, you need to illustrate how the above statement played out in a specific situation. What was your responsibility in the situation? What task did you have to complete? Choose a recent example of your teamwork experience. Pick an example relevant to the initial statement you made.For example, ""I was responsible for providing one-on-one feedback to a group of freelance writers who worked for our publication."" This outlines the situation. You managed freelance writers, and your responsibility was providing feedback.
From here, get specific. What task presented a unique challenge? For example, ""I had an author with great energy and fantastic writing skills. However, she had a tendency to write very fast. While her articles were always turned in early, there were a lot of typos and missing words in her work, which made the editorial team's job more difficult.""

, This is your chance to be the star of the story, so focus on actions that make you stand out from the rest of the team. The best answers detail your exceptional ability to react to the particular situation, while also highlighting other strengths of character, like patience, alternative thinking, and time management.You can say something like, ""I sent the writer an email requesting a private meeting. I wanted to talk to her one-on-one."" Here, you showcase your ability to take initiative in resolving a situation.
Continue with something like, ""I tried to focus on what she was doing right. I said, 'Lindsay, you're a fantastic writer, but I think your passion gets the better of you. You get so enthusiastic about your ideas you do not pay attention to small details.'"" You're showing how you focus on the positive over the negative, returning to your first statement.
Close with how you ended up resolving the situation. For example, ""Lindsay and I talked about specific actions she could take to catch typos, like setting her work aside for a day, reading her articles out loud, and so on.""

, Interviewers want to see results. You have to explain how your actions benefited your company. Take some time to explain the results of the actions you took.For example, say something like, ""As a result, Lindsay's articles starting coming in with less errors. I was happy to be able to keep a talented writer on staff without having to stress out the editorial team.""
This answer shows you were able to manage team relations. You were able to keep talent on staff, while making sure your editorial team was not frustrated.

, Asking a question near the conclusion of the interview can help convey your interest in a company. If teamwork is a major part of a company's culture, ask about this specifically. This can show you're invested it making sure you meet the company's needs.Ask about the other employees. For example, say something like, ""Can you tell me about the team I'll be working with?"" This shows you're enthusiastic about learning how to best interact with others in the company.
Try asking something like, ""What skills would the ideal candidate have?"" This shows you want to know how to best fit into the team environment at this company.

, While you may have handled conflict great during a college internship, if you graduated 3 years ago this is not the best example. Employers want to know who you are now, so always pick a recent example.Preferably, your example should be from a job you've held in the last 12 months.
If you've been unemployed for awhile, do you have any non-work related examples? An example from volunteer work can also help showcase your experience.

, You want to show that you would be an asset to a company, so pick a story that makes you shine. Choose a situation where you produced amazing results and were successful in resolving a conflict.Do not pick an example where you left a situation bitter or frustrated. Focus on positive experiences, in which a situation was successfully resolved.
Results are also important to showcase. You may have smoothed over a disagreement between two co-workers, but maybe the only results were a decent 20 minute presentation. You want bigger results than that. For example, talk about the time you helped smooth out a misunderstanding between a client and employee, which resulted in a huge sale for your company.

, Never focus solely on teamwork in a team player question. You only have so much time in a job interview to speak to all of your strengths, so make sure to get in as much information as possible.Think of what other strengths were involved in a team work experience you had. Say you worked with a co-worker on a sales pitch for a client. In addition to working successfully on a team, what other skills did this situation require?
For example, you probably had to make a deadline, use great verbal communication skills, and demonstrate great interpersonal skills. Find ways to work in these skills as you outline your experience working on a team.

, Ask a friend or family member to help you practice for your interview by acting as the interviewer. Give them the list of sample questions you predicted might be asked. Encourage them to add their own questions too, so you can get comfortable performing under pressure when you haven’t crafted the perfect answer beforehand.


The more you practice and become familiar with possible questions and your answers, the easier it will be to stay calm under pressure.
Ask your “interviewer” to challenge you with difficult questions and resist offering feedback until the practice is over. For this exercise, they should consider you one of several strangers they have to meet with to fill the position.

Understand the purpose behind the question.,
Treat the question as one that still leaves room for you to improve.,
Cover the point of management as part of your answer.,
Know the exact expectations of the management role for which you're applying.,
Compile answers before your interview.",How to Answer an Interview Question About Defining Your Management Style," It's basic - the interviewer wants to know what your ideas are about managing people, leading people, and how you handle management on a daily basis.


Your self-perception matters in this answer and the interviewer will be listening very carefully for how you describe yourself. Be sure to use positive, strong, and realistic words.;
, In other words, use aspirational language as well as concrete examples, as this shows you continue to be willing to learn and update your management skills.

, When it boils down to it, management involves two main things: ensuring the the job gets done, and ensuring that the people who get the job done are well looked after and enabled by the manager. Be sure that the way in which you respond demonstrates that you can get the job done and both enthuse and rein in the people doing it.

, This article can only provide basic generalizations about what is appropriate to provide as an answer. You'll need to ensure that you've spent adequate time learning about the role you're applying for by reading the company's website, talking to people in management roles directly, even relying on acting in a management position if you're in a position to do so. Draw on all your resources to learn about the specific expectations of the management role you're applying for.

, Since this is such a stock standard question, it shouldn't come as a surprise to you. And it should be something you've thought about well in advance. It can be helpful to brainstorm a list of the things that you think make you a good manager; this will serve as a memory prompt during the interview. As for a good answer, as recommended earlier, be sure to cover the purpose of management (to get the job done and to supervise) as well as addressing the expectations for the role you're applying for. For example:


""I'm a team member as well as a manager. I don't expect my team to go it alone; I am very much the type of person who pitches in to ensure the work gets done when needed. At the same time, however, I make sure that people are doing their role to their best ability and to find out why they might not be if things are going wrong for them. I consider myself to be very open-minded and approachable - I love hearing new ideas from my team and will try to implement them if they benefit the firm and the team as a whole. I'm a good listener and I am always ready to listen to staff when they experience problems and need help. I am highly ethical and will always ensure that my team is well briefed on accountability needs. I believe that it's important to reach consensus wherever possible, rather than laying down the law but I am not averse to using authority where it is needed, for the common good of the firm and team"".

Understand what is being sought by asking this question.,
Rely on using the same stock standard answers that you'd give for wanting to leave your existing job for the new one.,
Where the reasons for leaving the job were negative, tread with care.,
Explain to the interviewer what positive things you got from the job they've highlighted.",How to Answer an Interview Question About Why You Left a Job," This question isn't about the current position you're seeking to leave; it's related to any job the interviewer decides to select out of your resume and quiz you on. The interviewer wants to know what motivated you to leave in order to see whether or not that motivation will arise in the job you're applying for. And if you do have anything you're trying to hide from a potential future employer, this is a question aimed at ferreting it out.;
, Ensure that you focus on the positive aspects as much as possible. Typical positive reasons for leaving a current or older job might include:


You were ready to seek new challenges and the old role no longer offered these.
You had upgraded your qualifications and wanted to put them to use.
You were looking to diversify and not be typecast in a single role.
You sought a promotion or a different type of role.

, In particular, difficulties will arise where you clashed with your boss or team members (including bullying), where you were fired, or where you were made redundant. Here are some suggested answers:



Redundancy: Although this occurs through no fault of your own, it carries a negative stigma with some employers for reasons of their own. Don't sound resentful or angry; treat it as much as you can of being a case of ""these things happen in life but I've moved on"". Avoid criticizing that employer and try to focus instead on the broader market decisions and outcomes that brought about the redundancy. Also explain that others were made redundant and then quickly explain how you have since bounced back.

Being fired: This one is hard because it's not positive. Be honest and keep it as factual as possible. The most important thing here is to convey what you learned from the experience and how you have put in place approaches that now mean nothing like it will ever happen again because you've changed/reformed/improved, etc. Use the word ""dismissed"" as it has the most professional ring compared with all the usual slang words. Avoid suggesting that you were made a scapegoat (an example to others) or that you were justified in doing whatever brought about the dismissal. These kinds of excuses make you appear vengeful, unable to forgive and move on, and potentially volatile and argumentative in the future. Stay humble!

Inability to get along with the boss: Avoid using this as a reason. No interviewer will appreciate being given the lowdown on how bad your ex-boss was and what a sinking ship your workplace was. That shows bad morale on your behalf and an inability to rise above a challenging situation, as well as the inability to take responsibility for your own contributions to the situation. Find positive reasons and leave the ex-boss out of it.

, Whatever your reason for leaving, if the interviewer is able to get a sense from you that you learned lessons, gained experience, and have moved on positively and successfully ever since, then the interview will be a lot more successful than focusing on all the things that went wrong.

The interviewer wants to know that you want this job. If you show up even one minute late, they are going to think that you have more important things to do than be there. Being late is rude and suggests that you are likely to be late for work. It might also suggest you are a sloppy and disorganized person.;
, You want the person who is interviewing you to have a great first impression of you. If you wear jeans, Uggs, and just your old Beatles shirt, the interviewer is going to think that you do not care about this interview and are not serious about landing the job. If you're a girl, wear a skirt or dress with a blazer and flats.


For a man, a suit and tie is appropriate. Women may wear a smart trouser suit and flats are not compulsory.
If you don't have any interview outfits and are not easily able to buy any, search for local charities who may be able to help you. There are some organizations whose main intention is to help people get into, or back into work with the right clothes so have a look online and see if you can get some help. Dress to impress at an interview, especially if it is public facing or fashion related.

, If you seem happy and excited to work rather than depressing, dull, or sullen, it is more likely that you will be given the job. Don't apply for a job that doesn't excite you, unless you are desperate for money.

, Employers are always looking for people who can add something special to the company. Be bright, charming, and intelligent because that is what everyone looks for in an employee.


Don't be overconfident. Many employers are impressed by modesty, dedication and loyalty. To really bring something new to the equation, be ready to tell your potential employer something you can do in the role than no one else can do as well.

, Be confident that you passed the interview. Doing so will make you feel better and will make you positive about it.

, Interviewers usually ask a lot of questions about why you want the job, such as whether the job is your first job, and about your work experience. Before the interview, try answering some made-up questions in front of a mirror, or ask a family member to act as an interviewer.

, Find out more about the company. Read recent press releases or study their website for an event that has happened to the company in the last few months. This way, you can talk about the happening with your interviewer and show that you care enough about this job to look it up.


A little homework goes a long way. Throw in a couple of technical terms that you have learnt about the role at the interview.

, Take five seconds to gather all your thoughts and then answer the questions. Speak slowly, in order to make your words concise and simple. Avoid using fillers such as ""umm....and then"" and ""you know?.....we can..."" as fillers interrupts your speech.

, Make your shoulders loose and don't stare. Use your hands while answering.

, It makes a negative impression.

, For instance, do not start off the sentence with ""when I went to Harvard law"" or ""after I got almost a perfect score on my SAT"". Your employers don't care. They already have what they already need to about you. They have your resume, so don't think that they haven't done their research too.

, Avoid fidgeting and slouching at your seat.


Be still. Sit upright and sound interested while at the interview.

, Don't just ask about the pay, the lunch breaks or hours. If you can't ask an intelligent, researched question about the role or the company or organisation, you can try ask how many people applied for the role and how many interviews they are holding.

, If you are at an interview and you take out a piece of gum or even an apple without permission from the interviewer, he or she will blow his or her top.

, Say thank you and shake hands firmly with great eye contact. Send a thank you letter promptly after you leave.

, Don't ask about the salary or any bonuses until you get the offer.


Do ask about your interviewer's card when leaving; it makes a good impression. Depart gracefully.

Be prepared.,

Breathe deeply and plunge into an answer using good analytical skills and an appropriate sense of humor.,

Answer with thoughtfulness and clarity.,

Stay calm and keep focused.",How to Answer a Weird and Wacky Interview Question," Don't expect your interview to be completely seriously focused but do expect the wacky question to have serious intent. In case you get a weird and wacky question, at least expecting it won't throw you.

An example of a weird and wacky question is: ""If there was a venomous snake sitting on the photocopier, and there is a deadline to meet: What would you do?"";
, The interviewer is trying to elicit how you react to the question and how well you analyze a problem and find solutions., Try not to delay too long in responding as this is about ""thinking on your feet"". Taking the above question, an answer might go something like this:

""Well, that's a curious question! I can envisage several possible answers to this one. First, I would ask everyone to vacate the area. And I'd ask if anyone was its owner, failing which, I'd ask if anyone has had experience in handling snakes - you never know what hobbies people have! Then I'd call security and let them know that there was a possibly poisonous snake sitting on the photocopier and could they send someone to help. If I couldn't reach them, I'd do my best to close off the photocopier room so that nobody could go in there and get hurt. If the photocopier were in an open space and we had to meet the deadline, I guess I'd suggest everyone took their laptops outside or to another area or level and block off the whole floor until help arrived, and we'd get on with our deadline! If I found either the owner or someone with snake-handling skills, I'd suggest they help capture it in a bin or printer paper box, or something!""

, Don't make the answer too short, too long-winded, or just plain ridiculous. For example, simply stating you'd get the office staple gun and shoot it would demonstrate that you're potentially easily annoyed and you're not willing to engage in analysis, or that you're not very creative in coming up with solutions."

Learn about your possible interviewer.,
Make a list of question to ask.",How to Ace Your Medical Residency Interview1," Though you probably won't know who's going to interview you, log in your program's website for clues before the interview. Find out who the program director is, who the major faculty involved in the program are, and who the current residents are. Chances are, those are the faces you'll see.


Be sure to note what their research interests are. What's their take on their specialty? What have they accomplished? All of this information is fodder for your upcoming interviews. You can talk about that cardiac or heath care policy research paper that they wrote. Even just 10 minutes of background research goes a long way in forming a vague idea about who's in the program and what it's all about.;
, Remember that this is a big decision, so you should have questions. Avoid questions that could be easily found on the program's home page. Instead, use this opportunity to ask about the inner workings of the system. How many months in the ICU? When is the in-service exam? How important are the in-service scores? How are residents evaluated? Use this opportunity to find out if the program is a good fit for you. This is also the time to ask about logistics like parking, ARMs, where you'd eat, where you'd sleep, what are the support services and so on.

Be ready to answer a general question on health care reform.,
Write down important experiences.",How to Ace Your Medical Residency Interview2," It's highly likely that you'll receive a question along the lines of ""Why do you want to be a doctor?"" Be sure you have a concrete answer that you can deliver with confidence and clarity. This is also applicable to your specialty—why did you choose this field over a different one?

, You'll probably be asked a question along the lines of ""What do you think will happen in the medical field in the next 10-20 years? How will it affect how you practice medicine?"" Have an apolitical, well-informed response prepared.


Be sure you are knowledgeable about the PPACA passed under the Obama administration. This is a big topic in medicine today, and being unaware of it will definitely hurt your interview.

, Take some time to think about the most important medical experiences you've had. Talk about the time you spent shadowing, your mentor and other people that influenced you, and the interesting cases that you were involved in. Writing these down will help you organize them in your mind so that they are easily accessible come interview day.

Stay relaxed.,
Be friendly.,
Be engaged and open.,
Avoid being awkward.",How to Ace Your Medical Residency Interview3," Don't fear your interviewers—they're probably just as nervous to give the interview as you are to be interviewed.

, Maintain eye contact and don't forget to smile. Interviews are often designed so that the interviewers could see themselves working with you. Showing that you are friendly will help them see that you'll be a good face to have around everyday.

, Show your enthusiasm and interest by staying engaged throughout the interview. Be open to answering any questions thrown your way, and don't be afraid to ask your own questions!

, In general, don't fidget, chew gum, or pick at your shirt. Don't crack inappropriate jokes or check your watch constantly.

"
Keep your schedule free.,
Don't reschedule.",How to Ace Your Medical Residency Interview4," Avoid making big plans during interview season so you can be sure that there won't be any conflicts.

Avoid undercutting yourself.",How to Be More Assertive at Work," If you don't feel confident speaking your mind at work, it might not be the best idea to dive right in by volunteering for a major presentation or asking the boss for a big raise. Instead, start with something smaller.For example, if you were promised some new supplies, like a new monitor for your desk, but your supervisor has forgotten about it or hasn't gotten around to it, make a polite request for those items you've already been promised.
Small victories will build up your confidence and help you feel empowered to speak up on larger issues.;
, When you achieve something important at work, don't keep it to yourself. You don't want to brag too much, but recognizing your own achievements (and having others recognize them) is important to building your self-confidence.Getting in the habit of self-reward and self-acknowledgement will help you feel your own worth and value., Even if you don't feel it inside, pretending like you are confident can make you feel more confident, especially if you make a habit of it.For example, try to smile at your coworkers, and look them in the eye. Walk with some spring in your step, like you're heading somewhere important.Dressing with authority can also make you feel more authoritative. Pick out clothes that are true to your own style and personality, but also convey the idea that you are a professional.This strategy can both make you feel more confident, and can also lead others to treat you with more respect, which can likewise help boost your confidence.

, Think about day-to-day situations in which you often feel uncertain of yourself or hesitant to speak your mind, and look for an opportunity to practice acting confident and speaking up every day.This may feel awkward at first, but this is how new skills are learned. Consistent practice is the path to mastery.Repetition and success will eventually make this start to feel natural.

, It's important to spend some time thinking about tasks or discussions to which you could contribute more, areas where you are strong, and areas where you have room for improvement.Being assertive doesn't mean behaving as if you and your ideas are perfect. True confidence comes from emphasizing your strengths, but also understanding your weaknesses and doing what you can to challenge yourself to improve in those areas., If someone at work criticizes you by saying something that isn't true or isn't fair, try not to dwell on it.Time spent obsessing over criticism that isn't constructive can damage your confidence. It's also a waste of energy., An important part of being more assertive at work is appearing (and being) confident in what you have to say. One powerful way of conveying this is simply making your voice heard in situations where your opinion or perspective might be valuable. Don't wait to be called on, but instead, make your views known.This does not, however, mean your voice always needs to be heard first. Sometimes, it's a better idea to let someone else speak first, and find a way to piggyback your own ideas on top of theirs. This can increase the likelihood of your ideas being approved.For example, it might be a good idea in a meeting to wait for two or three people to speak, then put forward your own ideas, saying something like, ""My idea, which works well with Janet's idea, is...., If you are asked to do something that is not part of your job description, or which you don't have time for because of other projects, you should feel comfortable saying ""no"" to your coworkers. This doesn't make you selfish.

, Being assertive doesn't mean you always get your way, and it doesn't mean silencing other people.The goal of assertiveness is to be confident and persuasive, but not to be demanding, rude, or controlling of others.Practice empathy. Pay attention to the attitudes of those around you and give them a chance to share their views as well.Being respectful of other people's opinions will create a more positive environment in which everyone can feel more comfortable sharing their ideas. Not only does this create a more harmonious workplace, it will allow you to feel more comfortable speaking your mind without fear of judgment or undue criticism.Being aggressive can actually undercut your ability to make your ideas heard, as your co-workers may be put off or distracted by aggressive mannerisms., A professional relationship is different from a social one. In the workplace, being respected as an authoritative and valuable member of the staff is more important than being well-liked by your fellow employees.This is especially true if you are in working in a leadership capacity. Providing those who you are supervising with honest, constructive feedback on their work may not be pleasing to everyone, but is the path to an efficient, effective staff.Sometimes expressing your honest opinions or assessments won't endear you to your coworkers, but this should be a secondary concern in a professional setting.

, An important part of assertiveness is clear communication. Whether you are speaking up at a meeting, having a one-on-one with your boss, or participating in a team project, you will communicate more clearly and effectively if you've given some thought to what you want to say first..


Having a plan for what you want to say before you start talking will make your thoughts and ideas come across more clearly and confidently.If you have to present your ideas at a meeting or in some similar forum, do some research on the topic first. If you are well informed about your topic, you will likely be seen as more authoritative, and probably feel more confident., When considering what you want to say, make sure to craft your message in such a way as to get right to the point, eliminating any information that isn't necessary to the main idea.Tangents and going off topic may cause your listener(s) to stop focusing on what you are saying., Although you can't anticipate every workplace situation, if you know you'll be at a meeting where you'll want or need to present ideas or information, it's smart to practice your presentation beforehand.An idea that may seem clear to you in your own head may sound jumbled and confusing when you say it out loud. Practicing the presentation of your thoughts gives you chance to make sure they are clear and well organized before you speak.Practicing is also good way to reduce ""filler,"" those distracting words or phrases you may use to avoid silence while you gather your thoughts (e.g. ""um,"" ""uh,"" ""you know,"" ""like,"" etc). These space-fillers can make you seems less confident and informed, but you'll be less likely to rely on them if you've practiced what you have to say in advance., A soft, quiet voice will be some as a lack of confidence or authority. Try to speak up so that your words will be taken more seriously.This may also take some practice on your part.
Do not yell. While it is important to make your voice heard, you don't want to be seen as disrespectful or overbearing., Speaking too quickly can make you appear nervous and also make it harder to keep up with what you're saying. Speaking too slowly can make you appear dull or cause your audience to lose interest.It is perfectly acceptable to pause for a drink of water if you need a second to gather your thoughts or let your audience catch up.If you'll be doing a lot of public speaking, consider recording yourself as you practice your presentations. This will help give you a better sense of whether your pacing is effective., Do not use language that makes you seem uncertain or suggests your ideas are not valuable.For example, don't use the word ""just,"" e.g. ""I just think we might want to consider a more ambitious plan."" This suggests you don't think your idea is all that valuable.Similarly, don't start sentences with phrases like ""I could be wrong, but..."" or ""This is only my opinion, but...."" These kinds of openings immediately tell your audience that they should not take your opinion seriously."

Schedule an appropriate time for your interview.,
Prepare for your telephone interview as you would a face to face interview.,
Begin by verifying the interviewer's information.,
Answer effectively.,
Observe standard telephone etiquette.,
Stand up and smile during telephone interviews.,
Close the interview by reaffirming your interest in the position and requesting a follow-up interview in person.

",How to Ace Telephone Interviews," Make sure you can dedicate a block of time in which you will be alone, in a quiet environment, with no interruptions. If you are caught off-guard by an unexpected telephone call, reschedule the interview for a more optimal time, citing a schedule conflict.;
,


Research the company. You should know as much as possible about the company you are interviewing for, as well as the person who will be conducting your phone interview.
Practice your answers for commonly asked interview questions. Interviewers typically ask about your experience, qualifications, work ethic and availability. Additionally, you can find lists of occupation-specific interview questions online. For example, telephone interviews for phlebotomy might include questions about venipuncture procedure and healthcare law.
Before you start your interview, be sure to have a pen and paper, calendar, your resume and cover letter, references, company research and a list of questions you want to ask the interviewer.

, Write down the name of the person who will be administering the phone interview so that you can refer to it throughout the conversation. Also, write down the interviewer's telephone number in case you are disconnected.

, When you are in a telephone interview, you cannot read the interviewer's non-verbal communication and, therefore, gauging the appropriateness of your answers can be difficult. Adhere to the following guidelines when answering questions during a phone interview.


Repeat the question back to the interviewer to show that you are paying attention, and that you understood what was asked of you. Additionally, this technique gives you some time to formulate an answer.
Reply with a question. You don't want to do this for every question, but you should implore about the meaning of important questions that are main qualifiers for the position before you answer. For example, when an employer asks about your experience, you may reply by saying, ""I have a wide range of experience that I feel qualifies me for this position. Could you please give me a specific idea of the type of experience you are looking for?"" That way, you can tailor your answer in a way that either meets the employer's standards, or that compensates for an incomplete match.
Avoid simple yes or no answers. Elaborate on whatever positive points you can make in response to the question.
Stay on subject. Answer the exact question that was directed at you. Do not go off on long-winded tangents.
Allow the interviewer to ask the question completely before attempting a response. Take time to listen and do not interrupt.
If you need time to think, tell the interviewer so. Be conscious of unexplained dead-air and the effect it has on the person at the other end of the telephone line.

, Do not chew gum, eat, drink or smoke, and avoid common language fillers like ""uh"" and ""um."" Speak directly into the phone so that the interviewer can hear you clearly, and never put an interviewer on hold to answer another call.

, Holding yourself upright makes your voice carry, and smiling comes through in your tone.

Ideally, you should try to arrive 10-15 minutes early. This should give you enough time so that you don't have to stress if you hit a few red lights.If you don't know where you're going, consider traveling to the interview location a few days before the interview, just to get yourself familiar with the route. This is especially important if you're not sure about where you will be able to park.;
, It's important to look professional for your interview. You want to look like someone who the parents can trust to take great care of their children.Don't wear anything too revealing.
Make sure you wear something that would be appropriate for a day on the job. If you show up wearing shoes that you can barely walk in, the parents might think that you don't understand the physical requirements of being a nanny.

, The more prepared you are for your interview, the more professional you will appear. If you think you might need it, then go ahead and bring it. In general, you should bring the following items to your interview:Several copies of your resume.
Contact information for references, as well as letters of recommendation, if you have them
Certificates from any relevant programs, including college degrees, first aid certificates, and CPR training certificates
Photo identification
A pen and paper to take notes
A copy of your schedule (if you have other commitments)
A list of questions you want to ask the family

, If the children are present during the interview, you have a great opportunity to showcase your skills. Take advantage of this opportunity to get to know the children and get them to like you.Demonstrate that you know how to interact with children by getting down on their level, making eye contact with them, not interrupting them, asking them questions about what they have to say, and using encouraging language.Ask the children questions about their interests and try to suggest activities that would be interesting for them. This is a good opportunity to talk about activities you like that may fit their interests.
It may be a good idea to bring along some puzzles or games to share with the children during your interview.
In some cases, the parents may ask you to do a trial shift, which will give you an opportunity to spend some time with the children, and will give them the opportunity to judge your performance. If you are asked to do this, it is especially important that you come prepared with as many engaging activities as possible to entertain the children., All job interviews are stressful, and nanny interviews can be especially unpredictable because the parents are probably not used to interviewing and may not know what to ask you. Despite all of the pressure, however, it's important to be yourself. After all, the parents are going to want to hire someone who is likable and genuine.


Be conscious of your body language. Lots of people fidget when they are feeling nervous. Try your best to sit still, have good posture, and keep smiling. This will make you appear much more confident. Maintaining eye contact with your interviewer and having a strong handshake are also very important., You should always go into an interview with a list of personal and professional references. Make sure to let your references know that they may be contacted by your interviewer., Remove anything that might be considered inappropriate from your social media accounts before you begin applying for jobs. There's a good chance that the parents will look you up online at some point. You might even consider downloading an app to clean your accounts up for you., Always be sure to silence your phone before an interview. A ringing phone can make you look unprofessional and might interrupt the conversation at the worst possible time.

, Always bring a pen and paper with you to an interview to take notes. It will make you look prepared, and it will allow you to easily jot down contact information and anything else you may need to remember after the interview.

, You should never say anything negative about a former employer during an interview, even if it is true. These kinds of comments will only make you come across as negative and immature, so try to think of a positive way of talking about your past jobs.

, It's important for the interviewer to get a good sense of who you are, but it's also important that you demonstrate that you are capable of staying on-task. Offer details or examples when they are relevant, but try not to get too off-topic when answering questions.

, After your interview, be sure to send a note, either by mail or by email, to the family. You should thank them for their time and reiterate your interest in the position.

, For a phone interview, it is very important to be in a quiet place where you won't be disturbed. Turn off your phone, television, radio, and anything else that may make noise., Even though your interviewer can't see you, you should still dress nicely and try to maintain good body language during your phone interview. This will help you fel more confident, which can come across in your voice.Smiling is very important too because it can help your voice sound more positive.

, Have your resume in front of you during your interview so it will be easy to answer questions about specifics, like dates.


It's also a good idea to prepare some written answers to questions ahead of time. You don't want to sound like you're reading from a script, but a list of attributes and experiences can help you answer questions more confidently.

, You are able to take more detailed notes during a phone interview than you are during an in-person interview, so take advantage of this! Jot down notes to remind you of questions that you would like to ask your interviewer later on so you're sure not to forget.

, Whether you're a recent graduate or you've been working as a nanny for many years, you need to communicate to the parents why you are qualified for the position. Make sure to communicate how your experience is relevant to this specific job.Even if you've never worked as a nanny before, you can probably think of some relevant experience you've had with children. Babysitting, working as a tutor, and volunteering at a summer camp all count as relevant experience.If you have a degree in early childhood development or a related subject, talk about the kinds of classes you took and what you learned. Some parents may have no idea what your degree entails.

, Be sure to highlight any special skills that you have that could benefit the children. Knowledge of childhood development is a huge asset, but there are also many other skills that parents may be looking for.Be sure to mention the following skills, as well as any other unique talents that set you apart.Second language
Culinary abilities
Musical or artistic talents
Teaching or tutoring experience
Exceptional driving record

, The parents want to know that you will be energetic and engaged when you're with their children, so you need to seem genuinely excited about the opportunity.


Try showing enthusiasm by talking about some of your favorite activities to do or your favorite meals to prepare.

, Asking questions about the children will not only make you seem more interested in the job, but it will also give you clues about what qualities the parents might be looking for in a nanny.Find out how many children the family has and how old they are.
Ask about the children's interests and activities.
Find out if the children have special medical needs or behavioral challenges.
Learn how the parents discipline their children and what guidelines they expect you to follow.

, Your answers should show that you are experienced, professional, and friendly, but they should also be true. Don't lie during an interview, even if you think it will help you.


Keep in mind that you are interviewing the parents as much as they are interviewing you. If you don't agree with the parents' disciplinary techniques, the job may not be right for you, and that's okay!

, Some nannies are responsible solely for taking care of the children, while others might be required to do some household chores as well. Clarify the scope of the work by asking if you will be responsible for things like laundry, cooking, running errands, tutoring, and pet care.Unless these chores are a real deal breaker for you, always express enthusiasm and a willingness to do whatever is asked of you.
You may also want to ask about the children's schedule and the hours you will be expected to work, especially if you have other commitments.
Ask questions about the household routine and the parenting philosophy. It is important to know, for example, if the parents do not want their children watching television during the day or if the children are accustomed to lots of organized activities.

, It's usually best not to ask any questions about compensation during the first interview. These kinds of discussions are often saved for a second interview or for after you are offered the job. If the interviewer brings the topic up first, then it's fine to talk about it.It's a good idea to do some research on the going rate for nannies in your area before the interview, just in case you are asked about your salary requirements. Pay for this kind of work varies greatly by geographic area.If you think of any qualifications that you forgot to mention during the interview, feel free to let them know.

, There's no way to predict all of the questions that parents will ask you during a nanny interview, but preparing answers to some of the more common ones is a great way to prepare. You want to sound conversational, so don't memorize every word you plan on saying, but have a good idea of what you will say if you are asked the following questions:Why do you want to be a nanny?
What was your last job and why did you leave?
What do you enjoy about working with children?
How would you handle a medical emergency?
How do you believe in disciplining children?
What are your views on childhood nutrition?
What was your daily routine like at your last nanny job?
How do you spend your free time?

"
Always be friendly, open to conversation, and professional.,
Get good reviews.,
Always maintain a good work ethic.,
Accept as many shifts as you can.This proves you are keen to work, and additionally after a job well done you are more likely to get more work.,
If you are not getting any work, give them a call.,
If you are not getting much work, join a second agency.,
Be yourself, and do the best you can.",How to Be a Valued Temp Worker (and Get More Work in the Process)," Definitely one of the main but underestimated points of being an agency worker is to always be friendly, open to conversation, and professional - to both your agency's ""consultants"" (who call you to give you work) , and also to everyone in your host workplaces. It's human nature that people prefer a friendly face as opposed to an indifferent one, even if the indifferent worker is better than the friendly worker.
, This is mainly done in your first 3-6 months, even stretching up to 12 months after joining an agency; needless to say, it is always important to have a good work ethic first and foremost. After getting positive reviews from different workplaces, your position in the agency's call list will go up, and you will receive more work. Likewise, you are relied upon to represent your agency in the best, most professional manner at all times, whether working in the public eye, or in private factories and the like., This includes obvious things such as ""doing your best"", not ""slacking off"", ""doing nothing"", checking your phone for extended periods of time, or other similar behavior. It is also important to follow the less obvious social work ethic rules such as no ""extended talking"" or constant conversations while working. This widely varies between companies and workplaces, so it is always important to take a note of and ""feel out"" the company culture and stance on employee's engaging in conversation while working - as it is widely believed (and correct to a degree) to impede efficient work performance., On the other hand, if you must turn down shifts, briefly state your reason why (e.g. invited to a wedding on the weekend), and you may also state you are free next weekend, or the rest of the week, etc., In many agencies, especially if you are a new agency worker, sometimes the only reason you may not be getting any work is because you are simply not on the ""available list."" This is a common mistake that many agency employees make, they state they have not been getting any work for weeks, however have not been in touch with the agency at all during those weeks. In this situation, your ideal course of action is to call the agency anytime during work hours, stating your name and availability (e.g. Hi ...... its ......, just calling to see if there's any work today? I'm available the rest of the week and onwards. Thank you!"").

If you still get no work, wait the rest of the week, or at least 2 days minimum before calling again. If you are calling the agency for work and you still are not getting any work (provided you are in good standing with the company), then there may not actually be much work available. Many agencies hire a vast pool of employees, and additionally there are seasons and times of the year where some companies simply do not have much work available.

, If you are still not getting any work of an extended period of days or weeks, it would be wise to join another agency, just ensure you are as honest as you can be to both agencies and let them both know. Many agencies openly state in their contracts that you are not restricted to working elsewhere, so long as you are honest with your other jobs, and do not inconvenience either agency (e.g. accepting a job assignment, but later cancelling it for another job, not showing up, etc....these are big no-no's and will do you no favours.), In the end, in all assignments, if you can be friendly, professional, do your best, and represent the company in a positive manner, you will almost always get a positive review, and in the process get more work. This may help you become a full-time agency casual at a workplace, a full-time agency worker, or even a full-time employee at one of your host workplaces.

It will always vary from workplace to workplace, however the minimum agency contract to full time period is generally 4- 6 months if a host employer is looking to sign you from the agency as a full-time employee at their company. This is often seen as a great compliment to your working skills and ethic, and also is a great opportunity to begin a career as a full time employee (with benefits) at the host employer you are already familiar with. If you accept such an offer, it is always preferable to remain on good terms with your agency in case of worst case scenario. Similarly, you may also choose to stay in contact with your agency as an on-call worker for extra out of hours or weekend work in addition to your full time job.
On the other hand, if you choose to decline an offer, explain your reasons as politely and as respectfully as you can. You may be invited to continue your regular agency contracted role in the host company, or you may be replaced in the host company if the host employer is looking to hire another full timer. In this situation, you would also preferably explain your reasons for turning down the offer to your agency, so the agency can simply transfer you to another company/job role.

Common requirements include a high level of performance, good teamwork and interpersonal skills, and an ability to make others look up to you.Some organizations allow fellow employees to nominate each other for excellent all-around performance.;
, Once you're aware of the standards for being awarded employee of the month, you can work toward fulfilling them. Even if you’re not selected the month that you start trying to improve your performance and people skills, that doesn’t mean you won’t be chosen soon—it may take time for your performance to be noticed.


Start doing things like allowing others to get extras before you do, turning in high quality work, and being warm in your interactions with other employees and with customers.

, Punctuality is a very important part of any job: it shows that you are reliable. If you aren’t already a punctual employee, start arriving to work a few minutes before your shift begins to help you get in work mode without wasting company time. Punctual employees are disciplined employees, and disciplined employees are more productive.

Try laying out your clothes, lunch, and day bag the night before so that you can just pick it all up on your way out the door.
Try to fake yourself out by setting all your clocks forward five or ten minutes—stove, microwave, phone, even your car clock.
Think about what delays you normally experience on your way to work, and plan to get up in time for an early departure.

, Being able to get to work every day is just as important as being on time. Employees who come to work every day are seen as dependable. Employers would rather have employees who do poor quality work but come to work daily than high achievers who are absent often.It also effects your co-workers when you are consistently absent. If you’re on a team, you slow everyone down by your absence, contributing to a workplace full of irritated coworkers—not a good thing for someone who wants to be employee of the month.

, Along the lines of being present at work every day, meeting all your deadlines shows that you are dependable. When a supervisor continuously sees your work on their desk when it is supposed to be there, this raises their respect level toward you and may even position you for a promotion. People like to work with dependable employees.


Your professional reputation is heavily influenced by how reliable you are. As you turn in projects on time, you build that perception of reliability in your boss’ mind, making you a great employee of the month candidate. You also make a great example to less motivated employees.Complete all tasks related to your job, even if it’s not strictly on a deadline. Task completion also boosts your reputation as a reliable employee.

, You might be surprised to learn that little things like filling up the printer after you’re done and restocking the supply closet are ethical decisions in the workplace. Since many employees tend to avoid such menial tasks, your willingness to perform them displays a strong work ethic.


A good work ethic also includes being honest, not gossiping or sharing secrets, keeping promises, and following rules., Keep your mouth shut in public and on social media. If you don’t like your company or agree with some of its practices, that’s fine. But once you share that feeling with people who could transmit your opinion to your boss, you risk losing your reliable reputation and instead making your boss see you as a gossip.


Instead, promote your company when you can, leaving your name with potential customers so that you are seen by your boss as a free-advertising asset.

, Go beyond the call of duty in areas that are your strengths. This means doing extra work where you know it will pay dividends, such as helping other employees meet deadlines or volunteering for assignments that will be easy for you to excel in.


Because you still need to maintain your reputation as a reliable employee who gets to work on time and meets all deadlines, you want to focus your extra work on things that will be easy for you to excel at.
Don’t look around for someone in charge to notice your efforts. Just do them and you might be surprised who notices.

, We are all familiar with the concept of ambition carrying us to the top of the corporate ladder or getting us to achieve specific goals. And personal ambition is necessary for getting you elected as employee of the month. But companies really like to see ambition channeled toward the company as a whole, leaders who are out to push the whole team toward success, not just themselves.Take initiative when you see the opportunity, but make sure you can turn this transfer this initiative to your co-workers, especially a team if you are part of one.
Get creative about how you motivate your team—use incentives like food, fun times, and competitions with awards.

, Try to go beyond what each task asks of you. Many employees can fulfill the bare requirements—but you want to stand out to your employer in order to be in the running for employee of the month. Do things like writing more detailed reports, doing lengthier research, or following up on a customer's needs more than your training requires.


Offer to work overtime. Even though employees are motivated to take overtime—even ask for it—because of its increased compensation, willingness to work when no one else wants to shows that you are reliable. Employers find employees with a helpful attitude like this a relief.
Put in work outside your job description, such as helping co-workers who are struggling in areas that you can help with but are not your usual tasks.

, In all your rush to do more and motivate others to join you, don’t forget to give your work your best effort. Employers may be excited to see your work on their desk on time, but they also expect it to be thorough and helpful.


Emphasize quality over quantity unless directed to do otherwise.

, Many companies deal directly with their customer base, so if you do customer service in any capacity, do so with the utmost kindness and patience. Customer surveys will reflect satisfaction with your behavior, making supervisors pleased to have you around.


Great customer service can make a business grow, so finding an employee who can help bring in more money is certainly a candidate for employee of the month.Have integrity with customers, doing what you say you will do.
Be patient and courteous even when your customer is rude.

, Being good with people helps you maintain positive customer service relations, but it also helps maintain a pleasant work environment. If you become known for your smile and skill at navigating conflicts with coworkers, employers will look favorably on you—this means less drama and more focus on work (which means more revenue).


Being able to effectively communicate is key for being a good people person amongst coworkers. Do things like learn how to read nonverbal cues (body language) and lower your own stress level., A great way to garner respect and goodwill among coworkers is to volunteer to cover their shifts when it is difficult for them to get off. Sometimes attending an event or staying home to take care of a sick child is more important than the money a coworker would earn, and finding a substitute can make them very appreciative.


Such happy feelings towards someone you work with means a happier work environment.
Being available to serve your coworkers in this way increases your reputation as a reliable employee.

, Work colleagues and bosses like being around people who are friendly, upbeat, and who use manners in all their daily dealings. Make friendliness and courtesy your mantra in both inter-office and customer environments.


A positive attitude can rub off on other employees.

, Seek help when you're in over your head. This willingness to be wrong shows that you are teachable, which can be a relief to a boss who has to train arrogant workers most of the time. Humility can also keep you from taking risks that can land the company in trouble.


Be ready to ask for help when needed but also show that you learn quickly and can institute a new way of doing things from that point onward.

, Cheer on colleagues who are awarded the employee of the month award. Show that you are supportive and not at all jealous. How you behave in front of others reflects on your team spirit.


This is called servant leadership, and ironically is often a quality required for earning the employee of the month award."

Take care not to be too social.,
Stay away from controversial topics.,
Remember that your employer isn't your parent.,
Own up on accomplishments as well as mistakes.,
Keep your opinions about work to yourself.,
Be pleasant.",How to Avoid Making Common Work Mistakes," While employees are expected to be friendly, and some socializing is necessary for employees to bond, spending hours talking about personal things, gossiping, flirting or ""creating drama"" is inappropriate. Never ignore your work in order to engage in non-business conversations, especially if you have clients or customers waiting to be served.;
, Avoid ranting about politics, religion or anything else that others might hold different views about. People typically present a more bland version of themselves at work; just because they don't talk about controversial topics doesn't mean they don't have any opinions or that their opinions are the same as yours.

, The company offers benefits and perquisites to encourage employee retention, not because it cares about you. A business downturn may force change or cuts; don't expect the company to forgo profit in order to make you happy.

, Part of every employee's job is to let the company know which employees are performing well so they can be rewarded or promoted. This is true even if the employee is you.

, Don't grouse about the company or bad-mouth your coworkers or supervisors. Keep in mind that decisions are made and policy set by company executives, who won't share their reasons with you. Make suggestions if invited or offer to help, but don't simply complain.

, The best way to keep your job and advance in the company is to be perceived not only at good at your job, but well-liked and easy to work with. You may have to suppress your natural personality in order to get along.

Find humor in your day.,
Initiate a rewards and recognition program.,
Go out of your way to smile and greet everyone you meet at work.,
Listen to your coworkers/employees and offer positive, proactive ideas.",How to Be a Ray of Sunshine in a Dull Workplace," Sharing a laugh with a coworker or a team of employees can help you add levity to your day. Not only will a good laugh break up the monotony, laughing can have a positive physical impact on your overall well-being. Dr. William F. Fry, a psychiatrist at the Stanford University School of Medicine found that laughing just 20 seconds a day provides the same mental effects derived from 10 minutes of rowing-- and research has shown that exercise elevates the mood and can have a distressing effect.


Self-deprecating humor. People who can laugh at themselves are often the life of the party. Think--Hugh Grant or George Clooney. Both of these famous actors have ‘em rolling in the aisles even when unscripted. Learn how to laugh at yourself and you’ll make others feel comfortable, adding a little sunshine to anyone’s day.
Bonding humor. Bonding through humor is a great way to create office camaraderie. If you are working on a tough project with coworkers or are trying to get to know another employee, find humor in situations such as laughing about something crazy that happened at the office or laughing at some of the crazy ideas you conjured up during the last brainstorming session.
Observational humor. In the spirit of comedian Jerry Seinfeld, find gentle, fun ways to identify the humor in everyday occurrences at the office. For example, why is the water cooler designated as gossip central? Why can’t it be the bathroom or the janitor’s closet?
Teach/train with comedy. If you are your office trainer or are in the process of showing another employee how to accomplish a task, inject a few funny comments into your repertoire to lighten the mood and captivate your audience.;
, One of the best ways to motivate and rev up the atmosphere at work is to implement a rewards and recognition program. Check with HR to see if a program currently exists; otherwise propose a program that will involve every employee in an effort to show how the company appreciates him or her.


Include everyone in the office. The best way to spread office cheer is to make sure every single employee can participate. From the CEO to employees in the mail room, lightening the office atmosphere starts at the top and moves throughout the organization.
Celebrate both big and small accomplishments. Set small, attainable goals such as delivering internal and external customer service or being the office cheerleader. Recognize random acts of kindness such as the employee who stops what he/she is doing in order to help another or the employee who is first to give a coworker a hug when a situation goes wrong. Find metrics that allow you to increase motivation and enhance a positive workplace (such as increased customer service or even a good deed of the day).
Recognize someone each day. Go out of your way to point out the positives in at least one employee every day. Whether it’s bringing your coworker coffee and delivering a “way to go at the meeting today” comment or telling your boss about the outstanding job a coworker did on a project, make sure you find the good in at least one (if not more) employee every day.

, Smiling is infectious--a sincere smile and a warm greeting first thing in the morning can change the mood in your office instantly.


Make eye contact before delivering a warm smile. Call your coworker by name and deliver a heartfelt “good morning” or “good afternoon” along with a warm, welcoming smile.
Ask employees positive, personal questions. For example, when you greet an employee in your department, after you deliver a smile and a “good morning” ask your coworker how his/her child’s soccer game went last night, for example. Avoid touchy subjects but remember topics he/she may have talked about the previous day and raise the topic to show you care.

, Squash negative thoughts and ideas in the workplace with a “can do” attitude and ideas.


Be available to talk and have a listening ear. Sometimes coworkers want to vent or bounce ideas off of someone. Be that “go to” person who will listen and provide comfort and support.
Offer support to coworkers. Be a source of strength for coworkers, however in the event two coworkers are feuding never take sides. Offer helpful suggestions such as mediation or meeting with the boss to discuss a dispute. Also, offer to help or provide resources if a coworker wants to implement a positive idea that will help corporate growth or change.

Train optimism in yourself.,
Identify and oppose irrational thoughts.,
Re-frame problems as lessons.,
Don't multi-task.,
Don't complain.,
Raise your social awareness.",How to Be a Hard Worker1," By learning to be optimistic, the extra effort you need to put in to become a hard worker will become less severe. Optimists see negative occurrences as short lived and narrowly focused events. Adopt the explanatory style of the optimist to help yourself view both good and bad events in a more optimistic light.Describe negative events, like a difficult presentation, in its positive light. For example, instead of complaining about responsibility, you could celebrate it as a chance to show your dedication and work ethic to your boss.
Describe positive things in your life as permanent and everyday. This will help you feel encouraged as you try to step up your game at work.
Optimists have also been found to score more highly on tests designed to gauge luck and self-perception.The higher your self-perception, the more likely you'll be able to shore up weak points in your life.;
, Notice when you see only the worst possible outcomes (catastrophizing), minimize your own good attributes and contributions, or any ""all or nothing"" thinking.Small successes are no less of a success, and you should allow yourself to feel pride at your accomplishment.

, Positive re-framing will reinforce the positive aspects of your situation and prevent you from feeling overwhelmed.This will also encourage you to approach the situation with a more open minded perspective. Open mindedness will facilitate problem solving, and a sense of having your work situation in hand will contribute to peace of mind, making your work easier in the long run.

, Much research has recently shown that no matter how good of a multi-tasker you think you are, there are some serious downsides to performing many tasks at once.Multi-tasking impairs your overall performance, so that even if you feel like you are accomplishing a lot, you really might be missing out on important information and cues.
Constantly being distracted with many tasks can leave the problem solving and creative parts of your brain unable to function optimally., Complaining is a natural part of the human condition, and it's unlikely you'll be able to remove this completely from your life. Be that as it may, complaining without a goal or solution in mind can lead to negative cycles that contribute to depression, poor self opinion, and stress.These will only make it harder for you to put in the time and effort required to become a better, more industrious worker.

, By intentionally reaching out and trying to connect with people that you work with, you will further develop your empathy. Empathy is a key component of conflict resolution, collaboration, compromise, effective listening, and decision making.Raising your social awareness and developing your empathy will allow you to work even harder with your coworkers, and hold you more accountable to your goals.


Research supports that what scientists call ""willed empathy,"" or the imagining of the pain of others, activates the pain response in your brain similar to naturally occurring empathy.Admit the limits of your understanding and ask questions to create conditions where you can feel, and practice, empathy.

Put in overtime when appropriate.,
Culture accountability.,
Maximize potential and improve weaknesses.,
Take the initiative.,
Build a healthy support system.",How to Be a Hard Worker2," Even if there is something that you would much rather be doing, during busy times you can practice your diligence and show your coworkers your commitment by putting in when necessary. Gauge how busy your place of employment by checking in with a manager and asking how other projects are going.


Be careful not to overdo it. Working too hard can have serious health side effect., It's impossible for you to address issues if you are unwilling to face them. It can be difficult to take responsibility for your actions, but complete and timely resolution of conflict is impossible if you don't honestly deal with the root of the problem.


Avoid justifications and unnecessary explanations. These are, generally speaking, a waste of time, as there are always additional factors you could list to explain your actions., Avoid minimizing your successes, no matter how minor, and identify areas in which you would like to improve.


Further improve your strengths by joining seminars, classes, and take on roles in the community that utilize your abilities.
Weaknesses can be addressed by interrupting negative thought patterns by doing something else, like taking a walk, admitting your humanity and the impossibility of true perfection, and by finding a mentor to provide guidance and support.
Make specific changes to help yourself be accountable. You might ask your manager to speak about performance related issues privately in the event you are shy.

, Jumping on an opportunity when it arrives takes self confidence, and you can build this in yourself by starting with small goals and working your way up to a more major responsibility.Before you make a suggestion, pause and think if the idea can be implemented effectively. It's easy to be defensive over your own idea, but weeding out implausible suggestions might leave you feeling less self-conscious.

, Human beings are social creatures. No matter how much of a loner you believe yourself to be, a healthy support system will improve efficiency at work, the keeping of resolutions, and diminish the feeling of being overwhelmed.Use your support system for recommendations when trying for a new position or if you are asking for a promotion.
Collaborate with your coworkers. You never know when you might need their help.
Try not to compete. This can be difficult, especially since many managers use competition to encourage performance, but constantly comparing yourself to other workers can leave you feeling dissatisfied or inadequate."

Practice positive self-talk.,
Exercise your will.,
Imagine your process.,
Make time for meditation.,
Review your progress.,
Try again when you fail.",How to Be a Hard Worker3," Coach yourself by using phrases that resonate with you. Self-talk should positively affirm your accomplishments and the achievement of your personal best.Use present tense messages when practicing self talk to remove future worry with positive assertions.
Talk yourself through fears by asking yourself what the source may be and how you intend on correcting it.

, The more you strengthen your willpower by training it, the stronger it will become. Approach the topic of willpower with a confident mindset; the belief that your willpower pool is limited will cause you to feel a lack of will more frequently.One way you can exercise your will and promote general health and wellness is by exercising. The increased activity of your body will also result in a more active mind., Think about how you will feel as you work on your goal and when you complete it. Visualize yourself being engaged in your work and finding harmony, fulfillment, and pride through it, a common characteristic of world class performers., Many researchers on the topic of willpower and perseverance have noted the positive influence meditation has on endurance, focus, and learning.Taking 10 minutes to calm your mind, breathe deeply, and focusing on the present will allow you to refocus and redeem yourself in a good way.

, Charting your past success will keep you in touch with just how much you've grown as a worker.Self review will also promote more productive discussions about performance, priorities, and challenges., The sting of failure is difficult for even successful people to take in stride, so don't feel self-conscious if you struggle while returning to a failed task. Use self-talk to minimize your negative feelings, and begin planning a new way of tackling your goal.

Sit down more often while working.,
Sit down during lunch.,
Sit down during breaks.",How to Avoid Feet and Leg Problems if Standing for Work1," Although many jobs in modern times are sedentary and involve sitting, there are still some jobs that involve lots of standing, such as bank teller, cashier, factory worker, chef, hairdresser and various retail and construction jobs, to name a few. However, there are often opportunities to sit and rest your feet while still working and being productive, so look for those opportunities and be sure to tell your boss what you're up to. For example, sitting while answering the phone or filling out paperwork might be appropriate at your workplace, especially if there are no customers around.


Aged people are more susceptible to foot/leg injuries from excessive standing because their tissues (ligaments, tendons, cartilage, fascia) lose elasticity and shock absorbency.;
, When you take your lunch break, make sure to grab a seat and put your feet up while eating and hydrating. You may be in a hurry, but take advantage of the opportunity to take the weight off your feet. If your workplace is short of chairs or doesn't have a lunch room, then either bring your own folding chair or stool, or find a different location to eat where you can safely sit down.


Food courts at malls, outdoor picnic tables, water fountains, or even some clean grass under a tree are all good places to take a load off and enjoy your lunch.

, Make sure to take all of your allotted breaks and try to sit the entire time, preferably with your legs up, which promotes better circulation because of the reduced effects of gravity. Taking off your shoes while resting will also allow your feet to cool down by evaporation.


While on your break, consider rolling your bare feet over a golf ball. It will feel great, relieve some tension in the soles of your feet and maybe even help prevent plantar fasciitis (pain and inflammation of the connective tissue covering the bottom of your feet)."
"
Stand in a different spot.,
Stand on an anti-fatigue mat.,
Stand carpeting.",How to Avoid Feet and Leg Problems if Standing for Work2," Many years ago, most workplaces were made with wood floors, which have some cushioning even though they may seem pretty hard to walk on. However, in modern times, most businesses tend to have floors made from concrete, ceramic tile or marble, which have essentially no cushioning, shock absorbency or insulative properties. Consequently, stand in an area that's covered in more springy material such as wood. If that's not possible, then change positions just for the exercise, which will promote blood circulation and may ease the tension in your feet and leg muscles.


Concrete and ceramic tile will easily transfer cold to your feet which is not good for blood circulation, so stand in warmer areas without cool drafts.
If you work outside, find some grass to stand on while plying your trade or waiting for the next task.

, Anti-fatigue mats are designed to decrease the stress on your feet and legs by providing a cushioned surface to stand on over prolonged periods of time. These mats are typically made of thick rubber, but some are also made of foam, leather, vinyl or even wood. In many cases, your employer will readily supply you with an anti-fatigue mat if you ask because they are proven to reduce the incidence of feet and lower leg problems.Thick anti-fatigue mats can be a minor hazard at the workplace if people trip over them, so always be aware of where your mat and those of your co-workers are located.

, Take a look around your workplace and see if there's any carpet you can stand on and still be able to do your job properly. Carpet (even the thin, cheap stuff) provides much more cushion than concrete and will help your feet and legs survive the long shifts at work. If there is no installed carpet at your workplace, ask your boss if you can bring a piece from home.


Some businesses that sell carpet will give you a decent sized sample (big enough to stand on) for free.
Make sure the underneath side of the carpet doesn't slide too readily on the floor, or else you're at high risk to slip and fall.

"
"
Wear shoes that fit properly.,
Don't wear high heels.,
Don't wear narrow shoes.,
Wear compression stockings.",How to Avoid Feet and Leg Problems if Standing for Work3," A significant percentage of people wear shoes that don't fit, perhaps because their feet suddenly increased in size, or because the shoes were on sale super cheap, or because they were passed down from a relative or friend. Either way, always wear shoes to work that properly fit your feet while wearing socks. If you absolutely have to choose a pair that aren't your size, then pick a pair that is too big rather than shoes that are too small because cramped shoes often lead to blisters and foot cramps.


Get fitted for your shoes by a shoe salesperson later in the day because that's when your feet are at their largest, usually due to swelling and slight compression of your arches.Sacrificing style and fashion for practicality is the best strategy when shopping for work shoes.

, Women are often expected or pressured to wear high heels for many jobs, but heels more than 2 inches (5.1 cm) high can force the body to tilt forward, which creates a variety of imbalances from the feet to the low back. This situation can cause foot strain, Achilles tendonitis, tight calf muscles, knee pain and low back problems, as well as instability while walking.Wearing completely level shoes is not the answer either, because too much pressure is put on the heel, so wear shoes that are elevated in the heel by about 1/4 or 1/2 inch.
Most athletic or walking shoes with wide toe caps are good choices if you must stand for hours at a time at your job.

, High heels are often too narrow at the toe, which compresses the toes together unnaturally and increases the risk of painful bunions and unsightly calluses. Cowboy boots and some swing back sandals are also too pointy in the toe, especially if you plan on doing lots of standing. Instead, choose shoes that grip your heel tightly, provide enough room to wiggle your toes, and has enough interior support to prevent pronation (the rolling inward or collapsing of your ankle).


Pronation is much more common in obese people and often coincides with flat feet., Compression stockings provide support to muscles and blood vessels of the lower leg, which reduces edema / swelling and promotes better circulation.They are found online, at medical supply stores and sometimes at pharmacies or physiotherapist offices. Alternatively, wear supportive pantyhose or well-padded socks.


Compression stockings are particularly important for people who have venous insufficiency (leaky vein valves) or inflamed varicose veins.Thick, well padded socks are helpful if you experience heel pain while standing.

"
"
Take a foot bath.,
Get a massage.,
Wear shoe orthotics.,
Lose some weight.",How to Avoid Feet and Leg Problems if Standing for Work4," Soaking your feet and lower legs in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce pain and swelling.The magnesium in the salt is thought to help the muscles relax. If inflammation and swelling is a problem for you then follow the warm salt bath with an ice bath until your feet feel numb (about 15 minutes or so).


Always dry your feet thoroughly before you get up and walk away from your foot bath in order to prevent slipping and falling.
Epsom salt baths are thought to be helpful for alleviating restless leg syndrome at night, which negatively impacts sleep cycles.

, Get a massage therapist or sympathetic friend to give you a foot and calf massage. Massage reduces muscle tension and promotes better blood flow.Start rubbing from the toes and work towards the calf so you help the venous blood return to the heart. Using a wooden roller under your feet will give you a decent massage by yourself without straining your hands. Consider applying peppermint lotion to your feet also, as it will tingle and invigorate them. After the massage, perform a few foot and calf stretches on both legs.


Stretch the calf muscles by leaning against a wall with one knee bent and the other leg straight out behind you with both feet flat on the floor — hold for 30 seconds and repeat a few times.
Stretch the bottom of your foot by wrapping a towel around the end of your toes and then trying to extend your leg — hold for 30 seconds and repeat of few times.

, Orthotics are custom-made insoles for your shoes designed to provide arch support, shock absorption and better foot biomechanics, which can translate into less foot/leg/back pain and reduced risk of various foot and leg conditions.Orthotics are particularly helpful for treating and preventing plantar fasciitis, a very painful condition of the bottom of the foot, and flat feet. Custom orthotics can be expensive without medical coverage, but off-the-shelf insoles may provide benefit also.


It's estimated that about 2 million people require treatment for plantar fasciitis in the United States every year.You may have to buy shoes a little bigger than you normally would in order to accommodate the orthotics.

, In general, people who are overweight or obese suffer more foot problems because of the increased amount of pressure on their feet.Flat feet, fallen arches, severe pronation, and ""knock knees"" (medically known as genu valgum) are more common among the obese. As such, do your feet a favor by losing some weight. Lose weight by increasing cardiovascular exercise (such as walking) and decreasing your caloric consumption.


Most people who are relatively sedentary only require about 2,000 calories per day to maintain their body processes and have enough energy for mild levels of exercise.Reducing your calorie intake by 500 calories daily will result in about 4 pounds of fat tissue loss per month."

",How to Be a Good Employee," This is a business, a hospital, a chemist, government department, a retail outlet, etc, not a playground, unless you are employed as a playground supervisor. People talk, and workers know the difference between a person who is fun to work with and a person who is always fooling around. Fun means a good personality, a joke or two, and a smile. Fooling around is wasting your time and that of others, being frequently off-task, and often being seen standing in the workspace of others instead of in your own.;
, It will provide you with valuable ideas about what people expect from you, any weak areas, and what you need to work on first. If a boss or coworker criticizes you in a way that hurts or angers you, wait until you cool/calm down and ask them if you can talk with them. Tell them how you felt, but tell them that you would like to fix the issue and want them to talk with you about what needs to be changed.

, Whether it's menial and tedious, or tough and high-paying, learn how to do the job, regardless of how difficult you think it might be. Promotions are most commonly based your ability to do your job, loyalty to the company, your aptitude, and your educational background. If you don't know how to do something, go find out; don't make excuses for why you didn't do it.

, They are the experts in their departments. Treat all co-workers with courtesy, respect, and kindness because they hold more power than you realize, and your reputation with them matters. Do not hang out with other employees who mistreat, disrespect, or talk down to others.

, You can also take a study course paid for by your employer - do it! Cross-training, new skill sets, and further education show that you are intelligent and value life-long learning. If push comes to shove, and people are let go, you stand a better chance of being retained than those who can only do one thing.

, Do a good job, show up on time, keep a good attendance history. When you find out someone has been let go, you often find out later that there were underlying circumstances that led to their dismissal, including frequent absences, missed deadlines, reprimands for unprofessional behavior, or too many customer complaints. If you don't do that, you don't have room to negotiate.

, Always arrive early. Be at least 15 minutes early every day. That way, if you are running late, you will be on time. If you have to park far away, you will walk in and still not be late. If your client is early, you will be there to greet him or her, and not leave someone waiting for you - even if you arrive on time.

, This will immediately make you stand out from 95% of the other employees. Mean what you ask and follow through on your promises.

, Quit whining about what's wrong and start being vocal about what's right! A positive attitude goes a long way with many supervisors. When you go to the boss with a problem, go with at least one suggestion in mind for a solution. Even if the boss doesn't take your suggestion, you will look like a problem-solver, not a complainer. Your boss has their own private lives to leave at the door, so do you. If you keep piling on the emotional baggage, then your boss may see that you can't balance your personal life from your work life. They will not approach you when they want to ask employees about perhaps open door advice when it comes to work related group efforts.

, We mean this in a literal way. Pick your feet up and walk proud, and get right to your work - don't procrastinate or let things drag up to the deadline, and then jump in to get it done in a fast flurry at the end. It may make your boss crazy. Gain a reputation for having your act together more so than the majority of people.

, Quit gossiping and get to work. Your employer is not paying you to gossip. Of course, you want to establish a good rapport with your co-workers, and a little chatting is inevitable and desirable. But spending a half hour regaling your co-workers with your previous evening's adventures will not make your boss love you. When one of you is talking a lot, two of you are not working a lot. Note: if your boss walks by and two of you are talking, no big deal, but wrap up the conversation so that the boss won't see the same sight on her way back. The same goes for a group of you. If you are part of a group who is talking when the boss walks by, discreetly excuse yourself to return to your area after a few seconds. If your boss hears that you are gossiping behind their backs or planning a secret meeting to approach your boss is not the solution. This may just make you look like an instigator or conspirator.

, Don't let paper sit on your desk for days on end. Get the work done and move on to the next thing as quickly as possible.

,, A calm, assured energy will take you much farther than carrying yourself in a hunched up ball.

, Don't worry about who gets credit - your boss knows much more than you think. Be a team player. In addition, volunteering allows you to choose the part you will play. If you don't choose, chances are it will be chosen for you. Either way, you'll be responsible for some facet, so be one of the first to step forward when you can.

, Work is for work. Keep cell phones in your locker and limit personal calls on work phones to emergencies.

, People notice who runs to the clock out stations prior to shift end. One of the best uses of this time is to organize your work space for tomorrow. Take a moment to put away loose papers, sweep, wipe down surfaces, and locate things you'll need.

, Offer to show them the ropes or offer training tips. Remember how it felt to be the newbie. Be a mentor. If you are not sure someone understood something, be willing to ask if they need assistance. Don't do the work for them, teach them instead. Be careful what you say to new employees; don't air your grievances, frustrations, or interpersonal conflicts. Don't gossip.

, Don't argue a lot, your company's policies is what your boss has to follow. So if you found something wrong, try to understand your boss's perspective, but without arguing. Use a good and quiet way to understand the problem point. You may just realize that things happen for a reason and not necessarily for a season. Policies are implemented for reasons of the good of the whole.

Bring along a notebook or keep your cell phone handy and take notes on the state of the barbershop, the duties performed by the barber, and any other responsibilities you might notice.Try to plan at least one of your barbershop visits during a high volume time of the day. You can do this by stopping by the shop you want to visit throughout the week, peeking in the front window to see which days are busiest.
It's important to get an idea of the range of responsibility of a career before committing to it. If you aren't sure you can handle the busy days, you may want to reconsider your choice of career.;
, This is a rich opportunity for you to inquire about a practicing barber's experience, his thoughts on the profession, difficulties he's had in his career, and so on. If there is a particular barber you admire, try to arrange it so that you and he have time to chat, or even schedule a shave or a haircut with him.

, Location has a large impact on the kind of clients that will frequent the barbershop in which you will work. Your ideal clientele might be outside your reach while starting out as a barber. It's important that you provide a high level of service to all customers, even if you consider yourself more an artist than a glorified pair of hair clippers., Though a job as a barber might seem quite laid back, after a busy day spent mostly on your feet, you might begin to question your choice of vocation. Is standing for long periods of time difficult for you? Can you maintain precision and skill with repetitive mechanical tasks, like sweeping, operating scissors, and using clippers? These requirements are all in a day's work for a successful barber., Though barbers are required to know how to cut and shave clients, sterilize tools, and even assess skin conditions, all of which are normally covered in the course of your barber schooling, no amount of school can guarantee your personality. Barbers are expected to be personable, friendly, and skillful. If you lack any of these qualities, barbering might not be for you., There are some certification programs that are affordable, but some programs can be expensive. You will also need to consider the cost of owning your own barbershop, is that is a goal of yours.


Some 6-month, comprehensive programs can cost up to $3,000, while a top tier 12-month program might cost as much as $12,000.
An associate's degree may take you 2 years to complete and anywhere between $6,000 and $26,000., Many states require that you not only complete a barbering program, but also have your high school diploma. Even if the state you live in does not have a diploma requirement, many barbering schools list this among admission requirements.While in high school, you may have the option to prepare you for your barbering career. Any classes on hair styling, small business management, or accounting can be a serious benefit to your career.
Many high schools partner with community colleges to offer more specialized courses for students. You might be able to take a course in barbering or hair styling, which will give you a head start in your career.

, You might even want to see if a local barber will take you on as a part time employee. Explain your plans to him, and let him know that you're willing to help with whatever he might need around the shop while you observe his daily routines.Try to pay attention to:


How space and equipment are organized
How he interacts with customers
How chores and workflow are managed
Miscellaneous errands you might not have considered, Choose your program wisely. Your education and time are an investment, and you'll want to learn not only the ins and outs of snips and shaves, but you'll also want to learn about the business side of things. Some states also require a minimum number of hours of practice before you can even be considered for licensing as a barber.

Regardless of state, most programs include courses in:

Bacteriology
Honing and stropping
Hygiene
Physiology
Sanitation and sterilization
Scalp and skin diseases

State barber laws, rules, and regulations
Straight razors, Some of this may be covered in your barbering program, but on the business side of things, you might not think about the cost of insurance you may need to cut hair and shave. Accidents, though few and far between, do occur. You'll need to protect yourself, and your clients, from issues that might arise from being uninsured.

, No matter the state you live in, you will be expected to take an examination to prove that you are ready to be a barber. In some cases, this test might be unique to your state or a national exam created by the National-Interstate Council of State Boards of Cosmetology (NIC).

Some states even use a combination of state and national tests, but the written portion of the test will include:

Chemical services
Chemistry
Electricity and light
Facial and shaving services
Hair and scalp
Haircare services
Infection control and practice
Skin histology
Tools, implements, and equipmentAdditionally, there may be a practical portion of the exam which might include:

Chemical relaxing
Chemical waving
Hair lightening/coloring
Haircutting
Set up and client protection
Shaving with a straight razor, There are various routes you can take as a newly licensed barber. You may want to apprentice under a more experienced pair of scissors until you are fully confident in your skills and are ready to strike out on your own. You can also:


Work at a barbershop for commission
Rent a chair from a local barbershop
Contract with a spa
Open your own barbershop, Now that you've completed barbering school and received your license, you may be tempted to rest on your laurels and take things as they come. Even if most of your clientele prefers not to be shaved by straight razor, you never know when this service will be requested.


Some barbers maintain their skill-set by practicing on themselves daily., This is especially common when you are just starting out. You won't have a client base to support you, so you might be hired to barber for commission. This, most usually, entails a percentage split, where you split your profits with the barbershop.


A 60% take home with 40% returned to the barbershop is not uncommon while you build your clientele., As your client base grows and you gain more regular clients, you should renegotiate so that instead of paying commission per client you are instead playing a flat fee for use of the chair. This is referred to as ""chair rental.""In this case, you will not have to split any profits with the establishment, you will only be expected to pay a set fee., If you are cutting your way to owning your own barbershop, you'll need to shop around for insurance and be sure you have it before opening shop. Most states will require you to have some kind of legal coverage., With online services, like Facebook, Twitter, and Yelp, you can get word out to new potential customers about your services and skills. However, it can take time before word gets out and the clients come in. You should be prepared both financially and emotionally to wait out opening doldrums.

, Quality products are an investment in your business, and customers will appreciate quality tools and a comfortable environment. You should also pay attention to trends in style. If you notice locals in your area preferring a kind of wax or some other product, you may want to include that you carry this product in an advertisement.

, Some barbers, especially those who have been around a long time, can make ends meet offering only the basics. As a newly licensed barber, you should consider offering unique or special services. Something as simple as hot towel service and your winning personality can earn you customers and set you apart from the rest.

, The bottom of the tie should just barely be able to touch the top of your belt buckle if you are a male in JROTC.

, These and other drill / marching commands can be found in Army Field Manual 22-5 aka the blue book.

, Commands should be reasonable such as ""Cadet, please notify First Sergeant that we need assistance in the supply room,""  not ""Cadet, I order you to shine my shoes.""

, If you are too quiet or too loud people will think you are not bold enough to be a leader or too bold and a know it all. For example:

Have an ""Ah Ha"" moment.,
Decide some areas of your abilities and things that are interesting to learn.,
Keep up your stamina and enthusiasm in the areas of your strengths and interests to find your best abilities and greatest opportunities that will fit your personality.,
Focus mainly on one thing -- one at one time, and not much else, and let almost every ounce of effort go into that so that it will become a real area of strength -- not confusion.,
Keep on doing what you decided to do.,
Improve yourself and your chances and you will not be confused.,
Do not stop and start--or quit halfway through--because if you do not accept or reject theories or ideas blindly, then you can be clear about your purposes and keep going.,
Continue to build your strength of faith and your ability to learn and to earn -- with faith in your ability to improve abilities and skills by being persistent and reliable -- believing that you're blessed.,
Follow-through: stopping halfway is confusing and shows a pattern of mixed up thinking.",How to Avoid Confusion in Study and Work," Make two columns with a list in each column. In column one write your interests and abilities (What are you good at?) In column two make a list of your difficulties and weaknesses. This can help to clarify your thinking in both areas by comparison and contrast. Hopefully you'll feel good about your strengths and prospects and you will not be confused.;
, Define your questions. Ask questions of your teachers, mother, father and other elders, as well as your peers. Read and do research to seek answers at the local library or on the internet.

, If you are not sure about what you want to learn and develop, then just take a guess and start on something that seems right.

,


You may need to get over some bad habits/weaknesses, and so work on lessening your weaknesses that seem to matter the most. For example, If you are good in improving your attitudes, being positive and thoughtful, then consider working in an area requiring contact skills in work that requires communicating with people.

, Persistence is about half of being successful. That takes mental discipline and keeping on doing positive habit-forming while breaking bad habits. This could be in school, in a career, a hobby or all of the above.

, Keep working and studying. Working itself is far more satisfying and important than reaching a temporary solution. Few things in life are permanent.

, Don't worry if your concepts are not clear at first or seem to come and go. Just step up and take a breath, keep going and be sure that you are doing it in a good manner.

, Be thankful for your opportunities and go for it, instead of complaining! If you find that your skills limit your earning potential consider staying in or going back to school or college. If your interest lies in the computer industry, many community colleges offer computer certification tests. Check with counselors at school or college.

, After all many employers just want to see that you can finish your program of study and be self-motivated to improve yourself, not just because of ""the paper"" for graduating from school and college.

Make a case for yourself.,
Identify the position you want.,
Get the timing right.,
Ask for a meeting.,
Do your research.",How to Ask for a Promotion1," When you ask for a promotion, you should be prepared with specific details about your contributions to the company as well as with an explanation of what you're asking for. If you go into a meeting and just say, ""I want a promotion,"" it's likely that your request won't be taken seriously. If you want to plan ahead, then you should be prepared to explain the following points:


Make a list of all of your accomplishments. Think about all of the things you have done for the company in the past six months, year, or even the past five years, depending on how long you've been at the same position. Write down any projects you worked on, any sales goals you've surpassed, or any innovative ideas you've had that have helped move the company forward.
It's important to be as specific as possible. If you can quantify exactly how much your projects, sales, or general work has helped the company, this will make your case much stronger.
Prepare to show that you've been exceptional. You don't just want to say that you've done a good job, but to prove that you've gone above and beyond expectations.;
, Many people want to advance in the company and get a big promotion, but they find that there's nowhere for them to go because of the corporate structure. If there is a specific job opening, then this part is easy, because you can apply for it. However, if there is not, determine a need for a position where you can improve the day-to-day business operations of the company by being effective in that new role.


Once you've found the position -- or created a new position -- you'll need to find examples to prove that you're the perfect person for the job. If you want to be a team leader, show your boss how well you've done when leading smaller projects.

, Many people are afraid to ask for a promotion because they can't seem to find the ""perfect time"" to do it. Well, there's no perfect time to ask for a promotion, but there are definitely some moments that are better than others. The best time to do this is during your yearly or semi-annual review, which is the perfect opportunity to discuss your accomplishments and future potential. But if you don't want to wait, here are some other points to consider:Consider the situation in your department or team. Has your department recently merged with another, and is there a lot of overall change in the company? If so, then you may use this as an opportunity to be a part of that change. However, if your department is laying off a ton of people due to the merge and the environment is very stressful, then you may want to hold off until things quiet down.
If your company has been struggling and losing a lot of money, or you and your fellow employees are struggling to make a major work deadline, then you should wait until things calm down a bit.
Understand who your boss or superiors are before asking. Many people have a ""way"" they like to converse and do business. This way is different for each individual. Determine when the right time is to ask the boss about your promotion. For instance, if she is about to take a two week vacation, she might be in a good mood. If she just lost a major account, looking to promote yourself may not be wise at that juncture.
Don't wait for the perfect time for too long. If you've been wanting to have the conversation for months but there's always a ""good"" reason to wait, then it's time to be less picky and to start moving forward.

, Once you've figured out what you're going to say about your accomplishments, know what position you want, and have an idea of when to have the conversation, it's time to get the ball rolling. Don't just barge into your manager's office in the middle of the day and ask to have the talk. Instead, have a conversation with your manager or send a quick email saying that you'd like to discuss your performance and potential.Once you talk to your manager, he'll have an idea about what you'll want to say, so he won't get caught off guard during the meeting.

, Though you don't need to say exactly how much money you'd like to make when you ask for a promotion, you should be prepared to talk about it if it comes up. Find out exactly how much you're worth, both in your company and the world at large. Look at Salary.com and PayScale.com and figure out what you should expect at your company as well as with the competition."
"
Don't think that you're entitled to a promotion.,
Don't think that you and your boss see eye-to-eye.,
Don't compare yourself to other employees.,
Don't make a case based around your personal life.,
Don't get frustrated or upset if you don't get a promotion.",How to Ask for a Promotion2," The worst thing you can do when you go into your manager's office to ask for a promotion is to be 100% convinced that you deserve it. Just because you've worked at the company for a certain amount of time doesn't mean that it's time for you to get a raise and a promotion. Go into the conversation prepared and with an open-mind. If you sound too self-assured, your boss or manager may think you're being arrogant or unreasonable.

, In an ideal world, your boss will be aware of all of your accomplishments and will be on the same page about when it's time for you to move up the corporate ladder. However, even if your accomplishments have been impressive, your boss still may not think it's enough for you to move on to the next level.


He may agree that you've been accomplishing as lot, but he may also have a better idea of how many skills and how much experience you'll need to acquire before you can move on.
Be open-minded. If he thinks you're not ready, ask what else you can do and even write it down. Show that you're determined to keep up the good work and will do whatever it takes.

, Though you may feel that your coworker, Jim, doesn't have as much experience or education as you but was promoted more quickly, the worst thing you can do is complain about other coworkers who have been promoted and say that they don't deserve it or that you're a harder worker than they are. This will make you look petty, whiny, and most of all, not mature enough to move up the corporate ladder.Let's face it -- maybe you feel that you really do deserve a promotion more than old Jim. That doesn't mean you have to talk about it. Focus on yourself, not the people around you.
Promotions happen for a number of reasons that may not be clear to you. Don't try to guess why so-and-so was promoted instead of you or you'll drive yourself crazy.

, Though personal circumstances may lead you to need more money, and thus, a promotion, as soon as possible, you should avoid talking about your personal life when you ask for a promotion. Instead, focus on all that you've contributed to the company as well as the contributions that you plan to make within your new position.Don't mention the fact that you need money to pay for a new house, to support a new baby, or to pay for a pricey divorce -- these may be relevant points for you, but they'll make your boss think you're not focusing on the company.

, If you didn't get the promotion you want it, don't sulk, complain, or even tell other coworkers about how badly your meeting went, how your boss is out to get you, or how nothing you do will ever be enough. This kind of word will spread, and you won't come off in a favorable light.


Be polite and calm to your boss and ask what you can do to be a better employee -- you may be frustrated, but you shouldn't make your feelings public or you won't be considered for a promotion in the future, either.

"
"
Start by stating your accomplishments.,
Show that you're ready for more responsibility.,
Ask for feedback.,
Don't be disappointed if your boss thinks you need more time.,
Follow up.",How to Ask for a Promotion3," That list of personal accomplishments will come in handy once you're ready to have that meeting. You should open the meeting by thanking your boss for taking the time to talk with you and then discuss all of the success you've brought to the company, being as specific as possible in terms of revenue, increased growth, and any factors that truly make you stand out as an employee.

, Once you've stated your accomplishments, you can discuss the position you'd like to obtain, whether it's a position that's just been opened or one that you'd like to create. You should be prepared with a list of goals you'd like to meet in this new position, and a game plan for achieving them. While you're doing this, think of what would interest your boss the most, and prioritize your goals accordingly.

, Don't do all of the talking -- let your boss help you find ways to grow and to offer his perspective on whether or not you're ready for a promotion. Though you should prepare some talking points, you should look at the meeting as a conversation, not just an opportunity for you to deliver a speech on how amazing you are.

, If your boss says you're not ready for a promotion, don't get upset or hurt. Instead, ask him to help you build a road map for future success. This can help you have a better vision for your future, and feel like you have a concrete plan for achieving your goals.Be proud of yourself for starting the conversation, and know that the meeting will have your boss thinking of you for future promotions, even if it didn't come out the way you planned.

, If you didn't get a promotion, don't just tell your boss you'll try to meet your new goals and hope for the best. Instead, follow up from time to time and ask your boss about your progress and see if you're meeting his needs. If you check in once in a while without being too insistent, then your boss will be paying more attention to you and will know that you're serious about accepting more responsibility.And if you did get the promotion, then go out and celebrate! You deserve a break after all of the hard work you've done.

Talk about the individual's greater background.,
Summarize the new role.,
Congratulate the employee.,
Announce the promotion externally.,
Publicize the promotion.,
Share the news on your company's website and social networking sites.",How to Announce a Promotion," Communicate the good news to him or her. Outline the changes in their duties and any change in salary.”I’m so happy to be able to tell you -- we’re promoting you to X position. You’ll be making Y amount more per hour and have Joe and Sandra reporting to you.”
”We’re doing some restructuring and I’d like to offer you a promotion. You’d be a manager, making $2,000 more per year. Do you think you’d be interested in this?”
”I know you’ve been looking for a way to move up in the company. We have an opening in the shipping department that I think you’d be great for. It would pay more and be more responsibility. Are you interested in a move like that?”;
, He or she will want to share the good news with those closest to them. Let them know, however, that it should be kept quiet until you begin making the public announcements.

, Before announcing a promotion to the entire company and the public, make sure the employee, the former supervisor and the new supervisor are aware of the change. Keep other key staff members in the loop, including the managers and leaders who work with that employee regularly. Be sure all operational managers are aware of the change too, including human resources personnel, I.T. managers, security personnel and others who may need to know about the promotion for logistical purposes., Announce the news of the promotion to the entire company. This can be done in person, if it is a small company, or by email or written memo. Use many different methods to communicate the news.”As CEO, I am so happy to announce that our longtime administrative assistant Jenny Gonzalez is going to be heading a new department. She will be in charge of X, Y, and Z.”
”It’s been a tough few years for our company, but things are changing. We’re going to promote Ellen Jones to the managing director position, which has been unfilled for many years. Ellen has been with us for ten years (as most of you know) and we’re excited for her to take an even larger role in the company.”
”Great news, colleagues! Dr. Kevin Lee will be named head of surgery. He’s done an amazing job as assistant to the head of surgery, and with Dr. Mary Lewis moving on, we needed a new head of surgery and knew that Dr. Lee would be our first choice. We are so glad he has consented to the change in duties.”

, Reference the individual's history with the company, and what he or she has done. Mention how long he or she has worked there, and highlight some of the person's major contributions.”Ms.Gonzalez has been in charge of our diversity hiring initiative since 2009. She has also led our bilingual and translation group, which is now large enough that it needs its own administration. She will be our first head of bilingual, translation, and Spanish-language initiatives.”
”We hired Ellen soon after we started the company, and she has been central to our success for ten years. She has planned our amazing Christmas and Fourth of July parties for nine years, and is a favorite among all of our children for her (not-so-secret) sticker and candy drawer.”
”Dr. Lee has been an integral part of our surgery department for four years. His good humor and attention to detail make him a favorite with all of our residents. He’s an amazing mentor to younger doctors, and his continuing interest in and love for medicine helps remind all of us old-timers why we got into this in the first place.”

, Note any prior experience or expertise he or she had before joining the company. Also discuss significant educational achievements.”She is a graduate of UCLA (2004) with a BA in Communications and Business. Before Ms. Gonzalez worked for us, she worked at Kane and Barnes as an administrative assistant.”
”Ellen graduated from the University of Vermont (like most of us) in 1987. She worked for a while as a dairy farmer, a midwife, and a massage therapist before having her children. After staying home for a few years with her children, she was ready for a new challenge and applied to join our business when it was barely making money. Thanks to her and all of our employees, we have succeeded far beyond our early expectations.”
”Dr. Kevin Lee got his MD from Vanderbilt, and his BA from Duke. He completed his residency at Cedars-Mt.Sinai. We hired him four years ago and have been so pleased at how well he has worked out.”

, Talk about whether the promotion will be to fill an opening, or whether it is a new position created to match the individual's strengths. Assure everyone that there will be no gaps in what that person used to do, and that the department or the team will continue to function and succeed.


”Ms. Gonzalez will be taking a new position in the organization, and I know that the job description as we have currently defined it will probably grow and change as she continues to work. She will be overseeing all of the work with our Spanish-speaking clients and conducting feasibility studies about a new office in Mexico City.”
”Ellen will be directing and managing all of our catalogue work, both online and in print. We decided it was finally time to make one person in charge of all of it. Mike Henderson will be taking over Ellen’s warehousing responsibilities, and we’re going to be advertising for a part-time person to answer phones.”
Dr. Lee will be taking over the position vacated by Dr. Lewis”

, Publicly express your appreciation for the work the employee has done. Welcome others in the organization to congratulate and honor the promoted employee.


”Please join me in congratulating whenever you see him/her.”

, Share the information with any clients, customers, and other partners and contributors to the business or organization. Follow the same format as the internal announcement, and communicate if the promotion means anything to specific groups, such as the taking over of new clients, accounts, or other projects that are relevant., If the promotion involves a person with a public profile, or a job that will require a lot of public and community outreach, send a press release to the local media. Most newspapers have business sections that include new jobs and promotions., Include links to the announcement of the promotion and the biography of the employee. Explain how the employee will fit into the existing structure of your company."
"
Know your office's dress code.,
Find your brands.,
Understand modesty is your friend.,
Dress up more than you think you need to.,
Focus on the details.,
Don't be afraid to add a little flair.",How to Appear Professional1," Most offices will spell out their dress code for you. However, if they don't, take a look around when you interview. You should be able to gauge what's appropriate to wear to the office by what other people are wearing. For instance, if everyone is wearing a suit jacket, don't show up for work in jeans., It will make it easier for you to keep your wardrobe up if you find particular brands that work for you in your price range. Not every brand fits the same, nor does every style fit every person. Invest some time visiting different stores to find what you like up front, and then you won't have to spend as much time when you need to update your clothes later., The office is not the place for short skits, low-cut blouses, tight pants, or halfway unbuttoned shirts, for men or women. Keep your clothes more modest, and you will be seen as a professional., This rule is true especially when you are meeting someone for the first time, being interviewed, or attending a big meeting, such as a press release or a meeting with an important client. If you overdress, you'll still be seen as professional, while if you under dress, you'll be seen as unprofessional. That doesn't mean you need to wear tails or a formal dress to a stockholder's meeting; however, you should try to wear your top professional clothing., It's the details that put you over the top professionally. For instance, you may have a well-made suit, but if it's covered in dog hair, you're not going to look professional. In addition, you may have nice shoes, but if they're heavily scuffed up, it takes away from your appearance., You can add personal touches to your outfit and still be considered professional. Maybe you like a funny tie, or maybe you enjoy a pretty hair clip. As long as it's not too ostentatious, it's fine."
"
Set a completion timeline for your project.,
Break down your project into smaller tasks.,
Finish one project at a time.,
Prioritize your tasks and your projects.,
Assume it will take longer than you expect.,
Schedule regular breaks throughout the day.,
Eliminate deadlines if there is no reason for one.",How to Always Meet Deadlines1," When setting a completion time, it’s good to be realistic about how long it could potentially take you to complete the project. Consider what you’re expected to deliver, how much time you can dedicate to it, how large the project is. Another way to get a good estimate is to compare it to projects you’ve done in the past.If you don’t think that it’s possible to finish on time, talk to the person who originally assigned the deadline and see if you can get it pushed back.


Determine an estimate of time that it takes for each smaller task. Once you're done, add a time cushion on the end of it to get a realistic time for the entire project.Make sure that you get complete clarification on the specifics of a project before you agree to a deadline.Don’t compromise and agree to a deadline that you know is unattainable. This will dissatisfy whoever assigned the deadline and hurt your reputation.;
, Instead of feeling overwhelmed with the idea of completing a large project, break it down into smaller, easily attainable tasks.Cross out the tasks on your list as you complete them.


If you have to write a paper, doing the research could be your first task. Additional tasks could include writing the first 500 words, completing the introduction, or getting a certain amount of pages written.
If your deadline is for work, make sure you are allotting time effectively. If one of your smaller tasks is taking much longer than usual, it may be a good idea to switch to another portion of the project.

, Though many of us are forced to multitask in our day to day lives, it’s important that you dedicate enough time to each individual project you are working on. Dedicating your attention to a single project makes you more efficient.If you are forced to work on a parallel timeline for two or more projects, complete a chunk of tasks for one project before switching gears and working on a different one.

, When you have to juggle multiple projects or tasks, it’s important that you can determine which tasks are more critical to the overall success of the project, or which steps need to be completed before you move forward with it.


It may be a good idea to start with the most difficult tasks or projects first, when your mind is the most fresh., It’s important that you factor in unintended circumstances that may delay your project. For some things, this may mean not having the required materials in time, someone getting sick, or a personal emergency.


If there is an emergency that comes up and you’re unable to make the deadline, let the person who issued the deadline know as soon as possible.

, Constantly working with out taking any breaks makes you less efficient. Instead of burning yourself out, take 10-15 minute breaks in your day so that you don’t lose focus.Consider how long it usually takes you to lose focus and adjust the amount of time you work at once based on it.Small scheduled breaks throughout the day also let you evaluate complex problems that may be stumping you., If a deadline is arbitrary or artificial, you should consider removing it all together. Some projects and tasks take time, patience, and high levels of accuracy, and the completion time has no weight on the overall project or organization.


Projects that require a high level of accuracy and testing like in IT or programming should rely less on deadlines, and more about creating a quality product.While setting fake-deadlines may work for some, studies have shown that they typically don't increase productivity. What matters more is our work ethic, and other behavioral aspects we can aim to improve, like getting more organized."

Show up on time.,
Take appropriate breaks.,
Know your job.,
Stay on task.",How to Appear Professional2," Being on time actually means making sure you're there a few minutes early in the morning, ready to work. Also, when you are supposed to attend meetings, always be on time., If you're supposed to take an hour lunch break, make sure you're back within the hour. Also, follow your break rules. If you're allowed 4 breaks a day at 10 minutes each, make sure to stick to that. It won't hurt you to take a few extra minutes every now and then, but don't make it a rule., You should be trained to do your job when you first arrive. However, if you find yourself a year or two in, and you still don't have all the knowledge you need, ask someone for help. If you want to be discreet, ask someone who works at the same level as you to give you a few pointers; you can pay the person back by taking him or her out to dinner.Similarly, if you don't understand a new assignment, ask for clarification from your boss. Your boss usually won't mind because you're just trying to get the job done right., While you're at work, be at work. Don't be on the phone with non-business calls except for the rare emergency. Avoid social media and other distractions. Focus on the tasks at hand."
"
Keep your personal and professional life separate.,
Buy into the culture.,
Keep your office clean.,
Speak distinctly and thoughtfully.",How to Appear Professional3," While it's fine to mention your family once and while, keep the details of your nasty divorce at home. Similarly, watch how you present yourself on social media.If you're friending people from work, you might want to hide certain posts from them, or better yet, don't post them at all. For instance, if you're going out on a drinking binge, it might be best to keep those posts separate from your work friends.Another option is to only friend work friends on LinkedIn, since that is meant to be a professional profile, while keeping them away from Facebook. Similarly, you could have two Facebook accounts, one that includes work friends and one that doesn't.
However, remember, that once it's out there, it can be copied and shared by other people, so if you really don't want people to see it, don't post it., Every office has a different culture, including unspoken rules. Some are more relaxed, while others may be more rigid. Watch people closely to pick up on the unspoken rules. For instance, maybe one unspoken rule is that you need to use email if your question can wait awhile., If you have piles of papers and coffee cups everywhere, you'll be viewed as unprofessional. However, you can add a few bits of personal charm; just keep it office appropriate. Pictures of your family are fine; pictures of half naked men or women should probably stay at home., The best way to sound professional is to keep the verbal tics out of your speech. One way to do that is to speak more slowly, taking time to think about what you're saying as you say it.If you aren't sure what verbal tics you use, try taking a recording of yourself when you're talking on the phone. You'll be able to notice it better when you play back than you normally do when you're speaking.Try to eliminate the ""ums"" and ""likes."""

Telling a friend or family member about a deadline could motivate you to completing it on time., If you’re the type of person that is easily distracted, you could benefit from saving social time for after you meet your deadline. If you’re missing important deadlines on smaller tasks because of late nights or spending too much time with your friends, abstain from attending social events until your deadlines are met.


Tell your friends that you have an important deadline, and you would like to go out, but you have to meet your commitments.

, Your environment affects your mood. If the work space you are using makes you tired, or is uninspiring, consider changing it.Visiting a local cafe may be the right decision if you can do your work on a laptop.
Simply changing the room you’re in may also help you stay productive.

Finalize your new goals.",How to Write a Self Evaluation," Creating a thorough and useful self-evaluation takes time, so make sure that you schedule enough time to complete the process. If you rush through it, then you’re likely to skip over important accomplishments or growth opportunities, which makes your finished product less productive because it won’t truly reflect your career progress., Your self-evaluation must reflect that you are meeting your self-set goals and the goals of the company at-large. Most importantly, to show your organization that you are an effective employee, you must show that you are working to meet the organizational goals.Completing a self-evaluation will show you if you are on-track to meet your career expectations because you can see if all of the hard work you are doing connects back to your goals.

, Based on your goals, create an inventory of all of the work you’ve done over the past year. Include things like projects you’ve completed, committees you’ve served on, and reports you’ve drafted. This list will include everything - from the client records you stapled to the committee you chaired.Assess your work materials, such as emails and reports, for examples of your work and support for your accomplishments.As you write down your accomplishments, think about how they fit in with your goals and use that to help with wording. For example, if your goal is to increase sales, and you have been calling potential clients, then you could say that you “initiated sales” or “increased point-of-sale opportunities” rather than “made cold calls”.

, Because this is a self evaluation, include only your accomplishments, not those of your entire team. Demonstrate how you contributed to any team assignments, including your qualities as a team player.

, Every worker has weaknesses, and honestly identifying them is the only way to overcome them. You must reflect on your struggles in order to set new goals and choose useful growth opportunities.Think about times you’ve fallen behind in your work, needed assistance, or were unsure that you completed a task correctly.
Provide examples. Just as with your successes, include concrete examples to support your need for professional growth opportunities.If you’re struggling to identify your weaknesses, talk to a trusted colleague, a mentor, or your supervisor.

, Record your professional development activities from the previous year, connecting them to your goals and prior weaknesses. Show how you’ve been successful at overcoming your struggles and how hard you’ve worked to become the type of employee your organization wants.


Include professional growth activities you’ve completed in your own time as well as those you did as part of your job.

, The feedback that you have received over the past year will be instrumental in supporting your accomplishments and helping your identify areas for development. Remember to include feedback from your supervisor, colleagues, and clients, if it’s available.

, Show your organization the unique qualities that you bring to the table. For example, do you have a varied educational background or are you bilingual? Include these traits in your self-evaluation to show your organization how you are contributing to the company culture.What makes you different as an employee? Ask yourself what characteristics you bring to the job that go beyond the job description. Since this evaluation is focused on your performance, incorporate details that demonstrate how you contribute as an individual.

, Work through your list of accomplishments and develop a list of the work you performed as part of that accomplishment. Once you have an overview of the work you completed, write a brief explanation using action verbs.Action verbs show what you did in concrete terms. For example, state that you evaluated survey results, trained a new hire, or initiated a new project.
Be honest. While you want to word your accomplishments in a way that reflects well on you, make sure that you are being accurate. For example, don’t record your independent work as managerial experience because you managed yourself.

, Support your accomplishments with quantifiable examples, such as statistics, percentages, or calculated totals.As an example, say, “I increased my customers by 20%” or “I lowered bug reports by 15%.” You can also use straight calculations, such as “I completed five surveys” or “I averaged four customers per day.”

, Prepare a list of qualitative examples to support your accomplishments, especially in areas you were unable to provide numbers.Qualitative examples show that you took actions but are unable to show numerical data. For example, say, “I increased customer support by creating a new web app.”


Qualitative examples are great support when taking an action is meaningful, regardless of its success. For example, if you are in charge of a program to prevent teen drinking, any action you take is useful, even if you only stop one teen from drinking.

, Link your positive feedback to your accomplishments to show that others have observed your successes in the workplace. Only include feedback that clearly supports an accomplishment so that your self-evaluation will be accurate and useful., Read over your self-evaluation, paying careful attention to how well you accomplished your previous year’s goals and the organizational goals. Identify gaps where more improvement is needed. Then study the struggles you identified, which will show you areas you need to improve., Based on your identified gaps and struggles, develop new professional goals for the upcoming year. Aim for two new goals, and remember that you will continue to work toward your organization's goals.As you set your goals, remember that you will need to show support for your accomplishment of the goals and that you will need to be able to take growth initiatives. Write your goals in a way that allows for you to meet those demands.

, Schedule a meeting with your supervisor to review your results. Be prepared to explain the information you’ve included. Show them your initial new goals, and explain why you’ve chosen this focus for the upcoming year., Once your supervisor has reviewed the results of your self-evaluation, ask for areas of improvement and areas where you’ve demonstrated success. Ask them what they think of your initial new goals, and allow them to help you reshape those goals., Discuss your previous struggles with your supervisor, and offer your ideas for the coming year’s professional growth. Listen to your supervisor’s suggestions and be open to pursuing their ideas. Show them that you are addressing your weaknesses and pursuing success.

, Based on the feedback you received from your supervisor, finalize your new goals and update your self-evaluation to reflect the changes."

Never claim service or awards if you have not served.",How to Know Military Uniform Laws," It is illegal to wear a uniform or any uniform part that is not issued by the branch of the armed forces in which you serve. For example, a member of the Navy may not wear the uniform of the Army.Your military unit instructor will let you know how to obtain your uniforms and associated parts (like hats, badges, etc.).;
, Some uniforms have parts that are easily identified with a particular branch of the military. While on- or off-duty, these ""distinctive parts"" can only be worn if you are wearing the full uniform.

,


Some parts are not considered distinctive (like an undershirt or shoes) and can be worn at any time, on- or off-duty.

, If you earn any type of medal, you should wear it only on ceremonious occasions and not with your regular uniform.


This includes the Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, or any other award or medal.

, You do not have to wear your uniform when off duty, but you do have to maintain your grooming standards and otherwise represent your branch of service in a professional way.


You should not wear your uniform when you are off duty, except for transportation home.

, In addition to your issued uniform, there are other policies regarding personal appearance and grooming including hairstyle, tattoos, and jewelry guidelines that are all considered part of the military uniform (because they keep everyone looking uniform in appearance). These differ within each branch of the military, so be sure to look through your handbook for specific instructions. For example, in the Army:


Soldiers may not wear any jewelry except a watch, ID bracelet, and two wedding rings. Female soldiers may additionally wear a single pair of round, stud-style earrings. Tattoos are permitted, but must not represent any extremist philosophy or group (including, but not limited to, recognized hate groups) or that are sexist, racist, or indecent. Additionally, soldiers may not have any tattoos on the face, neck, hands, or wrists. Be sure to talk with your commander before getting any new tattoos after joining the military., For the most part, wearing religious apparel in uniform is frowned on, but recent rulings by the United States government have made it possible for exceptions to be made to accommodate practices that are central to your religious observance.


For example, a Muslim or Sikh serviceman can petition his squadron leader to wear a beard or turban while in uniform. Accommodations such as these are made on a case-by-case basis. If you require an accommodation, you have to apply to be an exceptions to the rules., All other uniforms and uniform parts remain the property of the armed forces. You are allowed to wear one uniform home.You may continue wearing your uniform for up to three months after your honorable discharge.Many recently discharged servicemen and women like to wear their uniform for coming home parties or other special occasions. If you want to wear your uniform for an important event (like your own wedding), be sure to schedule the event within three months of your discharge.

, If you leave the military for bad conduct or any other reason that results in a dishonorable discharge, you are not permitted to keep any uniforms or parts of uniforms.The military will require you to purchase clothing to wear home.Because you were dishonorably discharged, you may never wear a uniform again (for example, for Veteran's Day ceremonies, funerals, or other purposes).

, If you choose to, you may wear your uniform at any time if you have retired from the armed forces-- you have earned it! You must wear the uniform of the grade at which you retired. For example, if you retire as a Sergent, you must wear the uniform and badge of a Sergent.If you were nominated for promotion upon your retirement, you may wear the new higher grade.Many retired servicemen and women choose to wear their uniforms to weddings, funerals, Veteran's Day celebrations, and other special occasions. You are not obligated to wear it, but it is a great way to show others that you served.

, Check with your branch of the armed forces if in doubt. For example, the presence of retired military personnel may be requested at a government sponsored parade or function. You may only wear the uniform under these circumstances if you served honorably in time of war. If so, wear the uniform of the highest grade achieved during wartime.

, This may or may not be an armed forces uniform.


Perform instructional duties for military courses wearing a uniform only if it bears some distinctive insignia to indicate that it is not a duty armed forces uniform.

, Wear the uniform as prescribed by your branch of the armed forces while you are living in or an officer of a Department of Veteran's Affairs veteran's home.Check with the appropriate branch of the armed forces if in doubt.

, Even if you are not currently serving, there are certain laws and regulations that apply to your behavior while in a uniform that represents the United States government. In general, you should behave in a respectful and becoming way. More specifically:


Any time you are in uniform, you represent the United States government. You are expected to maintain the grooming standards of the military even if you are retired, if you plan to appear in uniform. This includes being clean-shaven, keeping your hair neatly under your headgear, and not having facial piercings or tattoos.While saying the Pledge of Allegiance,or while passing, lowering, or raising the United States flag, anyone in military uniform (active, inactive, or discharged) should stand at attention, face the flag, and perform a military salute, rather than placing his or her hand over the heart., If you have never served in the armed forces, you are prohibited by the United States government from wearing the uniform of the Air Force, Army, Navy, or Marines.You are also prohibited from wearing a uniform that is similar to that worn by the armed forces in any public place or in public view. Doing so is a Class A Misdemeanor.The law is up for interpretation regarding how ""similar"" a replica uniform can be without being prohibited.


This includes wearing any ""distinctive piece"" of a military uniform, such as a beret , jacket, or insignia.
This includes the military uniforms of other countries, and the uniforms of past enemy regimes such as the Nazis, not just United States uniforms. For example, you are prohibited from wearing a Nazi uniform in public.There are several reasons for these prohibitions. The first is for security reasons; in one instance, a woman tried to gain access to a secure military base using someone else's uniform. Another reason is because civilians need to know that people in uniform are trustworthy in cases of emergency. Finally, it is considered disrespectful to those who have served, since they put their lives on the line for the privilege of wearing the uniform., If you portray a member of the armed forces in a theatrical, television or movie role, you must use a uniform given to you by the production which they have created or purchased for the production. You cannot wear any uniforms you or others may have that were issued by the military.Unlike costumes worn in public or for Halloween or costume parties, replica uniforms for productions may be made to look exactly like real military uniforms, but can only be worn while working on the production. So if you have worn, for example, an exact replica uniform for a play, you cannot later wear it for Halloween., If you are attending a training camp or other course of instruction hosted by the military and you are a civilian, on some occasions you may be required to wear a military uniform. This is the only time that you are legally permitted to wear an authentic uniform as a civilian.You will be notified prior to the training whether you should wear a special uniform. Only wear a military uniform if you are instructed to do so by the Secretary of the branch of the military concerned., Under the United States Stolen Valor Act of 2013, it is against the law to claim that you have served in the military or that you have received medals or awards for your service if you have not. This includes making fraudulent statements in order to obtain money, property, or other benefits (although simply claiming it is considered protected speech), and also includes simply wearing a medal that you did not earn.Even if a medal was earned by a relative or has sentimental value, it is illegal for someone else to wear it. This includes medals such as the Purple Heart, the Navy or Air Force cross, a Congressional Medal of Honor, or any other medal or award, or replica of a medal or award."

When you speak with a recruiter, be sure to ask about the commitment that will be required for the type of service you want to do. Discuss the specific requirements of your field of interest, including the education you'll need.
The recruiter will provide you with an application or direct you to one that can be found online. When you submit your application, you'll continue working with a recruiter to set up a plan for enlisting.

, The Navy is rich with career options for recruits, who can choose to pursue a career in engineering, construction, education, the arts, health, information technology, special operations, and so on. Deciding early on what path you want to pursue can help you achieve your goals in the Navy more quickly.


Recruits who wish to become officers, who serve in managerial positions in the Navy, will need to undergo more training than recruits who will serve as enlisted sailors, the workforce of the Navy.
The Navy often pays for undergraduate and graduate education to help members pursue jobs and careers., When you're ready to commit and you've passed the necessary medical and mental exams, you'll fill out paperwork and receive instructions regarding the first year of training. If you're signing on as an enlisted sailor, you will typically commit to at least four years of service; if you're signing on for an officer position, the commitment is three to five years.

Complete the first year of service.,
Complete your terms of service.,
Rise through the ranks.",How to Join the Navy3," During the first year, you'll undergo primary training and begin learning about the job you wish you pursue. You'll spend time getting acquainted with the rules and culture of the Navy.

, As a member of the Navy, you may or may not spend time deployed on a ship. In some cases you may spend up to 6 months at a time away from your home base. At the same time, you'll work a specific job and gain expertise in your chosen field., Many people in the Navy are eligible for a promotion after just 9 months of active duty. As you fulfill your service commitment, opportunities for promotion and advancement are often plentiful. After 3 to 5 years of commitment, many choose to stay in the Navy past their first enlistment.

You must be a British, Commonwealth, or Irish Republic Citizen. If you have dual citizenship with another country, this does not necessarily revoke your nationality eligibility. You must also have resided in the UK for the five years preceding your application. During those five years, you must not have lived outside of the UK for more than 28 days per year.If you meet the nationality requirements but do not quite meet the residency requirements, contact an RAF recruiter for more information on whether you may still be eligible to apply.;
, Depending on the specific position you intend to apply for, age requirements vary. The youngest possible age at which you can join is 15 years and 9 months. At the upper end of the age spectrum, candidates up to age 55 can serve in specific positions. Age requirements are not flexible.If you’re applying before the age of 18, get your parent or guardian’s legal consent before beginning your application.

, Depending on which position you intend to apply for, you may need to specific academic experience. Some positions, however, have minimal academic requirements. Once you consider all of the eligibility requirements, consider your academic history and performance when deciding which specific position to apply for., Training in the RAF requires all candidates to be physically fit. You will undergo multiple fitness assessments during the application process. Requirements in terms of the minimum level of performance will vary based on the position you’re applying for, your age, and your gender.See the RAF Fitness Test website at https://www.raf.mod.uk/recruitment/how-to-apply/eligibility-check/?rid=19.1542 for specific information on the marks you’ll need to achieve in specific exercises – such as pushups and sit ups – as well as a video that will familiarize you with the tests.

, You must also be healthy to join the RAF. Health is determined according to your Body Mass Index (BMI), your eyesight, and any medical conditions you may have. If you are over 18, your BMI will need to be within 18 and 28. Eyesight requirements widely vary, and correctional lenses do not hamper your eligibility. If you have certain medical conditions, including some common ailments, you may not be eligible for application.The RAF website provides a calculator to help determine your BMI.
You may meet the health requirement with a slightly higher BMI by undergoing an additional assessment with an RAF doctor.
If you are under 18, your BMI must be within 17 and 27.
See the RAF website for a non-exhaustive list of medical conditions that will likely render your ineligible to apply. Understand that you will have to pass several medical assessments to be admitted to the RAF., If you have any convictions on your legal record, declare then when you first contact an RAF recruiter. Certain convictions may prevent you from being eligible to apply. The RAF will undertake a background check on you in order to determine your eligibility for admittance, as well as any potential security clearances.While a legal record may not prevent eligibility to apply, it may disallow you from serving in certain positions.

, Certain factors may automatically remove you from eligibility. In particular, certain tattoos or other physical adornments, extreme political views, a history of drug abuse, or pending court appearances will render you ineligible to apply. You may also be ineligible if you have recently declared yourself bankrupt. If uncertain about these criteria, contact a recruiter.Previous or current membership in any organization known to condone racial hatred or violence will likely disqualify you.
Tattoos must not be visible above the neck collar nor below the cuff while wearing an RAF uniform. Piercings, such as gauges, that have resulted in permanently open holes may also disqualify you.

, Before beginning your application, choose between a full-time and spare-time commitment to the RAF. This will determine whether you will be applying as a Regular or Reserve. Further, you’ll also need to determine which “area” of the RAF you are interested in. Within your area of interest, you will choose a specific role to apply for.Areas of the RAF in which you may serve include personnel support, medical and medical support, logistics, force protection, communications and intelligence, aircrew, air operations support, and technical and engineering.

, For help determining which roles you are eligible for, contact a recruiting office directly. The “Contact” section of the RAF website provides a form to contact a recruiter via email, though you may also visit an RAF office, attend an event (listed on the “Contact” page), or call 0345 605 5555 about Regular service or 0345 606 9069 about the Reserves., There are seven specific roles within the area of personnel support that you can apply for as a Regular or Reserve candidate. These roles include positions related to personnel training and support, human resources, and physical training.

To be eligible to join the SAS, you must be an official member of one of the uniformed services of the British Armed Forces — either the Naval Service (comprised of the Royal Navy and Royal Marine Commandos), the British Army, or the Royal Air Force.


Note that each service has its own enrollment and training requirements, which can be demanding in and of themselves. For instance, the British Army's basic training regimen is 26 weeks long and includes rigorous physical training and tactical exercises.
Note also that, like other services of the British Armed Forces, the SAS accepts members from countries of the British Commonwealth (like Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, etc.).;
, Another way to become eligible to join the SAS is to join one of the SAS reserve regiments (the 21st and 23rd regiments) and serve in the reserves for 18 months. Because, unlike the SAS proper, the SAS reserves do recruit from the civilian population, this represents a relatively direct path to SAS status for an applicant starting from civilian status.

, The selection process for the SAS is one of the most difficult military training programs in the world. Its purpose is to test candidates to the utmost limit of their physical and mental abilities. Though rare, it is not unheard of for candidates to die during the selection process.Because of the extreme demands of SAS training, only healthy young men in great physical and mental condition are considered.


Though women have been integrated into the British Armed Forces since the 1990s, they are excluded from most combat-oriented units. Because of this, at present, women are not allowed in the SAS. There are, however, signs that this may change in the near future., The SAS demands a serious commitment from its applicants. If you successfully complete the selection process, the expectation is that you will remain with the SAS in a devoted role for, at the very least, a little over three years. Because of this, candidates who apply to the SAS must have at least 39 months of service remaining to be considered. In addition, candidates must have a minimum of 3 months experience with their own regiment.

, If you believe you have what it takes to join the SAS and you have a burning, passionate desire to do so, finalize your decision by filing an Army General Administrative Instruction (AGAI). The AGAI states that you are prepared for and have full knowledge of the demanding challenges that lie ahead.


Once you've made your decision, you'll want to wait for the next selection process to begin. The SAS selection process takes place twice per year — once in the winter and once in the summer. This is true regardless of the conditions: no matter how hot or cold it gets, the selection process moves forward.

, As the very first part of the selection process, recruits are taken to the SAS headquarters at Stirling Lines, Hereford to receive a basic medical test as well as the Battle Fitness Test (BFT). The medical test ensures that the recruit meets basic standards for being healthy and disease-free, while the BFT tests the recruit's physical fitness. About 10% of applicants fail one of these tests.


The BFT consists of a squadded 2.5 km (1.5 mile) run in 15 minutes followed by the same distance run individually in under 10.5 minutes. Those who fail at this point aren't physically prepared to become members of the SAS.

, Over the first weekend of SAS training, recruits receive detailed instruction on what it will be like to experience the SAS selection process and, afterwards, to be employed as a member of the SAS. During this short phase, the physical and mental demands placed on recruits are not as strenuous as they will eventually be, though recruits do still participate in several hill runs. In addition, recruits undergo a variety of general suitability tests, including the following:


Compass and map test
Swimming test
First aid test
Combat fitness test

, After the briefing phase of training, the actual selection process begins. The first phase, which lasts for four weeks, focuses on the candidate's endurance and ability to navigate in the wilderness. Activities during this phase include timed hikes and runs and navigating between rendezvous points on a map. The intensity of these activities grows over the span of the training phase as candidates are made to carry increasingly heavy packs and meet increasingly strict time goals. Candidates are often not informed of the time limit of a given exercise before being assigned it. Major events during this phase include:


The ""Fan Dance"", a 24 km (15 mile) hike in the Brecon Beacons (a mountain range in Wales) that takes place at the end of the first week of the phase and serves as a major ""weed-out"" event.
The ""Long Drag"", the culminating test of this phase of the selection process. Candidates must complete a 64 km (40 mile) hike in the Brecon Beacons in less than 20 hours. During the hike, candidates must carry a 25 kg (55 lb) pack, a rifle, food, and water. Candidates are forbidden from using established trails and must navigate solely by map and compass.

, After passing the physically demanding initial phase of SAS training, remaining recruits enter the next phase, which focuses on combat skills. Over four weeks, recruits receive training in weapons handling (including foreign weapons, demolition, patrol tactics, and other essential battlefield skills.


During this phase, every recruit that is not already parachute qualified is trained in this skill. In addition, recruits are trained to the British Army Regimental Standard for signalling.

, Following Initial Continuation Training, recruits are shipped to a location in Borneo or Brunei where they undergo 6 weeks of strenuous training in the hot, humid environment of the jungle. Candidates are divided into four-man patrols, each supervised by a member of the Directing Staff. During this phase, soldiers learn how to live, navigate, and fight in the jungle. Activities include hikes/marches, boat handling, combat drills, camp building, and more.


Personal care and first aid plays a big role during this phase. Because ordinary cuts, insect bites, and blisters resulting from training can easily become infected in the jungle, it's important for every recruit to know how to care for his wounds.

, As the final stage of the selection phase, recruits participate in a variety of exercises designed to build their ability to survive in realistic ""off the grid"" combat scenarios. Recruits learn how to move stealthily, live off the land, and avoid capture by hostile forces. Activities include evasion exercises, survival scenarios, and lessons in interrogation techniques.


The culminating test of this phase is an exercise in which recruits have to complete set objectives while evading capture by a Hunter Regiment of opposing soldiers. Regardless of whether or not recruits are captured during the exercise, they must take part in Tactical Questioning exercises (see below).

, One unique aspect of the final phase of the SAS selection process is the Tactical Questioning portion. Recruits are placed in a variety of physically and mentally uncomfortable positions for 24 hours. During this time, Directing Staff subject them to numerous interrogations, during which candidates must not reveal any significant information. Recruits may only volunteer their name, rank, serial number, or date of birth. All other questions must be answered with ""I'm sorry, I cannot answer that question."" If any soldier cracks, he fails the entire selection process and must return to his unit.


While Directing Staff aren't allowed to torture or seriously injure recruits, their treatment is quite severe. Recruits may be, for instance, blindfolded, deprived of food and water, forced to stay in painful ""stress positions"", subjected to continuous loud noises, and forced into small cages. Punishments may be psychological, as well, and may include verbal abuse, insult, humiliation, trickery, and more.

, If you successfully make it through the SAS's selection process, you can count yourself among the proud few. Only roughly 10% of candidates make it this far. At this point, recruits are given the SAS's characteristic beige beret with upturned rapier insignia and enter SAS Continuation Training, which is focused on teaching new SAS operatives the unique special operations skills they will need to achieve victory in the world's tensest combat zones.


Note that, at the end of the selection process, recruits relinquish any rank they may previously have held and become troopers. In the SAS, all recruits have to work their way up from the bottom. However, if a recruit leaves the SAS, he is immediately restored to his previous rank with credit for time served. The exception to this rule is with officers, who retain their rank upon joining the SAS.

, The most immediately apparent aspect of SAS training is that it is likely more physically demanding than any other experience you've had thus far. Candidates are expected to run or hike for hours (during the ""Long Drag"", for up to twenty) through tough terrain on a regular basis. Candidates are also expected to carry heavy loads, scale difficult peaks, and perform many other physically challenging tasks. For the best chance of making it through the SAS selection process, try to devote serious time and energy to getting yourself into tip-top shape before beginning.


Cardio training is an absolute must. Many of the toughest challenges during the selection process, like the ""Fan Dance"" and the ""Long Drag"", are endurance-based. This means that a strong focus on cardio training, especially running and hiking, is one of your best bets for having a strong advantage during training. In addition, spending lots of time performing these activities will get you used to the feeling of spending all day outdoors. See How to Add Cardio to Your Workout.
While cardio training is very important, you won't want to neglect strength training. SAS candidates are expected to have the strength to carry heavy packs on long treks in the wilderness and to be lethal in combat, among many other responsibilities. A thorough regimen of strength training exercises balancing lower body, core, and upper muscle groups can help you achieve the level of strength you'll need. See How to Lift Weights.

, Some recruits who are natural-born athletes still drop out of the selection process due to the mental stresses involved. SAS selection and training requires your total concentration even during times of great physical exertion. For instance, recruits are expected to be able to navigate their way through vast stretches of wilderness with nothing more than a map and a compass even when completely exhausted. Without mentally preparing yourself for what may very well be the most stressful events of your life, you may find that your efforts are wasted.


Precise instructions for how to mentally prepare can vary from person to person. Some may respond well to concentration-improving exercises, while others may favor meditation. Regardless, everyone can benefit from having very realistic expectations of the selection process. It's not a gung-ho, Hollywood-style macho exhibition — it's an intensely demanding experience for which very few are truly prepared.

, The SAS is not for candidates who struggle to find inner motivation. The grueling selection process weeds out all but the select few candidates who have an intense, burning passion to become some of the greatest soldiers in the world. For instance, in a practice that is uncharacteristic of most military training programs, SAS Directing Staff do not shout encouragement or insults at candidates as they complete their long marches. It's entirely up to the candidate to find the inner strength to succeed. If you have any doubts at all about joining the SAS, you may want to reconsider.


Though some candidates are allowed a second chance at the selection process after failing, this is not necessarily guaranteed. After two fails, candidates are barred for life from attempting again.
As you prepare for training, keep in mind the official SAS motto: ""Who Dares Wins"". By attempting to join the SAS, you are making a significant risk (or ""dare"") — that the time and effort you put into preparation and training won't be in vain. With the right inner drive, this risk becomes slightly smaller — if you want the prize, you'll push yourself to the absolute limits of your ability to get it.

To a certain extent this is true, however, your recruiter can also be your best friend and will generally bend over backwards to help you. If you are honest with them, they will play straight with you. In the end, though, they are salesmen, and you should stay on your guard in the same way you would with a car salesman: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.;
, There are many sign-on bonuses and guaranteed promotions that are available to you for enlisting. While you should enlist out of a desire to serve your country and grow as an individual, you may do that and get a sign-on bonus. Regardless of what your recruiter tells you, take the bonus. They will give it to you. If given an option between money and promotions, take the money. A minor promotion from E1 to E2 is meaningless when you arrive at your first chain of command. You will still be treated as low man on the totem pole, regardless of your rank. Remember that one third of your bonus is going right back to the government in taxes. If you can't get the guaranteed school that you want, don't sign anything. Thank the recruiter and tell him to call you if a spot opens up, but in the meantime, you're going to see if another branch (i.e. Navy) can offer a guaranteed school in your area of interest. The recruiter will call you several times and encourage you back, but hold firm. Before a month's time, they will guarantee your school or arrange to guarantee when a slot opens up.

, The military will eventually find out if you do (urinalysis flushing drugs only last for a while, and eventually you will test positive). As long as neither are excessive, you can usually get a waiver. Do not, however, apply with drugs in your system. If they are detected, you will be forced out and unable to re-apply. Don't lie about an injury either, because you could suffer from it. (In the Air Force)

, Boot camp turns your life upside down and can be very long (three months if enlisting in the Marine Corps), but a little preparation before starting can make your time there easier.


Exercise. Run, do push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups and crunches. The more physically fit you are before arriving at basic training, the better off you'll be. Not only will you need less time adjusting to the physical demands of basic training, but you'll make a good impression on your drill instructors. Arriving at basic training overweight and lacking strength can make you a target for drill instructors, and in extreme cases, add time to your basic training. You can't begin training until you meet military standards for weight and strength. If you don't meet those standards, you will be put on a physical training routine until you do. This means spending weeks or months more at basic training.
Study. If you ask your recruiter, he/she will give you books that you can study from. Knowing basic knowledge and military jargon before arriving at basic training can help you stand out from the crowd. That can be a good thing. The more you learn in a low-stress environment means you will have an easier time in the high-stress environment of boot camp. Try to absorb as much on rank structures, equipment such as the M16, and the 11 General Orders if possible—it will pay off later.
Practice basic training routines. Speed and motivation are everything in boot camp. Drill instructors will constantly test your ability to do things quickly and without hesitation. While at home, fill a laundry basket with 6 pairs of socks, 6 pairs of underwear, 3 pairs of pants, 3 shirts, two notepads, all your hygiene gear, a couple of books, and two pairs of shoes. As quickly as you can, dump everything out of the laundry basket onto the floor and mix it up a bit by kicking it around a little. Now stack everything on your bed in a neat fashion. That means having the clothes folded, the hygiene gear aligned in a neat way, your books and notebooks stacked neatly, and your shoes sitting next to each other with the laces tucked in. Do this repeatedly until you can do it in under 15 seconds. You'll have a similar ""test"" in basic training, and you won't be given as much as 15 seconds to complete the task, but it's a good start.
Start sitting on the floor now with your legs crossed. Most of the time when you're sitting down in basic training, you'll be doing it ""Indian style"". While it doesn't sound difficult, it becomes hard when doing it for many hours each day. Practice sitting with your legs crossed, your back straight, and your hands on each knee. You'll have to do this without moving a muscle for long periods of time while in basic training. It gets easier with time, so it's a great benefit to get used to it before arriving.
Learn to swim. If you can't swim when arriving at boot camp, then you're going to have a real hard time when it comes time for swim qualifications. This is true for the Navy and Marine Corps, but not as much for the Army. An inability to swim can set you back in training and extend the time you spend in basic training.

, Immediately, your drill instructors will be looking for the leaders in the group. You want that to be you. When you arrive, speak loudly, do the things you're told to do with speed and without hesitation, even if it makes no sense (and few things will). Speak to your fellow recruits you see doing things they're not supposed to, because if you don't, and you're their leader, you get punished too. Stand up straight, chin high, and don't be lazy. All these things will help you stand out from the crowd.


While it's important to be a leader in boot camp, don't alienate yourself from your fellow recruits. Having friends and buddies watching your back is very valuable during your training. Try to balance being a good leader with being a good friend. People who position themselves as jerks and outsiders will get no help from fellow recruits.

, It's all too important in basic training. Anytime you are responding to a drill instructor, do it with confidence and do it loudly. Get right to the point when speaking, don't stutter or stumble over your words. When ""sounding off"" as a group, try to be the loudest. If you are being lazy when sounding off, your drill instructors will notice and punish the whole group. Your fellow recruits will know the people who are not being loud and causing punishment. This will cause contempt amongst those people who you want to be your friends.

, In fact, in some boot camps, the words ""I"" and ""you"" don't exist. It's ""this recruit"" or ""Recruit (last name)"" or ""Drill Instructor Sergeant Myers"". Drill Instructors will ask you why you made a particular mistake, why you looked them in the eye, or whatever minor error you have made. Always say something straightforward, such as ""I lack discipline"" or ""I lack focus"". They may make you do a few pushups, but they will cut you some slack because you're not trying to make excuses.

, Teamwork is essential, because if the group fails, the group will get punished, regardless if it is only one man bringing you down. Likewise, help out the recruits that are struggling—they may be helping you out when you struggle later. Don't get angry at them for failing as long as they tried their best (and don't let the drill instructors pit recruits against each other). If you have a problem with someone, talk to them after lights out.

, Many ""tests"" that you are put through in basic training are designed so that they're impossible to pass. Don't get frustrated when you fail. It's meant to happen. The drill instructors will initially make tasks so difficult that they are impossible to complete. With time, the task will become easy for you. That's the whole point. They will break you down and build you back up with more confidence then you ever had before. Just go with it.

, There are times when you may not understand the instructions given, or you may not have been paying attention. If you see everyone else moving to do something and you didn't hear what you're supposed to be doing, just follow everyone else's lead.

There are a lot of great websites online with information on all aspects of making the military your career. This knowledge might help convince your parents to support your decision.


Use the tips and resources on the sites to learn things such as the enlistment process, the required ASVAB test, and the various types of training available.For information about general military life, the various armed services, requirements for enlistment, and benefits, http://todaysmilitary.com/ is a great source to explore.
The information at http://www.goarmy.com/ is army-specific in nature.
Both websites have information geared specifically to concerns and questions expressed by parents.;
, The most important information you can have is if you are even qualified for the Army; not everyone is, due to various mental, moral, or physical issues. A list of minimum requirements can be found online and are good to know before visiting a recruiter,but if you have questions or need more in-depth information, speaking to a recruiter can help.


If you are still in high school or are in college, there is a chance you can find a recruiter at your school to talk to.
Once you’ve researched enough to know whether you are interested in active duty or army reserve, it’s very easy to locate the proper type of recruiting officer in your area by going online.
Bring a list of questions. Having a list of prepared questions can help you AND the recruiter stay focused on the areas of most interest to you.Tell the Recruiter why you want to join. If you have done your homework and discovered why you want to join, the Recruiter can help you talk to your parents. Also, it will give you someone to practice on for when you tell them about your decision.

, There are many places to find brochures and booklets with information on enlisting and the army as a career, including your school’s career guidance office and any recruiter office. These not only have good information but can be used to introduce the subject of your career choice to your parents.


Try leaving a couple of these items around for your parents to find in order to introduce them to your interest and open the lines of communication.
If you include items that go over both the pros AND cons of military life, it can help your parents see that you have considered all sides before making your decision.

, Now armed with so much information, you will want to set aside a block of time when both you and your parents are available to have an uninterrupted discussion.


Make it as convenient and stress-free for your parents as possible. Ask them when a good time is for them.
Be positive so they don’t fear what you might be fixing to discuss with them. Try smiling and saying, “Mom, Dad, I have something important and exciting I’d really love to share with you.”
Come prepared. Have access to a computer with tabs already open to your favorite resource sites, and have any printed material you’ve gathered handy so that you can easily share the sources of your information.

, You’ll want to be confident but not cocky as you go into this discussion. Let your attitude be strong but not disrespectful. You want them to know you are sharing this with them, even though you are set on your goal.


You can try beginning the discussion by saying, “I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about what I want to do with my life, and I’ve found a career path that will set me up with a solid future while allowing me to be of service to others. My plan is to join the army.”
Let them know you are open-minded and want their opinion, but use language that shows you are knowledgeable about the subject and solid in your decision. You can say, “I’ve been doing an extensive amount of research on the pros and cons, and after doing that, I know this decision is right for me.”
Stay mature and reasonable even if they become angry or upset.Answer any of their questions calmly.
Use your resources to support your answers.
Don't become argumentative.

, Let your parents know you respect their opinions, even if you disagree with them. Truly listen to all of their concerns and criticisms, then try to address them if you can using all the information you’ve learned. Be open to what they say; they may have good arguments for waiting to join up.


Offer to go talk to the recruiter with them.
If they still refuse to support you, accept it for now.

, The Army Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps is a cooperative program between high schools and the army what helps build basic military knowledge and skills such as leadership and discipline. This may be more acceptable to your parents.Experience in JROTC will give you hands-on knowledge so you will have an even greater understanding of life in the military and if it truly is the right life for you.
Your participation in this program can give your parents time to better acclimate to the idea of their child going into the army.

, This program (formerly called the Delayed Entry Program) prepares members for military service early and gives many benefits to participants. High school students can enter the program, but must commit to eventually entering basic training.Advantages include things such as early promotion, preparation for basic training, and the ability to reserve your MOS (Military Occupation Specialist.)
Check your local recruiting station for information on the FSP.

, There are many types of summer camp programs out there, including many military-oriented camps. These camps allow teens to experience a rigorous and exciting summer learning about and experiencing many aspects of the military. There are a lot of different types to choose from, so you may find one that your parents would be willing to let you attend.Some camps you can look into include the Military Adventure Camp, Camp Challenge Leadership Programs, and various military academy summer adventures.
The overall goal of the camps is to instill in the participants leadership, self-esteem, self-confidence, and good character within a military style environment.

, At some point, you may simply have to deal with the fact that your parents are not going to approve of your career choice no matter what you say or do. This can be hurtful and cause emotional stress. It may even tempt you to give up on the idea in order to win their approval. However, if joining the army truly is your dream, for the sake of your emotional health and your relationship with your parents, you should stay true to yourself while also respecting their point of view.If you are not yet eighteen you will need to abide by your parents’ decision for the time being. However, you can keep your dream alive by making good use of your time preparing your body and mind for when you can legally enlist at eighteen.

Begin some form of regular exercise program in order to prepare your body for the physical rigors of a life in the army.
Prepare for the ASVAB. The Armed Forces Vocational Aptitude Battery helps determine what occupations you would be successful at in the military. It is a required test and you can prepare for it ahead of time by taking practice tests.If you are eighteen or older, and enlisting despite your parents’ disapproval, include them in your experience as much as you can to let them know you love them and want to share your experience, while also letting them know you need to live your life your own way.

, It helps to have a support group of like-minded friends to share your thoughts and dreams with. Spending time discussing your future plans will help you focus on your goal while taking the sting out of your parents’ disapproval.

, Although there may be tension and stress between you and your parents because of your decision, keeping a positive attitude will help maintain the peace and may even lead to their eventual acceptance of the situation.


It’s always a good idea to keep the lines of communication and mutual respect open, so stay connected and talk with your parents whenever they appear open to doing so., You may worry that talking will lead to a confrontation; if so, consider writing your thoughts and feelings down.


You can keep a journal just for yourself, or share it with your parents at some point.
You can write them letters if you want a more direct approach.

, Try to understand that more than likely your parents are disapproving out of fear and love. Acknowledge that, but allow yourself to follow your dream if you truly feel it's right for you. It will be worth it in the end when you can finally show your parents some of the tangible benefits of your career choice.

, Remember, at the end of the day you are legally free to join the army once you turn eighteen, so if worse comes to worse, just bide your time. The army will still be there.

Horizontal versus vertical.",How to Create an Impressive Looking Resume," This is the best way to go. Make sure everything is lined up and doesn’t feel squished or cluttered. Use lines and bullets to help break up sections and create order.;
, Create at least one-inch margins on your resume and leave some blank space between various sections of the resume text, so several distinct chunks of information can be seen. To increase readability set the spacing between 1.15x and 1.20x the font size. For example: 11 point font should have 13 point spacing.

, Some fonts are easier to read than others. For example, Times New Roman is the default Microsoft Word (web) font therefore is used on most resumes. Times New Roman actually has horrible word spacing and letter spacing. Garamond is a print font; which makes it easier on the eyes to read.

, Always use the same font throughout. You can use varying font styles - meaning, italics or bold. Keeping that in mind, make sure you keep the font consistent. For example if you list job titles in small caps, make sure they are all written that way.

, Font should be set no smaller than 9 points for sans serif and 10 points for serif. Avoid underlining; studies have shown that most readers find underlined text difficult to read.

, You may be tempted to add decoration like floral borders, or an illustration that represents yourself. Your resume should remain professional; avoid being cutesy or too colorful If you want to add character, set your name slightly larger, or in a different weight as the same typeface as the rest of your resume. Use different color, but use color sparingly, if at all. No more than one color in addition to black.

, Walk into any office supply store and you'll see shelves of resume paper to choose from featuring “linen” and “parchment” finish. Avoid them! They are expensive and don’t make you stand out and look extra special. Stick with a plain, smooth finish. It can be heavier then regular copy paper but not stiff as a board either. An ever slight hint of cream is fine, but never use a slight pink finish. Remember: clean and simple.

, Don’t use a weird paper size; use the standard 8.5 x 11. If the resume doesn’t fit in a binder or file it will get thrown out.

, Choosing to put your resume horizontal versus vertical is more annoying than innovative. The person viewing your resume typically in human resources views hundreds a day. Too much variation from the norm makes it harder for them to make a quick assessment of you. If you want to stand out, write a good cover letter instead.

Know what to include.,
Consider a chronological resume.,
Be wary of a functional resume.,
Try a combination resume.,
Consider a CV.",How to Create a Resume in Microsoft Word3," Resume templates can be very useful if you are uncertain about how to format your resume, or you are not confident using the formatting tools on Word on another word processing programme. If you prefer create your own format and not to use a template, start by planning out which sections you will be including and how they will be organised. A resume should generally include the following sections:


Education and qualifications.
Work and volunteer experience.
Skills and qualities.
It should also include your full contact details and state that references are available upon request., There are a number of different types of resume, including the chronological resume, the functional resume, the combination resume, and the curriculum vitae (CV). The chronological resume lists your work experience from your most recent position to your earliest position, with your responsibilities for each position listed under the position title and dates you held it. This type of resume helps you to show how you have progressed over time.Most chronological resumes only cover the last 5 to 10 years of your employment history.
You may wish to include positions earlier than this if they are appropriate to the job you're seeking.
This is the format most American employers prefer to see resumes in.

, The functional resume lists your key job skills first, then follows with a list of positions you've held. It can be useful to highlight your particular skills while hiding gaps in your employment history, but it is generally not advisable for students or recent graduates to use this format.It can be a useful format for those looking to translate their current job skills into a different field.

, A third option is the combination resume, sometimes known as a skills-based resume. This format enables you to highlight your skills most prominently, but also to tie them to your practical work experience. This can be helpful if your skills are more relevant than your work experience for the position you are applying for, but this format is unfamiliar to some employers and it is generally preferable to opt for a chronological resume.


A combination resume might list your key skills at the top before providing a short account of your experiences.
This type of resume can be helpful for those entering the job market with little work experience, or for those trying to change careers., A curriculum vitae serves the same basic purpose of a resume, but there are different conventions that govern how it is written. The curriculum vitae is a comprehensive list of your job experience from your current or most recent position to your earliest. Unlike the chronological or functional resume, which typically run 1 to 2 pages, the CV is as long as it needs to be to encompass your experience.


The CV is commonly used when applying for positions in Europe, and also when applying for positions at colleges and universities worldwide.
CVs can be thought of as living documents that records all your work and achievements, which will generally grow and develop over time more than a resume."
"
Complete your contact information.,
Consider including an objective.,
Outline your education and qualifications.,
Detail your work experience.,
Have an extra skills section.,
Consider adding references.,
Make final format adjustments.",How to Create a Resume in Microsoft Word4," Once you have decided on your resume you can begin actually writing it up. Start by providing your full contact information at the top of the first page of your resume. Your contact information should include your name, address, telephone number, and email address.


If your resume extends beyond one page, ensure that your name is in a header on every page.
Your email address should appropriate for a job application. Use your own name or initials if possible.
Don’t use something jokey such as ""sly-dude,"" ""foxymama,"" or ""smokinhot.""

, After your contact information, you might want to include a one line objective that states you career goal. Employers have mixed opinions on the inclusion of an objective statement, so consider carefully whether or not it adds anything to your resume. If you do decide to include one, make it short and closely focussed to the position you are applying for.


For example, you might write that your objective is “To contribute to the design of new word processing software.”Alternatively it may state the position you hope to attain, such as “A position as in healthcare policy and research.”
Objectives have become less common, and you may prefer to provide this information in your covering letter., The order you use for the following sections may vary, but in many instances you will start with a statement of your education and qualifications. Here you simply need to detail your qualifications at school and college as appropriate. List the colleges or technical schools you've attended, in reverse chronological order. Be sure to give the date you achieved your results.


You can include a bullet point or two to provide a little further information on your specialism, if it is appropriate for the position you are applying for.
This section normally comes after your work history unless you're a recent college graduate, in which case it will generally precede it.
If you achieved any honours or awards as part of your studying or training include these here., List the positions you've held in reverse chronological order, with the start and end dates (month and year). In a chronological resume, the dates should be listed first, while they can be listed after the position title in a functional resume. Pick out the key tasks and responsibilities you had at each position, your accomplishments, and what skills you developed while working there.


Use bullet points to make sure it is clear and easy to read or scan through for key words relating to the position you are applying.You can include volunteer positions if they relate to the job you're seeking or if you have little paid experience., You will probably find that most of your skills have been covered in your education and experience sections, but it can be a good idea to have a separate skills section. This is an opportunity to highlight any skills and knowledge you have that is relevant to the position, but does not fit in anywhere else in the resume.


You can title this section as “Other Relevant Skills”, or just “Skills.”
This could include proficiency in foreign languages, knowledge of particular computer software and programmes, and any other specific skills not previously mentioned.Take care to avoid repeating yourself. You don’t need to say you have “excellent communication skills” more than once.

, Generally you should only include named references with contact information if they are specifically required for the application process. Often references will only be taken up a later date. If you are not asked to include references in the application materials just write “references available on request” at the end of your resume., Once you have the information in place in your resume, you can then format it as desired. Choose a single, easy-to-read font, either a serif font (Times New Roman, Book Antiqua) or sans serif font (Arial, Calibri, Century Gothic). All text should be 10 to 12 point, except for your name in the first-page header, which can be 14 to 18 point. Bold your name, your section headings, and your job titles.


Allow reasonable margins around the edges of the page. Word's default settings are usually sufficient for this.
Left-align your section headings. You can use single-spacing after a heading and before the section content, and double-spacing before a heading.
Get your resume down to one page if at all possible. You can try adjusting your line spacing in the Paragraph dialog box, but don’t lose your neat formatting trying to get it down to one page.
Rethink your words and try to express yourself more concisely.

Direct your desired viewers to your site.",How to Create a Digital Resume on Weebly," Go to www.weebly.com and choose the “Try Free” button to create an account unless you have already made one, then click the “Log In” option. A name, email address, and password are all that is needed to create an account. To create a digital resume you will want to choose a focus of website when prompted by Weebly (ie. blog, shop, website.);
, You should pick a theme that encourages the viewer to maneuver through the site with ease and understanding. Your theme should represent the objective being achieved by your website (ie. Dusk, Impact, Birdseye, and Oasis.)


Your domain name should also represent your objective, for example, you could use a combination of your name and an attribute you’re proud of (SueSmithRN.weebly.com).

, Your homepage is the first thing your viewers will see when they come to your site, which means it needs to make a good first impression. Use the build tab at the top of the Weebly page to insert text boxes, image spaces, dividers, buttons, and more. Your name should appear large and noticeable on your homepage, but you can also add other items too, such as an introduction paragraph from you to the reader.

, The homepage could be a good place to insert this, or you may find that it fits in better on a specific page of your site. Your photo should portray yourself as your viewers would see you if they were meeting you in person at an interview.


The photo you choose should not display an unfavorable image of you and should clearly show who you are. This means it is best practice to avoid things like large sunglasses, group photos, and inappropriate photos of your personal life. Something similar to a yearbook photo or profile photo would be best.

, The categories that appear on your resume are a good place to start for page topics. Education, Experience, Achievements, and Contact Information are a few that are standard on mostly all hard copy resumes.


Digital space allows more room for extra things such as Family, and Hobbies if you want to include these on your webpage. Paper resumes are usually a page in length, but because you can add many pages here, there is greater flexibility with the information you can provide.
With the approval of your professional and personal references, you can create a specific page for their contact information for viewers; Be sure to keep this, and all contact information, as accurate as possible.

, Use clear and concise language focusing on the important information you want the readers to remember. It is a good idea to add any familiar logos or images to represent affiliations you mention on your page. Your readers will remember things they recognize easily.


Adding in a link to websites could also be helpful for unfamiliar organizations to allow your reader easy access to learn more about it if interested.

, This allows viewers to have access to a printable version of your resume to have for further follow up purposes. Designate separate buttons for viewing of any awards, certifications, etc. You can provide any work examples or portfolio pieces too.

, Along with displaying your phone number and email on your website, you can also insert active forms that viewers can use to communicate to you directly from your page. Using the build module on Weebly, you can insert the contact form and receive emails with the name and number of the inquirer.


Also, Weebly allows you to link your social network pages as well. You can have the icon for Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest, and many other sites appear on your page. When a viewer clicks on the icon it will direct them to your profile on whatever social media site they chose. Providing this kind of transparency could be really beneficial but this also comes with risks too, so be careful to only link to sites that will not show your viewers anything inappropriate you don’t want them to see.

, The last thing you want on your professional website are spelling errors and grammar mistakes. It is very important to check for this every time you edit your site. Your readers will see silly errors as a lack of interest and give them a reason to move on to other candidates.

, After all the changes are made or you are ready to stop editing it, you need to make it available for public viewing by publishing your site. Until you publish your site the first time, your page will not appear on the internet. Once you have published for the first time and then made additional changes, the newest version will only be viewed after it has been published again.

, After you publish your site, Weebly provides you with a link to view your site how it appears to the public online. Make sure all the buttons lead to the documents you uploaded and that all your pages appear how you intended them to. You could even have a friend or family member try to access your site to verify usability.

, To utilize your new digital space you will need to direct your intended viewers to your website. You can list it on your hard copy resume, insert your URL into electronic applications, email to networking contacts, and more. Weebly does allow you to upgrade your free account so that your site will be promoted to appear on search engines, but that is not necessary to have a functioning webpage.

, There are over 130 different career fields found in the Air Force. You can find them listed at the U.S. Air Force website online. You'll be asked to offer a list of acceptable career paths for which you're qualified. If you know what jobs you're interested in, this will speed up the enlistment process.Realize that the Air Force is very selective. You may not get your first choice of career.
Ask what the required ASVAB score is for the career fields you've chosen. The recruiter can give you this information.

, The test is a timed, multi-aptitude test, determining the areas of the military you might qualify for, possible enlistment bonuses and other aspects of service. which Your score in 4 areas - arithmetic reasoning, word knowledge, paragraph comprehension and mathematics knowledge - will affect your Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) score, which determines whether or not you are eligible to join the military.A high score on this test increases the chances of your getting the career you prefer.
You are encouraged to study for the ASVAB. Practice tests are available online.

, No matter what was promised by your recruiter, if it's not written in the contract then it doesn't exist. Look carefully at the details of your commitment. If you were promised a signing bonus, make sure it's listed in the contract.Regardless of the time of active duty you'll be serving you are signing an 8-year commitment.
During these years, you may be recalled to active duty any time.

, The Air Force typically recruits people several months prior to the date they'll be called to serve. If you're in a hurry to join, ask your recruiter to be put on the quick ship list. This means that if there are recruits who drop out at the last minute, you can be called to take their place.The drawback of being on this list is that you'll be required to accept whatever career the original enlistee had accepted, which may not have been on your list of preferred careers.
You may only get 24 hours notice if you're called on this list.

Consider the ACF's goals for cadets.",How to Join the Army Cadets1," The ACF traces its history back to 1860, and has existed in its present form as a national youth organization since 1957. Today, roughly 41,000 cadets and 9,500 volunteers in over 1,600 locations across the UK make up the ACF.Cadet detachments typically meet twice a week in the evening, with the focal point of the year for most cadets being the two-week summer camp.;
, While the ACF does offer basic military-style training, including map-reading, outdoor skills, and shooting, it also includes community projects, sports and adventure training, and cultural activities.


Despite its historical ties, the ACF is not a recruiting arm of the British Armed Forces. It is not a requirement (but certainly a benefit) for those wanting to join the military, nor is it expected that cadets will choose to join the armed forces., The ACF strives to instill skills including leadership, teamwork, confidence, self-reliance, respect, and other such skills that would benefit any young person.

Make choices about how to outline your experience. Resumes usually list your job titles followed by explanations of your tasks. You can use short paragraphs or bullet points to explain experience, but you should keep the method you use consistent throughout. If you explain your duties for one job in paragraph form, all your job duties should be listed that way.Certain parts of a resume will be in bold or italics to draw attention to a job title, school, or work place. Make sure any choices you make about highlighting words are consistent. For example, say you choose to list one of your jobs like this: Server, Emma's Grill. For the remainder of your resume, you should have your job titles in bold and the name of your workplaces in italics.
Font size and spacing should also be unified throughout. For example, you can always use size 12 font to list a job title, and size 10 for your place of work and job descriptions.;
, In general, your resume should not go over a single page. Sometimes, people who've been in the same field long term may have a lengthier resume that goes over a single page but as a teen you're likely just starting out in the industry so you should keep you resume to a page., You need to choose a format for your resume. Resumes are designed in a variety of ways and there are no hard and fast rules for formatting. However, any choice you make should be easy to read for potential employers.


All resumes should include a heading at the top that includes your name and basic contact information. The text here should be bigger than the other text on the page.
Resume fonts should be professional in appearance and easy to read. Overly flashy, cursive fonts are a bad idea for resumes. Stick to fonts like Calibri, Arial, Georgie, Times New Roman, and other easy to read, formal fonts.Color can be used lightly in a resume and may help yours stand out. You can add color to headings like ""Experience,"" ""Education,"" and ""Additional Skills."" However, the color should be darker shades of primary colors like deep blues and purples. Avoid difficult to read shades, like yellows, or flashy, neon colors like lime greens and hot pinks.
Some resumes, especially if you work in a creative field, may use more creative formatting. Browsing creative resumes on Pinterest and Flickr can give you ideas of a unique format. However, you should strive to keep your resume readable and professional above anything else. Also, as a teen you may be lacking experience and a potential employer may look more harshly on a creatively designed resume as they may see it as a way to hide a small work history., All resumes should include certain basic contact information. Make sure you include the following information somewhere near the top of your resume:


Include your name, which should be written in larger print than other parts of the resume. You want your name to be somewhere at the top of the page, serving as a header above the other text.Below your name, include your address, home phone number, and e-mail address. Use a professional sounding e-mail, that uses your full name instead of a nickname or something informal. You should also make sure any voice mail greetings you have on your phone are professional in case you miss a call regarding a job., While objectives are getting less and less popular for resumes, if you're a teen it's still a good idea to include a few sentences about your career goals.


An objective should come in the form of a 2 to 3 line paragraph that states what you want to do professional and why you would be good at it.Try to be as specific as possible. Avoid statements like, ""My goal is to obtain a position in my chosen field. I want to use my skills and education to further my experience. I am a hard worker."" This does not really tell your employer anything specific about you. Ask yourself, ""What are my specific skills? What can I bring to this position?"" As the more specific the better, it's a good idea to quickly rewrite your objective for each job you apply to, catering it to that employer's specific wants and needs.For example, say you've always been interested in politics and are trying to get a summer internship with a political campaign. A good objective for that job would be something like, ""I am a longtime campaign volunteer with 3 years of experience with campaign work. I am looking to break into a political career path by furthering my experience with fundraising, advertising, and general campaign management."", As teens frequently have little experience beyond their high school education, include a section outlining our education on the top of your resume.


Start with your most recent school and work your way back. However, you should not go all the way back to elementary school. Just list your college, if you're enrolled, and your high school education.If you've accrued any honors during high school or college, it's a good idea to list them. Things like the honors roll, honors college, or Dean's list speak to a strong work ethic. If you have a particularly high GPA, you might want to list that too., Oftentimes, teens have yet to have a real job or their work experience is very limited. However, there are ways to creatively present work experience in a way that displays a strong skill set even if work experience is limited.


List formal or informal volunteer work, babysitting, or any gardening, dog walking, or other chores you may have done for relatives or neighbors for money. Even if these are not highly formal jobs that require a large skill set, the fact you performed them on a somewhat regular basis speaks to a strong work ethic and good time management skills.Low wage, part time jobs may not seem like much, but mentioning things like waitressing or retail work can look good if you highlight how such jobs helped you with interpersonal communication. Focus on how you talked to and assisted customers and the vast amount of information you had to manage.

, Make use of resume ""buzz words"" when you list the jobs you have held. Buzz words are words used on resumes to make work experience appear impressive to help catch an employer's eye.


Online, you can find lists of resume buzzwords that will help up your chances of getting the job you want. Things like classified, analyzed, facilitated, collected, assessed, calculated, trained, and designed are just a small example of the kinds of words that look great on a resume.Using buzzwords can make jobs seem impressive and emphasize the transferable skills you gained from basic labor jobs. If you waitress on the weekend in high school, a good bullet point for your job description might be ""Interacted politely with multiple customers on a nightly basis, maintaining a positive public image for the business.""
Specifics are also important. Employers love it when tasks are quantified. Say you're a junior in high school and spent the summer tutoring middle school students in math. Instead of saying ""Tutored students each week,"" can be worded in a more impressive manner and in a way that quantifies your work. For example, ""Tutored a rotating group of 6 to 7 students on a bi-weekly basis, conveying concepts of basic algebra and geometry in an age-appropriate manner."", While you may be spotty on actual job experience, having a section titled something like ""Achievements and Honors"" can help you highlight impressive non-work related information.


If you've ever won any contests or excelled in an extracurricular activity, this would be a great thing to add in a resume.Being the captain of a team, playing a sport, having a band, or operating a blog with appropriate content are all things that are impressive to employers as they show a capacity for leadership and initiative.If you're a college student, list any scholarships you received. Putting emphasis on high grades and good study skills shows that you're a hard worker and would apply yourself to a job if hired., References are a great thing to include on a resume for a teenager. As experience might be lacking, having a couple of people vouch for your work ethic is vital to setting yourself apart.


References should be people who can speak to your skill set. Choose teachers, former bosses, people you've worked with volunteering, coaches, music instructors, or even a family friend who's known you for a long time.You should avoid listing friends or relatives, as this can look unprofessional., If your experience is limited, there are ways to emphasis your work ethic anyway. Employers may be hesitant to hire inexperienced workers, but they may take a chance on you if you appear to be a hard worker.


Focus on your academic achievements. If you have not had a lot of practical experience but where a high achiever in terms of grades and test scores, this may impress an employer.Are you proficient with any software? Many college or high school courses cover softwares that may be important for certain jobs. If you're proficient in something like Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator, list that here.If you speak a second language, this can also impress employers. Even just having conversational skills in Spanish or French due to high school courses can look good on a resume., A good resume should be free of spelling and grammatical errors. Make sure you proofread carefully. You should also have someone else read over your resume for you to make sure you caught all the errors. Sometimes, if you're working on a document for a long time you tend to get typo blind and miss obvious errors., You should not send out the same resume for every job you applied to. Try to tailor your resume to fit a variety of positions. If you're applying for a basic labor job, keep in your experience with things like waitressing and yard work. If you're applying for an internship, shift focus to volunteer experience, academic achievement, and relevant coursework.

Review your existing resume.,
Consider all of your past experiences.,
Find a mentor.,
Become an apprentice.,
Become a volunteer.,
Learn new skills.,
Enhance your education.,
Engage in extra-curricular activities.,
After you have done an activity that will look good on your resume, be sure to add it under the appropriate section on it.",How to Boost Your Resume," Look for any gaps or weak areas that you see right away. Check to see if you have at least one item listed in all of the following key areas: Experience, Education, Skills, Volunteer work. If you are lacking in any of these areas then target that area and commit to doing good work to enhance it. If you are unsure of what area needs improvement then ask someone you trust for advice. Alternatively, just select one of the above key areas and go with it. You don't have to do it all at the same time. In fact, it is better if you don't.;
, Be sure that your resume reflects all of the relevant things that you have done over the course of your career. If you have been a volunteer, have special skills or have been the captain of your local adult sports team then don't forget to list it. Hobbies like sports can enhance your resume if you can demonstrate that you were a team player during your experience. It is even better if you have some sort of leadership role on the team.

, A mentor can either be informal or formal. Formal mentors are people that you seek out for advice that have already been successful in the field you are pursuing. Informal mentors are people that you encounter or are in your life only briefly but can still offer you valuable advice and perspectives. Remember that the more people that you have in your personal network, the more opportunities that will come your way. So never discount anyone as a potential ally.

, Ask one of your formal mentors if you can shadow them in their line of work to learn from them. This will require a serious time commitment so you should only do this if you have the time resources.

, Volunteer work always looks good on your resume. Don't worry if the work does not relate directly to your field. It will look good on any resume because it shows that you care about your community and positions you as being a well-rounded individual.

, The more skills that you possess, the more generally employable you will become. You can engage in a self-study program by using library books or buying books from your local book store. You can also consider buying course materials over the internet at various e-learning institutions. Mastery of foreign languages like Spanish, Chinese, German, French, Italian and Japanese can really enhance your marketability.

, Consider getting you Master's degree or PhD. If you do not have a Bachelor's degree, then you should consider if that is the right path for you to take. Alternatively, you could get a Technical education in a vocational field from your local community college. If there are no degree programs in your local community then you can consider getting an online education from a University program.

, Employers like to see if an individual has a capacity for leadership. You could consider becoming captain of a sports team, a coach of a junior team, organize a neighborhood watch program or become the head of the PTA.

, You can get a career coach to help you do this. Unless you know how to write a resume, then it would be a good idea to hire a coach or a career services counselor to help you. The more professional your resume looks, the more likely it will get a potential employer's attention.

Follow employer instructions.,

Purchase large envelopes.,
Type the address.,
Place the address correctly.,
Proofread.,

Add proper postage.",How to Address a Resume Envelope," Some companies do not want to deal with hard copy resumes, and will specifically request email or other submission. If the job ad is not specific, feel free to ask for clarification.


For jobs that aren't specific about email or online only, feel free to mail your resume in anyway. It can be a concrete way to demonstrate your interest in the position beyond simply submitting your application and help you stand out in the crowd. Just make sure you definitely apply as the company requests.;
, In some cases, the correct name will be in the job ad, or readily available on the company's website. Not only with your resume get in the hands of someone who will actually be able to act on it, it will also demonstrate that you took the time to research the business and know something about it.If the name is not easily available, a little sleuthing can track it down. An online search using the company's name and department you want to work in may find it. Additionally, calling the company's main line and asking the receptionist for the name of the manager who oversees the department you are applying to can get it.Social networks, especially business-related ones like LinkedIn, are also a good way to track down people in certain businesses. You may not get the hiring manager specifically, but find someone who does.
Do not address the envelope to an unnamed ""Whom it may concern"" or ""Person who does the hiring."" Your resume may not get through to where it needs to be, and it looks like you did not attempt to learn anything about the company.

, Companies may have multiple addresses associated with them, including a mail address, street address, or addresses for different branches and facilities. Make sure you have the correct mailing address before starting your envelope. This address may be on the job ad, or should be available on the company's website. If you are still unsure, call the company and ask., You want a large envelope because your resume, or a cover letter, should not be bent or folded.These can be white, manila, or matching the paper your resume is on. It does not matter if the envelope does not match the paper your resume is on. As long as the envelope is clean and professional, that should be enough., Use a word processor or typewriter. Do not hand-write. A typed address is cleaner and easier to read, and also looks more professional. You can either print the address on a label, or directly on to the envelope.Some word processing programs have specific formatting for printing envelopes. Using that will make sure your text appears in the right place on the envelope.
If you have trouble printing on an envelope, it might be better to print on a label sheet, and stick that on the envelope. Clear labels can be a nice touch to make it look as though you printed directly on the envelope, but they are not necessary., Make sure the recipient's address is in the middle of the envelope, with your name and return address in the upper left-hand corner.

, Make sure you have typed everything correctly, without spelling errors and in the proper order. A mistake on the envelope can create a bad first impression, or worse, will prevent your resume from even arriving to the right place.

, You want to make a good impression and get the job, so you should print your envelope with the highest quality machine you can find. If your personal printer doesn't print envelopes, or can't handle high-quality resume paper envelopes, a printing service may be a better option.

, Make sure your resume also comes with a cover letter briefly introducing yourself and the position you are applying for. A cover letter is a basic professional courtesy, reminds the hiring manager who you are, and can highlight specific strengths in your resume that would be of interest. You don't want a resume to show up unannounced and with no instructions. Otherwise the hiring manager won't know what to do with it, especially if you've never met before.

, Once your resume goes in the envelope, you'll want it to stay flat for as long as possible. You can purchase cardboard envelopes, which are thicker and don't bend as easily, or you can use a piece of thin cardboard in the envelope.


You can also add ""Do Not Bend"" to your envelope as a reminder to the post office. The US Postal Service requires that those words appear above the addressee's name and below the postage. If you add ""Do Not Bend,"" you must also include a stiffener (like cardboard) in the envelope., If your envelope weighs more than one ounce (and with the cardboard, it probably does), you'll need additional postage. Putting a single stamp, as with a letter, will not do the trick.Your best bet is to go to the post office and pay directly there, as they will be able to weigh your envelope to determine the correct amount.

Thank them extensively.",How to Ask for a Reference from an Employer," Letters of reference should be glowing, Lukewarm references are not helpful. Think of an employer you’ve worked closely with who knows your style, skills and strengths. The most important thing is to ask people who will have good things to say about you.Reflect on what a potential reference would say about your background and performance before you ask.

, Theoretically, a letter of reference can come from any employer, past or current. However, it’s often best to ask one who has known you for a long time. They’ll be more likely to have specific compliments to make about your performance. Showing that you develop long-term relationships with your employers can also be a plus., Prospective employers often ask for multiple references so it’s a good idea to have several people in mind who can write letters for you. Three is a typical number but you may be asked for more.If you only have a few employers, then look for other people who might be able to write a letter of support, such as former teachers or community leaders who know you well.
If you have several letters you can also tailor the ones you send to each job, picking and choosing the ones that are most relevant.

, You should always ask before you put an employer’s name down as a reference. If they are contacted without knowing that you are applying for a job, they might be caught off guard and give a less than great reference. This will not make a good impression. It’s courteous and smart to ask ahead of time.If at all possible, let your employer(s) know when you start looking for jobs that you may ask for a letter soon.

, Your employer will appreciate having plenty of time to write the letter. Giving them plenty of notice also means that they will have more time to polish the letter and make it very strong. This will improve your prospects!For instance, if it’s Monday and you are asked to submit letters by the end of the week, don’t procrastinate and ask only on Wednesday. Ask your employer right away on Monday.

, Asking someone for a letter of reference in-person can make them feel pressured. They might find it harder to say no if they have to. Instead, write an email that asks for a letter of reference or use some other indirect method. This avoids putting your potential referee on the spot and allows them the opportunity to politely decline., Even if you know the employer well they’ll appreciate some comments on why you are asking them for a letter. Tell them how much you value their opinion on your job performance. You could also say that no one else is as qualified to comment specifically on your skills and qualities.Try writing something like: “John, in our two years working together, you’ve had the chance to see the successes I’ve had on several marketing projects. Your years of experience and mentorship along the way have been invaluable. I think you are uniquely qualified to discuss my performance, and I’d deeply appreciate your comments.”

, Make sure to tell you prospective letter writer that it’s ok if they are unable to write the letter for you. This makes it easier for them to say no if they don’t have time or don’t feel like they are the best person for the task.For instance, instead of asking “John, will you write me a letter of reference?” try something like “John, I would really appreciate you writing a letter of reference on my behalf if you are willing and able to.”
Make sure to also include something like “I completely understand if you are unable to write a letter for me at this time.”

, Keep in mind that a letter of reference is a favor to you, and that employers aren’t usually required to write them. If your employer responds to your request by saying they are unable to write a letter for you, thank them for their time and consideration anyway.You can also think of it this way: if someone is rushed, or not enthusiastic about you, then they won’t write a good letter for you.
If they say no, they’re actually doing you a favor by giving you the opportunity to ask someone else who will be more supportive.

, It’s often helpful for letter writers to see a copy of the job posting as well as your cover letter if you have one. This helps them tailor the letter to the specific job and application. They’ll probably also appreciate seeing a copy of your resume, CV, portfolio, or other evidence of your work history as a refresher., You can actually guide your letter writer. Provide them with bullet points, or even sentences that can give them highlights to include in the letter. This helps them to write a strong one.For instance, if you had a job interview that kept mentioning how fast-paced the job is, give your employer a bulleted list of evidence showing your productivity, like “Completed 19 sales in two weeks. Consistently submitted reports ahead of schedule.”

, Most letters of reference have a fairly standard structure but going over this can be helpful for both you and your employer. Supply your letter writer with a rough outline or meet with them to come up with one together.The first paragraph should introduce your employer, and explain how they know you. It should also describe how long they worked with you, and verify your job title.
The second paragraph can discuss your skills and qualifications that are relevant to the specific job. If your employer has lots to say, they can include several paragraphs.
The closing paragraph of the letters should enthusiastically summarize their support of you, and indicate whether they’re willing to follow up if the company you’re applying to has further questions.

, Sometimes letters are emailed, sometimes they’re sent via a web form, and sometimes they’re mailed. Make sure your employer knows the correct method, and has the proper address, as well as the deadline for submitting., After your letter writer is finished, it’s courteous to send a thank-you email or card, or to thank them in person. Tell them how much you appreciate their taking the time to write a letter on your behalf. You can also tell them that you value their support of your career.Keep them posted on how your job search goes as well.

Determine the type of references you need.,
Pick the right people.,
Update your resume.,
Ask early.,
Decide how you will ask.,
Tell your referees about the position.,
Explain why you’re asking them.,
Offer a guide.,
Give your referees a copy of your resume.,
Follow up.",How to Ask for a Reference," There different types of references, depending on the position for which you’re applying. References can also take one of several forms. Phone calls, emails, questionnaires, and letters of recommendation are all common. Be sure to review the applications instructions carefully to make sure that you secure the right kind of reference.


The most common type of reference is a professional reference. In this case, your referee should be able to attest to your ability to get the job done.
Another common type of reference is a personal reference. In this case, your referee should be able to attest to your character.
If you have a LinkedIn profile, you have the option of obtaining a LinkedIn recommendation.

, Different reference types often require people to serve as referees. Make sure that the person you’re asking can provide you with kind of reference you need. Ask yourself, “Who will be most able to discuss my qualifications for this position?”


Don’t limit yourself to former or current employers. Co-workers, former teachers and professors, ministers, and even your attorney might be able provide you with a strong reference.If you’re applying for multiple positions, consider asking different people to serve as referees for different positions.Make a list of reasons why you’re asking a particular person to be a referee for you. Include details like the basis and extent of his or her relationship with you, his or her professional qualifications, and the kinds of things he or she will be able to say about you. Not only will this list help you narrow down your list of potential referees, it will also come in handy when you actually ask for references.

, This might seem like a no-brainer. However, you’re going to want to provide your potential referees with useful information about yourself. An updated resume will serve them better than an out-of-date one.

, Your referees, should they agree to be your referees, are doing you a favor. Give them at least two weeks to prepare and, if necessary, write you a letter of recommendation.

, There is some disagreement about the best way to ask someone to be a reference. Asking someone in person or over the phone is more personal, but you run the risk of making someone uncomfortable.Asking someone in an email is less personal, but it gives the person a chance to consider the request.Use your best judgment.


Whether you ask for a reference in person, on the phone, or in an email, give the potential referee the option of saying “no.” Ask the potential referee, “Do you feel that you are able to give me a strong reference?” If a potential referee does in fact say “no,” be grateful. It’s far better to have someone who really wants give you a reference on your side.Be polite. Let your potential referees know how much you appreciate their efforts. And let them know that you’re available to answer any questions they might have.

, Supply them with job ad itself. You should also come up with your own description of the position.

, Remember the lists you made when you were deciding who to ask? Now’s the time to use those lists again. Make an effort to draw connections between your potential referee’s qualifications and the position for which you’re applying. For example, you might say, ""Since you are a successful business owner, I thought that Business University's School of Business would value your opinion of me.""

, Be very upfront about what you want your referees to say about you. You might say something along the following lines: “Given our history, I think you’re the right person to talk about my abilities in these areas…”


You can offer them anything from a simple list to a full-blown draft of a letter of recommendation. The more specific and thorough you are, the more grateful your referees will be.
Give your referees explicit permission to add or delete parts of your guide as they see fit. This will let your referees know that you trust their judgement. You can say, “This is just a guide. I hope that you will make whatever changes you think are necessary.”

, Remember: an updated resume is far more useful than an out-of-date one.

, Once you’ve submitted your application materials, be sure to send thank-you notes, and keep your referees in-the-loop about the progress of your job search. A quick email that begins, “I wanted to give an update about the job I applied for.”


Whether or not you end up getting the position for which you applied, maintaining contact with your referees is a smart idea. You might need to call on them to provide references for other applications. And they might be able to alert you to job openings.

Ask a family member or friend to review your resume draft.",How to Write a Resume As an Older Job Seeker," Avoid opening your resume with a “resume objective” which lays out all of your work experience chronologically, as this can make you appear old or over-experienced for the position. Rather, use the opening summary or narrative to describe list work experience from the previous decade.This structure will also allow you a space to explain what you can offer the company and how your professional skills will benefit them, if hired.;
, This brevity will let you concisely describe why you are the ideal candidate for the job in question, using skills that you have acquired in your last decade (or so) of work experience.Tailor the language of your opening summary to align with the specific position requirements given in the job posting. If you feel that you need to mention work experience that outlines the most recent decade, consider adding it farther down your resume, in a section titled “Previous Work Experience” or “Additional Work Experience.”


For example, one of the sentences in your opening summary could state, “I am a skilled communicator with over eight years of experience, and I have demonstrated my ability to oversee multiple projects while meeting frequent deadlines.”

, Transferable skills are those which you have acquired in one field of work—or in one long-term job—which can be transferred and applied to another professional field and job. When hiring older workers, employers are often concerned that the workers’ job skills will have become limited and stagnant; indicate otherwise by describing ways in which your skills from previous jobs will be applicable to your new potential job.Transferable skills include things like the ability to communicate with a range of employees and executives in a company, management skills (including delegating responsibilities to subordinates, and simultaneously overseeing multiple projects), and interpersonal proficiencies (being able to motivate and resolve conflicts with others).
You may have acquired transferable skills outside of the workplace; these deserve to be mentioned on your resume too. For example, if you had a career as a homemaker, did substantial volunteer work, or have gaps of unemployment in your past, find ways you can present skills acquired during these periods of your life as transferable., As a general rule, the “Past Employment” section of your resume should highlight your most outstanding professional achievements. That said, it will not look impressive if most of your successes were in the 1980s or 1990s. Tailor your resume to focus strongly on recent professional work and achievements. Your priority in the resume should be to feature skills and strengths that make you a viable candidate for the job, and that you have implemented in recent employment. It’s less important that you exhaustively catalogue decades of previous work experience.For example, describe job experience with statements like: “Oversaw software development and managed teams of developers from 2005 to 2015.” Even if you held this position before 2005, focusing only on the most recent decade will allow you to present your most up-to-date skills.

, Social media can play a large role in the hiring processes of many agencies and organizations, who will look not only at your LinkedIn profile, but also at your Facebook and Twitter accounts, as applicable. Describe your online presence on your resume, and provide links to the social-media pages that you would like your potential employers to access. When job hunting, these sites—especially LinkedIn—should be regularly updated and maintained just as careful as your paper-copy resume.Include a statement to the effect of: “I have stayed current with hiring practices and job-search procedures, and list relevant information about my past work experience at my LinkedIn profile . I am also active on Facebook and Twitter.”

, Alternately, if you prefer not to have an online social media presence, note this clearly on your resume. It’s better to acknowledge the fact that you choose not to market yourself online than to risk appearing out of touch with modern technology and hiring practices.


You can simply include a statement such as: “While I realize that some parts of the job-search process can take part online, I have chosen not to use a site such as LinkedIn because I would prefer my professional experience be summarized only on my resume.”

, Modern resumes are brief: they typically comprise no more than two pages. If your resume follows outdated resume-writing conventions—especially if the style of your resume is decades old—you will appear professionally out-of-touch and a poor choice to fill the position. Remove excess verbiage from your paragraphs, and focus on using active verbs that highlight professional skills.Only include a couple of concise bullet points describing your responsibilities at each prior job. Use verbs and active language, for example: “Developed material for cooling semi-truck radiators that saved $200,000 per year.”, While conventional chronological resumes present employment information from most recent to oldest and span an individual’s entire working career, this can be detrimental to older job seekers. Your decades of experience may make you appear too old or over-qualified for the job. Either a functional or combination resume will let you present your workplace proficiencies without relying on dates. Plan to format your resume in one of these two styles:A functional resume highlights the skills that you’ve acquired over your career, regardless of chronology, and is a good choice for people with gaps in their work history.A combination resume balances professional skills with your work history by first listing your relevant skills and experiences, and then giving a brief chronology of your work experiences., This is an outdated resume-composition technique which would appear out of place on a contemporary resume. The assumption here is that the prospective employer will contact you if they’d like to move forward in the hiring process and contact your references, so you don’t need to provide the names of references prior to (or in) the interview.Of course, you will need to have the names and contact information (at least email and phone) of 2–4 individuals who will be able to vouch for your professional and personal excellence.
You can include a brief sentence at the bottom of your resume: “Professional references available upon request.”

, Depending on how long ago you thoroughly overhauled and re-wrote your resume, it may feature professional or colloquial expressions that sound dated in today’s work place, or that no longer carry the same meaning. Read through your resume closely, and rewrite any decades-old business jargon or verbiage that makes you look old and out of touch with the professional world.For example, you and your resume would appear outdated if you use the term “director of personnel.” Businesses have scrapped this term and instead use terms like “talent acquisition.”
To get an idea of the type of language that a specific employer is looking for, read through the company’s online job posting or list of desired qualifications in potential employees. Then, use similar language when fleshing out your resume.

, When drafting your resume to make yourself competitive in the contemporary job market, avoid specifying dates on which degrees were earned or professional class were completed, as this will automatically make you appear older. Focus on the most recent relevant experiences within the category of education and professional coursework.For example, if you have a college degree, avoid mentioning high school on your resume.

, Keywords are specific words or phrases that automated resume-scanning systems are keyed to pick up on. Modify your resume, and especially the opening summary of experiences, to include keywords specific to your field and to the position you’re applying for. This will ensure that hiring personnel see your resume and it’s not discarded by an email filter.To find appropriate keywords, you can search for your position on a job-search website. Results will also yield a list of keywords commonly associated with the position. You can then plug these keywords into your own resume.
For example, if you’re applying for a paralegal position, employers will likely expect keywords like “paralegal,” “years of experience,” “legal system,” and “law firm.”

, It’s easy to miss small errors on your own resume: small typos, sentences that could be better composed, or instances of descriptive wording that could be improved to present you as a better prospective hire. Having a friend look over the document for you before you apply for a job will help you catch and improve these errors and spots for improvement.


You could also enlist the assistance of a professional resume coach, if you have the time and financial resources. A resume coach will help you tailor your resume for the job(s) you’re applying to, and will have further tips of how to use your age to your advantage.

Have an online presence.,
Create, customize and save your QR code.,
Add a short description of your code's destination.",How to Add a QR Code to Your Resume2," It’s important to have an online presence, because you need to have an outlet for your QR code to link to. If you have a creative way to present yourself, then put it online. You can have your own domain name or just create an online CV and resume.


Upon scanning your QR code, a recruiter or hiring manager will be directed to either a website or individual web pages displaying your profile, your strengths, and all your projects. This can help them determine if you are a qualified candidate or not.

, There are a number of online tools that you can use to create a QR code. Using these QR code generators, you can encode any type of textual information in the code.


This code often contains your website address, your facebook page, or your contact details.
You can also use Google Docs to create your resume, because then it can be downloaded into HTML, DOC or PDF formats, depending on the preferred document type of the recruiter.

Present your positioning statement.,
Include a custom landing page with your portfolio.,
Avoid common QR code mistakes.,
Make sure that linked content is formatted for mobile.",How to Add a QR Code to Your Resume4," If you have created a video resume, you can embed the video page. A video resume can be a great way to interactively explain your strengths. This can serve as a face to face explanation of how you can be of value to the recruiter's organization.

, In case you are maintaining a professional blog, you can direct the recruiter to read your posts. This can give them a feel for your thoughts regarding industry issues. Additionally, this allows them to gauge your communication skills in a personal context.


Make sure that you do not have any controversial, sensitive, or inappropriate content on any of your professional blogs.

, You may also choose to present your positioning statement to the hiring manager by utilizing the QR code. This statement will display as a text message on their screen.


For example: ""Tommy is the person who will build long lasting relationships with the people you want to do business with. Tommy can add value to your business through their leadership-driven experience.""

, You may also choose to create a custom landing page highlighting your professional strengths and portfolio. This is a remarkable way to showcase your work, especially any online projects.

, In order to have your QR code run as smoothly as possible, steer clear of these mistakes. QR codes can seem like a novelty item, and can project a cheap image if they do not work properly. These are some common mistake to look out for:



Difficult to scan codes. Certain codes are difficult to scan if there is too much information in the code, if the code is very small, if there is an inadequate margin around the code, or if the graphic is of poor quality or distorted.
Avoid these blunders by including a minimal amount of data, maintaining at least a 1” square, ensuring resolution for printing purposes, and ensuring plenty of mark-free breathing room around the code.

, If a recruiter scans the QR code with a smart phone and the page they are directed to is not mobile-friendly, this will result in poor user experience. This can make your presentation seem amateurish and ineffective.


Test it before sending it to your potential employer, especially for features like click to call buttons.

Ask well in advance.,
Make your request at an opportune moment.,
Ask to meet in person.,
Make your request direct and clear.,
Present your request positively.,
Explain to your boss why you’re asking them.,
Provide a loose template.,
Confirm that your boss will give you a positive recommendation.,
Provide your boss with necessary documents.,
Allow your boss to say “no”.",How to Ask Your Boss for a Letter of Recommendation," Employers tend to be busy, and will likely answer with a polite “no” if you ask them to write a letter only a couple of days before it’s due. Ask your boss for a letter of recommendation at least two or three months in advance, so that they’ll have enough time to reflect on your work and can write a thoughtful letter that isn’t rushed.If you’ll be leaving the company to seek further employment, and would like a letter of recommendation from your boss, consider asking up to six months in advance. This will give your boss enough time to look for a suitable replacement.;
, Even if you’re asking for a letter of recommendation well in advance, it would be unwise to present your question to your boss when there’s a looming deadline, or in the middle of an office crisis. Time your request so that you’re asking during a period of relative calm.For example, if you’re in the middle of a project, wait until you’ve completed the work. Then, when asking your boss for the letter, mention the hard work that you put into the project.

, Ask your supervisor if they have time to meet with you face-to-face during the next week or two.Let your boss pick the time and date, and if your boss is curious as to why you’re asking to meet, you can say something brief, like “I’d like to ask you for a professional favor.”


It’s always wise to ask for a letter of recommendation in person; asking via email can seem impersonal or distant. That said, if you or your boss are traveling for a long period of time, or if the letter is time sensitive, you can ask via email if necessary.

, There’s no reason to be subtle or ambiguous when asking for a letter. If you’re meeting face-to-face, speak clearly and confidently: ask if your boss will write you a letter of recommendation, explain the context for which you need the letter, and give the date by which you’ll need the letter in hand. For example, say something like:“I’m applying to graduate school, and hoping to begin next fall. I know the letters of recommendation will carry a lot of weight with the selection committee and, since you’ve been my supervisor for several years, I’d appreciate if you would write a letter recommending me on the strength of my work and my work ethic.”

, Your boss may be disappointed to find out that they’re losing an employee, especially if you’re requesting the letter of recommendation to apply to a different company. So, frame the request in a positive light: remind your boss of the good work you’ve done at the company, and make it clear that the recommendation will help you advance your career.Say something like, “I’ve enjoyed my 10 years of work here, and during that time I feel that I’ve contributed valuable work to the company. I’ve decided to advance my career by applying for a position at XYZ Company. Would you be willing to write me a letter of recommendation for the new position?”

, Regardless of the context in which you’re asking for a letter of recommendation (e.g. housing application, volunteer position, or new job), your boss will need to know why you’re asking them specifically. When making your request, use specific language so your boss understands why you want their letter of recommendation. For example, say:“I’d like you to write this letter because I think you have a good understanding of my work ethic and how much I devote myself to projects and assignments that come my way.”
“A recommendation from you would show my new supervisor that I get along well with people in management and can follow directions well.”

, “Letter of recommendation” can be a broad category, so in order to make the task easier on your boss—and in order to receive a better letter—provide them with some specifics about what you’d like them to mention in the letter. You don’t want to come across as singing your own praises or trying to write the letter for them. But, by giving your boss an idea of the template the letter could follow, you’ll make their task easier and receive a better letter.For example, say something like:


“I’d appreciate if you mentioned early in the letter that we’ve worked together for 10 years; that should give your endorsement more authority.”
“Since this is for a housing application, it would help if you mentioned my ability to keep my workspace clean and to meet financial deadlines.”

, Even if your boss agrees to write you a letter, you should double-check to make sure that the letter will describe you as a strong candidate for the job, volunteer position, or housing situation that you’re applying for. If you don’t, you run the risk of finding out after the fact that your boss gave you a negative or lukewarm recommendation.Say something like, “I just wanted to make sure that the letter you’re going to write will be a strong endorsement of me and not contain negative information.”

, In order to write a convincing and detailed letter of recommendation, your boss will need information and documents regarding your professional achievements. Send your boss a copy of your CV or résumé, an example of recent work that you’ve produced, and details about the position or program that you’re applying to.


Also be ready to refresh your boss’s memory regarding details work you’ve done in your current position. Most supervisors manage many employees, and will need reminding about specifics of work that individuals have performed., Despite your best efforts, your supervisor may decline to write you a letter of recommendation. This could be because they’re unhappy that you’re leaving to pursue a different job or have been dissatisfied with your performance at work, among other reasons. While you’re welcome to inquire as to your boss’s reasoning, you should not attempt to convince or cajole them into writing the letter.If your boss declines (whether over email or face-to-face) to write you a letter, remain polite and do not become angry.
Say something brief, such as: “I understand your reason for declining. Thank you for at least considering my request.”

Walk around the produce section when you get the chance.,
Study any weekly specials on produce.,
Write down the codes for the most popular fruits and vegetables.,

Doing something absurd while memorizing the codes helps even more. Such as doing the chicken dance while memorizing look a likes!;
, These are the items that people will mostly get, so they'll always be rolling on the conveyor belt.

, Whether it's one brand of apples, or if the strawberries are in season, or if the price of peaches are low - you don't want to be searching the code book every time, when it can be right in front of you.

, If you are new to being a supermarket cashier, writing down department codes may be also helpful, as some coupons need it.

, This paper may include the produce that people seldom get, but not as popular as the rest. Don't include seasonal items, as it's not useful as the others.

, However, majority of the produce will have a sticker (for example, apples).

Take a class related to your career.,
Consult or take contract assignments.,
Volunteer in your community or for a large organization.,
Attend professional conferences.",How to Address a Gap in Employment1," This can be a great way to demonstrate that you were committed to advancing yourself professionally. Even if you have a degree, don't be afraid to take a class in a subject you've previously studied, as a refresher course. Colleges also often provide a wide variety of resources to students that can be valuable tools for finding employment.


Take a seminar. An academic seminar is an intense course of study related to a specific field. In business, ""seminar"" often refers to a commercial training event. Both can be useful in addressing an employment gap.
For example, a teacher might take a class on pedagogy.
For example, a software engineer might take a class on a new programming language.;
, Many people choose to do work as a contractor, or to work as a consultant on projects, in between long-term jobs. This can be a great way to develop skills related to your career, as well as provide some income. Consider consulting or contracting., This can be a way to show that even though you were unemployed, you were still working in a sense. Some people are fortunate enough to be able to volunteer regularly, and this is not likely to count against them. Instead, volunteering, especially if it can be connected to your career, will likely look good on your resume., Many organizations hold professional conferences around the country every year. These professional conferences are often great ways to develop professionally. They can also be a wonderful way to network with people in your field.

Review your resume.,
Remove task oriented statements.,
Add results oriented statements.,
Reformat the experience section of your resume.,
Add a strong relevancy statement.,
Verify that your resume is coherent.,
Customize the objectives statement for each position you are applying for.,
Check your resume for formatting, spelling, and similar errors.

,
Solicit review of your resume by a friend, family member, mentor, or colleague.,
Send the resume in.",How to Make Your Resume ROAR (Results Oriented and Relevant)," If you have an existing resume, review (or ask a friend, colleague or family member to review it). For each statement under the experience section ask Does this statement come closer to describing what I was told to do, that is could it appear in my job description or does it come closer to reflecting what I really accomplished?  


For example, if you worked in a store, stating Opened the store would be more of what you were told to do. Achieved 100% sales award would be more of an accomplishment. 

, For each statement that appears to be more of a job description or ""told to do"", ask Would a potential employer with reasonable knowledge be able to infer this statement knowing my job title? If so, the task oriented statement is adding little or no value to your resume and is using up your potential employer's goodwill reading it. Remove it.

, Your resume may look a bit empty at this point. If so, ask yourself What did I really accomplish on the job? See if there are statements which reflect each accomplishment for each position. For example, the following accomplishments might have been omitted from the resume and should be added:


Sold more products than other employees on my shift
Praised for outstanding customer service by management
Have more repeat customers than any other sales representative
Suggest additional useful products to customers, increasing sales by 25%
Customer satisfaction rating of 90%

, It should be more Results Oriented at this time. Iterate this process many times.—Even after weeks of iterating, you will normally continue to find room for improvement. 

, Now, you need to make the resume Relevant to the employer. Determine what position you are applying for and write a few phrases explaining how your results (from the experience part of your resume) make you the world's best (or as close as you can come to it) candidate for the job you are applying for. For example: Eager to apply my experience as an award winning cashier, outstanding customer service representative, and engaging team leader to manage the front end cashiers and achieve highest possible customer satisfaction at Joe's Superstore. Place these phrases right under your name and contact information at the top of your resume. (While you may not label this as such, it is your objectives section.)

, Verify that each phrase in your objectives section is supported by documentation in your experience section.

, You may want to update the experience section as well. It is not uncommon to spend a half day or an evening customizing a resume (along with your cover letter) so that it meets what your potential employer is looking for; it is time well spent when you land the job.

,, It is highly likely that they will see errors or better ways of phrasing some of your statements that you have missed. They will help you to see if anything is wrong with it and say whether or not it is good enough.

, Look forward to receiving positive feedback from the potential employer if the resume truly ROARs (namely, is Results Oriented And Relevant).

Mention the most relevant duties & skill sets for the job you are applying for.",How to Avoid Common Resume Mistakes," The only things that should be on your resume are achievements. Anyone can do their job, but only a small percentage of the population can do their job well, wherever they go.


The best achievement is a promotion because it's an objective way to show that you impressed the people you work for.
Present quantified achievements. Most people do not think in terms of quantified achievements when they are in the job, but on the resume, that's the only part of the job that matters. Give evidence to show how you made a difference in your past roles.
Steer clear of expressions like ""Duties included,"" ""Responsibilities included,"" or ""Responsible for."" That's job-description language, and not what employers are looking for.Use action verbs instead, but minimize the use of ""I"" and articles (the, an, a).

Write a self evaluation and for each achievement, ask yourself: ""What does this accomplishment say about me, and what I can do for this employer I want to work for?"";
, Avoid being too modest. Don't be afraid to talk proudly about your accomplishments, just remember to avoid mentioning and bragging about every accomplishment you've ever had.

, An interviewer spends about 30 seconds reading through your resume; hence it is important to highlight the most important information on your resume. A resume should contain information relevant to the job opportunity. Your resume should not exceed 1 – 2 pages.


If you have a long job history behind you, beware of age discrimination. Employers might think you're too expensive if you have loads of experience. If you're at the senior level, list about 15 years of job history (no more) and don't provide the date of your college graduation if it was more than about 10 years ago.
When your resume gets you a chance to be interviewed, then you can elaborate on your hard work. , It's implied. Of course, if someone wants a reference, you will give one. No one presumes that you will not.


Don't list references on your resume; if they are requested along with your resume, list them on a separate sheet.If you have an excellent reference, like a CEO of a company, have the reference call before you even go to the interview. Sets the tone for the employer to think you are amazing.

, Only list personal interests that reveal a quality that will help you meet the employer's needs. If you are in sports marketing, then by all means, list that you kayak. If you are a dedicated and/or successful athlete, put it down because it shows focus and achievement. If you are a mediocre hobbyist, leave it off. Personal interests that don't make you stand out as an achiever do not help you.

, Stay away from overused templates (like those in Microsoft Word) because it makes you look completely generic, but don't use more than three different fonts and try to stick to two different text sizes. You want it to look smart but not generic., This is a very common mistake. It’s always good to have a spell check done once you have finished preparing your resume. It can be difficult to catch or identify your own mistakes, the best way to identify your mistakes is to have your resume reviewed by someone else or by reading aloud.

, Your resume should include the same keywords that appear in the job listing. If your resume lacks the right keywords, your resume is unlikely to get noticed as it will not appear to be a fit for that particular job opportunity.

, Be sure to read and update your resume for every job you apply for. Updating your skills section, contact number, address details, current location etc. is very important.

, Writing an objective statement is important to let an interviewer know what your focus is. An objective needs to be clear and has to focus on the target job opportunity. Ensure it is short and emphasizes on your interest in the type of work for which you are applying.

, It is good to write active statements which showcase your relevant skills and accomplishments, if you have made significant contributions and improvements in this positions include a quick note stating this, you can elaborate in the interview. This will help a potential employer easily identify how you added value to your role.

, Remember you need to show that you have the key skills required for the particular job opportunity. If your resume lacks this point; there is a chance that your resume will be overlooked.

Evaluate the circumstances.,
Decide if you need to address it in your cover letter.,
Change the style of your resume.",How to Address a Gap in Employment2," Think about how long you were unemployed. Does it merit getting addressed in your cover letter? These days, it is not uncommon for employment searches to take six months. Several years of unemployment will raise questions. Many employers may fear this gap is prison time or a job you are unable to list on your resume due to gross negligence.

, Smaller gaps do not likely need to be addressed at this stage. If you have had longer gaps between employment, you may wish to address them in your cover letter. If you feel you must, then make sure to do so in brief., When there are large gaps of unemployment, or even more than one gap in employment, you may wish to choose a different resume format. A functional resume lists work experience in skill/position-related categories, as opposed to chronologically. In this way you highlight the nature of your work experience.Create categories like “Customer Service Experience” and “Managerial Experience”. This will avoid highlighting any gaps of time.
Omit months. Especially when you have worked jobs for a number of years, this can give you a little bit of wiggle room around the start and end of employment.
List positions held for the longest amount of time first. This will show off your commitment, and your ability to responsibly hold a job for long periods of time.

"

Tell the truth.,
Express that it will not interfere with your work.,
Focus on skills you acquired.",How to Address a Gap in Employment3," You may be asked questions about your gaps in employment. It is best to tell the truth in these cases.When you do, make sure to play up the positive aspects, if you can. Don't use this as an opportunity to say negative things about your previous employer. You don't want to come across as a complainer, or as a person with a negative or toxic attitude.


If your employer asks you about time in prison, or criminal charges, in many cases you are required to tell them the truth by law. Background checks may or may not be used, and these will more than likely reveal prison time. By being honest and forthcoming, you establish your integrity, you indicate: “you can trust me”.
Be vague. Talk about the work generally. Refer not to the specific task you did, but to the general industry. You might say you “had a stint in the entertainment industry”
Omit. In this case, you might just say that you were unemployed. Some previous employment can reflect poorly on you, and in such cases, it may be necessary to say that you were not working at all. This can be better than ruining your chances at a fulfilling job.

, The last thing you want is for your employer to think that you will be sick again, or need to go on vacation, soon. Even if you might be planning a vacation, you don't want this to hurt your chances at employment. Make sure they feel this will not be an ongoing problem.If you were on an extended vacation, talk about how you're eager to feel productive and career driven again.

, Many people overlook the fact that not all work has to be paid. There are many instances where gaps in employment are connected to times when an individual develops new skills or continues to improve professionally. Volunteering, raising children, and sabbaticals can all represent time dedicated to improvement. Highlight these aspects when discussing employment gaps during an interview."
"
Tell people on a need-to-know basis, but be honest.,
Stay consistent.,
Forget about it.",How to Address a Gap in Employment4," You may or may not feel you have to talk about your previous work experience. If you were out of the workforce for a long time, it might come up. In these situations, say only as much as you feel comfortable saying. Make sure to frame it in a positive light.If you feel you need to talk about it, make a friend that you trust.
Be honest, but reserved when asked about your employment gap if you feel it is a sensitive topic.

, If you've framed your period of unemployment in a certain way, make sure you stick to your story. After some time it may be possible to open up or give more details to co-workers once you've become friends, but until then, make sure your story isn't changing all the time.

, You have a new job now, and though you may feel some stress, guilt, or deficiency related to your gap in employment, remember you have a job now. You can let go of the past struggle for employment. Letting go of the past can help you deal with feelings you have related to this period.


Remember that your current achievement means more than past unemployment.
Treat yourself to something nice. This can help to remind you that you are gainfully employed, and that you deserve to let go.

Consider whether a functional resume will improve your chances of getting an interview, and thereby a job.,
Brainstorm.,
Organize.,
Arrange the resume by category, not by time.,
Add a summary at the beginning.,
Add a brief chronology of your work history at the end.",How to Write a Functional Resume," A functional resume is any that emphasizes skills and abilities and de-emphasizes the chronology. This shift in focus may be helpful in the following situations:


You are changing careers or focus and you wish to feature skills and accomplishments that weren't central to recent jobs, such as older experience, volunteer experience, or skills developed outside of work.
You have an interruption in your work or your career has recently taken a detour
You can better customize your resume to the job you are seeking by de-emphasizing the chronology.

, Write down skills and accomplishments. Don't worry at this stage which ones are relevant. You can sort and edit later. Don't forget anything that might help, including:


Volunteer experience.
Experience working in another country, industry, or job function.
Education, academic background, and on-the-job training.
Skills, especially computers and language skills.
Clubs and community affiliations.
Hobby, craft, and do-it-yourself know-how.

, What is the very best, most relevant selling point on your resume? Are you a computer whiz? Do you have an impressive degree? Do you have years of experience doing something related to the jobs you want? Give your strongest asset top billing. You might also subdivide your experience into groups; for instance general people skills and more concrete accomplishments.

, Rather than a section for each job, have a section for each sort of experience or skill you can offer. Computer skills, education, and experience are the obvious divisions.


When listing experience, begin each line with an active verb. It adds punch to the writing and gives the list a consistent tone and structure.
If you can, focus on problems you've solved and specific results you've achieved. Did you save somebody money? Did you accomplish something more than your job description?
The usual rules of resume writing still apply, only the result is shaped differently.

, This is not the well-worn ""Objective"" bit about obtaining a full-time job. Instead, it is the best condensed version of your offerings you can write. Ideally, a busy recruiter or hiring manager should be able to tell whether it's worth reading more of your resume within about 20-40 seconds.

, They can be one-line descriptions, including simply the company, your title, and the year in which you worked there.

Rework your resume title when the current one loses significance.",How to Add a Title to Your Resume," Since you have only a few words to include in your resume title, it is imperative that you make the title specific and relevant to your capabilities as well as the job you are applying to.


A resume title that is very vague will say nothing about you, and a title that does not match the job title is likely to ensure rejection. Keep in mind that it is better not to have a title at all than to have a title that is irrelevant.
Remember that a resume headline or title must only be a phrase and not even a full sentence and must communicate your value as a candidate. If you make the title longer than that, it would lose its value or purpose, and that is not desirable.;
, It is very important that your resume title matches the job that you are applying for.


One good way to ensure that this is done is to use keywords directly from the job offer. This way the recruiter will immediately recognize that your capabilities match perfectly with the job description.
Keep in mind that you may need to write or tweak your job title to ensure that it matches each job that you apply for. This may mean some extra work, but the effort will be worth it if you end up being called for the interview or even getting the job .

, When you are preparing or editing your resume for a job application always remember that the title is a desirable and not a mandatory portion of your resume.


In fact, it may not suit your particular position, situation or even the job that you are applying to. At times it could even prove detrimental to your selection.
For example, you have a varied experience a short title can be quite limiting. In these cases you may decide to drop the title and send your resume without it. That can work too, however, be sure to analyze the situation well before making your decision.

, When crafting your own resume title, it may be helpful to look at some examples of specific, eye-catching titles, such as the following:


""Goal-Oriented HR Officer With Three Years Global Workforce Handling Experience""
""Successful Marketing Manager with Multiple Product Launches""
""Freelance Writer in Technology Domain""
""Early Years Educationist with Experience in Handling Problematic Behavior Issues""
""Bi-lingual & Detail-Oriented Secretarial Assistant""

, A resume title is a short phrase that precisely describes your suitability to the job in question. It is the portion of your resume that catches the recruiter’s attention first and determines whether he or she will continue reading or not. It is a vital part of a good resume as it helps to differentiate you as a candidate from the rest of the applicants.

, It is important that your resume title is well-written and to ensure that it is attractive as well as relevant. A resume title is a brief phrase that describes your key competency, and preferably must be appropriate for the job you are applying for. It should be just a few words, not even a full sentence - like a tagline.


Some examples of good resume titles include: ‘goal-oriented accountant with global accounting experience’ or ‘senior marketing manager with extensive online marketing campaign experience’.
Of course, it's important to only highlight the capabilities that closely match the recruiter’s expectations for the role that you are applying for, as this will be crucial to your resume’s short listing.

, The most important reason for including a resume title is to grab the recruiter’s fleeting attention and make them recognize your suitability as a candidate.


However, the resume title also makes the resume searchable (especially on online databases and job sites) and sets it apart from the pile of similar resumes lying in the database. Therefore, it is important to include relevant keywords in your resume.
In absence of an interesting resume title, there is a significant chance that your resume will be overlooked or dismissed. By using the resume title to showcase your skills or experience, you are showing the recruiter that you are qualified for the job, before they even read the full resume.

, Resume titles play an important role in determining your success as a candidate when you apply for a job, as they showcase your capabilities from the very first glance. However, it is extremely important to keep your resume title updated, so that it reflects your growing capabilities as effectively and accurately as possible.

, It may be necessary to change your title after a promotion, as your job position as well as your responsibilities are likely to change.


Your new role may have a set of responsibilities that you never handled, or you may get some special skills that take your profile to a whole new level.
In such a case, neglecting to change your resume title may get you overlooked for opportunities that you may be capable of handling very efficiently.

, When you are handed new possibilities at work, it is important to update your title to portray these enhanced capabilities.


You may be given a new product to handle or a new geography to oversee, which can significantly enhance your personal profile.
Whenever you gain experience that may be improving your chances to bag that dream job, just go ahead and display. However, you should refrain from over exaggerating relatively minor changes.

, When you are applying a job that uses very specific skills or keywords, it is a good practice to tweak your title to showcase your fitment to this role.


As mentioned in the section above, it is important to use keywords and phrases that are relevant to the recruiter with respect to the job being discussed.

Ask your parents to help you sell items online.,
Make craft items to sell locally.,
Do more chores than you usually do.",How to Make Money in the Winter (Kids and Teens)1," You'll need their permission, help and responsibility for such sales but it can be a good way to get your homemade and unwanted items turned into cash. Some ways to do this include:


Make craft items and list them on Etsy, eBay, etc. You will need to use your parent's account and have them do all the listing and sales but then they can hand the money on to you when done.
Find things you no longer want around the house. Have mom or dad put them on eBay or similar sites to sell. Don't expect too much unless your items are really wanted by people. But do realize that every little bit soon adds up.
You might need to reach a deal with mom and dad on splitting the costs involved. Have a talk with them first.;
, If you are good at making things, consider selling them to neighbors, at indoor markets or to family members.


Try knitting, sewing, crochet, beading, jewelry, blanket making, weaving baskets, etc. Think of things people like to use and wear; check out sites like Pinterest to see what's popular right now, for inspiration.
Make cozy things, like blankets, hats, mittens and warm clothing.
Decorate umbrellas if you live in a rainy winter area.
Make a production line of helpers if you have siblings who also want to make some money.

, Check with mom and dad first that they're okay about paying more for extra chores. Ask them what they'd really like done around the house and get to it! As an added bonus, it'll keep you toasty warm if you're moving around a bit.

Always smile and have a positive attitude, even if you are having a bad day. Customers will be more likely to tip you well if you show professionalism regardless of what’s going on in your personal life or back at the pizza shop., Before making your delivery, look at the name on the order. When the customer opens the door, say something like “Good evening, Mr. Smith. I’ve got your pizza right here, and the total comes to $29.76.”If you’re unsure how to pronounce the customer’s name, skip it. Instead, say “How are you tonight?” or something similar.

, People love their pets, and they’ll like you more if you’re nice to their pets too. Compliment the pet by saying something like “what a handsome German Shepherd you have here,” or ask if you can pet them., Rather than leaving your customer to wonder what happened to their pizza, let them know what’s going on. If it’s a busy night, or you are having car trouble, call and let the customer know you’ll be late. They may still be annoyed, but you’re likely to get a better tip for being upfront and honest than for just being late., You should always thank the customer, regardless of their attitude or the tip. Say something like “Thanks for choosing ABC Pizza, we truly appreciate your business!” Customers like to know they are appreciated, so recognizing their business can help you get a better tip., Customers will appreciate it if you acknowledge mistakes and apologize for them. Do your best to fix the problem, and offer a discount or free item, if your employer allows it.

, Make sure the pizza was made correctly and that you have everything the customer ordered. They will be frustrated and less likely to tip you if you forgot those extra containers of ranch dressing, or brought them super spicy hot wings when they ordered barbeque flavor wings., It’s incredibly important that you get to your deliveries promptly. If your car battery is constantly dying, or you break down on the side of the road often, that will severely reduce your tips. Make sure you have a reliable vehicle to do your deliveries with, because being late will not help you earn good money., Spend some time looking at a map, or even driving around to get a feel for the area. You need to know all of the major roads in your city, and what separates your city into Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western sections. You’ll make better time if you know the difference between 500 West Maple and 500 East Maple., Many people have GPS or can get directions using their cell phone. If this doesn’t apply to you, invest in a GPS system for your car. It will be super helpful if you get lost or if a customer lives in the middle of nowhere. Using GPS can also help you find the most efficient route from one delivery to the next., Customers may ask questions about their order or future orders, so be sure you know the menu. They will appreciate you being able to tell them what’s on the “Super Supreme” when they ask., Customers will need a pen to add a tip and sign the receipt if they paid with a credit card. Not having a working pen with you tells the customer you are unprepared. Be sure to keep a few spares in your car, and one in the delivery bag or in your pocket., You’ll get better tips if you look presentable. Wear clothes without stains or rips, if possible, and make sure your hair is neat. Some guys even say they get better tips when they are clean-shaven, so you could consider getting rid of your beard if you’re not too attached to it., Make an “X” or an arrow that points to all three lines on the receipt (total, tip, and signature). Highlighting just the tip line is tacky, but pointing out all three may make a customer more likely to fill in that tip line rather than leave it blank., Rather than giving a five dollar bill back when someone hands you $20 and their total was $15, give them back five ones. This way, they’ll be more likely to give you a couple bucks, rather than stuffing that $5 back in their pocket., Some people add a tip to the bill on a credit card at the time they order. Though it may be tempting to leave this order for last, since you know you’ve already bagged a tip, don’t do that. Give them the respect they deserve and deliver their pizza promptly. They’ll remember your effort, and will be more likely to tip you well the next time, too., Some people order pizza often and may have tipped you well in the past. Try to remember these customers, and treat them well. Ask how they are doing, or suggest new menu items you think they may like. A little extra effort can go a long way to ensuring you always receive a good tip from these customers., While you may not be able to offer discounts or give out free pizza or sodas, you can offer extra items. Bring extra napkins, plates, or seasonings, such as red peppers or parmesan cheese. Offering these to your customers when you arrive shows them that you are prepared and that you care about their order and experience."

Shovel snow for your neighbors.,
Scrape off the ice on cars.,
Run a hot beverage stand.,
Help the elderly.",How to Make Money in the Winter (Kids and Teens)2," This is a traditional job to do in the winter as people may not have the time to shovel snow. It will be better if you bring your own equipment to do the job so you don't have to rely on other people to give you equipment.


Let people know before the snow comes that you are available for snow clearing and let them know your rates. Ask around for rates offered by other people and keep yours the same or less, to drum up business.
Pop flyers into people's mail boxes to let them know what you do, or simply tell people when you meet them.

, This is a struggle everyone has during winter and few people enjoy it. You could earn a lot of money doing this if you do it properly. Just be aware though, that many people might not want you to scrape ice off of their cars as they don't want to risk damage to the car. A few glowing references from people who know your abilities might help you to convince such people.


Scrape only the windows. You don't need to get the ice off of the body of the car and this risks damaging the paint.

, When it's not lemonade season, make hot chocolates, coffees and tea. You could even ladle soup out of a crockpot. Since you'll be handling hot items, you'll need to be old enough to do this responsibly and with care, and it's a really good idea to have mom, dad or a teen sibling help you out with this sort of venture.


Choose a sheltered, reasonably warm spot to locate your stand and make sure it's one where plenty of people will come by in a short space of time, such as a work area around lunchtime or the local sled park at peak sledding time. It's important to minimize the amount of time spent outside.
Offer cookies too. People will often like a snack with the hot chocolate.
Wear warm clothing that still lets you move with ease. Fingerless gloves can be great for holding cups, pouring and taking money.

, In harsh climates in the winter the elderly won't want to risk going outside. You could run some errands for them and shovel their driveway, etc. This is a very effective way of earning money as the elderly tend to need help.

Plan ahead.,
Apply.,
Get there.,
Find a job in person.",How to Get a Summer Job in Glacier National Park," Decide that you want to work for a summer at Glacier National Park (GNP), in northwest Montana. Then you have two options: apply in advance or travel there without a job waiting for you. Either should work fine, but even if an early job application is not accepted (often in the form of no reply), then still travel to MT and follow out the latter option. There is a constant need for staff as a certain percentage of expected labor does not show/leaves/is fired as the season progresses .;
, If you decide to apply early, there are several avenues to pursue. The biggest companies offer the best chance for getting a job in advance. Glacier Park, Inc. runs most of the hotels and concessions within the park and employs large numbers. Other large employers are the St. Mary Lodge and the National Park Service (N.P.S). The N.P.S pays relatively well and offers a wide range of jobs beyond rangers, including trail maintenance to photographer. Employment with the park service, however, can be more difficult to achieve than most other jobs in the area. Though these three large companies offer the most jobs, there are dozens of small, individually owned restaurants, general stores, motels, etc in the small towns around the park. By looking online for businesses in the towns of St. Mary, Babb, East Glacier, and West Glacier, most of these companies can be found and then contacted individually. Though smaller than the three large employers, these businesses usually do accept and encourage early application. Most GNP employers begin accepting applications January 1 and specific positions can fill early.

, By car, bus, train (stations at East Glacier or West Glacier), or airplane (Kalispell Airport is the closest airport - transportation from the airport can sometimes be arranged with an employer). If you already have a job set up, the employer will tell you when to arrive by (often the beginning of June). If you are traveling to GNP without a job already set up, plan to arrive sometime in mid- to late May if possible. Being unable to arrive this early is not prohibitive to finding work, though.

, - yes, this path takes a little bit of faith, but it's genuinely not difficult and there are several fall backs. Have 10-15 copies of an updated resume printed in advance (you almost certainly won't need so many, but be prepared. If the fishing isn't good, there are several local stores, hotel offices where you can make more copies). Though not imperative (especially if you wish to work for a mom & pop place rather than a corporation), good first stops include Glacier Park, Inc, headquartered at the Glacier Park Lodge in East Glacier, and St. Mary Lodge in St. Mary. Go to the front desk, express an interest in working there and ask for the Human Resource Department or Director. The NPS headquarters in Apghat Village  may be a productive first stop as well, but the high demand for and difficulty in acquiring a park service job, walk-ins may be unsuccessful. Next, choose a town that strikes your fancy (or the first you come into), and go around to each restaurant, store, gas station, bar, etc. If you have a preference of job, this would be a good point to be selective about where you seek employment. If preferred jobs have been unsuccessfully pursued, then there will remain many other businesses in town or the area to engage. When you enter a place of employment, go to the front desk/counter and ask to speak to the manager. Introduce yourself, state your desire to work there, and offer a resume. Even if you are told that there are not employment opportunities at that business, leave a resume with your email and/or cell number and ask them to call if any job openings open. Repeat until a suitable job is found and begun. Good luck!

If you can’t find the number for the Circulation Department, call a customer service representative for help.;
, Once you get in contact with the Circulation Department, ask about any delivery jobs they have available. Say that you’re a young adult looking to deliver newspapers on your bicycle. If you omit this information, they may think you want to deliver newspapers with your car.Don’t attempt to take over a car delivery route with your bicycle. Car delivery routes have higher age minimums and cover many more square miles.

, Not all delivery jobs will require an interview. However, if you have to attend one, remember to be calm and professional. Talk about your strengths positively, but be honest when answering questions. Interview questions may include:


”Are you afraid of pets? Would that affect your delivery performance?”
”Do you work well when unsupervised?”
”Do you get lost easily?”
”Can you work in difficult weather conditions?”, An interview gives you an opportunity to find out more about the job. Ask about the job requirements, such as when you’ll need to be at work and what you’ll do once you’re there. Additionally, make sure you know in advance how much you’ll get paid. Many delivery jobs pay minimum wage but it can vary depending on the newspaper. Other excellent questions include:


”Will I need to collect any money from customers?” ”Can you walk me through a typical shift delivering papers?”
”Would I be able to get time off if I needed it?”

, If you get the job, the newspaper will train you on delivering papers in your community. Each newspaper has different requirements. For example, some newspapers require you to stuff all of your newspapers into plastic sleeves before you deliver them. Other requirements can include:


Delivering papers seven days a week
Putting newspapers in specific places, especially for disabled customers
Finishing before a certain time

, Delivering newspapers can be an excellent source of income for a preteen or young adult. However, there are many factors that may affect whether or not you want the job. For example, you will have to deliver newspapers no matter what the weather is like. Other considerations include:


Many newspaper delivery jobs don’t offer vacation days. If you need time off, you will have to pay someone to replace you.While the average minimum age for paper delivery is thirteen, your state may be different. Check with your local government to be sure.If someone complains about the way you deliver your paper, you may have the cost of their paper taken from your paycheck., You will need a container on your bicycle to hold the newspapers before you deliver them. You can put the basket on the back of your bike or on the handlebars.If you need advice, ask your coworkers what kind of baskets they use and how they attached them.


Many bike shops have inexpensive baskets for sale and will also help you attach them.
Alternatively, make your own basket and attach it yourself.


, Bike safety equipment will make you more visible to cars. This important equipment can be bought online or at your local bike shop. If you need help choosing or attaching this equipment, talk to a bike shop representative or your local biking association. Safety equipment includes:


Colored flags that can be mounted on the back of your bike
Active lights placed on the front and back of your bike
A headlight, placed on the handlebars
Reflective tape that can be placed on the tires and body of your bike, Protect your bike from the rain by storing it in a garage or covering it with a tarp.

Checking for rust on the body of the bike
Making sure the chain is oiled and clean

Wiggling the seat and handlebars to make sure they’re not loose

Replacing the tires if they become worn down or punctured

, You should always wear safety gear when riding a bike. However, this is especially important when delivering papers. If it’s early enough, it may still be dark out and cars will have trouble seeing you.

A sturdy, well-fitting helmet
Knee and elbow pads
Leather gloves to protect your hands
A reflector vest to increase your visibilityA reflective poncho to wear in the rain

, Depending on local laws, children under a certain age are allowed to ride their bikes on the sidewalk.If possible, ride on the sidewalk when delivering papers. You will be out of the reach of cars and can ride at your own pace.


Check online or call your local government to determine whether or not you can bike on the sidewalk.
When riding on the sidewalk, take care to avoid any early morning joggers or pedestrians.

, You will have to deliver newspapers in the rain, snow, and sleet. Therefore, when you ride in bad weather, take extra care to avoid any obstructions in the road. For example, avoid riding over any ice patches.Other obstructions can include:


Tree branches that fall down in a storm
Large puddles of water that may be hiding an uneven road
Broken or cracked asphalt

, No matter where you ride your bike, be aware of any cars that may be around you. Don’t expect cars to see you, even if you’re on the sidewalk. For example, if you’re not paying attention, a car could back out of their driveway while you ride past.Additionally:


Look both ways before crossing any streets.

You might also want to talk to a guidance counselor at school. Tell them, “Hey, Mr. Jones, I’m thinking of getting a summer job. Do you know where I can find information?” They should be able to point you in the right direction.;
, Before applying, make sure that you are old enough. For example, your state will have a minimum age limit. In Massachusetts, the minimum age is 14.Also check whether you need a permit at all. In Nevada, you don’t need a work permit if you are at least 14 years of age.Some states might exempt you if you have already graduated high school. For example, in California, you don’t need a work permit if you’ve already graduate or received a certificate of proficiency., Most states will limit the number of hours you can work. They may also limit when you can work. You should understand these limitations before you begin working.


For example, in Massachusetts, you are limited to working a maximum of 18 hours a week when school is in session. You can only work from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. during the school year and 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. when school is not in session.

, You’ll need your parents to sign off on the work permit, so you should ask them if you can work. Try to have several reasons why getting a job will be beneficial. For example, consider the following:


Explain why you want the money. You can tell your parents, “If I work, then I’ll be able to buy my new school clothes and supplies. This will help me learn how to budget.”Tell them what you hope to learn. Say, “I’ve never worked before, and I think this is a good way to learn how to be in a team with other people. I’ll learn important people skills.”
Tell them you are bored. Explain to your parents that you’ll only be sitting at home if you don’t work. By working, you’ll make productive use of your time.

Check if you need a work permit.,
Find out if you are eligible for a work permit.,
Have a job offer in hand.,
Apply for the permit.,
Wait for the results.",How to Get a Work Permit and Job3," Many temporary jobs do not require a work permit. You can check whether you need one by visiting http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/apply-who-nopermit.asp#dropdowns and checking the job you intend to perform in Canada.


For example, you do not need a work permit to run or organize an international convention or meeting in Canada, unless you are doing hands-on work, such as decorating, setting up or taking down displays, or providing audiovisual services.If you intend to work as a public speak for more than five days, then you also need a work permit., Canada has a list of general eligibility requirements you must satisfy. Check to see that you do before applying for a work permit:Prove you intend to leave Canada when your permit expires
Show you have enough money to provide for yourself and your family during your stay in Canada
Obey the law and have no criminal record
Be in good health and take a medical exam if required
Work only for eligible employers
Avoid working for an employer that primarily offers erotic dance or massage, escort services, or striptease
Not be a danger to Canada’s security

, There are two types of work permits: open work permits and employer-specific permits. An open permit allows you to work for any employer, whereas an employer-specific permit is tied to one employer.By far, most work permits are employer-specific, and you must have an offer in hand from a Canadian employer before applying for one., Your requirements will differ depending on whether you apply for the work permit outside Canada, while inside Canada, or when entering Canada. See http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/apply-who-eligible.asp for detailed information.


If you apply when outside Canada, then determine which work permit you will need: an open work permit or employer-specific. You can apply for the permit when you apply for your visa.
Generally, you can only apply for the work permit while in Canada if you have a valid reason for being there. Examples include having graduated from a Canadian university, having a valid study or work permit, having temporary residence. You can apply online at http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/e-services/account.asp.
You can apply for a work permit when you enter Canada only if you are from a visa-exempt country and you have a valid medical certificate. You may ask for either an open work permit or finish an employer-specific application that your employer has completed.

, The amount of time you must wait will depend on your circumstances. You may receive a decision within hours or up to eight weeks later. The process can also be delayed if the government needs to confirm your offer of employment.Remember that you can’t work until you receive your work permit. However, if you obtained a business visa, then you can do any work allowable under the visa.

Keep an open mind when looking for a summer job.,
Think about a summer camp job.,
Work in food, catering or retail.,
Look for a summer internship or work placement.",How to Make Money Over the Summer1," The most obvious thing to do to earn money over the summer is to get a good summer job. There are a huge variety of areas you could work in, so you should keep an open mind when thinking about what you would like to do. There will be things you can do locally, but also jobs that involve you being away for weeks at a time.


Most of the time you will need to begin looking for work before summer comes around. So be proactive and start sending out resumes before you finish school for the summer.;
, Being a camp counsellor can be really fun way to earn some money, do a wide-range of different activities, spend lots of time outdoors, and meet loads of great new people. It’s a big time commitment, but can give you great and experience and be an excellent addition to your resume.You will learn lots of valuable leadership, communication, and organisation skills as a camp counsellor.
If you have specific skills, like languages or sports, there are particular camps that you should keep an eye out for.

, Working in your local mall or shopping centre is one of the most common types of summer work available. Look for positions advertised online, but also walk around your local mall with a copy of your CV and go into shops to ask if they are recruiting. It’s best to be proactive in your search as they will most likely be a good few people looking for work in the same places.


Working in these areas can give you great experience learning personal organisation and customer service skills., Getting an internship or placement over the summer can be a fantastic way to gain experience relevant to your career interests as well as building up some contacts, and earning some money. It's a good idea to contact your school or college careers service as they might have an index of local firms that take on interns.Alternatively put yourself out there and approach places you would be interested to work at.
Do your research before you contact a company.
Don't think of it as a summer job, but a potential trial period for your long-term career. Treat it accordingly and maintain a high-level of professionalism."

Work at summer events.,
Try car washing.,
Find out if anyone in your neighbourhood needs a house sitter.,
Try babysitting or being a nanny.,
Offer pet feeding and walking services.,
Try doing yard work.,
Do some house painting.",How to Make Money Over the Summer2," There a lots of big events in the summer which require a lot of casual workers. Look around your local area for festivals and events and contact the organisers. You could even get work at a music festival or sports event that you love.The sort of work you can do at these festival includes handing out promotional flyers, punching tickets, and a host of other things.


If you have particular skills, such as first aid, you will be more attractive to the event organizers.

, Washing cars can be a good way to earn some extra cash, especially if you can team up with some friends and drum up a lot of business. Word of mouth works, so be sure to do a good job and people will recommend you to others.

, Housesitting is a really great and pretty easy way to earn money over the summer. You may find yourself being paid to water plants, feed the pets and just keep an eye on the house while the residents are away on holiday.Ask around people you know to see if anyone is looking for a house sitter, as you are more likely to get a job from someone you know who trusts you.


Leaving your keys with someone is quite big deal, so although the actual work may be easy, you need to take it seriously and respect the house.

, If you like kids, this can be a way to make cash over the summer and have a lot of fun at the same time. This isn’t just for women either! Looking after children is a very serious job, so be prepared to put in a lot of work and be exhausted at the end of the day, but playing in the park with some good kids is probably more fun than washing cars.


If you have particular skills, such as being able to tutor in the kids in a foreign language, or teach them arts and crafts, then parents may offer you more money.If you have a good relationship with parents and their kids, there can be lots of work here for you that can continue beyond the summer.

, Feeding pets is a nice way to earn a bit of extra cash, especially if you can build up a good number of pets nearby to feed. Feeding one cat, once a day will probably not earn you all that much. You can compliment this by taking on some dog walking too, in order to increase the time you are working and the amount you get paid.You can ask around your neighbourhood for those who are going on vacation and need someone to feed their pets.
You could also put an advert in your local paper, or drop some flyers through mailboxes.

, Yard work is a good way to earn some money while enjoying the weather, getting a suntan, and some exercise. Summer yard work covers things like mowing lawns, basic gardening and more serious landscaping work. This will most often be casual work, so you will have to work hard to get your customers in the first place, but once you build up a good list you can start to see the money flow in.Keep an open mind about the kind of yard work you can do, and work out your rates early on.

, Summer house painting is another classic way to earn extra money in the summer. You can do this on your own, or with a group of friends. Put some adverts up and knock on some doors to let people know about your business. Like yard work, this can be a great way to earn money while still enjoying the weather and seeing a tangible result of your work.


Consider completing a training course before you start to advertise yourself, as this could make you stand out from your competitors, as well as improve your brushwork."

Work out what you can get rid of.,
Sell old college books.,
Have a yard sale.,
For more cash, sell big ticket items.",How to Make Money Over the Summer3," Selling some stuff you don’t need or want can be a good way to get a little extra money. The first to do is to go through your things and work out what you can spare. Things like college and school books, clothes and shoes can all fetch good prices. But CDs and DVDs may not go for so much.


You can check some online shops to see what kind of price you can get.

, Textbooks that you are finished with can be some of the most valuable things you have, especially the very expensive medical and engineering books that all students on those courses have to buy. Be sure to describe the condition they are in accurately, and look around to see the kind of prices second hand copies are going for.


Lots of people will be trying to sell old books, so be realistic in your valuation.Advertise on campus as well as online.

, One good to way to shift a variety of bits and pieces that you have, without having to list them online and pay for postage and packing, is to have a yard sale, or go to a car boot sale. You will not be getting big prices for what you are selling, so have realistic expectations. But you can do a few things to increase your chances of making more money.Promote it well, so you get good footfall.
Have a clear pricing strategy so people don’t think you are just making it up as you go along.
Sell some drinks and snacks to your shoppers.
There is also the added bonus of getting rid of some of your old stuff.

, If you really need to bring in some money, it might be easier to sell a few things that can fetch a big price. You won't get much for dozens of old CDs, but a good stereo or piece of electrical equipment could be very lucrative.


Things like musical instruments can be worth a lot of money.
Don't make any rash decisions though. Once it's gone, you can't get it back.

Start researching.,
Get the word out.,
Use your connections.,
Volunteer.,
Make a resume.,
Apply early!,
Go to an interview.,
Increase your earnings.",How to Get a Job As a Teen,"


Find organizations and other places that you know pay teens to work. Good places to check are government departments and nonprofit organizations such as city park and recreation departments, zoos, museums, camps, and hospitals.
Another option to look at are bridge clubs. They usually meet once a week and pay well for caddies and also have tournaments every month or so that pay even more.
Don’t go out looking to be executive director of any job. Start out small and easy, retail and food industry jobs are probably the easiest to obtain.;
, You can post flyers in your neighborhood detailing jobs that you can do, such as lawn mowing, babysitting, or dog-walking. You can also post your information on a website or job board, but beware of giving out personal information until you trust the other person. Post 3 x 5 cards at local stores and other places with notice-boards telling of the services you're willing to do.

, Talk to friends and family about any paying jobs they might know of, and follow through.

, Sometimes, the best way to get a paying job is to begin as a volunteer and work your way up. You may have to give some of your time for free to make money in the long run. Treat your volunteer work as if it were a paying job -- get there on time, call as soon as you know you can't come in or are going to be late. Listen and learn about the organization. Do such a good job they learn to rely on you.

, Even if most jobs you apply for don't ask for a resume, it's a good exercise, and it's useful to have your work history and education details all written out in one place. It makes filling out applications much easier.

, The most important key to getting jobs with these places is to apply as soon as you hear about jobs. Always be on the lookout--sometimes recruitment starts as early as February or March for summer jobs.

, One of the most often asked questions is: Why do you feel you are qualified for this job? Let them know how positive you are, always willing to help out, and go out of your way for special requests. When asked any experience you may have; Well now you have phone experience, can you dial numbers without really looking at the keypad or even better are you good with a calculator? That’s 10 key (depending on how fast and the job needs this is a good thing to include in your Job experience) Do you know how to use a computer? How about the Internet, Word, Outlook or email? Do you know how to use a fax machine, copy machine? Can you file, sort by alphabetical order, name order, date order. Believe it or not it’s all relevant and sometimes even as a mail room attendant that’s all you need.

, After working at the entry level position for a few summers or after school, you will have the experience to work at a higher level once you are out of high school. This can help you pay your way through college, and you can practically guarantee you'll always have a summer job. In some cases (like the S.F. Bay Area), you could go from getting minimum wage to getting $15-17/hr.

Pay attention to age regulations.,
Use your connections.,
Make a job for yourself.,
Don't be afraid to volunteer.,
Pursue online opportunities.,
Be open to what is available.",How to Get a Job when You're Only 161," Before you start looking for work, you need to make sure you are eligible to work. There are some federal and state regulations that say you must be a certain age to work, and others that restrict teens from certain types of jobs. Find out any rules in your state that would keep you from working. You may need to talk to your school to see if you need paperwork from them, as well.Individual companies may also have restrictions about age, so you want to pay attention to those requirements as you are searching and looking at applications. You don’t want to spend the time it takes to file an application if they only hire people who are 18 years or older.;
, One of the most important, and often hardest, aspects of getting a job is learning to ask for it. Talk to everyone you know and tell them you are job searching. Ask them if they know of any good opportunities at the moment. It is great to ask adults like your parents, aunts and uncles, teachers, guidance counselors, and church leaders. These connections can be especially helpful in getting informal jobs like babysitting and lawn care.There is also always the possibility that you know people who work in places that would hire teenagers for assistant type work, filing, or cleaning positions.
Once you have made the initial ask, and especially if the person tells you they will check into something, make sure to follow up with them later on to see if they found out anything.

, A great option for teens is to go the more entrepreneurial route, rather than seeking jobs within a company structure. Going the self-employment route gives you greater flexibility in regards to how often and how many hours you work. When you are using your connections, pointing out your interest in self-employment is always a good plan.The types of jobs you have available in this area include babysitting (which people always need), lawn care (such as mowing, gardening, or even simple landscaping), dog walking, or car washing. You could even offer pickup and delivery services (if you can legally drive) for things like groceries, dry cleaning, or other goods.
People have all kinds of things that they need done, and as a teen, you may be able to offer them lower prices than if they hired an adult. Don’t limit your thinking about what opportunities might be available.

, Volunteering for a while can be a great way to start building relevant work skills that make you more marketable. If you have the time to put into volunteering somewhere on a consistent and long-term basis, you may be able to build enough rapport with them that you can move into a paid position.If the business or organization you are volunteering with starts looking to hire, you will be a better candidate than many others because you already know their environment and goals well.

, In today’s marketplace, online and telecommute jobs are plentiful, and many are viable options for teens. If you have a skill for writing, there are many online platforms that allow you do freelance work. As long as you can perform the writing well, your age would not restrict you. If you have any website design or other graphic design experience, this can be another good option.In many cases, you will still need to meet specific qualification standards. Some freelance jobs will require you to have a degree, some experience, or be of adult age. When looking at potential opportunities, be careful to look for these requirements.
Consider learning to buy and sell things online, such as comics, antiques, or other merchandise. You may need your parents to help set up an account for something like eBay if there is a restriction, but then you would be able to do the work of selling.
Online working options could be great when you are still in school, because they rarely require you to work specific scheduled hours. You would have the freedom to work around your schedule, and do extra work anytime you have days off from school.

, Although jobs may be limited by your age, many great opportunities still exist. Many restaurants, retail stores, or agricultural and labor jobs allow younger employees. Don't say no to these types of jobs, even if they would not be your favorite choice. At 16, this probably won't be your lifelong job, so be willing to do something that you may not love for a while to earn a little money and gain work experience.

Prepare your paperwork.,
Write up a resume.,
Prepare for your interview.,
Take a training course.",How to Get a Job when You're Only 162," To get hired by most businesses or organizations, you will need a few pieces of paperwork and identification. The first thing you may need is a driver’s license, but you may be able to substitute another form of photo ID like a passport if you don’t yet have a driver’s license. Know your social security number, and possibly have the social security card itself for when you fill out applications and tax documents. Lastly, it is possible you’ll need a specific work permit of some kind, possibly signed by your parents, to show that you are legally allowed to work.It is in your best interest to gather all of these before officially filling out applications or tax papers so you’ll have them ready if you do need them.

, It may not be entirely necessary to have a resume for many of the jobs you’ll be looking for, but there is still a benefit to doing it. You may not even have any work experience to speak of, but you can craft a resume that highlights what you do have to offer. It can be worthwhile to list academic accomplishments which show that you are a hard worker. But a resume can help you highlight some soft skills like how energetic you are, show you are reliable, and let you talk yourself up, in general.If you have volunteer experience, you can list that and explain what ways it has helped you become a better worker. Maybe you were a top seller in a recent fundraiser, which shows you have sales capability. Maybe you won top prize in a science fair, which shows you know how to work with complex mechanisms.
A resume is all about making you look like the best candidate, so craft it to fit the jobs you are looking at. Find ways to prove that you have the skills the hiring personnel are looking for.
The other benefit of a resume when you’re only 16 is that many other people your age will not have written a resume, so it gives you a bit of an edge over them.

, Even many adults struggle with the interviewing process, so it is always good to think about it and practice ahead of time. Ask your parents or other adults what types of questions they were asked. If you know other teenagers who work at places you are applying, ask them what type of interview they went through. Compile a list of some basic questions that you are likely to be asked and have some good answers ready for those questions.Sample questions might be: What can you offer this company? What makes you qualified for this job? What experience do you have that makes you a good candidate for the job?
It is also helpful to just keep a positive attitude going into an interview. Tell yourself that you are ready and that you are a great choice for the job. It’s hard to convince someone else if you aren’t convinced yet.

, Something that will make you a better job candidate is having something extra to offer, outside of job specific skills. Going through a training course for CPR, getting certification for basic first aid, or attending a customer service seminar will give you an edge over other young applicants.


For babysitting, CPR and first aid would be a great help. Parents will likely feel more at ease knowing you have some training for emergency situations. These would also both be great for jobs like being a lifeguard at the community pool.

With all the limitations on your hours and your lack of experience, it will be difficult to find jobs in more competitive sectors.


Alternatively, call or stop by places that you are interested in. These jobs cycle often, so they are often looking for new employees. There is a decent chance that they are hiring.
Find something that you are interested in, like a restaurant whose food you like. If you like coffee, a café could be a good option. If you like movies, find a movie theater. Though these jobs don’t pay well, they often allow you to get free products.;
, You are more likely to get a job if you already know people who are employed with a company. Talk to friends and elders. Ask if they know anyone who is looking to hire and if they can testify to the fact that you are a reliable person., Applying for a service sector job is often very different than applying for a professional job. Instead of asking you to write a formal resume and cover letter, employers will typically have a paper application for you to fill out. The only way to know for sure is stop by and ask how to apply.

, Without work experience or a degree it will be hard to prove that you are a qualified employee. If you have any experience with volunteer organizations, clubs, or other groups—especially as a leader—talk about this when you apply for your job. If you don’t have any such experience, reach out to some groups and get involved., Think of some adults to whom you have demonstrated that you are responsible. You could consider teachers and school counselor. Anyone who you have worked with in an organization like the boy scouts or local clubs can testify to your ability to work with others.

, When you apply for a job, be sure that you are dressed in a way that suggests you are serious. A suit and tie might be a bit much for a summer job. But you should be sure that you are wearing nice clothes, with no holes, stains, or messages that could be read as offensive.

, You won't have to worry about a work permit if you're working for yourself. Ask neighbors if they need someone to mow their lawn or watch their kids. Although it might be a bit old-fashioned, a lemonade stand on a busy street in the summer could also bring in a bit of money.


Small household chores are not covered by federal regulations. Doing these will save you the trouble of getting a work permit and dealing with other child labor regulations.These sorts of jobs can be a good chance to show that you are a self starter, able to organize a business and get jobs done on your own.

, There also aren't as many regulations when working for your parents. Hopefully, they've also learned by now to like you well enough to give you a job. Ask if you can get paid for doing some chores around the house or if they are have any business that they can help you with.


There are no regulations for doing household chores. There are some for working with parents in a business, but it should be alright as long as the conditions are not hazardous., You'll have the rest of your life to work. One day, you might look back and regret that you didn't spend enough time being a kid or working on your education. While working isn't always a bad idea when you are young, consider whether it is really worth the cost.


Often it is best to work over the summer and Christmas holidays. Without school, you'll have time on your hand. Working won't get in the way of your education. That is why federal regulations are much more lenient when it comes working over the holidays than they are when it comes to working during the school year.

Find proof of age.,
Stay in good standing with your school.,
Talk to a school counselor.,
Get your parent or guardian to sign the form in front of a notary.,
Present the work permit to your employer.,
Expect to get another work permit if you change jobs.",How to Get a Job if You Are Under 16 (USA)2," To get a work permit you will need to be able to show a qualified professional proof that you are at least 14. Different states will accept different documents, but a birth certificate should always be the best document to present., It makes little sense to get a job if you are already having trouble at school. Furthermore, many states require that you have a record of good attendance and passing grades to get a work permit.There is no federal standard on this subject, but expect your state to require some level of good performance in school in order for you to obtain employment.

, There is no federal law requiring work certificates, which means that each state has its own unique procedure for requesting a work certificate. A school counselor is a good person to ask about the process, because she should at least be able to explain the process in your state and because you often go through your school to get the work certificate. The most likely places to get a work permit are a courthouse in your county, the state employment commission, or your school district.
You should ask about a work permit before applying for jobs. In some states you need to be offered a job before applying for a work permit.However, this isn't necessary true in all states. If you can get a work permit first, it will increase the likelihood that you will receive an employment offer. Either way, you should inquire about the process before starting your search.
Although it is rare, some states don’t offer proof of age. You might be required to talk to the federal Department of Labor.If your counselor is not able to help you, look online for the website of your state's Department of Labor. It should include the relevant information. Remember, that information from the federal Department of Labor and other states will not be relevant because every state has a different process.

, This step might be required to make the work permit a legal document. You should be informed as to whether this is necessary when you pick up the work permit.

, Your employer should take and keep the work permit or proof of age. This will be necessary for them to prove that you are of age. If they do not have this evidence, they could be fined for hiring underage employees., Once again, while there is no federal standard, some states require you to get a separate work permit for every new job you take. Even if this not legally mandated, it might be necessary for practical purposes. You have given your original work permit to your employer and might find it difficult to get the permit back.

Don’t bother if you are under 14.,
Don’t expect to work too long.,
Avoid hazardous jobs.",How to Get a Job if You Are Under 16 (USA)3," Federal law sets 14 as the minimum age of employment. This means it is impossible to work under 14, except for in a few specific industries.It is possible, for example, to work under 14, if you are employed in the entertainment industry.
Newspaper delivery is also exempt from federal law, but might be covered by state law., Federal regulations only allow those under 16 to work three hours on a school day and 18 hours total during a school week. Federal laws do allow you to work longer on holidays, but state laws often impose stricter regulations.


Outside of school weeks, students can work 40 hours a week, 8 hours a day. Thus, holidays are an optimal time to get a job.
You are only permitted to work 7 AM to 7 PM, excluding summer time, which is defined as the period from June 1st to Labor Day. Over summer, youths can work as late as 9 PM.
When state and federal laws differ, the most restrictive law applies. In general, state laws impose stiffer limitations on working hours than the federal standard. You will need to abide by these.If you are working for a business solely owned by your parents, the hour restrictions do not apply. You are still, however, forbidden from working in hazardous occupations.When working for your parents, you can work for as many hours as you want at whatever times of day you wish. However, you are still forbidden from working in hazardous conditions and the business must be solely owned by your parents., Minors are generally prohibited from working in occupations that involve explosives or heavy machinery.State law generally provides additional detail as to what type of industries minors can be employed in. Sometimes, your own real options are service sector, retail, and restaurant jobs."

Create a shopping list.,
Talk to the teacher you are going to intern under before your first day.,
Use the knowledge you have learned in your college coursework.,
Never question the classroom teacher's performance, technique, or presentation in front of the class.,
Keep your cool in the classroom.,
Get plenty of rest.",How to Survive an Internship in Elementary Education," Never go to the store without a purpose or you may come out broke (but with a fabulous new set of books and markers). Some common supplies an intern may need to begin are these:


Hand sanitizing wipes. Not every classroom has a sink or bathroom for immediate use, so to avoid germs as much as possible, you will want to wipe your hands pretty often.
Pencils, markers, and other writing supplies. Get enough so that you are able to share with the students if you are able. Schools have limited resources, and often it is the students/parents responsibility to provide basic supplies, but a dedicated teacher (or here, intern) will want each child to have what is needed for them to learn.
Notebooks, binders, or a teacher's planner. Lessen plans are the main structure of many classes, and during internship, you will want to develop good planning techniques, both by observing and taking notes of the classroom teacher you are interning under, and using the knowledge you have gotten during school to begin creating your own.
Snacks, bottled water, and other comfort items. These are for you, not the students! You may choose to bring treats for the students, but these should be reserved for special occasions, or you will find it impossible to stay on a budget.
Tissues and toiletry items. This can possibly include many different things, depending on your gender, and the available facilities where you are interning.;
, Internship relationships are not always equal, and going into the process with a clear understanding of what the teacher expects from you will help you have a plan in place when you start. Interning is not teaching aide training, but an opportunity for you to use and develop skills and techniques before becoming a full-time teacher. Some of the things you can expect to do are the following:


Work with individuals during classes. Often a teacher will take advantage of an intern to work one-to-one with students while they are doing group or general classroom work.
Develop, or help with developing lesson plans. While the classroom teacher is still responsible for the daily lesson plan, they may enlist your help in developing one, or give you the task of doing specific portions of it.
Checking work, grading papers, or writing tests. These may be considered aid jobs, but most classrooms do not have teacher's aids, so it is reasonable to assume the intern will at least share this duty, and it is a significant part of a teacher's daily work.
Developing special projects. This will depend on the course you are interning in, of course, but for example, in a science class you may have an opportunity to set up lab equipment, demonstrate an experiment, or make visual aids for a particular item of study.

, Before becoming an intern, you will probably have completely four years of higher education (in the US, at least), and this is the first chance for you to use this knowledge productively. It is also a ""proving ground"", of sorts, since moving the techniques and knowledge you learned into the real world sometimes has exposes problems your professor did not prepare you for.

, It is his/her class, and if you have reservations about what they are doing, wait to discuss this in private. The teacher you are working under will be reporting to your own counselor, as your internship is part of your own education, so in this sense, you are being graded on your work, and causing friction will not result in good assessments.

, Nervousness and apparent lack of confidence may cause the students to loose respect for you, especially if you are a young college age intern teaching high school classes, where there may be only a few years age difference between you and the students. Whether a teacher or an intern, you have to maintain control and composure.

, Getting a good night's sleep is important in any pursuit or endeavor you engage in, and teaching is no exception. Eating healthy foods, and general living a healthy lifestyle will help you get perform better at any task.

This will speed up the process of applying when you find something you like. You will also need to have a copy of your resume when doing certain types of searches, such as if you go to a job fair. Be sure that your resume is appropriately structured and looks professional.


Consider building your work experience first. If you have no work experience, it may be worth it to consider building work experience before attempting to get an internship. Many internships are competitive and you will be unlikely to get one with no work history. Consider volunteering or an entry-level position.;
, Like having a resume to present when searching for a position, you will also need to look professional during certain types of searches. Any time where you are meeting a potential employer, even just to inquire if an internship is available, you should be dressed appropriately for that position.

, Many high schools, colleges, and universities will have career centers where you can search for an internship. Many times, these centers will be staffed with volunteers or employees who can help you in your search, give you advice, and help you write your resume and cover letters.


Such resources are often also available to alumni.

, Job fairs are often held in cities. At these events, businesses looking to hire employees or interns will have booths where you can apply or get more information. Look for job fairs in your area and be ready to attend. You should have a strong idea of what you’re looking for, as well as proper dress and a resume.


Job fairs will often be advertised in the local paper or on local television channels. You can also inquire at your city’s Chamber of Commerce or local convention center. They may know of upcoming events or the time of year when they can be expected.

, Many career fields will have professional organizations or associations or regionalized branches of those groups. These will often have online job postings or postings in their offices. Call the organization appropriate for your field and ask if they provide any information regarding internship openings.

, Networking is one of the best ways to find internships and other work opportunities. Poll your friends using social media, ask your parents or your parents friends, or talk with acquaintances and employers about openings they are aware of or people they may know who would be open to taking an intern.

, There are many websites which are designed to help people get internships. While you have to be careful, since like other job websites there are often people wanting to scam you, these websites can be invaluable tools for finding internships you might not have been aware of otherwise., If the above methods aren’t working for you, don’t provide you with the kind of opportunities you want, or you are just more of a take-the-bull-by-the-horns kind of person, you can take the situation into your own hands and create the internship you want. Find a company that you would like to work for, ask for a meeting, and propose an internship. This is called cold-calling. Be aware, however, that if you are taking this approach, you will need to be very well prepared. Dress to the nines, have an excellent resume, have a plan dealing with how you can help them and what you both stand to gain from the relationship, and generally show them why they’d be crazy to turn you away.

, Once you've found a listing, flyer, or post for an open internship, you will need to make contact with the employer. Generally, postings will let you know the best method of communication to use. If unspecified, calling is best so long as you can sound professional and confident. Bring or mail them their requested materials (such as a cover letter and resume) and ask any initial questions you may have.


The more they feel like they know you before the interview, the better your chances will be.

, You will want to do whatever you can to impress the people you interview with. This can be done through the language that you use, the clothing that you wear, and how you approach questions.


Make sure you look and sound professional and confident. Speak in definitive terms when you tell them about yourself: I can do this, I will do that. Don't use terms like probably and maybe.
Research the company before interviewing. Find out their values and buzzwords. Use references to those values and buzzwords in your interview.
Get acquainted with common interview questions and how to answer them. There are many standard questions that tend to get asked and how you answer them is important. , Employers want to see that you are capable, determined, and invested in the position you want. This tells them that you will work hard and be a good employee. Be persistent in your communications and proactively seek the things you want.

, If you get an offer, make sure to take a moment to think about it before accepting, unless you are certain this job is for you. If you accept, you have now made a commitment. If you have had other interviews, you may want to ask the employer for time to decide on the offer, so you can then contact the other employers you've interviewed with and see if they can make you an offer sooner. This way, you can choose between two offers rather than only going with the first one you get.


Be careful though: being unsure about taking the position won’t look good to all employers!

, You will want to be sure the internship is one which might be related to or help your future career goals. The point of an internship is to give you experience which you can use and make you more employable, so make it count.

, Internships will have different time requirements. Some may be full time, some may be part time, and some may be only a few hours a month. You will need to decide what fits best with your schedule, especially if you will need to hold down a second job while working the internship.

, You will need to figure out the furthest you are willing to commute in relation to the time commitment of the internship. This will limit the areas in which you can look for an internship.

, Some internships don’t pay, some pay only a very small amount, and some pay like any entry level position. You will need to determine what your budget is and if you can afford to have an unpaid internship. If you cannot, you may need to have another job on the side.

Get an internship.,
Maintain regular and clear communication with your HR recruiter and your manager.,
Start your first day right.,
Get to know the expectations.,
Settle into your role.,
Work as closely with your manager as you can while still being independently productive.,
End on a high note.",How to Prepare for an Internship," This is an obvious first step, but one worth mentioning. Sometimes the thought of even getting an internship can be a challenge for some people. But by having a clean resume, going to career fairs and professional conferences, and presenting yourself professionally many students can attain an internship.;
, You want to make sure you clear up what your start and end dates will be, the work site you will be working on, and what you should have ready by the first day of work orientation.


Additionally, you may be moving to a new city or state for your internship. Make sure you clear up with your HR contacts what kind of travel and living expenses are covered by your company and find an apartment several months in advance that provides the proper amenities. And you may want to look into the costs for renting or buying a car while you are in a new location if you do not bring your car with you.

, On your first day of work you will likely attend a daylong orientation process, which officially makes you an intern for the summer. Here you will likely get your employee badge, necessary work equipment (like a laptop, monitors, workstation, etc), and get to meet other interns or coworkers. This is a good day to take it easy and meet new people in your work network.


Even if you do not work with someone directly on their team, it is very possible that you will work with them indirectly through projects or collaborations, so you want to make sure you make a good impression with your new coworkers.

, Even after going through orientation on your first day and setting up your workstation, you might still need a few more resources to actually start doing productive work. Talk with your manager about your scope of work in the team and what you are expected to deliver. Ask your manager and coworkers what software tools and extra resources are required, and if there are any rights or permissions you require to be approved to perform the job effectively without too many obstacles.


Additionally, you will possibly have new employee trainings that you have to get out of the way before you do productive work. If your manager and work permit it, ask for VPN access on your laptop so that you may do work from home.

, By now you should have a pretty good understanding of the kind of work you and your coworkers do and how it affects other teams and the company as a whole. Your team might be composed of smaller sub-teams, each of which focuses on a specific project, or it might be the case that every member of the team works towards a large scale and long-term project that requires regular updates. Whatever the case may be make sure you find your role in the team.


If it is the first mentioned case, attempt to find small projects with each of the sub-teams that can be accomplished within the short time you will be interning. If it is the latter case, make sure you designate most of your time and resources towards the big project at hand and help your team mates however you can.

, You want to show you can get tasks done, but you also want to gather all feedback you can. Make sure you meet at least once with your manager within the first month for a performance management assessment. This is important for two reasons:


First you want to make sure that you are doing work well according to your manager’s expectations. Your manager should let you know if there is anything you need to improve on or anything you have been doing well so far.
Secondly, a performance management assessment done well shows your manager that you are taking your job seriously and opens the possibility for them to hire you into the company after you graduate from college.

, By this time you should be wrapping up all of the projects you have been assigned. You should meet one last time with your manager for a final performance management assessment and discuss the possibility of working full time after graduating from college. 


Additionally, if you are still going to be in college a year or more after the internship is over (either as an undergraduate or graduate student) many companies will offer you the possibility of interning again at the same company. If this is something you are interested in you need to contact your HR recruiter and let them know this and fill out the proper ELOA (Educational Leave of Absence) so that you may come back next year without many hassles.

, The goal should be to end up with a great reference from your employer. To make the most of your time put forward your best effort on every project you're assigned.

, During your internship, fully understanding of what's expected is essential for your performance of creative tasks and the quality of the work you do. Make sure you can comprehend the language that will be spoken most. Often your acceptance into the program is dependent on your language level.

, You will learn more skills during the internship.

, To do so:


Mind your body language. Your posture, facial expressions, and eye contact give away subtle clues to how you feel. You want to project confidence, sit up straight, relax and be engaged with the interviewer. Eye contact and nodding in agreement to important statements shows you are actively listening.






Dress for the position you want. Every company has their standard of professionalism, to get a sense of it, look at their website and note what the employees are wearing in the pictures. When in doubt, dress business professional. This means a business suit and ties for men and trousers or knee length skirts with stockings for women, pair with a conservative top and blazer.

, There is a big difference between being on vacation and living and working in a new city. You may not be able to sight-see and explore for quite some time while you get established. Juggling a social life in a city like Madrid or Brussels, while upholding your commitment to work can be quite overwhelming. Many people overestimate their stamina and wear themselves out fast. If your focus is more on nightlife, then work life, the quality of you work can suffer, leading to discipline from your employer. It's important to find a balance between work and play.

Earn a Bachelor's Degree.,

Obtain two or more years teaching experience (preferred).,
Complete a TELF internship in China.",How to Get a Teaching Job in China1," Hundreds of teachers move to China every year to work in various schools. Most of the teaching jobs available to foreigners require applicants to have earned a bachelor’s degree in any field. Complete a degree at a university or community college before applying., TEFL stands for “Teaching English as a Foreign Language.” Most teaching jobs for foreigners in China require this (or an equivalent) certificate. Furthermore, this course work is excellent preparation for teaching English as a Second Language. TEFL preparation is the best for the demanding duties of a teacher in China.Other companies, such as TESOL, also exist to certify teachers, but TEFL is the most widely known.
TEFL tuition varies by location, but a certificate will run between $1500 and $2000.

, Most jobs will also ask that you have two or more years of teaching experience. This experience may be broadly construed. For example, if you have led a summer camp or worked as a tutor, you may be able to present this work as your “teaching experience.” Additionally, this experience is usually listed as a “preferred” qualification, as opposed to a “requirement.”, Another way to gain a teaching job in China is to complete a paid TELF internship.

Pursue training or continuing education.",How to Get a Teaching Job," Before you jump into a degree program for teaching, think about the pros and cons and how your personality fits to the career. Do you enjoy working with children? Are you passionate about education? Do you feel you can maintain authority over a group of people? Are you patient? These are all questions to think about before beginning the pursuit to become a teacher.


Some other things to think about before becoming a teacher is the salary, job perks, and lifestyle of a teacher. Teachers usually make a mediocre salary with the average pay for the nation between $40k and $50k. If you are looking for a job with a high income, teaching probably isn't for you. Some school districts may pay more than others, but keep in mind you may not make over $60k,.Also, it's good to think about the lifestyle of a teacher. A teacher works from early morning until the afternoon, but many teachers have to take their work home with them. They need to grade tests or papers, or create lesson plans for the coming week, so you'll likely be working more than just an 8 to 4 job. Also, many teachers are involved in their schools' extracurriculars. Some teachers lead organizations like National Honor Society or Student Council. Others help host events or work as coaches. This would require you to work even more hours, so be prepared to work longer hours than you may have planned.;
, There are a wide range of subjects taught in schools, and each subject differs depending on the grade level. Before you pursue a teaching degree, think about the subject you want to teach. Are you interested in teaching advanced math like calculus or statistics? Do you have a passion for literature and writing? Are you really interested in government or history? Thinking about your own passions and what you would enjoy teaching is a good first step.You probably want to teach something that you enjoy. Part of your role as a teacher is to help your students become more interested in or passionate about the information they are learning. If you are teaching a subject you have no interest in, it may be hard for your students to take interest in it as well.
Keep in mind that some subjects are in higher demand. A middle school or high school math or science teacher will be in much higher demand than an English or social studies teacher in most areas. If you already have a certain school district or city in mind, explore the job openings to see where the demand is., As a teacher you can work with children anywhere from age 5 to age 18. Before you pursue a degree, think about the type of students you want to work with. Most education programs and certifications are geared towards a specific subject and age range. You'll have to decide generally if you want to work with little kids, middle schoolers, or high schoolers before you begin your teaching career.Are you passionate about working with little kids and helping them learn to read, write, and do simple math? Do you enjoy having intellectual conversations with older students or are you excited about seeing students take what they have learned and apply it to the real world? There are many questions you must ask yourself before you become a teacher. If you feel working with older children is intimidating, then settling for elementary school might be the best path for you. If you want to work with students who have advanced skills, then you might think about working with high schoolers.
Note that as you progress to older students, your knowledge of the subject you are teaching will probably need to advance as well. Teaching English to third graders will look a lot different than teaching English with seniors. You will likely need to be more knowledgeable in your subject area for higher grade levels, whereas a teacher in elementary school will need to have a well rounded knowledge of all subjects, but will probably not need to be a specialist in every subject.

, Think about the teachers you had in your life that made an impact on you. Try to set up a time to meet with them so you can ask them for advice. Learn about why they wanted to teach, what challenges teaching brings, if they think you would be a good fit, etc. You can meet with newer teachers and retired teachers so you have different perspectives.

, One of the best ways to know if teaching is right for you is by spending time with children. Volunteer to mentor a child through a local program, or get a job working at a day care, day camp, or babysitting. Spending time with children of different ages will give you the best idea if you should teach and what age group you should teach.


There are several different organizations you can go through to volunteer with children. Communities in Schools allows you to mentor, read with, or tutor children from K through 12. Project Sunshine, Red Cross, and American Youth Literacy Foundation are some of the many organizations you can partner with to invest in a child's life., Most schools will require you to have a bachelor's degree in your desired field of teaching in order to teach. Explore different schools you are interested in and check out their course catalogs and what they can offer you in regards to credentials for teachings. Some schools have programs that will place you in a student teaching position after you finish your courses.Your degree will vary on the age group you are teaching. Usually high school teachers obtain degrees in their subject like English, history, government, math, etc. and then go on to complete an educational program. A middle school or elementary teacher will often major in education with a focus on the area they want to teach in.
Once you find a school with a good education or teaching program, sit down with a counselor to further discuss the courses and the benefits this program can bring you. Some schools will incorporate the teaching certification in their undergraduate classes, while others will require you to attend a teaching program post graduation.

, If your undergraduate degree didn't build this into your coursework, you'll need to attend a teaching program so that you can learn the fundamentals of education and teaching. These programs are offered at many universities, some online, and take anywhere from 12 to 24 months. Some states require you to take the first Praxis exam before entering into these programs. You will then take the second Praxis exam once you have completed your program.Praxis I is a basic test to determine if a teacher education program is a good fit for you. It will test you on your reading, math, and writing abilities. Praxis II is geared specifically towards your field of study and is what helps you gain your certification.

, In order to become a teacher, you will need certification in your specific area. If you are teaching a high school subject, you'll need to be certified in that subject. If you are teaching elementary or middle school you'll likely need a certification in your age group and focus such as middle school math and science. Many states administer the Praxis II exam after you go through a teacher education program.The specific requirements for licensure vary state by state. Make sure you research the requirements for the specific state you plan to teach in before you seek certification. Also, keep in mind that some certifications only work in some states. If you are certified in one state, you may not be able to teach in another. However, some states allow you to use your certification from another state to teach in that state. It could be helpful to review all of these requirements even before you obtain your bachelor's.
Check the dates available for the standardized tests required for certification early. The availability of these tests vary widely from state to state. Procrastination could mean waiting a year or more after graduation to secure a teaching job if one or more standardized tests is required to teach in the location of your choice. Most state certification commissions allow the completion of standardized test requirements at any point in a teaching candidate's academic career.

, Almost all states require you to spend time in the classroom as a student teacher before entering as a full time, paid teacher. If you know that you want to teach in a specific school district or city, try to obtain an internship in that school district or one similar so you'll have a better idea what teaching might be like. Your teaching program or undergraduate program will often help you locate a school to student teach in.Keep in mind that these internships are usually unpaid and you will be spending the same amount of time in a classroom as a teacher, meaning a full school day, five days a week. You will often student teach for one class and work with that teacher to prepare lesson plans and learn from the teacher.

, This certification goes beyond your licensure and gives you the opportunity to demonstrate that you have exceptional knowledge in your specific subject field. Gaining this certification has its benefits in that you have greater opportunities for advancement, and many schools will pay you a higher salary and give you compensation for continuing your education.Certification is offered by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. Gaining this certification can also make the ease to higher positions like counselors, administrators, and specialists easier.

, Graduate school isn't usually necessary to become a teacher in a public school (although some schools may require it). However, it provides many benefits. A master's degree may help you stand out amongst other job applicants. It also allows you better mobility, meaning you can go on to become an administrator or reach a higher level at your school. Schools will often pay higher salaries to teachers with master's as well.Before you pursue a master's degree, think about your career ambitions. If you are content with your salary and teaching position you may decide a graduate program isn't worth the work. However, if you have a desire to move up in your school district, whether that is to become a counselor, work as an administrator or principal, or work in curriculum development, you may want to look into a master's degree.
Some school districts will compensate their employees for pursuing further education. Talk with your school district and see what benefits they can offer you.
A master's degree also allows teachers to work at community colleges or teach college level courses at their school in many states. Teaching dual credit courses can also increase your salary.

, The type of school you work in can greatly determine if you have a positive or negative experience. Some school districts have exceptional ratings when it comes to test scores while other schools may be struggling. Figure out what type of school and what students you would be most passionate about, and apply to those schools.


Inner city schools often have more lower income students that may be considered higher risk students. If you have a passion for working with at-risk students and helping them become passionate about education, then you may want to work at one of these schools. These schools are often in more need of teachers, so earning a teaching job may be easier if you go directly to these schools. If you are more interested in working with students that achieve higher test scores, then working in a suburb school may be the place for you. Do some research before applying for jobs and think about where your personality fits the best.Keep in mind that no matter where you work your job will require patience. You will almost always be working with some students who are apathetic about learning, so be prepared to practice patience and perseverance with these students.

, Often times the first year of teaching is a roller coaster ride. You will learn a lot, but you may often be stressed, overwhelmed, or discouraged. Don't feel alone if you experience these things -- many teachers have a hard year the first year that they teach. If you find that you do enjoy what you do, stick with it and as the years go by teaching will become easier for you.In your first few years of teaching you may not get the desired courses that you want to teach. That is because often times the more desired positions are already filled, so you may have to wait until another teacher leaves or is relocated. For example, if you want to teach advance placement classes you may have to teach regular classes for a few years before you get that promotion. However, if you work hard with the classes you are given, the administrators in your school will notice and will feel more confident that you are qualified to move up.

, Teaching is a competitive field, especially in the subjects that are more popular to teach like liberal arts. Because of this, you want your resume to stand out amongst other applicants. A few ways you can make employers take notice of you are:Show a passion for teaching. You can demonstrate this in your objective section of the resume, or in your career summary section. Use this section to communicate your teaching philosophy, your belief about education, and your desire to help students. Make sure you are communicating that you are teaching for the right reasons. Employers want to know that you care about the students at their school.
Credentials: Your credentials should be the first thing employers see. You should list your degrees and any certifications you have at the top of your resume along with your GPA. Because this will be the first thing employers see, you want to present yourself well and show that you are accomplished and educated.
Use key words: Employers may be looking for certain words throughout your resume that are industry specific. Because employers usually get a lot of resumes, they will be scanning many of them and these key words will help your resume grab their attention. Some key words to use in the education field are: teaching and learning, curriculum planning, peer tutoring, peer mentoring, teacher-parent relations, special needs students, ESL/ESOL students, technology integration, classroom management, student involvement, interdisciplinary teaching approaches, K-12, etc.
Accomplishments and related jobs: This is really what will make you stand out from other resumes, because everyone will likely be applying with a similar bachelor's degree, but not everyone will have job related experience. Think about the accomplishments you have made throughout college that are related to teaching, leading, working with students, etc. and find a way to incorporate those into your resume through the related experience section or in your activities section. Think about the qualities that would make someone a good teacher, or the experience that could help them in teaching. Then, think about what things you have done that you can include in your resume to make you well equipped to become a teacher.
Look up sample resumes. If you are still stumped as to how to boost your resume, there are always tons of resources online that give example resumes in specific subject matters. You can use these as references or a guideline for how to boost your resume.

, You can often find teaching jobs listed on a school's website on their job's or career's page. There are also websites online that allow you to search the entire nation for teaching positions. You can also visit career fairs at universities to learn about the schools hiring in your area. This gives you an opportunity to meet some of the employers, which may give you an advantage when you send in your resume.Be flexible when applying for jobs. As previously stated, often times in your first year or two of teaching you won't get your dream teaching job. If you are willing to take a job that may not be exactly what you are looking for, though, you'll have a better time at finding a job. At the very least you'll be able to gain more teaching experience that will boost your resume so that when you apply for later jobs you have something to show them than just the education you obtained.
If you are called in for an interview, be prepared to ask questions and show your knowledge. Do research on the specific school district and school before going into the interview. You want to show the employer that you know your stuff and that you really want to work at their school. Have some questions on hand to ask about the work atmosphere at the school as well as personal questions you may ask your employer about why they enjoy working at their school. Avoid asking questions that you could have found the answers to online.

, Many times employers will ask for references from previous employers, professors, and then someone else that is not related to you. Before you apply for jobs, think about the people in your life who know you well enough to put in a good word for you. Choose a professor who made an impact in your specific subject area and an employer that worked with you closely and knows your work ethic. Then, compile this list so that you have it available if a school asks for it.Some people choose to put their references on their resume, but this can take up needed space. Often times employers will ask separately for references, so it's better to have a separate document with your references instead of adding them to the end of your resume.

, If the job hunt is proving difficult for you and you haven't been able to find a full time teaching position, apply to be a sub at different school districts. It's good to apply to several schools because you'll have a better chance of gaining work.


Although it may not be your ideal job, subbing will give you the opportunity to earn some teaching experience, is flexible, and will help you get to know the school or schools you are interested in working at as well as the administration.
You also have an advantage over many people who are substitutes because you have your teaching certification. While some schools require certification, others don't, but may be more willing to hire a substitute who has an educational background.

, Teach for America is an option that is an alternative to directly applying for positions in a school. TFA is an organization that places students passionate about learning in a low income school district and gives them the opportunity to teach for a year. To apply for this program you won't need a teaching certification, but you will need a bachelor's degree.You will apply to the program through the TFA website, and will be taken through a several part interview process. At the final stage of the interview you will prepare a fake lesson to give in front of some of the staff for Teach for America. You will also have the opportunity to choose the top cities you would like to teach in as well as your preferred subjects and grades you would like to teach. If hired, you will then be placed in one of those cities to begin teaching.
While TFA is a great way to gain teaching experience, it is not for everyone because often times you won't receive much training beforehand, and for someone who didn't go through the teacher education program, you might be a little lost. Depending on the school district, you may receive adequate help from other faculty, or you may have to navigate most things yourself.

, The Peace Corps gives you the opportunity to teach in another country, usually in areas where you will be very immersed in the culture. This organization allows you to enter as a ""Volunteer,"" which means you aren't making a salary, but you will be given a housing and living stipend as well as paid transportation.Peace Corps openings can be found on their website, in a number of different fields, and a minimum of a bachelor's degree with some teaching or tutoring experience is usually required.
With the Peace Corps you will be placed with a host family or in a dwelling determined by the local host organization. You will be asked to adhere to cultural norms, as the Peace Corps is also an opportunity for your to learn about different cultures and respect the differences between your country and the one you visit.
The benefit of the Peace Corps is it gives you teaching experience, but also offers entry into unique graduate school opportunities as well as the option to forgive or defer certain public loans., As a teacher, it's important to stay up to date on the new technologies or techniques used in the class room. You can attend different training or workshops to learn more about your specific field or new advancements in teaching. Different states also require you to participate in professional development to maintain or renew your license. Visit or contact your state's agency to learn about the education requirements for your state. After teaching for a while you may also decide a master's and/or PhD is something that can help advance your career."

Teachers who commit to staying in their position for at least two years often succeed at building relationships with their students and with the community., Out of state teachers can find it challenging to teach students from Alaska Native villages, as they are not well acquainted with the language and culture of the Native population. The state is currently trying to train and hire more local teachers, but this also means the opportunities are there for out of state teachers. As an out of state teacher, if is important that you make an effort to learn more about the Native population in Alaska, as this will help you to connect with many of your Native students.


You can do this by reading up on the history of the Native people in Alaska and by making an effort to meet community leaders in the Native population. Be open to learning more about their customs and their culture, as this will then allow you to better integrate into the community.

Browse employment notices.",How to Choose a Subject to Teach," Chances are, whatever subject interested you then will be just as fun to teach. Whatever subjects bored you are probably poor choices for you to consider teaching.


Which subjects did you have good grades in?
What subjects did you have memorable projects in?
Do you remember your most inspiring teachers? What did they teach?;
, When you’re not working or not in school, what you do for leisure is a good indication of what you might want to teach. Consider the following:


Do you build or fix things for fun? Think about science or something similar.
Do you read about history or visit historical sites around your community? Consider being a history or social studies teacher.
Do you read fiction and other types of literature? You might consider a career as an English teacher., While general interests and curiosity are important when it comes to teaching, you need to consider what you’re the best at. Whatever subjects you excel at the most will likely be the ones in which you’ll be able to offer the most to students. Consider the following:


If you are a natural writer, you might teach language arts.
If intrigued by the historical perspective on social issues, you might teach history or social studies.
If you enjoy working with numbers and problem solving, think about math or science., Those who know the most about teaching, both grade levels and subject areas, are teachers who have taught a long time.


A science teacher might enlighten you on the challenges and joys of teaching the subject.
A language arts teacher in a college can share the struggles of adults in a remedial language arts class and strategies used to accelerate learning.
An experienced middle school social studies teacher might direct you toward teaching high school or college depending on your interests.
You might gain valuable contacts for later in your teaching career., Watching teachers and learners in the classroom is one of the best ways to determine a subject and age group to teach. You'll also be able to observe how specific subjects are taught at specific grade levels.


You might find that you possess the enthusiasm and energy of preschool teachers or thrive on the difficult questions asked by high-achieving college students.
You might also find that you enjoy one subject better than another.
You might learn that being a middle school social studies teacher is drastically different than you originally thought., If you already have an associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree, chances are you’re qualified to be a substitute teacher for K-12 in many school districts. Spending some time as a substitute teacher will enable you to take command of classrooms for the entire spectrum of grade levels. If you’re able to have such an opportunity, you’ll be much more equipped to decide what grade level and, relatedly, what subjects you want to teach., Ask permission to visit one class each day for a week to observe progress across a longer duration. Visit all grade levels to gain a comprehensive view of the needs of each age group. You'll not only learn about different age groups, but you'll see how different subjects are taught to them.

, As anyone who has graduated from the K-12 experience can tell you, different age groups study different parts of subject areas in math, science, English, and other subjects. If you're committed to a certain subfield of your specialty, you need to consider what age group is appropriate for that area.


Prospective science teachers need to consider whether they want to teach general science or a subfields like chemistry, physics, or astronomy. These subfields are usually reserved for high school and college.
Prospective math teachers need to consider whether they want to teach basic arithmetic or a subfield like algebra, geometry, or calculus. These subfields are usually reserved for middle school and above.
Prospective English teachers need to consider whether they want to focus on basic principles like grammar or if they'd prefer to focus on literature. In many districts, teachers won't really be able to focus on literature until at least middle school, and will have to wear many hats as an English teacher. So make sure to do your homework before deciding., Teaching elementary students will largely influence the type of material and the type of teaching you’ll be engaging in. Teaching elementary students offers various rewards and challenges that other age groups do not and will greatly influence how you approach subject matter. If you pick teaching at the elementary level, you'll be working with young children, so you’ll need to be geared toward handling age-related issues.


Working with elementary students often requires teaching numerous subjects, so depending on age level, you may not be able to focus on just one subject area.
If you enjoy working with young children and are equally knowledgeable about the fundamentals of math, reading and writing, grade school teaching may be for you.
If you are interested in focusing on basic concepts, elementary teaching might be right for you.
If you are interested in being part of a more nurturing environment and helping students transition to a new environment, elementary teaching might be right for you., Middle school is really the “middle” ground between elementary and high school. This is the best of both worlds if you want to provide a more nurturing environment, but also want to focus more on a specific subject area.


As a middle school teacher, you’ll be able to focus much more on a specific subject area, but you’ll still also be dealing with a lot of nurturing and behavior supervision.
Your students might be a little more unpredictable than high school students, as many will begin going through puberty.
Students will begin to seem more like adults, but will still need more individualized attention like elementary students., High school students are, of course, the most like adults. But teaching high school students also comes with a unique set of problems and opportunities. Consider the following:


You’ll be able to teach much more complex concepts.
Behavior issues could offer more challenges, as students are almost adults.
Students will need less individualized attention, but will still demand a high level of supervision.
Although your students will be older, you’ll still have to deal with parents and special needs., Teaching college age students is drastically different than many of the other types of teaching. Students are now considered adults, and as a result, your role as a teacher will be much different. As an “instructor” or “professor” you are an advisor, mentor, and a purveyor of knowledge. Consider the following:


You’ll focus on complex subject concepts.
You’ll seldom have to worry about behavior problems.
You’ll have little to no interaction with parents or guardians., Your geographical location is extremely important in understanding employment opportunities. Depending on a variety of factors, certain areas might have a deficit or surplus of teachers in certain subject areas. Depending on other factors, it might be very difficult to secure employment in any subject area.

, If concerned about employment prospects, researching the job market in advance will assist in making a sound decision. The school districts near you may be in need of math teachers or bilingual educators. Choosing to become trained in multiple topics or training extensively in one academic subject are potential outcomes of a job market search.


Some districts provide money for their teachers toward training in critically needed areas.
Some districts and states will assist you in paying off your students loans if you're in a critically needed subject area.
There are some programs, like Teach for America, that will help train and place you in areas where teachers are needed in certain subject areas., You need to be aware of any requirements for employment ahead of time. Visit your district's website or call their main office, and they'll be able to provide you with a list of requirements. You may be required to:


Complete a particular type of degree, based on the subject or age level you might teach.
Gain teaching experience.
Take specific subject area exams to become certified in your topic of choice.
Requirements vary greatly depending on your state., After pinpointing a subject and grade level, consider the degree(s) you will need to teach the subject. This might vary on the state or municipality you live in.


Elementary teachers need a bachelor’s in education from an accredited teacher preparation program.
Middle school teachers might need a bachelor's in education from an accredited teacher preparation program.
High school teachers might not need an education degree, but are often required to have a minor in education and have been enrolled in a teacher preparation program.
College professors need at least a master’s degree, and depending on the subject, might need a doctorate to be competitive.
Read the list of courses you must take to satisfy the degree, along with the course descriptions, to be sure that the topics hold your interest., Browsing district employment pages or other websites will give you a very good idea of what subject areas might provide the most opportunity for you in any given area. Take a little time to acquaint yourself with the demand side of the equation before you make any decision.


Take a look at school district websites to see what subject areas are in demand and if there are any incentives for teachers in certain subject areas.
Browse internet job websites to see if private schools are hiring certain subject areas more than others.
Consider contacting independent school placement firms to see if they can give you an idea about what schools are looking for in terms of subject area teachers at any given time."

It may be somewhere you have always wanted to visit, or one that you know well and want to settle in for a while whilst earning a living, or possibly because it presents a challenge.


Whatever your chosen country, and whatever your reason for going there, you will find receptive pupils who are wiling to learn and who will be grateful to you for teaching them English. It is no exaggeration to say that most of them will remember you for the rest of their lives. Thailand remains the world's most popular TEFL course destinations.;
, You can find cheap flights online or try one of the many student travel agencies. Book a room for one night then you can negotiate a good monthly rate once you have arrived and are happy with the room. Don't go for the cheapest. Quality, security and comfort are more important than the price. Air Asia is a good reliable budget airline for the region..


Find out if your chosen country requires a visa, travel on a tourist visa. When you find a job, your employer should be able to arrange a work permit.

, Put together a professional resume or curriculum vitae before leaving. Save a copy in your iPod, or Gmail, Hotmail email folder.


Don't Forget:

Your TEFL Certificate
College diploma/degree if you have one
Any other relevant certificates
A summary note which emphasizes any teaching or training experience you may have, lists everything you have learned on your TEFL course
Your references

Most employers will ask for references. Arrange these before departing. Former employers, teaching colleagues and co-workers make the best references. Ask each to write a brief letter which recommends you as a teacher. Ask them to leave the letter undated - so that you can use it for a long time into the future. But each letter should include an address, phone number and email address for the person writing your reference.
If you do not have any relevant teaching experience, ask your TEFL trainer to write a reference about the skills you have learned.
Take at least two paper copies of all this with you with you in a protective case. Where possible, save everything in your email account and keep a back up copy in your email folder or on your iPod/Phone.





, Your employers may well be more impressed at an interview by your appearance than your qualifications. Dress like you would for a job interview at home.


For men, this means a shirt & tie, dark pressed trousers and polished shoes. For women, long dark skirt, white blouse and covered shoulders. Go easy on jewelry.
Earrings are normally considered acceptable for women, but nose and other visible body piercings (for both sexes) are generally seen as setting a bad example to the students and should be removed.

, If possible, ask your hotel to pick you up at the airport. Alternatively you should book a taxi from the taxi desk inside the airport arrival hall. You might pay a bit more, but it is safer and less troublesome. On the first day in a new country, this can really help to set you on your way. It's best not search for jobs on your first day. Take a stroll, and let your body and mind adjust to the new environment.


Unpack your interview clothes. If they are wrinkled, find a laundry service to have them ironed(your hotel or guest house should be able to help). Once ironed, hang up your clothes. Polish your shoes and prepare your resume. Finally, have a beer, or other drink, and relax.

, Prospective employers will want to call you. Asking them to leave a message at a hotel or guest house is unreliable and the employers will not be impressed. It is best to get a mobile phone with a local number. Mobile phones in most places are cheap and easy to find. Before leaving the shop, ask the staff to switch your language options to English.

, There are three basic methods you can use (though these are not the only ones)


Internet Search - Go to EnglishJobLinks.com and apply for any jobs that sound promising. Email a cover letter and your resume (from your email account) to each employer. It may be better to paste the resume into the body of the email rather than attach it as a file (many schools will not open attachments). Send one personalized every email address they could get their hands on.

TIP: Call first and get the head teacher's or school director's name. Have a quick chat with them before sending your resume. Then follow up with another phone call. In the cover letter, tell the school that you are currently in the country and are interested in a position immediately



,


Buy the local newspaper(s)

Go to a newsagent (or coffee shop) and look through any English language or local newspapers. Sit down and scan the classifieds. These always contain advertisements for English teachers. Circle them and immediately call those that list phone numbers. Mention that you meet their requirements and that you are interested in a position. Arrange an interview. Email any contacts that could not be contacted by phone.
Beware of unscrupulous agency ads, which are usually easy to spot by their vague offers.


Walk In

This can often be the most effective way of finding a teaching job. Spend a day or two visiting local private language schools. Put on your best business clothes, gather a stack of resumes, TEFL certificate copies, and reference letters. Almost all schools will ask for a recent photo when you apply, so make sure you have a supply of 12 or more.
Compile a list of 4 to 6 schools and visit them. In my experience, this is the most effective way of job searching and it helps you to get comfortable talking to employers. When visiting schools, greet the receptionist, ask to talk to someone about a teaching position and hand the ma resume.
Always Smile and show enthusiasm. You may get an interview, and a job offer, on the spot. This happens more often than you would ever believe! But do not be discouraged if nothing happens right away. Walking into a school will help you grow more comfortable talking to employers.



, When being interviewed, always dress smartly, but conservatively - even if you are applying for a temporary or casual post. In fact, dress like a Sales Executive. After all you are selling yourself!
Smart appearance is especially important in Thailand and Asia, where many employers will often judge you by your appearance, smile, and enthusiasm above qualifications or work experience.
If you arrive at the interview wearing jeans, sandals and a low cut top, or you look like you just fallen out of bed, you simply will not get the job. So make sure you get a good night's sleep the night before and dress appropriately.

,


But do not automatically accept the first job you are offered. Examine the contract carefully.
Ask questions:
How many hours a week will you teach? 45 hours is a normal week but over 25 actual teaching hours is too much.
Will they sponsor a work visa? They should!
Will they help you find an apartment? They should.
How much do they pay?
Insist that the school provides you with further training on their teaching methods and some peer observations. If possible, talk to other teachers at the school and confirm that they retreated well and paid on time. Sign the contract when you are satisfied - but only when you are satisfied.

,


Congratulations. You will be teaching English to grateful pupils in a fascinating country - as well as embarking on a fulfilling and life changing experience.

, Teaching online is more challenging than delivering in person lectures. Technological devises are not foolproof. Practice online teaching sessions with mentors who can provide honest feedback and hone your skills.

, Enroll in an online teaching certification program. Although, all tutoring agencies do not specify for teacher certifications, it is better to hold one to prove your competency in a subject.

Divide the cell.",How to Do the Mitosis Dance," Before beginning this activity, discuss it with your students so they know what to expect. This activity is a fun and exciting way to represent the process of cell division called mitosis. By representing the different parts of the cell, students will hopefully have a firmer grasp of how each phase proceeds.Some of the students will need to hold hands with other students. If you know some of your students are uncomfortable with this, have the students stand close to each other instead of holding hands.;
, If you assign the roles the day before, you can tell the students to wear a specific colored shirt based on what part of the cell they are. Have the plasma membrane wear black, the nuclear membrane wear white, the centrioles wear red/orange/yellow, and the chromatin/chromosomes wear blue. You will need the following number of students for each role:Chromatin/chromosomes: You need an even number to represent the chromosomes. You can have as few as 2 or as many as 8, but 4 or 6 students would be best.
Nuclear membrane: You need enough students to make a small circle around the “chromosomes.” If you only have 2 student chromosomes, you will only need 4 or 5 students to make a nucleus. The more chromosomes, the larger the nuclear membrane.
Centrioles: You need four students, in pairs of two, to represent the centrioles of the cell.
Plasma membrane: remaining students (at least 10). You want to make a large plasma membrane with the remaining students.

, You need a lot of space to perform the mitosis dance. If the weather is nice, doing it outside is a great idea. If it’s raining, the gymnasium is a great option. If you’re limited to your classroom, push all the desks against the wall so you have an open space in the middle of the room.Consider making this a performance for the rest of the school and present it to everyone.

, Students representing the nuclear membrane should form a circle around the chromatin and link hands.This circle represents the nucleus of the cell which contains the genetic information needed to reproduce a cell (DNA).

, The students representing the plasma membrane should form a larger circle containing the nucleus. Instruct the students to hold hands to make a strong plasma membrane.Pairs of students representing the centrioles should be inside the plasma membrane but outside the nucleus. Have both pairs stand near each other on one side of the cell.

, You can choose any music that you would like. Anything fast-paced that the students will want to dance to is a good option. Start with everyone swaying back and forth. This first part represents “interphase” which is the phase before the cell starts dividing.The nuclear membrane is fully intact and the genetic material is still in an uncondensed chromatin form.

, This is the first official phase of mitosis, prophase. Chromatin condenses into chromosomes so have the students inside the nucleus need to pair up and hold hands. The nuclear membrane begins to dissolve so have those students leave the cell.Centriole pairs should begin to migrate to opposite ends of the cell. One pair should be on one side and the other pair should be directly opposite them.
Tell everyone to keep dancing around while they move around the cell.

, The next phase of cell division is called metaphase. This is the phase where the chromosomes line up on the “equator” of the cell and prepare to be separated from each other.Chromosomes should move towards the equator of the cell and grab hold of your partner with both hands. Stand facing each other and continue dancing with each other.
The centriole pairs should be on the “north” and “south pole” of the cell with the chromosomes in between them.

, The next step is anaphase, where the chromosomes get pulled apart. These separated chromosomes will serve as the genetic material for each new cell. Have the chromosomes let go of their partners and wave goodbye.The plasma membrane people should start stretching out the circle into an oval in the direction of the centrioles pairs.

, The last phase of mitosis is called telophase. Telophase is when the plasma membrane forms a peanut shape and the nucleus reforms. Tell the plasma membrane to form a peanut shape by cinching together in the middle of the cell.The nuclear membrane students should form a new nucleus in each new cell.
The centriole pairs can let go of each other and become the new centrioles of each cell.
The chromosomes can let go of each other and become the less dense chromatin again.

, To divide the cell have the plasma membrane people in the center of the circle let go of each other’s hands and reattach with someone in the new cell. You should now have two separate cells with two separate nuclei and chromatin.This final step is called cytokinesis.

Research your options.,
Consider your credentials.,
Compare opportunities to ensure you're maximizing your earning potential.,
Consider obtaining an online teaching certificate.",How to Earn by Teaching Online1," Traditional brick-and-mortar universities, nonprofit online universities, and for-profit institutions all offer online course content. Determine which institutions offer teaching opportunities relevant to your field of expertise.


Remember that many colleges and universities now offer multiple educational tracks. Research opportunities in ""traditional"" subject-area departments, but also remember to look for adult degree completion programs and other special instructional tracks. Programs geared toward working adults are more likely to involve online course offerings.;
, Most online college instructors are part-time adjuncts. Typically, you'll need to hold a master's degree in your field of expertise. While full-time online teaching positions are uncommon, those that do exist often require applicants to hold a doctorate or have significant experience in high-demand career areas such as healthcare or accounting. Determine whether you meet basic requirements prior to applying for a position.

, The pay range for online courses varies. While most institutions pay adjunct instructors per course, occasionally you'll find an institution that pays a ""per head"" fee, or even one that holds instructors accountable for students completing the course.


Instructional terms fluctuate wildly from institution to institution. Pay careful attention to length of term when comparing your opportunities. For standard per-course pay, divide total compensation by the number of weeks you'll be teaching so you can better compare pay rates among institutions.
Assess how many students you feel comfortable teaching at one time. Note the structure and expectations of each course; grading 20 essays is considerably more time-consuming than grading 20 multiple-choice exams.
Note whether instruction will be asynchronous (not dependent upon your presence during a certain time slot) or synchronous (in real time).
Many schools limit the number of courses or credit hours an instructor can teach at any one time. Consider teaching at more than one school simultaneously if you wish to ""override"" this limit.
Some online programs use an established curriculum, while others require you to develop your own course content. If you are required to develop your own course, you should be paid more than if you are asked only to teach. Understand what rights you're giving to the institution if you do write and develop a course. Often the institution will then retain rights to the finished course.
Note which online platform the institution uses. Are you already familiar with the software, or will you require training? Some colleges require you to attend unpaid training sessions if you need to learn new software. Limiting your teaching load to colleges using the same online platform may save you time and resources., Some schools of education now offer Master Online Teacher (MOT) certificates signifying your expertise in online instruction. Community colleges and four-year universities offering online instruction often partner with these institutions for MOT training. An MOT certification may help you establish your credentials as an online educator.Note that MOT certificates may also be useful for high school instructors.

Apply to teach at a virtual school.,
Sell lesson plans or other classroom materials.,
Write and edit educational content.",How to Earn by Teaching Online2," Many states and localities now offer public online instructional services. You may also find opportunities through charter schools and private educational institutions. Certification requirements for virtual teachers are typically equivalent to requirements at their brick-and-mortar counterparts, whether public or private.


Online teachers are generally required to be certified in the state where they are teaching, so note where job postings are located even in situations where you'll be able to work from home.Consider Master Online Teacher (MOT) certification to improve your credentials as an online educator., K-12 educators are increasingly eliminating the ""middle man"" of learning-supply retailers by offering lesson plans and other classroom teaching materials for sale through online marketplaces.Teachers who create this curriculum earn money from their work, and teachers buying the materials often benefit from lower prices.


Familiarize yourself with your district's ethics policies before posting material for sale. Some districts have enacted policies preventing teachers from selling materials developed on district time.

, Assessment institutions (ACT, the College Board) and educational service providers are in continual need of material ranging from assessments to study guides and test preparation materials."

Offer foreign language instruction.",How to Earn by Teaching Online3," Platforms such as Udemy offer models that allow you to post your own course content and then keep a significant percentage of revenues. Professional credentials are not required -- but to create a useful course, you'll need to have expertise in your chosen field.

#*Consider where you have marketable expertise. Instruction in high-demand skills such as Web development or corporate communication can be especially lucrative, but well-designed courses in subjects ranging from animation to yoga have performed well.

Plan to put significant time and effort into creating a good course. One successful Web development instructor, for example, created over 220 video lectures for a single course.Maintain realistic expectations. While stories proliferate of instructors receiving $400,000 or more for a course, most instructors who post content on Web-based teaching platforms can expect earnings in the four-figure range., English as a Second Language (ESL) instruction is in consistently high demand. Many freelance English teachers take advantage of Skype to offer one-on-one English instruction. Others use virtual classroom software to reach larger audiences.


ESL curriculum is widely available online if you'd prefer not to develop your own lessons.
Network with other English language instructors. Developing these connections enables you to benefit from others' support and wisdom.
Maintain a dynamic online presence to ensure those in need of English instruction can find you.
If you prefer to work for a larger English-language instruction service, perform an online search for reputable companies. Compare pay rates to ensure you aren't accepting substandard pay from an unprofessional institution., Search online for tutoring companies in need of employees with your expertise, or consider freelance tutoring via tools such as Skype. See How to Tutor Online for more detailed advice.


You may also consider using a Web-based teaching platform to develop your own larger-scale tutoring service. While you'll need to develop your own content, you will keep a larger percentage of profits.If you are a talented musician or a visual or performing artist, consider using a patron-funded sharing site to post online tutorials. Companies such as Patreon offer a platform for artists to share their material with ""patrons."" Patrons fund these artists' creative efforts in exchange for enjoying the artists' content. , Consider freelancing via Skype, developing your own tutoring service via a Web-based teaching platform, or signing on with one of the many companies offering foreign language training online.


Consider how you might tailor your services. If you have worked in financial services, for example, and are fluent in Mandarin Chinese, consider targeting your advertising to individuals and businesses in the financial services industry who are seeking Mandarin language instruction. If you have a background in agriculture and speak Spanish, offer language lessons for farmers seeking better communication with their workers.

",How to Develop a Mentoring Program," It sounds ridiculous, but this prepares your brain for planning.;
, you may start by writing down the goals or thoughts you have for the mentoring programme. Make sure you identify the group you would like to mentor, i.e. over 50's, single parents etc. What do you want to / feel comfortable mentoring others on? When would you like to start and where would the meetings take place? How often should it be? How many people would be involved? Would you need to get other people to help you? And at what stage would this help be required? Who would fund it? (You would have some costs including rent of space used, refreshments, pc/internet rental, phone bill, other equipment depending on your target group.

, do you have friends, neighbours or colleagues that share the same vision? Why don't you share your vision with a few other responsible members of your interest groups? These may form your core group. Do they need to be checked at the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) in the UK or the relevant local police authority where you are? If working with vulnerable mentees, the disabled, children and senior citizens, protect your clients and your program by obtaining all required credentials.

Ask if students have questions.,
Set guidelines on participation.,
Incorporate participation into final grades.,
Cold-call on students.",How to Encourage Class Participation1," In many cases, students may not feel comfortable talking or asking questions. They may be concerned about not appearing smart in front of you or classmates. By directly asking students if they have any questions or coming with prepared questions, you can stimulate more participation in class.Take breaks to ask short questions every few minutes. This can keep students engaged and ensure they understand the material. For example, you could ask: “Does anyone have any questions about why the invasion of Pearl Harbor was so important in American History?”
Have a couple of questions prepared in advance in case students still seem reluctant to answer or participate. For example, if nobody is asking questions, you could say: “One questions I always get about the invasion of Pearl Harbor is whether President Roosevelt baited the Japanese to attack. Historians have used archival sources and oral histories to show that it wasn’t the case. What have you have heard about this story before?”;
, You may not always be able to get a class to participate. In these cases, it can be useful to have guidelines for how much you expect students to participate. Remind students as needed that you expect them to speak up during class, which can help relax the environment and may get even more students to participate.#*Outline your participation expectations in writing, especially with older students. For example, “I expect you to make at least two substantive comments per class,” or “All of you know I expect you to join in the discussion. Why am I the only one talking today?”, Students often take participation and other assignments more seriously if they factor into final grades. Depending on the age of your students and the subject and type of class you’re teaching, incorporate participation into your students’ final grades. This may encourage more participation.Make sure the participation grade fits the age and work. For example, you can easily make participation 30% of the final grade for a college-level seminar. However, for a high school class, it may only be 5-10%.
Inform students that participation counts towards their final grades and ensure they know how much it is worth.

, When all else fails, you can simply call on students to speak. This is called “cold-calling.” It can encourage participation by getting students to speak before they are singled out to talk by you.Consider calling on two students at once. They may be more comfortable and able to come up with an answer that if you only call on one.

Welcome everyone warmly.,
Draw on your comedic side.,
Tell a funny story.,
Praise students.",How to Encourage Class Participation2," Kindness is something everyone likes. It can also help put people at ease, which in turn can encourage participation. Before each class take the time to welcome your students warmly. This shows you care and are ready to enjoy any ways they may participate.Greet your students individually by name if you can as well as an entire class. For example, “Hi Mara, it’s lovely to see you today. Are you having a good day so far?” or, “Hello hello class! It’s great to see everyone today and I’m really looking forward to this lessons. It’ll be a lot of fun.”

, Humor is a great ice breaker. It can help foster feelings of comfort and help students relax. This can encourage your students to share their own comedic side, which in turn may stimulate further participation from others.Keep the comedy appropriate to the age of your students. For smaller children, keep it simple and something each student can enjoy. Use can use more sophisticated material with older students. For example, with first graders you could say, “Wait. What did you say Frankie? There’s something on my head? What it is it? Is it a frog? No, it’s a hat!” Try, “Who remembers why the Dark Ages are called dark? And it’s not just because there was no indoor plumbing” with older students.

, If you notice the energy is your class is waning or the students are not particularly interested in material you’re covering, tell a funny story related to the material. This can easily reinvigorate energy in a classroom.For example, you could say: “Hey guys, let me take a second here while we’re discussing the French Revolution to tell you a little bit more “juicy information” about it. How many of you know that it wasn’t Marie Antoinette who said, “Let them eat cake?”

, Everyone likes to know they have done something well. Praise helps people relax and makes them happy. A well-placed, “Good job!” can go far to encourage all of your students to participate in class, even if they are wrong.Use simple praise, which everyone can understand. For example, you can say: “That’s a great point, Elisabeth!”
Remember that it often takes a lot of courage for an individual to speak up. Many people even get so nervous of making a mistake that they may not speak. You can help them—and others—feel comfortable with praise for speaking up. For example, “Not quite, Rebecca, but you’re on to the answer I’m looking for.”Take the opportunity to offer praise even after class, which may encourage more participation. For example, “You did a nice job in class today, Kate. I’d love to hear you speak up more often. Your comments always add a lot to our discussions.”

"
"
Respect all points of view.,
Exercise discretion with problematic comments.,
Limit students who talk too much.",How to Encourage Class Participation3," A fundamental in any classroom is respect. Not every student will agree with you and/or their classmates. Part of any learning experience is understanding that there are many points of view and respecting them. Showing your students respect for their points of view can not only encourage everyone to participate, but also teaches them how to respect others.Remind students that your classroom is an open and safe space to express their opinions. Some students may be shy, but by showing that you will listen to every student’s point of view, you can help stimulate further participation. For example, you might say: “We’re about to talk about the US decision to invade Iraq in 2003. This is a very controversial topic and everyone in this classroom has their own views on the matter. Please be respectful of everyone’s comments and feelings.”
Acknowledge students with different perspectives. For example, you might say: “That’s an interesting point of view, James. Based on what I know, I see it a little differently. Would anyone else like to add something to our comments or the discussion?”, Use caution when telling a student they are wrong about something. Keeping in mind that a student’s background and lack of experience may inform their position. It’s your job to acknowledge this and then expand their mind.Make sure you give a student time to speak without interruption. This can prevent you from making incorrect assumptions about what the student is saying.
Deal with offensive or problematic comments quickly. For example, respond to a comment such as, “The Jews in Germany took all of the jobs in medicine, law, and the media” with, “Actually, Sam, the Jewish population of Germany in 1933 wasn’t very large. It was less than 1%. They couldn’t have taken all of the jobs by a long shot.”, Many classrooms have one or two students who also volunteer to speak or will simply offer comments without prompting. This can intimidate the students’ fellow classmates and keep them from speaking. Limiting how often students who tend to over-participate speak can encourage their classmates to speak up more.

Ask students to raise their hands if they want to speak. This can ensure that everyone gets a chance to participate in class even if one or two students seemingly always have an answer. You could also give students 5-6 paperclips to use as “comments” per class.
Tell a student who is talking too much to give others a chance. For example, “Carter, can you hold on a second please. Hannah had her hand up before you and you’ve already had a chance to speak a lot today.”

Talk to your students about your own background and experiences.,
Have students introduce themselves interactively.,
Address students with the name they prefer.,
Get diversity-enhancing lesson plans online.,
Include students whose first language is not English.",How to Create a Culturally Diverse Classroom1," A good way to encourage open and honest discussions about diversity is by addressing it directly. Near the beginning of your time with a new class, tell them about yourself, your history, and your teaching style. Mention where you came from, any experience you have teaching people from different walks of life, and the way that your teaching methods are guided by an interest in recognizing and respecting diversity.Be explicit. Say something like, “As your teacher, I am committed to better understanding the cultural differences between everyone in this classroom. Most importantly, I want you all to know that I respect and value your culture, and diversity is something that everyone should feel free to discuss throughout our time together."";
, Introductions can generally be a great opportunity to emphasize and celebrate diversity. For instance, when your students first take turns stating their name to the class, have them share a bit about the origin of their name. Direct your students with something like, “After sharing your name with us, also tell us a bit about how your parents chose the name and what it means.”Other good introductory activities include having students mark their birthplace on a map, share a photo of their family, or write one of the most common words they use on the board. For instance, you could start by writing “hello” on the board - and be sure to include translations into other languages that your students may speak.
With older students, ask everyone to include something about their family that they're proud of during introductions.

, Ask your students what name they prefer to go by. This conversation is best had one-on-one, as students will likely feel more comfortable correcting any potential mispronunciation. Then, use their chosen name to address them, both one-on-one and in front of the class.Remembering, using, and pronouncing names is an important way to demonstrate cultural awareness.
Take care not to use language about names that implies a certain ethnocentric approach is best. For example, don’t ask people about their “Christian name,” simply ask your students how they prefer to be addressed.

, The Southern Poverty Law Center hosts a project called Teaching Tolerance that provides free classroom resources online. Resources include both activities and lesson plans for students of all ages. Similarly, other websites also provide lesson plans that incorporate discussions on multiculturalism and diversity., Their are free online resources that are designed to help educators equitably include students who may have a first language other than English. More specifically, these include teaching materials and contemporary publications on the topic.One particular example is the Teaching Diverse Learners (TDL) website.
In particular, familiarize yourself with the challenges that those still learning English at the elementary level may face in the classroom, as well as the ways you can help facilitate oral, reading and writing development.

"
"
Acknowledge your own bias.,
State your high expectations to the class.,
Familiarize yourself with your students and their culture(s).",How to Create a Culturally Diverse Classroom2," People’s outlooks and attitudes are influenced by the culture in which they grow up. This is an all but inevitable aspect of human psychology. However, this does not prevent you from being able to facilitate a diverse and inclusive environment in your classroom.If you’re students have different socioeconomic or racial backgrounds than you do, for instance, remind yourself that you may need to be sensitive to the fact that their attitudes and outlooks will likely differ from your own.
Say something along the lines of, ""Some of us hold different beliefs and have different lifestyles than others in this room. That's entirely okay - and in fact, it means we can learn from one another. The important thing is that we always listen to one another with an open mind and a positive attitude.""

, One of the most important components of an inclusive learning environment for younger children is your belief as an educator that all of your students are capable of success. In order to convey your belief in your students to them, articulate these beliefs specifically.Sometime early on in your time with a new class, say something along the lines of, “I know that each and every one of you is capable of learning what we will be going over together, and expect each of you to succeed.”

, If you will be teaching students from a culture you are unfamiliar with, it’s important to learn as much as you can about commonly held beliefs and ways of living in their communities. There are many ways to do so.


Aside from reading and other forms of research, talk to other teachers and educators in your area about resources and opportunities to increase your knowledge of the local community.
Especially if your students are older, try to participate in the community in which you teach by attending events outside of the school that they are involved in.
Helpful publications include Gloria Ladson-Billings’ The Dream Keepers: Successful Teachers of African American Children and Crossing Over to Canaan: The Journey of New Teachers in Diverse Classrooms, Jacqueline Jordan Irvine’s Educating Teachers for Diversity and Culturally Responsive Teaching, and Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed."
"
Be patient but firm about cultural misunderstandings.,
Include diverse images in the classroom.,
Establish specific rules for respect and inclusion in the classroom.,
Bring the fight for progress into the classroom.",How to Create a Culturally Diverse Classroom3," If your students are from multiple cultures, there will likely conflict between students about the different ways they may see the world. Being aware of this can help you recognize and minimize these conflicts.Some students, unfortunately, will learn racism or other types of intolerance at home. This can make your job in the classroom more challenging, but you can also address bigoted points of view head-on.
For instance, if and when a student conveys beliefs or behavior that is disrespectful of another student’s culture or identity, immediately direct them to stop, and tell them why you are doing so.
For specific examples about how to handle intolerance in the classroom, reach out to your colleagues and review resources offered by organizations working to improve attitudes about diversity., In order to promote multiculturalism and celebrate diversity in the classroom, visual materials must reflect the communities in which your students live, as well as the other cultures represented in your country. For instance, posters in the classroom and videos you show should include people from different races and with different identities.Meanwhile, it is important that teaching materials do not reinforce stereotypes. For instance, instead of a poster featuring a Mexican man in a field wearing a sombrero or a Native American woman in a ceremonial headdress, have a poster that features a male Mexican doctor and a Native American businesswoman.

, To prevent exclusion and insensitivity, it can be helpful to articulate the importance of always respecting one another to your students. Ask your class to help you determine what that will mean in your classroom.Start the discussion off by saying something like, “I think one rule we should have is that we will always listen to whoever is speaking and give them a chance to convey their perspective fully.”

, True social justice and equality will only be achieved if children are taught to be open-minded, understanding, and resistant to the biases that everyone is exposed to. In fact, many people reach adulthood without ever expanding their personal worldview to acknowledge and fully respect other people’s ways of living.


Fortunately, there are more and more resources available to help you and other educators provide accurate and responsible perspectives on the world we share. For more information about culturally diverse resources, visit http://www.teachingforchange.org/."

Get inspired.,
Get organized.,
Find a scheme.,
Develop the design.,
Draft plans.",How to Design Your Own Teaching Museum," Planning your new teaching museum is the most critical moment of the process, and the most fun. Capitalize on the magical inspiration every project needs to make a museum a teaching museum - yours! Capture the lightning-in-a-bottle that motivates you in the first place to design your own home. Write it all down, keep a scrapbook, bookmark pictures in books, take pictures, whatever your preferred method.


Write down every price quote, budget amount, phone number






Take hundreds of pictures. Digital cameras make it cheap and easy. Shoot every angle of a building you like. You'll find more detail in the photos than you saw in person.






Keep a scrapbook of magazine articles, newspaper articles, business cards, etc. Begin compiling a list of every detail you like from your various resources. The more information that you can provide to your architect or builder about paint colors, door hardware, plumbing fixtures, counter-tops, built-ins, stair details, appliances, etc. before you begin construction, the more likely you will hit your housing budget.






Check out other examples of museums you like (friends, family, etc.) and learn about aspects of each.





;
, You need documents that contain information you've gathered which serves to direct your planning efforts. Accurate documents focus attention on facts. Basic information eliminates ""Pie-in-the-Sky"" dream scenarios which waste time, effort and people's patience. Start with a Requirements List. Make a Wish List separately so that you can add it to your design later, as you find you can afford. Spend approximately 30 days to 6 months on this part.

, You'll want to consider several different designs to find the scheme that best fits your needs. Schemes are freehand sketches drawn to capture the essence of a plan under consideration. They can be as simple as paper napkin sketches or professionally illustrated drawings. All are valid tools and each serves the purpose to convey a concept. This should take you about 3-6 months.

, This is the phase of the process where dimensions are added to the drawings. Everything must be made to fit at this phase. You will develop your scheme into a completely dimensioned drawing. With a conceptual design roughed out, scheme chosen, a theme decided upon and problems on the site ironed out, you are fitting all the pieces of the puzzle together in this step. You know you are done here when you have located on paper the location of every door and window in the museum. This should take you approximately 2 months.


Pay a pro to draw a ""Site Plan"" of your property, including elevations. This will be helpful in balancing slopes, adding fill or making cuts to accommodate your dream home.






Let the steady hand of an experienced designer take over the process of shaping up the prints. If you've gotten this far on your own drawing skills, you need to delegate now. You have more important duties involved in managing your dream home.







, The takeaway from this step is a fully detailed set of plans that the city and construction workers will use to build your home.

Encourage group participation.,
Guide participants through the discussion.,
Avoid dominating the discussion.,
Defuse conflicts and redirect the discussion.,
Keep track of time.,
Wrap up each group session with a closing statement.,
Administer feedback forms (optional).",How to Lead Small Groups1," Your small group may be discussing an issue, solving a problem, or sharing personal problems. Make a list of what the group wants to accomplish, and break it down into specific tasks or discussion points. If you're not sure how long each task will take, organize the discussion so the most important tasks are first on the group's agenda. Write down notes using the steps below, to help guide you through the facilitation process.;
, The main advantage to small group discussions, as opposed to large meetings, is the chance each member has to provide detailed, high-quality input to the discussion. Encourage people to break out of formal roles by meeting in a living room, a quiet café, or a natural, outdoor area., Introduce yourself, define your role in the discussion and the objective of the group. Invite group members to introduce themselves.


If participants do not know each other or are acting shy, ask specific questions, such as where each participant is from and what they hope to gain from the group meeting.
Allow for longer introductions in special cases. If the group will explore personal problems, or if the backgrounds of group members are important to the process, allow each participant to speak for about a minute.

, When delivering information or asking group members to solve specific problems, develop informational handouts that they may refer to during the group session. The information may also be written on a board or projected on a wall for reference.

, When group members are just getting to know one another, they may be hesitant to speak. Create a safe space for participants to contribute their ideas, suggestions and questions, by explaining that all questions are welcome. If someone is staying silent, occasionally ask her a question, or invite her to share her thoughts, but don't force her to participate.If necessary, break the group into smaller groups of two or three participants to allow time for greater sharing.

, Prepare a list of questions to keep the discussion moving. When participants ask for your opinion on the discussion topic, direct the question back to the group to generate their insights or feedback. Clarify and summarize each point before moving on to the next topic.

, Successful small group facilitators refrain from speaking extensively.A small group discussion is considered effective when it stimulates thought and sharing by all members. Lecturing or delivering too much information can cause inattention or lack of interest.

, When people express diverse views or are attached to their opinions, conflicts may ensue. Ask group members to listen to opposing views without interrupting, and to respond to the group as a whole, rather than an individual person. Model this behavior yourself by refraining from reacting negatively towards individuals whose beliefs or opinions differ from yours.

, Group discussions can have a habit of running on too long, or getting bogged down in one topic past the point where anything new is being said. Unless an agenda item needs to be dealt with for the group to continue, keep track of the time and let people know when you need to move on to the next point. If this is a recurring problem, consider using hourglasses or other timers as tools., Briefly summarize the discussion or activities of the group, taking no more than a minute or two. Thank the group members for their participation and announce the details of the next meeting, if applicable.

, Evaluate the experience of group members by requesting anonymous feedback. Ask participants to fill out evaluation forms and drop them off on the way out. Assigning quality ratings, making suggestions for improvements and sharing insights gained during the group process are the types of responses that may be included on a feedback form.


Keep in mind that it may not be appropriate to ask for ""anonymous"" feedback if the group is small enough to make each person's feedback easily identifiable. In these cases, it may be more effective to encourage other members of the group to arrange a one on one meeting or email correspondence.

Decide on the purpose of your group.,
Gather people together.,
Ask someone to be your co-leader.,
Offer food and drink.,
Start with introductions.,
Start a Bible study discussion.,
Facilitate the discussion.,
Don't act like an expert.,
Talk about prayer and the members' lives.,
Encourage people to take on roles.",How to Lead Small Groups2," Many small groups, or ""cell groups,"" hold open meetings available for anyone who wants to join, although regular attendance is encouraged. They discuss spirituality and Biblical passages, but typically pick a different topic each meeting so new members can easily participate. Others are formed from a close-knit group of friends or people from the same church congregation. These may only accept new members at specific times, develop intimate bonds with each other, and hold discussions that last for several meetings., Most small groups have between three and nine members, including the leader.Invite friends, fellow churchgoers, and other interested people to come to your meetings, if you do not already have an existing small group.

, Invite someone to help your run the group, to encourage the group to shift the focus away from a single leader, and instead work together to focus on God and Christianity. If your small group expands to more than nine or so people, having two co-leaders also makes it easy to split apart into separate groups., A snack at the beginning of the meeting can be a great way to encourage people to relax and talk to each other. The focus of the meeting shouldn't be the food, but if someone in the group enjoys contributing by bringing food, don't discourage him.

, During your first meeting, or whenever someone new is present, ask for introductions. Even if you all know each other, ask a question or prompt to get people to know each other better. This can be religious, such as ""tell us about a time you felt connected to Jesus,"" or just something interesting to talk about, such as ""where in the world would you most like to travel?""


If new people are present who may not be comfortable or secure in their religion, use more generic questions. The point of the introductions is to make everyone more relaxed and start them bonding with each other, not necessarily to dive into Bible study right away.

, Select a Biblical passage in advance of the meeting each week. Come up with open-ended questions that people can discuss in detail, and relate to their own experiences and emotions. A good, open-ended question doesn't have a ""yes or no"" or ""multiple choice"" answer, and should lead to a debate, not complete agreement.Here are a couple examples of good questions or prompts: ""What would it be like to be one of the people described in this passage?""; ""Let's compare these two passages and discuss what each of them suggests.""; ""Does this passage make you want to change your behavior in daily life? How would you change it, or why wouldn't you?""
Avoid questions with simple answers or that contain your own opinion, such as ""Who is Jesus talking to?"" or ""What do you think about the brave and faithful actions of this figure?""

, As a leader of a small group, you are responsible for keeping the discussion moving and encouraging people to dig deeper. Ask follow up questions in response to other people, for instance by asking how they would tie the discussion to their own life. Politely interrupt people who are hogging the discussion, by thanking them and asking another person how he would respond. If the topic deviates from Christianity or spirituality, suggest the group gets back on topic., The focus of the group should be on God and the discussion, not on any one person.If people keep turning to you to settle disputes or answer Biblical questions, refer some of the questions to other members of the group. Encourage discussion and participation from all members, taking turns if necessary, rather than turning the Bible study portion of the meeting into a lecture.

, In many small groups, members have a chance of a more intimate discussion after the Bible study. In this, they get to know each other, and especially about hardships and changes in the members' lives. As the leader, ask if anyone has a prayer request, and set aside time for people to talk about prayers requested at previous meetings as well. Some groups prefer to split into smaller groups of two to four people, and promise each other more focused, one-on-one prayers.


Small groups can be run in many different ways, so feel free to organize your own spiritual activities or discussions.
Many small groups end with a closing prayer, but not everyone is comfortable with praying in a group. Ask the members how they feel about it before adding a closing prayer to your meeting.

, Dividing responsibilities encourages participation and strengthens the bond between group members. As the meetings continue, ask for volunteers to help select Bible passages, keep track of the members' prayers in a notebook, or simply help set up and clean up.

Stop fixating on popularity.",How to Lead a Team," The entire team needs to be on track toward the same set of goals. Create a clear objective that the team can agree on and actively work toward.


Explain in clear terms how the team's degree of success will be evaluated.
Make sure that your objectives are challenging yet realistic. If your expectations are too high to meet, the morale of the team will drop.
You will need to refer to the objectives you set throughout the lifespan of the team. When the team must make a decision, evaluate the options by determining which are most closely aligned to your overall goal.;
, Work with your team to plan out the steps you will need to follow to achieve your group objective. Make sure that these steps are described in clear, precise terms so that everyone is on the same page.


Each stepping stone in your plan should be necessary. Do not create a bloated plan filled with nonsensical steps simply for the sake of having an impressively large plan.

, Be in constant communication with your team and never allow them to feel uncomfortable about approaching you. Try to answer questions before or as soon as they arise.


Keep your teammates informed about each new development and change as it happens. Leaving someone in the dark is a sure-fire way to make that individual confused and unproductive.
Your team members should have a clear, precise understanding of how you think, make decisions, and measure performance. They also need to know how you expect them to work. Without knowledge on all these points, they would be unable to meet your expectations even if they wanted to do so.

, Your team needs to see that you are open to good advice and eager for their active involvement. Before making any major decision, talk it over with the team as a group and ask for their thoughts.


When teammates feel listened to, they are more likely to lend their support to the final plan. Make sure that everyone has a chance to share ideas, concerns, and suggestions before taking any major step.

, Every team of people will have its own group dynamic unlike that of any other team. Watch for the patterns and habits of your team before making decisions that will affect the team as a whole.


You should also look for patterns within the broader realm your team must work in, regardless of whether it is an industry, organization, or league.
Only by having all of the facts can you make the wisest decisions. Quick action can demonstrate your ability to lead, but if those actions make matters worse, you will lose your team members' trust and confidence.

, Even though you should involve your team as much as possible in the decision-making process, ultimately, you are the leader. That means you'll need to make the final decision when all else is said and done.


Aside from establishing your authority, there is an even greater practical reason for being the final decision-maker: you will probably have a greater idea of what is and isn't achievable with respect to the team's resources. Your team members can dream of the possibilities, but you need to be more grounded in reality.

, Spend some one-on-one time with each person in the team. Let your team members know that you see them as more than just faceless members of a larger whole.


Check in with each team member as often as possible. At the beginning, you should try to touch base at least once a day. Address any concerns each member might have when you talk with them.

, Pay attention to the way members of your team naturally behave and cooperate. You'll likely notice that some team members play a more crucial, direct role in work performed by the group.


Look at attitude before looking at ability. Teammates who are eager to support the goals of the group are more likely to work harder. Those who disagree with the team's objectives may still work hard, but you should watch those who are particularly vocal about their dissatisfaction for signs of sabotage.

, As the team leader, it is your job to find out what each team member can contribute to the group's efforts. Determine what each members' strengths are and assign tasks accordingly.


Take note of each member's area of expertise. You may not be able to use that skill set for the task currently in front of you, but if you need those talents later, you will know where to look.

, Allow some of the other members to take minor leadership roles within the team when certain projects or tasks are being worked on. As the leader of the team, knowing when and how to divvy up responsibilities is a skill you will need to master.


Delegate tasks to individuals based on who is most likely to complete a specific task in a timely and accurate manner.
Assign firm deadlines for specific tasks.
Follow up with the individual you've assigned the task to throughout the process. When your support is needed, lend it., When you assign a specific task to someone, you need to hold that person to it. The members of your team need to know that you fully expect them to take care of the responsibilities assigned to them.


Encourage accountability at the start of a task by giving team members everything they need to complete the task. This includes everything from tools to resources to authority.
Performance reviews are also a good way to keep team members accountable and aware of how well they are meeting expectations.

, A little appreciation can go a long way. Team members who do as they're supposed to and those who go above and beyond the call of duty should be both thanked and rewarded.


When working with limited resources, recognition of a team member's accomplishments or dedication can be a significant enough reward. Print a certificate, hand-write a thank you note, or give a gift card.Make sure that you issue rewards fairly. Acknowledge each team member who make a significant contribution to avoid the appearance of favoritism with any one person.

, As the leader, you need to guide, support, and encourage the members of your team. Each individual needs to do his or her own share of the work, but you can and should coach your teammates so that they learn the most effective ways to complete their work.


Being a coach is different from being a cheerleader. You need to encourage and guide teammates through rough patches instead of blindly and inactively cheering for them from a detached distance.

, To be an effective leader, you need to know when to allow others in the group to think outside the box. Ingenuity is a valuable problem-solving asset.


One good way to encourage teammates to think creatively is to place challenging tasks in their hands. Allow them to cooperate and compete with each other and independently of you.

, Demonstrate your commitment to the team by actively involving yourself in the work that goes on. Don't simply manage the team from afar; join the team members and lead them from the frontline.


A healthy and involved work ethic is an important tool you can use to show your commitment, but keep in mind that there are also times when you need to take a step back and direct from the sidelines.
Demonstrating your commitment is simply done by demonstrating your investment in the well-being of the team through your actions. Make the best decisions for your team at any given moment, regardless of the sort of work you'll end up doing individually as a result.

, Inspire your team by solving one major hurdle or other issue almost immediately. Acting so quickly will show how serious you are about your leadership role and may encourage the rest of the team to be equally serious.


If you're coming into a previously established team, quickly identify a pre-existing problem and address it early on.When you're leading a team from the start of its creation, watch out for early signs of trouble and address the problems as they arise.

, You might be the leader of the team, but if you want the other team members to respect you, you'll need to show them respect through your words and actions first.


This is especially important if you took the leadership role from someone else who still remains in the group. Avoid criticizing the previous leader's work in direct terms. Instead, correct past errors without pointing out where those errors originated., Perform the work properly and make the best possible decisions, even when doing so is an unpopular move. If you're too focused on trying to “play nice,” you may start slacking on your responsibilities as the team leader. The rest of the team may actually lose confidence in you as a result.


It's great to be a well-liked leader, of course, and becoming such a leader is encouraged when it is possible. The point is merely to focus on being trusted as a leader instead of focusing on being liked as a person.

Often they will rent several units in one apartment house, so you’ll have friendly faces just two doors down. Smaller schools sometimes don’t offer accommodations because they prefer to hire from within Japan. Less risk and they simply don’t want to fork out the key money. So you would have to find your own accommodations in Japan. No easy feat!;
, Large ESL schools often won’t have any flexibility in their curriculum. You will teach what you’re told to teach. However,smaller ESL schools will often be more flexible with their curriculum (if they even have one). This can give you the chance to experiment with new ESL games, activities and texts.

, Large ESL schools tend to see their teachers as expendable. With their massive recruiting budget and connections, they can replace teachers in the blink of an eye. This results in a colder atmosphere and causes faster turnover in the staff, and long-term bonds never get made. However smaller ESL schools tend to treat the teacher as a part of their team and may value your opinions and input on various school functions. They also allow you to hangout with students after class – this helps build relationships and adds to the entire experience.

, Large school salaries will all be in the 250,000 yen a month range. Your large chain schools usually give some kind of bonus -whether it is a free ticket back or a completion bonus. Generally the raises will be very small. Smaller ESL schools often give a bit more in the salary category simply because some of them are so far out in the country that it’s difficult to find teachers. Often it’s easier to get raises (or bigger raises) and other perks from smaller ESL schools than the larger ones. They don’t have such a well-oiled recruitment machine so it’s tough and a big pain for them to replace teachers.

Comply with all legal requirements for living and working in Spain.,
Get qualifications in language instruction.,
Reach out to schools.,
Make a deal.",How to Become an English Teacher in Spain," Although some English teachers in Spain may teach without going through all of these legal requirements, compliance with legal guidelines is necessary for a secure, long-term job in the country. The standards required by the Spanish government vary according to your country of origin. For those within the European Union, it's easy to travel to Spain and set up shop as a language instructor. For others from around the world, it can be more difficult.


Get the right visa, if applicable. Individuals from outside the European Union need a visa to legally work in Spain.
Obtain other legal requirements that may help provide for a transitional visa. In some cases, employers may be able to use a ""residencia,"" or proof of residence, or other legal items to help establish the person as an English teacher in their schools. Talk to native Spaniards and do research at local government offices to find out whether there is an alternative path for your legal transition based on your chosen occupation or other factors.;
, Most schools prefer to hire teachers with actual qualifications in English-language teaching. These will give you a better chance of employment.


Present a bachelor's degree in education or some other applicable degree from your country of origin. This can help you get preference over others for English-teaching jobs in Spain.
Earn an ESL, or English as a Second Language, teaching certificate. These certificates can be earned in as short as one month's time, and will often help you become more attractive as an English teacher candidate.

, Start calling schools within the country and figure out what their general needs are, and whether you are an applicable and desirable candidate for this kind of work.

, When you have interest from a school, go there to talk with staff and come to an arrangement about specific logistics for the job.


Work out pay. In order to successfully get a job as an English teacher in a Spanish school, you'll need to negotiate salary and come to an agreement on pay.
Figure out the hours for the job. Another essential consideration is the number of hours that the school uses your services, and when those hours will be.

,


Do not find someone else to blame for your or your team's failures. “Oh, if only _____________ had done his part, ” or “If ______________ (team member) had done such and such,” or “If they had done better.”
If you’re going to be any kind of leader to organize and get new successes out of your people, you can’t suddenly shrink into the background when you encounter crucial problems that all of you need to solve.

, Do not assign blame to others when something goes wrong -- nor seek your own glory for anything well done. Succeed by stopping the buck. Seek for the others to succeed; so then you succeed in their greatness.

, Teams win; so when you win, it’s time to celebrate the whole team! “We did something great!” Credit your team and your workers for your team's or company's success -- not bragging or being proud; humble yourself to the team effort.

, When you fail or lose; say, ""I didn't do enough! We can set it up right!"" Accept the ""buck"". Stop the blame game and tell yourself ""we will win together, as a great team.""

, If you’re busy finding scapegoats and assigning blame to events or other people, there’s no learning or motivation happening.

, In order to explain problems privately, in office, in a committee, work crew or team, you must take accountability on yourself for what does and will happen.

, Don't shirk responsibility. Be positive and upbeat, not down or grudging.


Get better each time. Lead your team in a better way. That works because you have a culture of accountability, not of blame.

, Use creativity and the courage to seek change for the better. Never show boredom or be complacent.

, You need some talent, but being persistent and developing industrious traits, staying meaningfully involved and engaged in continual improvement, are more important than native talent. Never stop improving.

, Pump customer service for their input on business through the customers' eyes. Prime the office-mates, warehouse-men, and others—individually and in groups, communicating together. Tune in to ideas and build on them.


Relational management builds relationships: synergistic energies/connections with minds and emotions of the employees. It primes the feeling of loyalty to the business and a vestment in the desire to improve the processes and mechanisms. Individuals tend to be more accountable to the management with whom they have relationships beyond just their daily work duties, particularly when the individuals are fully-valued.

, Listen to what your coworkers are seeing in their part of the work, school or game. Listen to what they are thinking and analyze thoughts with a high level of empathy.


Learn what is happening out there in the trenches! What was or is each of the other team or company marketers doing that you could latch on to and extend as well? What trends, strengths and weaknesses does each man see in the competition?

Ask for what you want.",How to Influence," If you want to be an influential person, you'll quickly learn that positivity will work more than negativity. People gravitate toward people and are willing to be influenced by people who are positive and nurturing, not harsh and criticizing.If you're going to criticize someone's work or offer suggestions or alternatives, start by praising something. Instead of launching into a critique, say, ""That's a great thought, but what if we tried it a little differently…""
Avoid conversation topics that involve complaining and criticizing. Talk about things you like, not things that bug you. People will be more attracted to spending time with someone who wants to have fun and talk about positive things.;
, Influential people are those who know how to play to their own strengths. What is something that you do well? What do you do better than most people? Recognizing and emphasizing your strengths in your personal interactions is a great way of influencing others.


If you're a harsh critic of yourself, listen to what others say. What are you often praised for doing? What earns you high marks in the eyes of others?
Try to write down a list of your achievements and attribute each of them to something that you think you do well. This can be an excellent and easy way of identifying your major strengths.

, If you can't speak up for yourself and communicate in a concise manner, it'll be hard to be influential. Influential people learn to voice their opinions and their ideas in concise language. You need to be convincing.


Speak clearly and loudly when you speak to command attention. Don't talk over people, but make sure you can be heard. It's hard to influence anyone while you're mumbling.

, If you want to influence others, you've got to do it with more than your good word and your ability to manipulate people. You've got to have the skills and the expertise to back up your words. You've got to walk the walk and talk the talk, which will allow you to be more assertive in your influence.


If you want to influence your friends, coworkers, or family members, spend extra time studying and researching the things you're talking about and the things that you're doing, from your job to your hobbies. Stay informed and ahead of the curve, then put that knowledge into practice.Go ""above and beyond."" Be the first to get to the office and the last to leave. Put in extra hours on the home front and let your actions speak for themselves. Make an effort to be the best at everything you do. Even if you're not, the effort will be influential.

, Charisma goes a long way in influence. It's hard to know exactly how to cultivate something that's hard to define, but a lot of it has to do with staying at ease in your own skin. Charisma is confidence. So, to influence others, stay relaxed, confident that you're correct in what you say, that you're who you are, and that what you say matters.


Make the mundane interesting. The head of Google's Spam division has hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers not because Spam is an inherently fascinating topic, it's because he tweets about the topic hilariously.Being charismatic doesn't need to be any more complicated than knowing when to button up. Cultivate a little mystery in your life by staying out of a conversation, rather than contributing as you might normally and you might be surprised at how people will conversely become more curious in your thoughts. Influence in silence.

, It's easier to influence others if your arguments are believable, well-organized, and convincing. From the way you carry yourself to the way you to the way you speak, cultivate a believable persona.


Know when to let something drop. Influential people also know when to admit that they're wrong and drop an idea or an argument that's not working. Being influential doesn't mean being right all the time, or convincing others that something you say is correct when it isn't.

, An inspiring person builds confidence and trust in others, influencing their decisions by spreading trust around. You don't need to be the smartest, the best, or the loudest, you just have to make other people feel as if they're benefiting from being around you. Easier said than done, but being inspirational is often the sum of many other abilities that will make you influential. Stay positive and speak well and you'll inspire.

, If you want to expand your influence, it's important to spend time focusing on the people who matter the most. Whether you're in a position of authority or you're low on the totem pole, pick out the people who'll be able to help you make a difference, or the people who'll be the most likely to go along with you and your ideas.


Don't waste time and energy on people who don't matter. It's not your job to influence every single person in your life. If your coworker has no authority over you, won't collaborate, and irritates you, ignore them.

, Truth-telling and influence go hand-in-hand. Make it your goal to be as honest as possible with people you want to influence. If you don't like an idea your employee brings you, be honest and say so as kindly as possible. Don't withhold uncomfortable truths, make it your goal to stay truthful and people will respect you.


Bluntness can be a turnoff in some cases, or it can be refreshing and influential. Still, it's important to exercise tact and pay close attention to the fine line between hurting someone's feelings and being honest., When you're interacting with people one-on-one, practice building rapport with people and instilling trust and confidence. Good conversational skills are more than just saying the right thing. To build rapport, make sure you:


Maintain personal space and distance
Look others in the eye
Breathe slowly and maintain an even tone of voice
Match your diction to others

, If you've guessed what someone's going to say before they say it, you'll be able to influence much easier. Work on organizing your thoughts and thinking about what you have to say ahead of time, so you don't have to think and speak on the fly. Anticipate other peoples' reactions and responses to think of what you're going to say before you say it.

, Negotiation and arbitration is a very important part of being influential. Working together to build the best possible ideas helps to give others the sense that you're willing to listen. Make sure that you take multiple perspectives into consideration and let others contribute. Make it a team effort.


Let other people come up with your ideas. If you're convinced that you've got the right answer, lead others through your thinking, but don't come up with a solution yet. When someone else sees where it's going, praise their great idea, even if it was yours.

, Little things matter. There's nothing that ingratiates someone less than forgetting someone's name, then brushing it off with a ""Oh, sorry I'm terrible with names."" Don't be that person. Be the person who only needs to hear it once, then talks to everyone, from the mailman to the CEO as if you've known them for years.

, Look people in the eye, nod your head when you agree, and focus on conversations that you're having. Engage and listen closely and you'll be much more collaborative and influential in your conversations. Other people will be more likely to tell you the truth and open up if you're a good listener.


Don't just give the appearance of listening closely, actually listen closely. We've all had bosses who nod along but couldn't summarize what you just said if they had to. Don't be like that. Really listen closely and think about what someone is saying. Don't just wait for your turn to speak.

, People like to feel unique, as if they have good ideas that are respected by other people. If you want to influence someone, don't do it by appealing to their sense of duty, or their sense of greed, or their sense of competition–appeal to their creative side. Give them the opportunity to form new ideas and creative ways of thinking and give them the opportunity to indulge those ideas.


Praise creative concepts, even if they don't pan out. If you have a friend who had a radical new idea about a small business that turns out to fail, praise their gumption. Celebrate little failures.

, If you want to influence others, lead them in the direction you want them to go. if your boss has the ability to grand you a raise that you want, tell your boss you want a raise at the appropriate time. There's no sense in beating around the bush. Cut to the chase and speak from the heart. If your reasons are sound and your influence is strong, you should have a stronger chance of getting what you want. You'll never know if you don't ask.

Empathize.,
Brainstorm with the person.,
Be honest.,
Set a good example.,
Understand that the person may not take your advice.",How to Give People Advice," Every situation is unique, so never assume you know all you need to know about a problem. Listen carefully to the person who wants advice, and learn as much as possible about this situation. If you need clarification, ask questions. Being an active listener will not only help you give good advice, it will also increase the chances that the person will take your advice.;
, Try to imagine yourself in the other person's situation. If you've been in a similar situation, think about what you learned, but don't rely solely on your experiences to give advice--imagine that you are giving yourself advice for the unique circumstances that the other person is facing.

, While you're at it, think about the consequences of not taking your advice. If there's no significant difference between the results of those two scenarios, your advice might not be bad, but it's not useful either. Ditto if the action you advise is impossible. If you can envision the path you suggest leading to a worse result than an alternative path would, your advice probably is bad.


Take your time. When possible, think long and hard about all the possible courses of action and consider the pros and cons (or the benefits and costs) of each. This is especially important for more complex problems.
Think about both the short term and long term consequences of your advice. Very important decisions are usually very important because of their long term effects. Think as far down the road as possible.

, Many matters require sensitivity and thoughtfulness. If you really try to put yourself in the other person's shoes (as suggested above), empathy will probably develop naturally. Even so, be very careful about how you word your advice and be sensitive to the other person's feelings and emotional state. Giving advice is more than a logical exercise. It usually involves helping a person sort through conflicting emotions as much as conflicting choices.

, Sometimes there is no clear-cut right answer to a problem. In this case, try to help the person mull over all the alternatives so that he or she can reach a conclusion together with you or on their own. Even for very simple questions, it can be beneficial to help the person develop his or her own advice, if only for the reason that he or she is more likely to take it.

, If your advised course of action has potential drawbacks, tell the person about them. If you don't really feel qualified or knowledgeable enough about something to give advice on it, be honest about this fact. Your goal should not be to blindly lead the person, but rather to help him or her make a good decision, so don't act like a salesman.

, If you advise one thing but do the opposite, your advice will be seen as phony and hypocritical. If you do as you say, however, people will be more likely to respect your advice.

, Just because someone asks for your advice, they are not obligated to take it. Realize that the other person almost always knows more about their particular situation and desires than you do, so you can never be sure that your advice is really the best for them. Understand that people will sometimes ask advice just in order to bounce ideas off of you, and don't be surprised if a person rejects even good advice and decides to make his or her own mistake. Live with it, and let the person live with his or her decision.

Use initiative.,

Be visible and approachable.",How to Improve Leadership Quality," If you want to develop your leadership skills, it’s important that you honestly analyse your strengths and weaknesses. Doing this will enable you to identify the areas you need to improve, and make you more aware of how you act and behave. Start by asking yourself “what kind of leader am I?”


Perhaps you are someone who leads by example, and doesn’t get too involved in other people’s work.
Or maybe you are a leader who helps to solve problems, and takes a more active and interventionist role.
Being a good team player and helping other people get along and work together more effectively is another way of being a leader.You can even use online leadership quizzes to evaluate your leadership skills.;
, Once you have begun to get a clearer picture of how you act as a leader, it will be helpful to consider how other people think of you as a leader. This could be your colleagues at work, or friends at school or college. You can do this by paying closer attention to team interactions, such as how often colleagues approach you for advice, and how comfortable they are doing so.You can also ask a trusted friend or colleague for her perception of your leadership qualities.
You can ask a more senior colleague, who is familiar with you and your work, for some feedback and guidance on management and leadership.

, After asking the initial questions about how you lead and how others perceive you, you can try to analyse you leadership qualities in greater detail. You will then decide which factors to work on. Write down the following questions and try to answer them as honestly and fully as you can:


Do I make an effort to be aware of the thoughts and feelings of colleagues?
Do I help others perform to their best and reach their potential?
Do I accept responsibility?
Do I keep an open mind and try new ideas and new ways of doing things?
Can I communicate effectively with others?
Am I a good problem solver?
Do I encourage and accept other opinions and perspectives?, These questions will help highlight which leadership qualities you are strong in, and which you need to improve. Using your answers to the questions, divide your leadership qualities into three parts. Firstly, note those qualities you feel you are very strong on. Secondly, identify which areas need some improvement. Thirdly, determine which areas you are weak on, and need considerable attention.


For example, if you are aware of the thoughts and feelings of colleagues, and you accept other people’s opinions, your openness and engagement with colleague is likely to be strong.
If you don’t help others perform to their best, and you don’t communicate as effectively as you would like, these skills will need some work.
These leadership qualities can be broken down into the more general areas of communication, inspiring and setting an example for others, openness, and teamwork and cooperation., Communication is perhaps the most important leadership quality, and one that runs through all of the other important qualities. One of the keys to good communication is enabling positive and sometimes robust dialogue on problems and solutions. There are different styles of leadership, but someone who consistently shuts down debates and stifles discussions is unlikely to command the support of others for too long.


Ask and encourage open questions, rather than constrictive ones.
Highlight areas of agreement first, and deal with the disagreements second.
Don’t be overbearing, and facilitate an open environment where people are free to talk without fear., Positive body language can help you come across as dynamic, open and cooperative. It can also help you to make a strong impression when you are talking, and increase the power and effectiveness of your words. One good rule is to have body language that is consistent with what you are saying. Don’t, for example, ask someone to do something while looking down at the floor. Instead make eye contact and be open and engaging.


To have positive and affirmative body language while talking, try to maintain eye contact, stand tall and straight, and relax your face.Your body language may be interpreted as how you are really feeling, so try to have body language that reflects the qualities and approach of a good leader., To be a good communicator, you need to be a good listener. If you make the effort to listen to somebody, she will see that and come to think of you as someone she can talk to. This is an important leadership quality to develop. Body language is important, so try to maintain eye contact with the person you are talking to.To be an active listener:


Don’t judge people.
Pay complete attention to the person you are talking to.
Try to understand others, before you try make yourself understood.
Don’t interrupt unnecessarily., One aspect of good leadership is being quick and decisive to act to solve a problem. If you see something needs to be done and are confident that you know the best way to do it, use your initiative. A strong leader can be someone who is prepared to take the lead in situations without necessarily being asked to.


Using your initiative demonstrates a positive and “can do” attitude.Make sure you are confident in your actions, however. Act calmly and assuredly, and don’t ty to rush to a solution when the problem requires consultation.
Another aspect of good leadership is knowing when to take advice, and understanding when a problem needs a deeper understanding before it can be addressed., To set a strong example as a leader it’s essential that you take responsibility for your individual tasks and priorities as well as your team as a whole. Having clear priorities and clearly assigned roles will make it easier for people to identify and own their responsibilities.Support your team members to complete their tasks and try to forge a cooperative rather than a competitive environment and culture.Taking responsibility can also involve removing responsibilities from those who have demonstrated that they are unable to manage the tasks assigned., One way to demonstrate good leadership skills is to always be alert to new possibilities to learn and develop your capabilities.Showing a continuous desire to improve yourself and your work can be a motivating factor for those around you. It demonstrates your commitment to excellence and your lack of complacency.


Organise and write down a clear set of standards for yourself personally, and then try to always stick to them.
Try to monitor your work, and identify the areas which you can improve on.
You can use these personal standards to draw up a personal development plan., A good leader is someone who can provide a clear and compelling vision for the short term and longer term future. The ability to plan ahead, think strategically, and develop priorities are all hallmarks of strong leaders.In order to do this, you will need to develop a broader perspective so that you can see beyond the immediate deadlines.


Seeing the bigger picture can help you envisage problems before they arrive.
This kind of approach can also lead to innovation and structural changes that have long term benefits., For teamwork you need motivated colleagues. One of the best ways for a leader to motivate her colleagues is pay attention to them and make it clear that you are there to provide support and help when required. Try to keep people focussed on the goals that are the highest priorities in order to provide a clear route forward.You shouldn’t be the last person to find out if someone has concerns or is struggling.
Be active and communicative to identify problems and deal with them.
This may involve tweaking your team or the distribution of work.
For example, if someone is losing interest as the work is not challenging her, think of ways you can get her to engage with her tasks.
You could explain how this work, although a bit boring, is essential to the overall project.
Say something like “I know this is a bit monotonous, but without this the whole thing falls apart. I assigned it to you because you have great attention to detail.”

, An important part of motivating others is commending good work. Look for opportunities to praise people for a job well done, and demonstrate that you appreciate what they are doing. Taking an active interest in the work of your colleagues is a key feature of a good leader who is able to motivate her team.


With more junior members of staff, always be on the lookout for career development opportunities.
A positive and cooperative working culture where people’s hard work is respected and appreciated will result in a more motivated group., If you are trying to be a strong leader, it can be tempting to try to prompt better work by creating a competitive environment amongst your colleagues. In fact, developing a more cooperative work culture often leads to more effective working and better relationships.


Any battles that arise in a competitive culture cost valuable time and resources to deal with.
You are better off creating common goals that you can achieve together.Creating a cooperative environment will encourage collaboration and help avoid silo working.

, If you are leading a team on a project, it’s important that you are available to your colleagues. Remember that a good leader is someone who not only gets the task done, but is also concerned with helping her colleagues develop and achieve their potential. Be open to mentoring more junior colleagues, and be sure to make time for one-to-one training when required.You can make yourself visible and available in a number of ways. For example, you might schedule in a short period each day where you are free to listen to any concerns.
You could do this formally, or just set aside half an hour in which you can go around the team and check how everybody is getting on.
If someone asks you something and you don’t have time to deal with it right away, don’t dismiss it outright. Schedule a time later when you are free to talk.

Teach younger children fun things you learned to do when you were their age.,
Treat them kindly as they learn.,
Teach them several things at a time.,
Entice and encourage but don't make up or exaggerate negative consequences of not following your advice.,
Help them comprehend what we refer to as ""Basic Needs"".,
Emphasize the importance of time spent with the immediate family.,
Be honest.,
Teach them to be independent.,
Confront their mistakes privately.,
Encourage them to read.,
Demonstrate and encourage them to be helpful to others.,
Demonstrate courtesy and having a gentle spirit when dealing with others.",How to Guide People Younger than You," When they've mastered some of these things, teach them things you've recently learned to do. Younger children often like the sense of pride that comes from knowing how to do something only older children know how to do.;
, Kindness and firmness can go hand in hand when you're teaching a younger child how to do something. If there is a right way to do something you're teaching them, show them in an entertaining way what happens when you do it the wrong way. For instance, if you are teaching them to tie their shoe laces, tie only one of yours and pretend you've tripped on the untied lace. Sometimes a little theatrics help to reinforce the importance of doing something the right way.

, Younger children can master several new things in a day, so keep things lively by teaching them how to do several things at a time. This will help you to avoid repeating yourself to the point of boredom for all involved, or provoking a fight. If they find one of the things difficult, encourage them to focus on learning one of the other things. For instance, teach younger children how to make their own glass of chocolate milk, how to tie their shoes and how to make their bed. Celebrate their new skills at the end of the day and minimize the impact of any failures they've encountered while learning.

, There is no benefit to creating neurosis, addiction or terror in a child who's anxious to learn from you. Avoid statements that evoke fear to force them to comply with what you are teaching them. For instance, telling a child to save every penny they earn or find or they'll end up on the streets, starving and homeless evokes unnecessary fears and exaggerates the consequences for not saving each and every penny earned or saved. A strong-willed child will not trust you and a timid child may believe you to their detriment, but both will think you a fool when they're older and know better. It is better to be balanced and honest in the reasons you offer in support of your lessons. For instance, you can tell a child that you are treating them to ice cream for desert because you saved all the money you've found and earned that week.

, At meal time, tell them that the food they are eating is a ""basic need"". When it is bedtime, tell them a story that spells out exactly what a basic need for a human is. These basic needs include food, water, shelter (even if it is a tent, a car, or a box) and to love. Ask them questions about what they consider a basic need and steer explain to them why each thing they name is or isn't a qualifying ""basic need"". Encourage them to say ""I want"" when talking about non-essentials such as an expensive phone, video game, or laptop, and ""I need"" when referring to the real basic needs they experience.

, Explain who the members of your immediate family are and do not include anyone else. Many people include their best friend in this important list, and while you may feel like your best friend is a part of your family, they are not. Telling young children anything different confuses their understanding of a family unit and how important it is that this exclusive group be treated differently than people we deeply care about, but who are not directly related. Encourage them to care about others deeply, but not to the point of putting others interest above the family's before they are mature enough to know that the bonds of relationships do break. Emphasize to them that their immediate family members will help them feel better as they begin to discover painful relationships with those outside and inside the family unit.

, Speak honestly when they ask you for advice, or you see they are struggling. Growing up is difficult and not always fun. When the bad times come, preserve their dignity and help them cope with whatever has gone wrong. For instance, if you discover that a young teen has started taking drugs, be honest with them about the potential outcomes. Take them to a hospital to ensure that they are not in a critical state, then spend some time talking to them about the real consequences of drug taking. Never encourage anyone to scare the young person. Scare tactics rarely have the intended impact on a teen using drugs. There is a sense of hopelessness and recklessness being experienced by such a teen and, while they need the extra attention you are giving them, scare tactics will only heighten their sense of hopelessness. If they have become addicted to drugs, have them committed for treatment and reinforce to them regularly that this is not the worst thing that could have happened to them and assure them that things will be better very soon. (Even if you are wrong, you will have lifted their spirits and helped them cope with a very difficult issue.) Remember that even if you believe they are ruining their life with this boyfriend or girlfriend or that, or by going to this school or another, they may simply be following a different path than you chose.

, By your actions and your words, show a young child or young person the importance of self-sufficiency, persistence and determination. Encourage them to do their best regardless of the task at hand. If they are cleaning their room, tell them how impressed you are that they are becoming independent and responsible in doing so. Acknowledge and reward them for their accomplishments. Remember that they have no frame of reference when you begin talking about the future, and you don't know their future either, so teach them to cook, to clean, to defend themselves, and to love others. Hold independent people up to them and show respect for them so the younger person recognizes what independence really is and how it plays out for those older than him or herself.

, Treat them the way you would want to be treated if you made a mistake. Confront them with the mistake and help them figure out the best way to correct that mistake, if correcting it is possible. If correcting the mistake is not possible, help them understand the consequences of their mistake and the importance of them accepting responsibility for their actions. Teach them to say ""I'm sorry"" when they are in the wrong and not follow the apology with explanations that nullify the apology. For instance, if a child has hurt another child's feelings, tell them that they must go to the child they hurt and apologize. Tell them that the words ""I'm sorry"" are enough, unless the offended person asks them why they did what they did. Otherwise the excuses they may instinctively follow the ""I'm sorry"" with will excuse the bad behavior in their young minds.

, Try not to limit or direct what they find interesting, just keep a regular appointment with the public library, a time of day each day they are permitted to be online, and/or keep a variety of books handy for them o choose from. Read to them and read in front of them; they will mimic you and try to impress you by doing so. Ask them about what they've read or learned and encourage them by showing an interest in what they find interesting.

, Volunteer with a young person to help them get comfortable with the concept of doing for others, but try to avoid burdening their little hearts with hard-luck stories that might compel a jaded adult to help another. Focus their attention, while they are helping others, on the affect their activities are having on the person they are helping. Teach them to do for others in secret. This will help them understand that they are not to help others for the kudos, rewards or positive attention they receive as a result, but for the other person to have a less difficult time in their life or day. If they cannot be compelled to help another, leave them hanging when they need you to help them and tell them you won't do for them what they will not do for others. This may help drive the concept home for them.

, Berating a young person for being rude or rough with others only reinforces to the young person that their calloused attitude toward others is the norm (at least in your opinion). Speak respectfully to them and treat them with dignity, even when you are frustrated or angry. By your actions and direction they will understand when people say to treat others the way you would want to be treated. If they've received good treatment from you, they will most often give you the same in return. If you've lashed out at them violently, they will at least want to lash out violently against you when they are frustrated or angry.

Consider volunteering or getting a job with kids.,
Try to give advice enthusiastically when you can to the children you work with or that are in your family/extended family.,
If you are looking for a more highly salaried paying job, consider becoming a teacher or child counselor.,
Lead an evening, Saturday or Sunday-school class or any small group for children or teens, at a youth club, or at a church, temple or another place of worship.,
Make inspirational YouTube videos.,
Be a real example: Help them have good, moral fun, being a great inspiration and fun to be around.,
Go to where they are and try to influence or do whatever creative thing you can think of:


Music.,
Do social networking that is inspirational and spiritual.,
Write ""serious"" but youthful drama that can be helpful to people younger than you.,
Mash-up stories (totally change-up, rewrite and combine two or more old stories) -- and possibly redo them as a series of stories; that may become a mini-series.,
Teach about tragic, wasted lives... crime, drugs,


Show how ""untouchable beauty"" is a wasted life, people gawking at unattainable model beauty.,
Show inner beauty.,
Teach creativity.",How to Help the Next Generation of America,"


If you are retired, how little a job pays won't matter, as these often pay less than you could earn as a licensed professional. Or if you are not the primary income earner in your home, you might be able to afford taking these wages -- to be great helping kids. ""If you would be great, you must serve.""
Work at kids summer camps, in preschool education, or in after school programs with/for children.;
, Help them to decide on good choices in life. Don't be heavy-handed, overbearing or too off-handed/flippant.


Tell them your stories so that maybe they can learn from your mistakes. Tell them what not to do, but also tell them what you wish you would have done, be dramatic or comical if you can. Make an impact.

,


Kids more than ever need good teachers and counselors in schools, youth centers or churches, since parents have become more absent from their children's lives due to many mom's working or getting snagged by soapbox operas, social networking, chipping drugs and ""smoking"" or what have you.

, Parents need to stay to keep kids under control. Teach them everything you know each year, a little at each opportunity. Mentor them, encourage them, inspire them.

, Tune them up for kids or teens and make them brief but captivating/involving, relevant to their lives. Try possibly for ""hilarious, exciting or at least engaging/interesting content and costumes, etc.""


Make hilarious teaching videos. Where do the youth of America spend their time learning -- at YouTube/Google -- Googling for interesting stuff all over the Web.

,


Become a great game player, or sport and/or Olympic competitive athlete, who praises good behavior, and is spiritual -- avoiding hypocrisy.
Make downloadable games that teach ethics and values. Make a trivia game. Make a board game, crossword puzzle
Do downloadable art such as color by numbers or instructions of how to do art, using historical or religious figures, etc.
Be lovable, work to overcome narcissistic/neurotic tendencies, fight phobias, by being realistic, but kind, actually doing/showing thoughtful behavior. Do what you teach and proclaim.

, If you have musical talents, try becoming an inspirational/spiritual song artist. We need more Good News, song writers and rap artists that kids can really look up to, instead of having so many secular artists and stars that are bad influences to form moral/immoral concepts (gangstas, glorifying drugs, etc.).

Do love songs that inspire, and teach morality, like ""Lemon tree very pretty, but the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat...""


Teach how to be gracious, loving and kind... not just nice. So, love goes the second mile, far beyond nice to actively help. Make your love active and not self-centered, not like: ""Me, my spouse and my two kids -- us four and no more...""
Comedy: Be a hilarious comedian for youth, who is clean and not just ""insane"" -- to be worthwhile.
Sports: Make a kids' sport network -- or something like the ""Harlem Globetrotters"" with fun routines for kids but spiritual. The sport-players could do quick change skits to do Bible characters or try famous, historical personalities (probably passed away 50 years ago or more)..
Political figures: ""Don't tell them... Show them"" the great leaders who had excellent or good moral behavior: George Washington, Ben Franklin, Paul Revere, Andrew (Andy) Jackson, Abe Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, etc.

,


Facebook. Do one page of tag team, ""public"" to the entire world, not private. Try to do adventurous, educational, humorous but inspirational postings, but not like what you ate for breakfast, or a simple picture of a cute puppy, etc.
Make a Twitter, Linked-in, Pinterest page, more than shallow, silly stuff, like kittens -- and not like grandma's religious pictures.

, Create a series of:


Short stories: Topics such as studying to be a success in school for kids.

Adolescent detective stories, but not getting too weird.


Novels or nonfiction: Adventures in missionary trips for youth, for example.

Do eBooks, electronic media of several short stories or a novelette.



,


Video a comic strip online Facebook/YouTube, etc., fun and ""zonk, zowie"", comic writing.
""Crack-up"" kids with comic strips compiled into a book for kids.
""Slide"" your book across the world: Make a comic slideshow of your comic strip that automatically moves through a series of pictures.
Post a ""c-r-a-z-y"" talking donkey/goat to publicize your comics (catch them chewing and put words to it) -- or whatever animal is available, in YouTube videos.

,
Avoid idolizing, over-glorifying, any stars, singers, sports figures... they often have clay feet, as in crumbling relationships, questionable morality that their fortunes can afford them.

, How can you? Use stories including illustrations, graphics and music.


Use parables: Do stories with a moral message, as a great teacher said: ""Condescend to those of low estate."" which includes telling stories that show principles that are easy to understand.

, Teach them to start! -- begin something. Sleep on it. Work on it off and on. It doesn't always happen overnight.


Train kids in a ""sustainable"" talent: tell them, ""Pass it on"", to develop repeatable talent...

full name of your company
date and time of the meeting
location of the meeting;
, You’ll need a full list of people who are attending the meeting. Also write down those members who are absent.Include any guests or consultants who have been invited.Note any late arrivals or the time when someone leaves the meeting early.Also write down who is conducting the meeting and whether a quorum was present.

, There are many reasons why you will have a meeting. Some of the more common reasons are the following:annual meeting for directors and shareholders
meeting to determine employee hiring
meeting to discuss compensation
announcement of new officers
issue stock
discussion of financial activity, such as a new bank or line of credit

, Generally, the first item on the agenda will be to accept the minutes from the prior meeting. You should have distributed them to everyone in advance. Write down the vote.


If someone objects to the minutes, discussion may ensue. If you need to make revisions, then note what you must change.

, Corporate minutes should also contain a summary of the discussion on each agenda item. You must choose your words carefully as you write down what people say. You want to be accurate, so listen carefully.


Avoid trying to take down a word-for-word transcription. For example, someone might argue for five minutes that a proposed policy is wrong for the business. It’s enough to note that they disagreed with the policy and to briefly identify the reason.
Note what documents the attendees are looking at. Write down the name of the document and its date. You should also have a copy of the document to attach to the minutes.

, If the meeting involves voting on agenda items, then the minutes must reflect the vote. Also note abstentions (people who decline to vote).Generally, most resolutions will be adopted unanimously. However, you should note the names of any dissenters.For example, you can write: “Resolution adopted. Dissent: Jones. Abstention: Mathers, Johnson.”

, Write down the time the person running the meeting adjourned it. If members discussed when the next meeting would be held, then note that information as well.


For example, you can write, “The next meeting was scheduled for July 1, 2016, time and place to be determined. The meeting adjourned at 6:16 pm.”

, You might have taken handwritten notes while sitting in the meeting. Even if you typed your notes, you might have caught only fragment sentences. As soon as possible, sit down and type up more complete minutes.


Remember to use standard grammar and complete sentences. For example, “Mr. Smith objected to the new line of credit” is acceptable. “Smith no on credit” isn’t.
There are corporate meeting templates available online. You might want to look at them if you need help figuring out how to organize your minutes.

, At the top of your page, include the where, when, and who attended or was absent. Also note any guests and who wrote down the minutes for the meeting.


For example, you can write: “Minutes of a regular meeting of the board of Directors of ABC Company, held January 22, 2017 at 1245 Corporate Avenue. The following directors were present: Abrams, Jones, Smith, Calvert, Bono. The following directors were absent: Clinton. The following guests were present: Michael Matthews, CPA. Minutes recorded by J. Allen.”

, State who called the meeting to order and acknowledged the existence of a quorum. Also state the time.


For example, “Chair Abrams called the meeting to order at 6:15 pm and noted the presence of a quorum. He introduced the guests in attendance.”, For example, you can write: “On motion made, seconded, and carried, the Board approved the previously distributed minutes dated .”, Some reports are given at every meeting. However, you may also have had a special presentation related to an agenda item. Identify the following:Who gave the presentation or report. Also identify their title. Some presentations are given by guests, and the minutes should fully reflect their identity.
What the presentation or report was about.
Whether the presenter responded to questions asked.
If a report was offered for adoption by the board, note whether there was discussion and if it was adopted. For example, “After a brief discussion of the issues, a motion was made to accept the financial report, which was seconded and passed.”

, The board might have decided to adopt a resolution or take action on some other agenda item. You should summarize the discussion of the members. Also note the vote on each item.


Use simple language. Avoid unnecessary words and adjectives, which clutter the minutes.For example, “Mr. Smith disagreed with Ms. Jones” is preferable to “Mr. Smith strenuously disagreed with Ms. Jones.”
Properly identify documents the attendees review. For example, “The Board approved the proposed additions to the conflict of interest policy” is unclear. Instead, identify the document: “The Board unanimously approved the ‘Addition to Conflict Reporting’ proposal dated June 1, 2016, a copy of which was distributed before the meeting.”

, Some corporate agenda items are more important than others. They are important because future lawsuits might arise out of the board’s decision. Lawyers and judges will treat your minutes as an accurate portrayal of how the board acted. To protect the board, you should provide more detail.


Mergers and acquisitions, stock buybacks, and other significant decisions will require more detail.Directors can be sued for improperly exercising their business judgment.
Board members often must consult with experts or review reports/studies before making a decision in these areas. Your minutes should reflect that an expert presentation was made or that you distributed studies or reports to board members ahead of the meeting.
You should also note that sufficient time was given to discussion and that the board acted in a business-like manner.
Note whether the board discussed alternatives to the proposed course of action. Summarize why the board rejected or adopted the alternative course of action.

, Note the following, where applicable, in the chronological order in which they occurred at the meeting:Announcements. The Chair or other members might have made announcements about upcoming meetings or other issues.
Executive session. State whether the board went into executive session after staff and guests left.
Adjournment. For example, you can write, “There being no additional business, the meeting was adjourned at 7:55 pm.”

, Your draft needs to be reviewed. Follow your corporation’s policy. For example, you might need to show your draft to the General Counsel or the Chief Financial Officer. They may make comments, which you should incorporate.


You may then need to distribute the draft to a broader group of management, which may also have comments.
Finally, you will distribute the minutes to the full board, since they will be voting on the minutes for the next meeting.

, Once approved by the board, minutes are final. You should avoid making changes to them. Some experts suggest you can make minor edits, such as fixing spelling errors.However, there’s really no need to correct typos and other tiny errors unless they prevent someone from understanding what was written.


You should never change anything substantive. If a board member wants to make a change to approved minutes, tell the board chairperson.

, You don’t have to file your corporate minutes with your state. However, you probably must store them with your other corporate records, such as your bylaws and articles of incorporation.Keep the minutes for at least seven years or perhaps indefinitely, depending on your internal policies.


If your minutes incorporated a document by reference, attach the document.
You should also discard any drafts of your minutes after the final version has been adopted. You may also have to delete back-up electronic versions of the minutes., If you have a shareholders meeting, you must notify all shareholders. If you are holding a director’s meeting, then you must notify all directors.Both shareholders and directors may waive the notice requirement. However, they should have signed a waiver form. Look to see if any have and provide proper notice to those that haven’t.

, Every attendee will need the same set of information so that they can make an informed vote at the meeting. You should create a packet of information and distribute. Include the following:


the minutes from the prior meeting
reports or documents to review before the meeting

, As the person taking the notes, you should decide how you want to write them down in the meeting. Generally, people still write notes in longhand, though you can use a laptop.


If you use a laptop, then any drafts will be stored electronically. This means someone can retrieve them in a lawsuit. Accordingly, you should think carefully before taking minutes using a computer.The clicking of the computer keys is also distracting, which you should keep in mind.
Ask your Chair whether they prefer you take minutes in longhand or with a laptop.

Commit to simple works, such as organizing a cleaning of local streets, repainting of local buildings with owner's permission, or helping to donate blood.,
Ask the city for permission to complete larger items, such as painting city buildings, repainting city parks, cleaning city toilets, cleaning highways, removing graffiti from public works, or holding children's events in public parks.,
Organize fund raisers for local schools who can not afford certain items.,
Hold open meetings for anyone to attend, explaining your ideas, beliefs, and be ready to answer questions to the general public.,
Ask the police for permission to form night patrols.,
Run a public carpool.,
Organize local events.,
Complete works at churches and soup kitchens.,
Develop alliances with other public groups and gain their endorsement.,
Be friendly and courteous at all times, when supporting your position.,
Join an organization such as the Peace Corps.,
Repeat any of the above steps, except for 11, at any village, town, city, or state across the globe.",How to Gain Support for a Group," Creating a visible organization within the community leaves a distinct impression.;
, These will not only generate a public image of doing good for the people, but it will also have a public record of you helping the city.

, Attempt to raise enough money to replace a certain set of textbooks, or have new toilets installed. Many schools will put a dedication to organizations that actively help schools, once you have shown you are trustworthy among the community.

, A quick example would be this: Say a group of ""Goths"" wanted to disperse of stereotypes. They would hold an open seminar, where people could attend. They would then have a few keynote speakers, and address the concerns of the public, parents especially.

, Have your members actively travel in groups of five six, and as a group, your group would attempt to maintain law and order, and escort people too and from places in the middle of the night.

, In many small communities, there is not enough of a voter demand for public transportation to be available. If your group has had the success and foresight to make it to a large group, attempt to provide public transportation at little or no cost to the public. There is no reason why your group can not have your sponsorship on the side of the vehicle.

, These can include sporting matches where all of the equipment is provided, gatherings such as concerts, or any other type of event you can think of. Make sure you obtain the city's permission to provide such a service, if you are going to use city space.

, Seeing one or two of your members at a soup kitchen may have an impact at one or two people. Seeing an entire collective of people serving the public can have an influence on another entire group. For instance, if you are running a group to dispel the stereotypes of punks as violent, having twenty to thirty punks show up at a soup kitchen can radically alter people's opinions.

, For instance, if you believe that a religious organization may be the most apprehensive towards your group, attempt to openly befriend said religious organization. If you believe that a police department has a dislike for your particular group, be cooperative and help the police at any possible moment.

, Hostility will not win over the minds and hearts of people. However, actively helping people will.

, Have large numbers of your group head internationally to aid other countries. This will not only create a public record of doing good for other countries, but will gain support on a global level.

, It will help better your image globally, and help organize people of the same beliefs in other countries.

Assess your personal strengths.,
Figure out what leadership style best fits your strengths.,
Default to the style that you believe will work.,
Draw on multiple styles of leadership.,
Avoid emulating leadership styles that don’t fit your personality.,
Be ready and willing to follow.",How to Find Your Leadership Style1," Whether you tend to be more collaborative or more independent when taking on a leadership role, there are a whole slew of characteristics that go into your personality – and accordingly, to your personal leadership style. Take online personality and leadership style tests to help further establish the dominant characteristics of your personality and the potential style of leadership that may work best for you.Ask your colleagues – both above you and below you in the hierarchy of the professional world – what strengths they believe you have, as well as those areas you should look into strengthening further.;
, There are established styles of leadership that will allow you to capitalize on the strengths you already actively demonstrate. Knowing what these strengths are can you choose the style that may be the most effective for you. Consider the following lists of characteristics and consider whether you identify especially strongly with one particular set.Are you empathetic, team-oriented, emotionally approachable, open to input, and inspiration-driven? Leaders of this variety are seen as collaborators or energizers, and can use their positive energy and ability to inspire to lead and motivate others.
Are you action oriented, confident in the methodology you use, loyal, quality-driven, execution-focused, and stable? Leaders who identify with these characteristics can be seen as providers or harmonizers, and are often able to keep a team working together smoothly.
Are you cautious in making decisions, task-focused, results-oriented, traditional, decisive, and self-reliant? Leaders of this sort, considered producers or composers, are often especially able to lead their team to achieve specific goals.

, Your search for a particular leadership style should reflect attention to what will generate results in the context within which you are expected to lead. While your default personality makes using certain leadership styles easier – this doesn’t necessarily mean that the style of leadership you may naturally be inclined towards is the right one for the job.Recognize that the leadership style you choose to employ is a choice, and a temporary choice at that.
Think about how different styles of leadership will allow you to do different things, and consider leaning towards the style you think will be the most effective.

, Be ready and willing to adapt your leadership approach when different situations call for it. For example, be willing to utilize more directive, pace-setting styles of leadership at certain times - even if you usually take a more collaborative, creative, and participatory approach.Your go-to leadership style will simply not work in every situation you face. This is perhaps especially true in unexpected moments, when effective leadership is most necessary.
Prepare for situations in which you may need to utilize a style of leadership you’re not used to. This includes the role of enforcer. If your leadership role usually doesn’t require you to be forceful, don’t allow this to lead to hesitation or uncertainty when a situation that calls for a stern approach arises.

, Do not allow yourself to resort to leadership styles that do not accurately reflect who you are as an individual. More than likely, straying too far from how you usually behave and interact with those around you will come across as disingenuous. Maintain authenticity by behaving in a manner that you can be genuinely proud of.
If you’re feeling awkward when trying out a new leadership style, don’t stick to something you don’t see developing further.
Keep experimenting with leadership styles until you find the one that allows you to be comfortable and confident.

, Recognize and appreciate the strengths of your colleagues and the value of their contributions to maximize your collective effectiveness.It’s impossible to be perfectly well-rounded, let alone have a mastery of all the skill sets needed to complete most multi-faceted projects. A well-led team, however, can be both well-rounded and masterfully multi-talented.


Reflect on who you work with, and who on your team has strengths that compliment your own.
Allow others to take the reins while executing certain aspects of your shared responsibilities. Not only may they be especially capable, your demonstration of trust in them will facilitate their appreciation for you as a leader.

Set specific dates that your expect certain tasks to be completed and check in with those responsible when those dates arrive.Cultivate the belief in others that you’re approaching your collective goals by emphasizing the positive steps taken along the way.
Maintain this confidence by communicating consistently with everyone around you.

, Remind yourself that nobody can read your mind, and that your ability to articulate your vision of an idea or solution is initially the most important factor in the realization of that idea. In simplest terms: get the word out and keep everybody – including yourself – up-to-date.Value your own and others' time by planning exactly how you want to convey certain concepts to those you lead.
Understand that you may have to explain a certain idea in several different ways to ensure it is fully understood by everyone involved.

, You will get nowhere if you’re not aware of the needs and feelings of those around you. In fact, your ability to lead is in large part dependent on being able to recognize the value of other peoples’ contributions.After ensuring that you’re on the same page with everyone, trust those around you to make innovative decisions about different ways of doing things.


Stay out of the way when good things are happening. Believing in those around you and giving them the freedom to rise to the occasion will inspire confidence and productivity.
Ask those you lead what more you can offer to help them accomplish the tasks they are assigned.
Ask yourself how you can better bring out the best in those you lead to fine tune your leadership approach with each specific colleague.

, It’s no secret that the world turns just as quickly outside your realm of awareness, let alone your sphere of influence. Keep an active external network with other leaders in your industry and read widely about the technological and socio-political developments that will affect whatever you’re involved in., Even if you don’t have a formal leadership role, present your ideas and opinions clearly and assertively.Always be professional, but don’t withhold the charisma. Particularly when you’re advocating for something you truly believe, use both your physical and verbal language to convey your excitement.


Stop just short of not giving a damn about what other people think.
After important conversations, reflect on whether you could have played a more active role.
Every evening, make a list of the things you did to become a better leader that day and think about how to incorporate what worked well into the following day.

"
"
Demonstrate integrity at all times.,
Practice patience.,
Be kind to everyone around you.,
Delegate challenging tasks to capable employees.",How to Find Your Leadership Style3," Your ability to positively affect those around you is a reflection of your personal integrity. The degree to which those around you are willing to follow you – more directly, the degree to which others trust you – depends foremost on whether people believe you to be a person of integrity. While this all may sound melodramatic, it’s immensely important. It’s also rather straightforward.Treat everyone with respect.
Don’t participate in something you would be upset to learn that someone else had done.
Be honest, especially in regards to your failures.

, For one thing, you will diminish your own and other’s productivity if you easily become frustrated with minor mistakes or temporary setbacks. If you find yourself frequently getting frustrated with those you lead, take a step back and reflect on your perspective of those around you.Treat your colleagues as your equals. Impatience with others is an indication that you view them primarily as something to be used to accomplish a certain task.
The next time a mistake is made, take the opportunity to address the issue calmly and with your mind towards prevention and education. Take care to do so without being patronizing.

, It’s been proven time and time again that positive reinforcement is more effective than punishment or other reactionary protocols. Not only do people simply respond well to kindness, a leader that is friendly is more often admired.If someone isn’t meeting your expectations, approach them with the intention of understanding why they are struggling, and be ready to propose a path that they might take to get back on track.
Let people know when they’re doing well, too. This will increase confidence, moral, and comradery.

, One of your primary roles as a leader in almost any context is to help those you lead learn to take on new responsibilities. Give them the necessary opportunities to practice doing so by delegating appropriately challenging tasks. Delegating tasks that others can accomplish also allows you to focus on the responsibilities that are unique to your leadership position.Avoid the classic pitfall of taking on too much by trusting your team to handle the responsibilities you assign them. Remember that taking on too much is a surefire way to lose control, not contain it.
Articulate your belief that those you lead can accomplish particularly challenging tasks, as this will motivate them to put their full effort into the task at hand.
Clarify your expectations. The more clarity you provide about what needs to be accomplished, the more likely those around you will be able to help make it happen.

Meet the basic requirements.,
Get involved at your parish.,
Assess your beliefs.,
Attend college (recommended).,
Enter a seminary.,
Excel in seminary school.,
Become ordained as deacon.,
Enter the priesthood.",How to Become a Catholic Priest1," In the Roman Catholic Church, a priest must be male and unmarried. Many Eastern Catholic Churches will ordain married men, generally in their native country.


Although there are no formal requirements or bans, anyone with ""homosexual tendencies"" must generally ""overcome"" these for at least three years before ordination.You must be at least 25 years old to become a priest, but this is rarely an issue unless you complete your studies unusually early.;
, Before you even think about going to college or to the seminary, it's a good idea to get started helping out at your parish. The longer your history as a practicing Catholic in good standing, the easier it will be to enter the priesthood.


Get to know your favorite priest. Tell him your interests in joining the seminary and see if you can assist him during services or when he goes to visit sick members of the church or participates in area activities.
In addition to altar services, help out with singing and reading. Getting thorough knowledge of the books and hymnal will make everything much easier down the road.

, Becoming a priest is not a decision to take lightly -- it is a path that takes years to complete and is not for the faint of heart or belief. If you at all see yourself doing anything else, priesthood may not be for you. These sources of insight may help you make your decision:



Pray for God's assistance in discerning your situation.
Participate in mass regularly, developing a relationship with your parish's clergy.
Ask for advice from a vocational director or any trusted mentor within the church.

, A bachelor degree typically makes it easier to enter seminary, and reduces the length of seminary studies by a couple years.A degree in philosophy or theology prepares you best, but a degree in any subject can demonstrate your dedication and ability.


While in college, get involved in your campus' ministry. Use this time to attend retreats, help other students, and connect with your new parish or diocese.

, Apply to seminaries through your diocese or through the religious order. If at all possible, enter a seminary that awards a Master of Divinity, and is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools (if you are in the US or Canada).Ask your parish how to get started.


Every school has a different application process. You may need reference letters, proof of church involvement, a certain GPA, and a statement of interest, to name the basics.
The questions may cover physical health, emotional well being, conformity of behavior with Catholic tradition, and broad knowledge of Church doctrine., In seminary, you'll spend your years studying philosophy, Latin, Greek, Gregorian chants, dogmatic and moral theology, exegesis, canon law, and church history, just to get you started. Program length varies based on prior education and the amount of time you can devote to it, but a typical student enrolls in four years of graduate-level theology, and zero to four years of undergraduate philosophy and/or spiritual years.You will also be attending retreats, conferences, and workshops as regular aspects of your training. You'll be guided on meditation and solitude and be given adequate time to hone your public speaking skills., After completing seminary, a bishop may call you to Holy Orders and ordain you to the ministry. You will now serve as a deacon for at least six months.Don't worry too much about whether you will be ordained. If there are issues that could prevent your ordination, you will likely discover them during seminary.
If you are not chosen to be a priest or you leave seminary early, you may be able to request a refund of the tuition. The response depends on seminary policy and your financial situation.

, Depending on your country's tradition, you may enter the priesthood after a relatively short term, or choose to remain as a deacon permanently.There are multiple forms of priesthood, which you will learn about in detail during seminary:Diocesan priests serve the Church in a geographic area. This includes parish priests, chaplains, and religious teachers, among others. They promise celibacy and obedience.
Religious priests join the global community of a religious order or congregation, such as the Benedictines or Franciscans. These priests make formal vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, with some variation among different orders.

Learn the requirements of specific communities.,
Consider your life experiences.,
Enter seminary.,
Become ordained.",How to Become a Catholic Priest2," The Catholic Church does not set a maximum age on ordination. However, specific dioceses and religious communities do not accept applicants above a certain age. when there is a limit, this is usually in the range of 40 to 55 years.You must be male and unmarried. Widowers are accepted, but typically not within a year or two of the spouse's death. Divorcées must apply for annulment. Some Eastern Catholic Churches have different regulations, and (rarely) a married man ordained in another faith may convert and become a Catholic priest.
Homosexual tendencies and acts are judged on an individual basis, but generally make it much harder to enter the priesthood.

, Parishioners may feel more comfortable with an older priest who shares more of their life experiences. In particular, the priesthood needs individuals who demonstrate human, intellectual, spiritual, and pastoral qualities.If you can demonstrate these qualities in at least one or two areas, you are much more likely to be accepted by a seminary, have your financial burden sponsored, and eventually become ordained.


Educational and career experience may help, but your personal life can be a source of strength as well. For example, teaching, providing emotional and spiritual guidance, or contributing to your community can all help prepare you.

, Seminary provides rigorous education at a graduate level, which may be daunting if your school years are deep in your past. Talk to mentors in the church to find seminaries that cater to older students.You may also find a seminary specializing in counseling, teaching, or another area that fits your life skills.You may enter seminary without a bachelor's degree, but it will be more difficult to get in, and the length of your education will typically increase to eight years.

, After you complete seminary, a bishop can ordain you into the Catholic ministry. You will first serve as a deacon for at least six months. After this service, you may be ordained as a diocesan priest serving a parish or other local area; or take vows and live in a religious community.

Understand the job description.,
Learn about different types of cartography.,
Consider related fields.",How to Become a Cartographer1," All cartographers must be able to visualize data using both analysis and artistic imagination. They use a close attention to detail and accuracy in order to translate the data into a map, and have a reputation for perfectionism.Computer programming skills and mathematical ability are increasingly valued in the cartography job market, but you do not necessarily need advanced experience in these subjects.


Most cartographers have office jobs, and spend 35–40 hours a week working mostly on the computer and drafting table.;
, Cartography is a wide field that combines elements of geography, engineering, programming, and design. While there are many specialized jobs out there, you can divide these roughly by how much mathematical and programming approach they use:



Cartographers who focus on creating traditional maps use technical drafting skills and geographical knowledge, but often computer programming as well. A minority of them perform aerial surveys or ground surveys.

Photogrammetrists use data from aerial surveys, LIDAR remote sensing, and other sources in map making. This typically involves heavy use of mathematical analysis and computer graphics programming.

GIS specialists use Geographic Information Systems technology to build maps connected to non-visual digital databases. This increasingly popular specialization relies heavily on an education in both geography and programming.

, While not technically cartographers, there are people in closely related fields who share many of the same skills and interests. Here are a few of the most closely related options:



Surveying technicians or cartographic technicians map physical locations from the ground. While they are paid less than cartographers, they get to travel and spend much more time outside.

Map librarians maintain permanent collections of current maps and atlases, while map archivists oversee collections of historical and unpublished map materials. They are not as reliant on programming skills or artistic ability, instead focusing on archival work, library science, and historical analysis.

Study relevant high school subjects.,
Consider a cartographic technician program.,
Get a bachelor's degree from a university.,
Take essential coursework.,
Take additional coursework.,
Look for internships.",How to Become a Cartographer2," Most high schools do not have classes directly related to cartography. However, a strong base in algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and preferably calculus and statistics will give you a useful head start. If available, take classes in technical drafting and any type of computer programming.

, These are usually two or three year programs available at colleges or trade schools. Focused on practical experience, you'll graduate qualified to work on survey teams mapping locations on the ground.


You may enter these programs with or without a bachelor's degree. It's common for people to transfer from a technician program to a university partway through the degree — or vice versa., University programs tend to provide less practical experiences but stronger knowledge of theory, and a broader range of coursework available to choose from. There are many degrees that could lead to a job in the field:Geography is probably the most common major for a cartographer, as most universities do not offer degrees in cartography or geomatics.

Civil engineering, forestry, or computer science can all provide relevant background, as long as you take the coursework described below.

, No matter what your specialty, take all the classes you can in the principles of map design, the history of maps, and data collection for mapping. If you are aiming to a very specialized branch, you'll need a university that offers the following courses:


Hopeful GIS specialists will need courses specifically on GIS technology.
Develop your interest in photogrammetry with coursework in remote sensing, image processing, and LIDAR (light-imaging detection and ranging).

, You don't need to be an expert on all of these, but try to take at least an introductory course in these, and additional courses in those that relate to your desired specialty:Geography is useful for all cartographers, including both physical geography and human geography.
Computer science courses are useful for many cartographers. Consider studying computer graphics, web-based technology, and data collection and analysis.
Algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics are all valuable, and may be required for more programming-heavy majors already.

, Training with actual cartographers can boost your practical knowledge as well as the desirability of your resume. Many of these are only available while you are a student or recent graduate, so start looking before you complete your education. Job search sites often include an internship section, and you can search online for internships related to your specialty as well.


A few examples include the ASRPS photogeommetry internship, and National Geographic.

Build a portfolio.,
Try to find lower-level positions.,
Look for government jobs.,
Find private sector jobs.,
Get certified.",How to Become a Cartographer3," Some organizations require a portfolio of completed maps from job applicants. Save any work you do for coursework or internships. After graduating, spend your own time to improve old maps using what you've learned since you made them.

, Build your experience by getting hired as a cartographic technician, or a project cartographer hired on a temporary basis. Entry-level cartographer positions are definitely worth applying to, but depending on your education and portfolio you may need this surveyor or freelance work on your resume.

, Federal, state, and provincial governments are often major producers of maps, and hire many cartographers. Look online for your government's job postings board, or visit a local government office. At the local level, cartographers often work closely with city planners, county assessors and public works departments.

, Surveying firms, civil engineering businesses, and environmental consulting firms all use cartographers at their core, but you may not realize how many other companies use cartographers as well. Software companies often use mapping technology, and need cartographers or GIS specialists to help them develop it.Insurance companies have been keeping and analyzing map records for centuries. Publishers sometimes have a cartographer on staff to update their atlases.

, Government organizations and professional cartographer organizations often have certification programs for different specialties of cartographers. Certification often requires significant job experience, but can help you find further jobs or advance to become a cartographic supervisor. Here are a few examples:

, This undergraduate degree prepares the student to pursue the advanced education required for counselors. But if for some reason this isn't your cup o' tea, social work, sociology, or similar people-study coursework will also suffice.


A degree in psychology prepares the student to work with clients in a counseling setting and is good practice for the master's program. Courses include research methods in psychology, behavioral and social sciences and an introduction to psychology as a career.
Students may also complete an internship for credit in an undergraduate degree program in psychology. The internship is an opportunity for aspiring career counselors to work with professionals in the field.

, Sure, there will be some psych classes where you wake up, throw on pants, walk into class, find out you have a test (good thing you went to class that day!) and do fine. There will be others that make you wish you just majored in gym. So do yourself a favor and don't risk it. Study up. Your future depends on it.


Get good grades now and you'll be looking at some stellar recommendation letters and stellar graduate schools. Get bad grades and you'll be stuck with a BA in psychology selling insurance across the street from your high school. Your choice!

, When you're nursing a particularly bad case of senioritis, good news! You're about to be a freshman again! In order to be a tried-and-true counselor, you'll need a master's. So when you've almost cinched that BA, start looking into the next few years of your future.


There are schools with master's programs specifically in career counseling. While you could just do general counseling or clinical psychology, if you're 110% this is your future, you might as well commit to a program that has ""career"" in the title.
Think about location, size of the program, the cost, and what the program looks like. Do they offer internships? What's their stance on research? Do they help with job placement upon completion?

, Career counselors must have a master's degree in counseling with a concentration in career counseling to work in the field. If you want to be a ""career coach,"" that's another story. But generally ""career coaches"" are people that have given good advice to their newly-divorced sister and decided to whip up a batch of business cards.


A master's degree program focuses on counseling techniques, assessment, career development, research and human growth and development. Students learn to evaluate the skills of a client, administer assessment tests and teach clients to pursue career opportunities. Any legitimate business or school will require that you have these experiences.

A master's program in education may also include clinical study under the supervision of a licensed counselor, which may be useful if you want to work in a school setting.



, So here's the deal: some places require an official license, others don't. If you have your own practice, you generally need a license regardless of your location. In order to qualify for this (it's best to get one, even if you don't need it), you'll need between 2,000 and 3,000 supervised clinical hours.Again, it all depends on where you are.


Your first job out of your master's program will be this. You'll be working as a counselor, but more like a counselor-in-training. You'll be doing a lot of the same work, just being watched. It's for the client's benefit, yes, but it's also for yours.
A list of state requirements is available at the National Board for Certified Counselors website., This is usually the test used for state licensure.If you do well enough, you may be eligible to be a ""National Certified Counselor.""It takes 4 hours and is 200 questions long.


The examination tests the candidate's knowledge of counseling techniques, assessments and evaluations as well as the legal and ethical requirements to work as a career counselor.
This NCC qualification is generally reserved for those who have been doing it for while. So take the NCE to get your state license first and then worry about becoming nationally certified.

, The requirements for a license to work as a career counselor vary by state. But if you have thousands of hours under your belt and have taken the NCE, you're probably good to go.


Candidates must submit transcripts, the score from an examination, the application fee and proof of clinical work experience. Clinical experience provides the candidate with an opportunity to observe a professional career counselor in the field as well as on the job experience providing services to clients.

, Professional career counselors may work as an independent practitioner or with an organization to provide career counseling services to clients. But if you're just starting out, it's much easier to find a job with an established company or team. Look for work in high schools, colleges, social services offices, employment and staffing agencies.Join an organization such as the National Career Development Association. Membership in a professional organization can assist in finding clients for a private practice career counselor. Participation in an association or organization for professional career counselors also provides opportunities to pursue career development activities such as seminars and workshops.

, Everybody needs one. When you're just starting out, your stress level will be seriously reduced if you can depend on someone to show you the ropes and answer all your questions. They'll let you know when you hit the nail on the head and steer you in the right direction when you're not.


Odds are you probably know someone from your schooling, from your supervised experience, or from this first job you have. Go through the people that have helped you out in the field and think about who you had a real connection with. It'll be that person.

, Just like finding friends in a new town, when you start out in a career, you gotta find clients. Some of this is going to involve shameless self-promotion -- let your friends, family, neighbors, barely-even-acquaintances, and even the guy flipping your burger that you're a career counselor. And hey! Since you're so close (or the burger was so good), you can give them a discount, too.


While this isn't so necessary if you're working for a school or other established organization, if you wanna go private, you'll need to whip out your marketing skills. So get to making business cards, taking out ads, and creating hubbub about your new office.

, Just like with any counselor (or any job, really), there will be specific types of people you prefer working with, specific work you prefer doing. Do you prefer working with teenagers (if so, what kind? Troubled? Gifted)? College students? Those experiencing a life transition? Big-time CEO? What are you best at?


This isn't such a big deal if you're working for a company that hands you one type of client. But if you do want to start your own practice, it's something to keep in mind. It's also something to keep in mind if you find yourself not really jiving with your current job. Maybe it's not the type of client you're best at!

, Each year, you'll be required to take continuing education credits.These will be in the form of short classes, seminars, and readings that you'll have to complete. It'll be nothing compared to what you've already had to do!


The requirements for NCCs are a bit different. In addition to paying a yearly certification fee, they must prove that they've clocked in 100 hours of continuing education that year or they have to retake the test., Depending on your work environment, your day-to-day duties will obviously differ. But usually you'll be doing an initial consultation and hand out some tests -- ones like the Holland Code, the MBTI test, and the Birkman Personality Assessment.But don't just assess them on paper! Get a feel for them in real life, too.


If you're working with kids, this is especially important. What's their home life like? Their financial situation? While adults generally have control over their circumstances (generally), kids do not. They may be up against obstacles that can't be assessed on a test.

, You're going to be working with all colors, genders, orientations, denominations, sizes, shapes, and any other descriptor you can think of. They all deserve the best help you can give them and the best job they can get. Everybody is fighting their own battles and they're coming to you for help. They each deserve the same amount of attention.


In other words, there is no room for bigotry in this work environment. The successful protestant white male is just as valid to society as the immigrant working to complete his GED. Everyone deserves your compassion.

, First and foremost, you're a counselor. This means those who are coming to you generally have a problem. It could be huge, it could be teeny, but it's still there. To wrap your brain around what they're facing, you'll need to listen to what they're actually saying. Don't stop at ""I want a new job,"" when they're really saying, ""I want a new job because I can't stand the pressures and physical demands of my current one.""


Some of these people will also be coming you to give them hope. They need something that they can't do for themselves. They'll walk in to your office frowning, concerned they're going nowhere -- and by the time they leave, they'll be shaking your hand with the biggest grin you've ever seen.

, The last thing you want to do is give bad advice. Telling someone to aim for this career path when it's about to die in a few years' time is not a good idea. Telling someone to aim for a career path that requires 18-hour workdays when they have 3 young children to rear is also not a good idea. Know the market, know what jobs entail, and know someone you can ask if you don't know yourself.


Know the area, too. Are specific companies hiring? Are some in a freeze? Is a new, huge business coming to town that needs hundreds of employees in the coming years? Or would you client be better off, well, somewhere else? All things to consider!

, It's easy to get swayed by emotion with the stories you'll hear every day. You can't do this! If you let your emotions cloud your judgment, your client or their potential employer may be in for a rude awakening. You may want to hand that single mother a six-figure income working from home, but it may not be meant to be. Do what you can within reason for each client, regardless of their situation and how it moves you.


Honesty is the best policy. Occasionally you'll get the individual that wants to be an astronaut when they'd be better suited being a paralegal. Not only do you not want to get their hopes up, but you don't want to hand NASA someone who's not qualified. If someone isn't suited for a job, recognize it. It's for the betterment of society, really.

, You are not only aptitude tests and a shoulder to lean on. You are networking, resume and cover letter services, job boards, and everything in between. If it's even slightly related to the topic at hand, you should be able to help. Heck, do you have a friend you can call up to talk to your client? Excellent.


There's a fine line when it comes to ethics here. While you want to create the best resume for your client, you don't want to give any employers false impressions. Try to do work with them, not exclusively for them. If they can't string a sentence together, don't write for them. Teach them how to do it so they can do it for themselves.

Look to your immediate community.,
Consider traits you admire in your family members.,
Find the women behind the work you admire.,
Find a mentor.",How to Find Female Role Models1," You may have teachers, family friends, or neighbors who you admire. Think of a few women for whom you feel a natural admiration, and look more closely at their accomplishments, their characters, and the way they relate to others.Make a list of admirable women you know. Write what it is you admire about each of them. This list could include women who influenced you in the past, such as while you were growing up.;
, It can be hard to idealize family members, because you know them too well. However, this can actually be a good thing—if you think someone is perfect, you'll never fully understand their character and the way they make choices. If you can see someone's struggles and flaws, you can also see how they compensate and overcome.


Find things you admire about every one of the women in your family. Ask older siblings, parents, and other family members for stories about these women.
Look to the women in your family who have accomplished things you admire, even if you don't want to be exactly like them.

, Look to political and religious organizations, local companies, and public works that you appreciate in your community. Whatever it is you are interested in—be it business, community organizing, art—there are people behind it, and many of those people are likely to be women.Go to the websites of local organizations you admire and read about the staff.
You can also consider the traits that you admire in certain women. It might not have anything to do with their professional accomplishments and more to do with their personal qualities, such as determination, intelligence, and assertiveness.

, Asking strangers to mentor you may not work, but you'll find mentors by growing closer to people you admire and work with well. Position yourself so that you are close to women who you consider role models, and say ""yes"" to any opportunities they offer you.Contact an organization you admire to see if you can volunteer, get a job, or apply for an internship.
If you admire an artist, athlete, or other highly-skilled professional, ask if she gives classes.

Look for hardworking innovators.,
Consider humanitarian leaders.,
Celebrate women who have overcome adversity.,
Take inspiration from great artists.",How to Find Female Role Models2," When you read about the history of the work that interests you, you may see a long list of male names. The work of women has historically been oppressed, stolen, and absorbed into a male narrative—delve deeper to find the women who have contributed from the start.If you're interested in science, consider researching the life of Marie Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.
If you are an athlete, look to pioneering female athletes like Junko Tabei, first woman to climb Mount Everest, or Charlotte Cooper, the first woman to win an Olympic Gold medal.
If you are interested in politics, look to women like Benazir Bhutto, the first female prime minister of Pakistan, or Sandra Day O'Connor, the first female Supreme Court Justice of the United States.

, Women who fight for others are the drivers of positive social change. Consider the suffragettes: some, like Lydia Becker started influential committees, while others, like Emmeline Pankhurst, practiced civil disobedience and were frequently arrested for their direct actions. Women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Julia Ward Howe fought for voting rights for women in the United States, although they neglected to acknowledge the concerns of black women and men.Early black feminist heroine Sojourner Truth advocated for the rights of black women.
The founders of the Black Lives Matter movement are all women: Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi.
Consider female champions of economic justice: Mother Jones (Mary Harris Jones), Emma Goldman, Dolores Huerta, and Sylvia Federici.

, Look to the brave women who have expanded the boundaries of what womanhood in their cultures. Many high-achieving people have been given every possible advantage, but others had to overcome serious obstacles to succeed. These women show fortitude and toughness that you may want to emulate. They are also uniquely positioned to inspire others who are oppressed.


Transgender women like Sylvia Rivera, Janet Mock, and Rita Hester brave the highest physical risk to express their genders and support other transwomen.
Lesbian heroines include Gladys Bentley, Barbara Gittings, and Audre Lorde.Ida B. Wells fought against lynching and against racism with female suffrage, even when her white counterparts sought to discredit her., Taking an artist as a role model can be especially fruitful because so many artists leave a thorough public record of their thoughts and feelings. Read the books of great writers like Gertrude Stein, Virginia Woolf, George Eliot, Toni Morrison, Etel Adnan, or Claudia Rankine.


Admire the visual art of brilliant women like Kara Walker, Frida Kahlo, Agnes Martin, and Berenice Abbot.
Enjoy the music of admirable women like Beyoncé, Joanna Newsom, Chavela Vargas, and Dame Ethel Smyth.

Research your role model.,
Meet your role model.,
Make a list of traits you admire in her.,
Brainstorm ways to become more like her.",How to Find Female Role Models3," Read biographies, watch documentaries, and study the works of your role model. Read interviews and essays about her as well. Study her greatest challenges and her greatest triumphs. Practice telling people what it is you admire about her—what she did, or is doing, to make her your role model.


Embrace the flaws and errors of your role model. All great women have said and done some unworthy things.
Think about those of her choices you disagree with and how you can avoid them in your own life. For instance, if she was a brilliant composer but gave up her career to make television commercials, you can make a pact with yourself to never sell out.

, Get to know the woman you admire better. If she makes public appearances, attend her lectures or performances. Set up a meeting if she is within your social reach.


Write her and ask for an interview. Tell her exactly why you are her fan, and make a specific request. For instance, you might write, ""I am inspired by the way you shut down corporate opposition to the new traffic lights. My aunt is deaf/blind and she benefits every day from the tactile vibration you fought so hard for. Could I interview you for my school newspaper some day next week?""

, Is your heroine brave? Is she kind? Is she an exceptionally diligent worker? Is she an original thinker? Write down the character traits you perceive as being central to her character. Describe the ways her life shaped these traits, and the way these traits shaped her work.


Keep in mind that it is okay to be different from your role model. You do not have to share all of the same traits as her.

, Do you feel like you could be braver? Would you like to advance the cause your role model works on? List traits you could imagine emulating. Make a separate list of works you would like to do that cause you to admire this person. See if you can use these achievements to help you accomplish your own goals. Your path to success should be something that is right for you. Then, write a plan for following through.


For instance, you might write, ""my aunt Maria is my role model because she is observant, funny, smart, and artistic. I can be more like her if I listen to others, pay more attention to my surroundings, and get up the nerve to make jokes in public.""
If your role model is an accomplished heroine, you might write: ""I would like to be more like Gertrude Stein, who wrote many artistically challenging books, volunteered with anti-fascist efforts in Europe, and had the courage to live openly with her female partner. To be more like her, I will continue to work on developing my own artistic style, I will volunteer with anti-fascist groups in my home town, and I will never pretend to be anyone I'm not.""

, It will be invaluable when negotiating leases with tenants, especially large commercial tenants who will often have a staff of their own experts to negotiate the best possible lease.

Decide what type of booking agent you want to be.,
Pay attention to the industry you choose.,
Go to local events and venues often.,
Volunteer for community events.",How to Become a Booking Agent1," This is something that starts in the short term and may take a little while, but it is an important step to start with because it will help focus what you do from this point forward. The role of a booking agent can be carried out in a number of industries from music, to modeling, literary, acting, and more and the steps for each one might be a little different.


Some agents will have talent that spans multiple industries, but at the start, it is best to focus on one and get the hang of what is required of you as different industries have different booking practices.
If you get into music, you'll be scheduling gigs for bands, and most likely looking for a record label to sign them.
If you start working with a writer, you'll be helping them find a publisher for their book, and maybe scheduling local readings or signings to get their name out there.
Working with an actor would mean finding them auditions and eventually helping them work out contracts.;
, Whichever industry you pick to start booking for, you need to learn as much as you can about it and follow what is new and what the trends are. This can be done by researching the history of the industry, by talking to anyone you know who may have some experience, and especially by absorbing as much as you can.


Listen to the newest music. Read authors’ debut books. Keep tabs on the latest celebrities.
Search out blogs and websites that keep the pulse of emerging artists, writers and actors. Follow these sites devoutly to stay aware of trends that develop in the industries.
It would even be great practice to start writing your own blog that chronicles what you are learning and thinking about regarding these industries. It is a great practice to share what you love with other people.

, The best way to start making connections is to go where the people you need to connect with are. Find out what bars and venues have local bands and go to the show, try to meet the bands and owners. If you want to meet local writers, find out if there are workshops or readings you can attend. Go to the local theater and scout actors who may be potential talent. Visit an art gallery and ask about local artists. The main idea is to find out who is in your area and what venues have to offer.


Starting local is more likely to yield results than trying to land an already famous talent.
If you do meet someone, discuss with them the possibility of working with them. If they don’t have anyone handling their booking, offer to work with them on a temporary basis to see if you can help each other out.
After you see a great concert, you could tell the musicians, ""Hey guys, I loved your set. I was wondering if you have anyone booking shows for you?"" This would work best with smaller, lesser-known, up-and-coming bands - if you have friends who are trying to make it big, you could ask them if they'd like to have you on as a booking agent. If you go to a writers workshop and you hear someone who has a cool book they are working on, say to them, ""Your book sounds cool. Are you already looking for publishers? Would you want some help?"" You'll have to adapt it to the setting, but just asking people if they are interested in help is the key.
Beyond just going to venues and looking for talent, make a specific effort to talk to the owners or managers and find out their methods for booking people. You may be able to offer them services in the future.

, If your community hosts events that book any kind of local talent, get involved with the planning and organizing process as an easy way to get experience.


Volunteer events are an excellent way to find new and upcoming talent and to promote yourself as someone who understands the industry. In addition, volunteering will allow you to learn many behind-the-scenes duties that could help you get the most for your talent.
If your town has any kind of street festival, they would most likely welcome your help is organizing the entertainment. Maybe there is a fashion show for charity that you could scout models for. Your local library might enjoy having a reading from a local author that you could volunteer to organize. The high schools near you might be interested in you promoting a battle of the bands that students could participate in.
If a very clear opportunity to volunteer does not present itself, take control and think of something on your own. You could organize a concert, fashion show, or reading on your own. You just need to find some place to hold it.

"
Get a degree.,
Get an internship.,
Get sales and marketing experience.",How to Become a Booking Agent2," It is not absolutely necessary to get a degree to become a booking agent, but what a degree will do for you is give you specialized education that just grinding it out in the business will not. People who have made successful careers as agents tend to recommend formal education, even if they did not get one. They say that times have changed and just getting experience is, in general, not enough to make it nowadays.Recommended degrees are in advertising and marketing, public relations, and human resources.
Going to school full time may be out of the question for you, but many universities offer online classes. Some college even operate 100% online, so this could be a really good option. They are directed at people who need the convenience of online programs, so they are crafted specifically with that in mind.

, If this type of commitment is an option, it is a great way to get your foot in the door and make connections. Large talent agencies often offer agent training programs for aspiring agents. In general, booking agents don’t just start out on their own and make it big. It is a career that tends to take time to build up, and internships are often the ideal place to start your career.If a formal internship doesn’t work out, get an assistant job. Get a low-level “go get my coffee” job. Whatever you can do to get in the door will help you start making connections and gaining some knowledge and experience in the industry.
An internet search of ""talent agency internship"" or ""music booking internships"" should return quite a few sites that are designated to internships. There will most likely be an application and if that is accepted you will have to interview to see if you are a good fit for the internship.

, Maybe you can’t enter the agent business in a direct line, but in the meantime you can get basic experience that will benefit you. Being an agent means making people want your “product,” which in this case is your talent. So learning to market and make sales is a great foundation.


Do you already have a job where you could ask for extra responsibility in this area? Can you practice your sales and marketing skills somehow in your work?
Can you start a job in sales and marketing to start getting experience related to being an agent?
You can start practicing your sales and marketing skills in everyday life, besides within a job. Think about what it takes to be a good salesmen: convincing people that they need the thing you are offering. So the next time you are picking a movie to watch, think of it as a sales pitch. Do what it takes to convince the person to watch the movie you want. Or pick an event that you are excited about going to and just start a talking it up a lot and trying to get other people interested in going to it. This may not be ""experience"" per se, but it will help you develop the needed skills.

"
"
Be exceptionally organized.,
Develop good people skills.,
Learn perseverance and flexibility.,
Want everyone to win.",How to Become a Booking Agent3," Keeping track of your artists’ schedules, what venues you have contacted, when you have events coming up, and records of the contracts you make are important parts of being a successful agent. You also have to manage your time efficiently so you keep on track. If you are an independent agent and not part of an agency, no one else will be telling you what to do. It’s up to you to stay on it. If you are in an agency, they will want to know you are doing your job well.Start organizing your personal life now to practice for when you have to organize other people’s. Make a schedule for what you do each day and try hard to stick to it. Evaluate at night how well you did on keeping to the schedule. If scheduling ahead doesn't work out well, keep a time log each day of exactly how you spent your time. This will show you if there are any ways you are wasting time and can become more efficient.

, Being an agent is a relationship-heavy job, so you need to have great communication skills and feel comfortable making connections with people. You will spend a lot of you time talking to your talent, to venue owners, and potential talent. You’ll constantly be meeting people and discussing with people in person, over the phone, and via email and social media, so get comfortable with these aspects of communication.


Ask your friends or employer if you are already good at these aspects. If not, consider whether this type of career is right for you.
Develop these skills by starting conversations with people more often. Not just ones where you talk the whole time, but actively try to get them to talk more and draw information out of them. If you struggle with talking to people, the only way to get better is to keep pushing yourself to do it more.
Practice calling businesses to ask them about services or products. It will help you become more comfortable with the cold calling experience.

, You will face all kinds of rejection as an agent, and you need to be equipped to deal with it. People will turn you down a lot and you have to keep going despite the setbacks. You also need to be flexible and willing to make things work when things are falling apart.Shows will fall through when venues cancel. Your talent will get sick right before an engagement. You will have travel troubles. You have to learn to accept all this with patience and keep on going forward.
Start planning for all the possible outcomes of situations you are in. If you are about to take a trip, think about what could go wrong and consider your options to handle those things. Thinking ahead about how you'll face problems that arise will help you be more flexible and get past them.
When something comes up that seems to waste your time or hold you up, take the opportunity to breathe and recoup. Traffic jams and long waits can be more than a time to get angry. They can be a time to plan for what is next and relax. Use those specific setbacks to practice being flexible.

, You want to earn good money and make a career of being an agent. So you need to succeed at booking your talent and making them big. They need to do well at shows/events so the venue likes them and wants them back. By seeking the success of your talent and the venues you book, you will achieve your own success.


In your day to day life, practice solving tricky problems, especially where multiple people are involved. Find ways that everyone can get what they want from the situation.
When a friend or family member has some type of event coming up, think about what would be the best possible outcome for them and do anything you can to make it that way. If a friend is in a play, encourage lots of people to go see them. Someone has a job interview? give them pep talks leading up to it and offer to go with them to help keep them calm.
Being a booking agent often means wanting other people to succeed above wanting yourself to succeed. So learning to put other people first is a must.

Learn a practical marital art such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.,
One of the best ways is to approach a bouncer and ask him who the head of security is.,
One way that people like to use, but never works, is beat up the bouncer and show that you are tougher.,
Another way is to walk up to the club owner/manager and ask for a job.,
The best way to get in as a bouncer is to make friends with other bouncers and bar-tenders, but not when they are working.,
Most Bouncers are hired through referrals.",How to Become a Bouncer or Nightclub Security Worker," Learning how to neutralize a fight without injuring the other person is crucial to being a bouncer. Bouncers should be able to handle an altercations in a calm and intentional manner. This makes the bar owner happy and the customers calm.;
, Approach this person about a possible job opening. If he doesn't make hiring decisions, he will know who does and he will likely be consulted during the selection process. Be confident, but not arrogant.

, This will just get you arrested and jobless.

, Not many people do this, but it will work some of the time. But for goodness sake, do not nag them every night when you're drunk. You will never get the job.

, Hang out with them, learn from them and tell them you want to bounce. Sooner or later, you will get to pick up a shift and if it all works out you will get a few more. In this line of work, you have to earn your co-workers' respect. This is the most important thing to remember respect means everything to our kind.

, Get to know the staff and avoid getting intoxicated at the bar. You have an advantage if you are over 25 and have a larger build. Just ask around.

Apply for a teaching position.",How to Become a Biochemist," In high school, you should take classes in all the sciences that you can, especially the natural and physical sciences (like biology and chemistry). These classes will function as the basis of your professional learning in the future and will prepare you to begin your degree in biochemistry once you start learning at the university level.All science-related fields will be helpful at this point.
Make sure you take Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Zoology, Microbiology, Organic Chemistry, and any other science-related classes you’re able to take.
Take Advanced Placement classes when possible because they will be more rigorous and you will learn more from them.;
, As a biochemist, you will need a basic understanding of math and how mathematical principles are played out in the natural world. Math knowledge will be especially useful when studying certain concepts in chemistry like electrochemistry, entropy, chemical potential, etc.Focus on math subjects like algebra, trigonometry, and calculus.

, Biochemists need to communicate effectively with coworkers and ensure that their research is organized and easily understood by their peers. Poor communication skills could lead to potential problems with research experiments and how results are recorded.


Take your English classes seriously to help your written communication skills. You could also take a Drama or Speech class to help you become a better public speaker which will be helpful to you in your career as a Biochemist when you need to present your work to others.

, You should start thinking about what college you’ll want to attend while you’re still in high school. This means searching out what schools you might apply to that have well-respected science programs and offer courses in biochemistry and other sciences that you’ll need to take.


Apply to several colleges to increase your likelihood of getting accepted to a program you’re interested in.

, Sometimes you can earn your bachelor's in biochemistry, but not all 4-year colleges and universities offer these specialized degrees. Take advanced courses beyond the minimum needed for the degree and major. You will do yourself a huge favor by getting a head start and learning things you will eventually need to know sooner rather than later.If biochemistry isn’t offered at your university, aim for a degree in biology, chemistry, or physics.
Make sure to take classes like General Chemistry, General Physics, Introduction to Biology, Introduction to Environmental Science, Anatomy and Physiology, Microbiology, Biochemistry, and Organic Chemistry.

, Much of the work you’ll do as a biochemist will involve doing some type of research in a lab, so it’s a good idea to get some experience early on if possible. Find out if your university allows undergrads to be employed as student laboratory assistants.Being a lab assistant will look great on your résumé and will work in your favor when you are applying to graduate programs.

, Doing research early is critical to ensure career satisfaction, as research is a core component of being a biochemist. Moreover, research experience will greatly increase your chances of acceptance into graduate schools.Seek out senior biochemistry professors and express your career interest and desire to do research. It helps to take a look at their CV and research interests before you speak with them. Ask them if they have any opportunities available for you to work with them.

, While you are taking science courses and working toward your undergraduate degree, you also need to be gaining experience in the field of biochemistry. One of the best ways to do so is to apply for summer internships, work study programs for students in the Science department, or any other kind of job that will get you some experience to put on your CV.

, Check the admissions criteria of the schools you are interested in applying to. Make sure to get good letters of recommendations – those from senior faculty members and department chairs carry greater weight than those from research assistants or temporary faculty members.You may have to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) – the general test and/or a subject-specific test – in order to apply to certain graduate programs. Make sure you find out what your desired program requires well in advance so that you’ll have time to study for the exam, register for the exam, and take the exam so that your scores will be ready before the due date for your graduate application., A master’s degree in biochemistry includes time in the classroom, field work, laboratory research, and the presentation of a thesis. There will be a lot of involved time in the laboratory to help prepare you for your future career as a biochemist.A master's degree usually takes two more years after you earn a bachelor's degree.

, While working on your graduate degree, it is important to continue working in the field of biochemistry so that your chances of getting a job when you graduate will be improved.Try getting an internship at a prestigious company that is well-known for hiring biochemists or try to get a job in a lab doing research in biochemistry.

, You can get many entry-level jobs as a biochemist without earning a PhD. However, if you want to go on to teach at the university level or to do independent research of your own, you’ll need to consider getting a doctorate degree in your field.PhDs usually take four to six years past a master’s degree and require a lot of time and dedication. During a PhD program, you will put in many hours in the laboratory and you will probably be asked to teach a few undergraduate classes., Postdoctoral positions are a great way for biochemists to continue their education and their research without committing to a long-term job or project. These jobs can provide opportunities to publish your research findings and gain more experience in the field.You usually need several published studies to find permanent work in research in laboratory settings.

, Many biochemists get jobs in laboratories, especially those with only a bachelor’s degree in the field. Lab technicians help with research in the laboratory, but are supervised by a more qualified scientist/researcher.To find these jobs, you can search various job posting websites., Many governmental agencies want to employ biochemists for a variety of reasons. This includes things like water regulation, food and drug regulation, and other similar things that the government is in charge of.There are many governmental agencies to check for employment opportunities like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),the National Science Foundation (NSF),or the National Institutes of Health (NIH)., Another option for a job as a biochemist is to return to the university in a teaching capacity. You typically apply through the school itself for these kinds of positions.To teach at the university level, you will need at least a master’s degree in this or a related field.
You will be able to teach a new generation of biochemists the skills they’ll need in the field.
You can check postings for teaching positions directly through individual schools or on websites where higher education jobs are frequently posted."

Read lots of books, and lots of reviews.,
Review books on retailer websites.,
Start a book review blog.,
Plan your next moves.,
Seek a professional reviewing job.,
Develop a specialty.,
Follow rules and deadlines.,
Guide the reader into the book.,
Listen to expert advice.",How to Become a Book Reviewer," Let’s face facts: if you don’t love reading, you won’t like being a book reviewer. Read widely to familiarize yourself with the new trends and the lasting staples of the book industry, and read reviews for inspiration and guidance.If you already have your sights set on reviewing for a particular publication, or in a particular field or genre, read lots of relevant reviews. Get a feel for the language, style, and content that reviewers in that vein utilize. Take note of what you feel works and what does not.
Try to realistically assess your skills and commitment. Can you read books quickly but with a full grasp of the material? Do your writing abilities approach the level of the reviewers you’d like to join? Regardless, there are options available to you, but you may need to temper your dreams of achieving fortune or fame. (Although, honestly, you probably shouldn’t see book reviewing as a path to those things anyway!);
, There’s nothing wrong with starting small, in a low-pressure environment. A few people do gain a reputation and even some income by reviewing books on sites like Amazon, but you should view it more as practice that may help some fellow book-lovers along the way.At most, you’ll have to create an account in order to review books, but take the process seriously if you are indeed serious about being a book reviewer. Read the books you review, obviously. Take some time to craft thoughtful critiques that you would be proud to claim as your own.
Even simple reviews like these can be used as samples of your work if you want to advance in the book-reviewing business. So make them good samples.

, If you simply enjoy sharing your thoughts about books you have read, this may be all you need. But it can also potentially be a springboard to bigger things as well.


Once again, focus on producing quality work. You’re the boss and your own editor, but don’t take it easy on yourself. Take some time crafting your reviews, and proofread them. Quality blog reviews can be used as “clips” (samples) for a reviewing job application.After you’ve gotten your blog off the ground, contact publishers about your interest in reviewing their books. You may find yourself being sent free books to review. Your only obligation should be to give the book a fair reading and review (positive or negative), but do disclose to your readers that you were sent a free copy in return for an independent review.Beyond adding to your book collection free of charge, you may be able to make a bit of money through your blog reviews. If you obtain an affiliate code from Amazon, for instance, you will receive a small commission any time someone clicks through the link in your review and buys the book from Amazon. Again, you should disclose this arrangement to your readers., Congratulations. By this point, you can legitimately call yourself a book reviewer. If you have more in mind, but still aren't seeking a career out of it, you still have several options to consider. For instance:


There are numerous book review websites that will provide you with even more free books and perhaps even a bit of cash in return for independent, quality reviews.If you really want to see your name (and work) in print, you can find many literary journals that simply require evidence of your reviewing skills in order to sign you up in a freelance capacity. Again, you may be working for free books or a bit of money.

, If you are determined to work your way up to reviewing books as a career, you’ll need to start making connections and building up your portfolio. Not surprisingly, there aren't thousands of professional book reviewer jobs just sitting around waiting to be filled, so you'll have to be persistent and realistic.Contact a group such as the National Book Critics Circle (NBCC, http://www.bookcritics.org/) and request a directory of book review editors. Use this list to determine which publications to target and which editors to contact.
If you have any inside connections with someone who works at one of the publications, by all means use it to facilitate contact with the editor. You'll need all the help you can get.
Assemble the best “clips” from your existing reviews and contact the review editor(s) at your target publication(s). (Don’t expect to start with the New York Times. Focus first on smaller local or regional publications.) Express your interest and offer to provide your sample work.
Request catalogs from major publishing houses so that you can pitch reviews for forthcoming titles as part of your application. After all, you won't be reviewing books that are already out.
Be persistent but not aggressive with follow-up emails. You want to show your sincere interest without annoying an overburdened review editor.

, There is value in demonstrating that you can review any kind of book, from kids’ stuff to romance novels to biographies. However, demonstrating a particular specialty will make you more marketable if your desire is to become a professional reviewer.Ideally, of course, your area of specialty in book reviews will be based on your personal taste, and your training, education, and/or experience.
Practically speaking, though, if you can fill an area of need with your review specialty, you will improve your odds of snagging a job. Keep up with your reading so that you are familiar with what genres are “hot” in the publishing industry.
Your goal is to become the “go to” person whenever a particular type of book lands on the editor’s desk.

, With your book review blog, you make the rules and set the deadlines. If you want to achieve more as a book reviewer, though, you must quickly learn that making your editor happy is essential.Carefully read over any style or formatting guides, and take word counts seriously. Space is at a premium for most book reviews, so you need to be able to winnow down your writing to the essentials, while still providing the necessary information and critique.
Don’t take on a review if you are not sure that you can complete it on time. Regularly missing deadlines is one of the easiest ways to get on an editor’s bad side — and another willing and capable reviewer can almost always be readily found.

, There is no single correct way to write a book review, of course. Some reviewers emphasize recapping the work, others focus on the critique. With all the information and opinion now available on any given book, however (think of the blogs and Amazon reviews, for instance), a standout review will offer something more.Reading a book, especially a good book, is all about making a personal connection between the reader and the world evoked by the words on the page. Think of it as your job as the reviewer to help prepare potential readers for entering this world. Share your unique experience with the work as a guide for them.

, About forty years ago, the renowned author John Updike came up with a list of six rules for book reviewers. These rules are still widely circulated and embraced by reviewers today, and are well worth considering for any aspiring reviewer. They include:Try to understand what the author intended to write, and don’t punish him or her for something her or she did not attempt to do.
Provide enough quotations from the work to give the review reader a feel for the quality of the prose.
Confirm your description of the work with quotations and other evidence from it.
Limit your plot summary, and never give away the ending. Don’t spoil the experience for others.
When a book is deficient in quality, cite similar examples of good books (perhaps even by the same author). Try to understand and explain what went wrong; don’t just do a “hatchet job.”
Don’t review books your are predisposed to dislike or like (for instance, one written by a friend); don’t see yourself as a caretaker for some tradition or standard of literature; don’t try to put an author “in his place” with your critique; and always review the book, not the reputation.

Get an undergraduate (bachelor's) degree.,
Take science courses.,
Don’t neglect writing courses.,
Understand biological subfields.,
Take courses in a specialization.,
Take part in undergraduate research or internships.Even as an undergraduate, there may be opportunities for you to participate in research.,
Choose potential graduate school programs and apply to them.During your junior year of college, you should develop a list of potential graduate schools (with master’s and/or Ph.D programs in biology) that you would like to attend.,
Complete a graduate program and earn your Ph.D.Earning a Ph.D can take five or more years (potentially longer if you earn a master’s degree first).,
Work at a college or university.,
Work in a government agency.,
Work in private research.,
Work with non-profit organizations.",How to Become a Biologist," Depending on the school you attend, you may be able to major in biology, or a more specific field such as zoology, botany, or microbiology.Neither approach is necessarily better than the other; you can always choose an area of specialization later on in graduate school.


Choose a school based on personal, financial, and social needs.
Bachelor’s degrees typically take about 4 years to complete.;
, Making sure to acquire a broad background knowledge in science is important to becoming a biologist. Aside from obvious courses in biology, biochemistry, and related subjects, it is useful to study subjects including:Chemistry
Physics
Statistics
Computer Science

, Much work that biologists do involves reading and understanding the research publications of others, and writing articles.Writing courses will help you hone your linguistic and research skills. You can seek out writing-intensive science courses, elect to write a senior thesis on a biological subject, or look for courses that will give you opportunities to write, including:


English
Comparative Literature
History
Philosophy

, Terms like “biology” and “zoology” are general terms that refer to the scientific study of living organisms and their environments. There are many subfields of biology that study a specific section of the living world or a specific group of organisms.Most biologists develop expertise in one of these subfields. For example:


Cell biology (also called molecular biology) studies organism  function at the molecular and cellular level.Ecology studies the nature, function, and development of whole ecosystems.Wildlife biologists study animals within their environments or in relationship to humans.Marine and freshwater aquatic biology studies water-based organisms and environments.Marine mammal science studies organisms like whales, sea lions, and manatees.Entomology studies insects, their development, roles in the environments, etc.
Botany (also called plant biology or plant science) studies the nature of plants and their role in environments.

, As an undergraduate, you do not have to choose an area of specialization yet. However, if you are interested in a particular biological subfield, such as microbiology, marine biology, or botany, you can begin taking courses in that area.As an undergraduate, however, you should concentrate on getting a good general science background., These can give you practical lab or field experience, a good sense of what life as a biologist is like, and a network of contacts.


Ask professors at your school if there are opportunities for you to assist in lab work or research projects.
See if there are special undergraduate research programs offered at your school, during the academic year or summer.
Consider completing a senior thesis or capstone project that explores a topic in biology
Seek volunteer, internship, or research opportunities at local labs, colleges and universities, hospitals, wildlife preserves, government agencies, etc.
Talk to your advisor or a professor you know well if you want help finding research and internship opportunities.

, During the first part of your senior year, you should apply to those schools.


It is better to choose schools based on their strength in the area of biology you would like to study rather than their general reputation.
Applications to graduate school usually require letters of recommendation from some of your former professors or lab supervisors, scores from the GRE (Graduate Record Exam), application essays, and other items.
Some students choose to take one or more years off between undergraduate and graduate programs. If you take this approach, you can work in a lab, for a conservation agency, or in another position that will allow you to gain additional skills before applying to graduate school.
Some students choose to get a master’s degree from one school before entering a Ph.D program in another. Other students earn a master’s degree from the same school that awards their Ph.D. Other programs allow students to earn a Ph.D without ever getting a master’s.
The right choice of program for you depends upon your career plans. Research biologists are typically required to have a Ph.D, while master’s degrees may qualify you for some other positions, such as with conservation agencies.

, Graduate programs typically involve coursework, examinations, and extensive research leading to a dissertation project that contributes original knowledge to the field of biology. As a graduate student, you may also author or co-author original research articles.


In many cases, you can receive funding for graduate school through teaching or research assistantships, scholarships, or work opportunities. Ask schools you are interested in applying to about how they fund their graduate students.
If you are interested in working as a professor of biology at a college or university, it is important to get some teaching experience in addition to lab research experience.
Some biologists seek postdoctoral programs (up to several years in length) after completing their graduate program. These can provide additional research and/or teaching experience.

, Biologists that work at colleges or universities may be employed as professors or research associates. Their day-to-day activities may involve teaching undergraduates and/or graduate students, performing original research, supervising the research of others, seeking grants from government, non-profit, and private sources, and serving on various educational committees.


Some biologists may also teach in lower-level educational settings. However, a bachelor’s is ordinarily the highest degree required to teach biology in grade school.
Jobs at colleges and universities are few in number and difficult to achieve. You can increase your chances of getting one by excelling in research, publications, and teaching.

, Governments hire biologists to conduct research, advise policy makers, manage protected environments, and other tasks. Biologists are employed in various government agencies, includingThe Food and Drug AdministrationThe National Park ServiceThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceThe U.S. Geological Survey
State wildlife agencies, Private organizations hire biologists to work in areas such as biotechnology, food science, and pharmaceuticals.These positions are concerned with finding practical solutions (applied research) to problems in medicine, society, or industry. They may seek, for example, to understand the causes of illnesses and diseases., Wildlife preserves, conservation agencies, science museums, nature centers and other organizations offer employment opportunities for biologists.Scientists working for such organizations may help monitor and maintain species and environments, study wildlife, advise policy makers, write essays or journalism on science for the general public, and other tasks.

Demonstrate a knowledge of the company.,
Consider an entry-level opening.,
Be prepared to relocate.,
Look and act like Disney material.",How to Apply for a Disney Job3," Learn the history of the specific Disney company that you are applying to, as well as Disney as a whole. You don't have to memorize every single fact and detail, but absorb enough to demonstrate a more-than-passing familiarity with your potential employer in your cover letter and interviews. Prove yourself to be someone who is passionate about contributing to the company's overall mission, rather than someone who is just seeking a job from the first employer who is willing to hire them.

, Disney companies pride themselves on promoting current employees to fill higher positions, so if you are holding out for one of those, readjust your expectations. Content yourself with an entry-level position at first. From there, aim higher. Excel at your original position. Earn a reputation for reliability, capability, and team spirit, while networking constantly between your peers, supervisors, and other management.If you are deadset on skipping the entry-level positions and landing yourself a high-profile position right away, be sure that you can offer an in-demand skill that they desperately need. Disney companies have a huge workforce to choose from, so set yourself apart from current employees by offering a unique specialization that few other candidates could boast.

, Unless you offer a rare set of skills that few other candidates are likely to possess, anticipate that the company will be more likely to hire someone who is able to respond to an interview request and start work immediately.If you do not already live in the immediate area of the job's location, plan your move as soon as possible. Research the availability of residences and the logistics of moving there before submitting your application. At the same time, set aside a separate budget for travel in order to appear promptly for an in-person interview if required.


If you plan to move to the company's location before applying or being hired, be sure to secure employment with another company until Disney guarantees you a job. Due to its popularity, Disney may receive countless applications for each opening, creating stiff competition for you.
Also be sure to have your own means of transportation, whether it be a car or bike, since many Disney companies are located in cities without reliable bus or train service.

, The more specialized and/or behind-the-scenes your position is, the less you may have to worry about this, but remember that Disney is a family-oriented business. Tailor your appearance accordingly. Style your hair conservatively. Refrain from getting visible or offensive tattoos. Dress professionally for interviews and leave the body jewelry at home.Again, there are many different Disney companies, with each one offering many different positions, so dress codes and professional appearance may be more relaxed in some areas, but err on the side of caution until the job is definitely yours.
Also be sure to keep your record squeaky clean, since Disney retains the right to perform background and criminal checks on its employees at any given time.

You should also take courses on technology or engineering. See if your school offers classes on computer programming or courses like wood shop.
Take a lot of high level math courses. A good knowledge of math is essential to becoming an inventor.

, Learning from others is important to becoming an inventor, and there may be clubs in your school that encourage you to invent. Join a variety of after school clubs that will help you become an inventor.


You could join a club like the Science Olympiads, where you'll learn a lot about science and technology. You could also try joining something like the chess club, which encourages logical thinking. This is also important for becoming an inventor.
In some schools, there are clubs where students work together on a single creation over the course of your semester. See if your school offers a club like this.

, Imagination is vital to becoming an inventor. Engage in a variety of hobbies that feed your imagination and allow you to develop the innovative mind of an inventor.Hobbies like baking sometimes require innovation. If you're out of cinnamon, for example, you'll have to improvise by finding a similar spice.
Playing make believe may seem like a waste of time, but it can actually nurture your imagination. If your characters get into difficult scenarios, you'll have to problem solve following the rules of your imaginary world.
Take initiative in day-to-day moments to be creative. Look for pictures in the clouds. Make a poem about the afternoon rain.

, To start, try to identify where there is a need for a new product. As an inventor, you should have an inquisitive mind. As you look at various products in your day-to-day life, identify gaps in the market. Look for places where there's room for improvement or innovation.Think about what market you're interested in. This would be a good place to start, as you already have some working knowledge of that field. For example, maybe you're interested in music and electronics. Think about items like the iPod and MP3 player. What makes these items desirable?
Tap into what consumers want in a given market. Do people want to better themselves? Do they want entertainment, convenience? Each time you see someone enjoying a product or service, stop and ask yourself, ""Why does this person use this service? What about this product is enjoyable to this person? What need is being met here?""

, With any market, there's always something missing. The best inventors understand the fundamentals of a field and look for where it could be expanded. For example, the people who invented services like Uber and Lyft realized taxi services were no longer cutting it. People wanted a more personalized experience and craved the wide availability and convenience of calling a cab without having to make a phone call or find one on the street. Look into an existing market and ask yourself what is missing.Think about common complaints people have. Going back to the music example, what do your friends complain about regarding their iPods? What features do they want that are not currently provided by Apple?
You can try asking friends to ascertain what's missing. For example, ask your friend, ""If you could change one thing about your iPod, what would you change?"" The answer could give you an idea for an invention for the music industry.

, Some of the greatest inventions are simply expansions or innovations on existing products. Can you think of a new spin on an existing product or service? Can you find a way to make a longstanding, successful invention more convenient and desirable? If so, this may be a great product to try to invent and sell.Research the market before you begin. You want to make sure, as you begin to think of expansions on existing products, that your idea has not been done before. Another inventor may have tried your idea and found it was unsuccessful for a variety of reasons.
Also, make sure your idea is significantly different than the existing idea or product. A tiny change or alteration to an existing service could land you in legal trouble. If your idea is too similar to something on the market, you could get in trouble for infringing on a copyright or patent.

, You may have a great idea, but do you have the skills necessary to produce it? You may have a stellar idea for a phone app, but little experience working with technology. You may have thought of a great idea for a new brand of hiking shoe, but aren't great when it comes to building. As you begin to figure out the skills needed to make your product happen, make a list of talents you need to create the product in question. If you do not have these talents yourself, you may have to dedicate some time to cultivating them before you get things rolling with your product., If you don't have all the skills you need, and do not want to take the time to develop them, do not be afraid to outsource. Inventors can rarely do everything they need to do in order to produce an invention. If you have certain weaknesses, that's okay. You can find others to help you in these areas.You can hire a freelancer for cheap to do certain tasks. For example, you may have a great idea for a phone app but don't know anything about coding or phone technology. Try to find a freelance tech person online and see if they would be willing to do some of the work for you.
You can also network with friends. If you have a friend who has a knack for building things, your friend may be willing to partner up with you to produce those hiking shoes. Just make sure you sort out how to divide finances in the event your invention sells ahead of time.

, Once you've come up with an idea for an invention, you'll need to build a prototype. You can show this to prospective customers and buyers to generate interest in your product. You can also use a prototype as a model when you begin to build your physical product.There are many technologies available now that allow you to build a prototype for a product. Design software like AutoDesk Inventor can help you build a digital prototype of your invention.
While working digitally can help, you can also try to make a small physical prototype. This may be especially helpful if your invention is something physical, like some kind of exercise equipment. Building a prototype will allow you to tinker with materials and experiment, eventually finding the right blend of materials to make your invention as solid as possible.

, Once you have a solid prototype of your product, begin showing it off. There are a variety of ways you can generate interest in your idea. You want to look for potential investors and buyers.One way to build interest for your idea is to attend trade shows. Here, people show of new and innovative products. You could look into getting your own booth at a trade show and display your product. You could also network with other inventors and get a sense of what similar products are out there. You may have to tweak your product to give yourself an edge over the competition.
Talk to a market research firm if it's within your budget. This can give you a sense of trends in the market you're working in, as well as general demographics. You can reach out to key members of that market through things like online surveys to see if your product has a chance of selling., If you believe you have a product that could potentially sell, contact a patent lawyer. You will want to get a patent on your product to make sure it doesn't get stolen by a competitor. It's vital to protect your intellectual property, especially if you think there's a market for it, so make sure you contact a patent lawyer. Search for a lawyer online, or in your local yellow pages, and make an appointment to discuss your product.Patent law is very complicated, so do not attempt to file a patent on your own unless you have extensive legal experience. If you have a friend who works in law, and who knows patent law, you may want to see if he or she will do some work for a discount price. Filing a patent is expensive in and of itself, so cut costs along the way where you can.
Patents costs between $3,000 and $10,000 to file. While that may sound like a lot, if you've determined there's a market for your product it's well worth the cost. Patents take awhile to go through. It may take 3 years until you've successfully patented your product. You can use this time to continue researching the market and tweaking your product to meet consumer needs.

, It can be expensive to patent and market your product to the right audience. Consider doing an online marketing campaign through a site like Kickstarter or GoFundMe. In addition to giving the money necessary to get your product off the ground, this can also help generate public interest.Remember your target audience and think about the best way to reach them. A younger audience, for example, may be on outlets like Facebook and Twitter while an older audience may respond better to mass emails. You should keep your audience up-to-date on your goals and let them know how close you are to reaching them.
Tell your audience about your product and be honest about how the money will be used. People will be more likely to donate if they know where their money is going. For example, how much do you need for a patent? How much do you need for supplies?
Allow people to share information easily. Have a sidebar on your fundraising page that allows people to quickly post details of your page to social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter.

, After generating public interest and patenting your product, decide what you want to do with your idea. Investors usually either sell licenses of their products to larger companies, or create and sell products themselves. Figure out which path is right for you.If you want to sell the product yourself, consider whether you have the time and resources to do so. If you intend to sell on your own, you may have to quit your current job or scale your hours back. You should also weigh the costs of the resources it will take to build the product. Do you have the materials and skills necessary?
The upside to selling your license is that you make money from royalties. You may not have to quit your current job, or alter your current lifestyle too much, in order to make money. However, keep in mind you may be giving up a lot of money this route. On average, patent holders make about 2-7% of retail sales on their products. If your product sells well, however, this could still translate to a lot of money.

, Good inventors do not get too attached to their ideas. Not every idea you have will be a winner. Some ideas simply do not work. Be ready to give up on an idea if it's not practical.Be willing to detach yourself from your ideas. Do not personalize rejection. Some ideas simply do not work as well as others. Your idea may have been done before or it may simply not appeal to most people in your target market.
Becoming an inventor is about numbers. The more ideas you have, the more likely you are to find one that works. Do not waste time holding on to a bad idea if you want to be an inventor.

, Even if you think you have a solid idea, keep your day job. You want to make sure you have a steady source of income until you start regularly making money from an invention. In the world of inventing, a lot is left up to chance. Even if you think you have an investor in your idea, a lot of could still go wrong. It may take years before you have a successful invention, so keep your day job until then., Rejection will happen along the way to success. If you want to be an inventor, you need to learn to take rejection in stride. If you do not do so, you'll have trouble succeeding in the field.


Rejection happens to everyone. Try to remember most successful people faced rejection at some point in their professional lives.
You should also keep in mind that rejection is rarely personal. There are thousands of products on the market. Just because yours did not sell or appeal to anyone does not mean it was not a good idea. It may just have failed to generate interest due to so much competition.

"
Look very carefully at each advert that is of interest to you.,
When you get a feel for what the job is about and what's expected of an applicant, set about reading ""between the lines"", to uncover what's not openly stated.,
Once you've worked out what the job is all about, take a highlighter pen and mark every clause or phrase where it states what the actual requirements are.

,
Read the advert again carefully to see if these needs are essential or merely desirable.,
Look for the crucial need (if there is one).,
For your own sake in terms of future fulfillment in the job, consider what outcomes you'd be expected to achieve in this job and whether you feel capable of this.,
When you have done all this analysis and you still see a good match, go ahead and draft your response letter.",How to Analyze Adverts for Job Applications," Read it through several times until you get the feel and an understanding of what’s being described. A typical job advertisement contains:


A statement about the organization and how it perceives itself in the market.
A statement about the job, in terms of what is involved and what a person doing it already (whether or not the position yet exists) would be doing daily.
A list of the selection criteria for any prospective applicant.
Details on how to apply for the job.;
, In doing so, try to deduce if there is one particular crucial need or if there is anything else you could infer from the words in the advertisement. It’s also useful to read the advertisement critically and ask “have they left anything out? Anything not covered when you feel that it should have been could affect your suitability.


It's a good idea to prepare specific questions about the things you either don't understand or don't see clarified in the job advertisement. Phone the contact of the company or agency and ask these questions. The answers will form part of your assessment of the advertisement and your own suitability.
When phoning, take care not to ""get interviewed"" as part of the call. Make it clear that you're seeking more information and even make an excuse to get off the phone and call back later if it seems that you're already getting interviewed (this can happen with smaller organizations sensing your keenness).
Also consider future needs and drivers of this job. What else will the company potentially need from this role down the track?
Consider what skills and experience you have that would be ideal for this position but that are not mentioned by the job. You'll need to ""sell"" these to the employer who may not be aware of the relevance but don't dismiss them for this reason.

,, This is known as a ""filter""; it's a way to eliminate applicants so that those interviewing don't have to expend additional time interviewing people lacking the relevant skills and qualifications.


When you analyze the advert some phrases will stand out. These all shout essential at you, so look for similar phrases that you can match yourself against. Examples of what to look for include:

“it is essential that you…"" (a bit of a giveaway), or
“you must have…"", or
“you will have…""


Other advertisements are not so firm. In this case, the advertisement is saying ""desirable"" but not essential. Such advertisements may say:

“you should have…"", or
“some knowledge of…"", or
“ideally…"".


You should be able to meet more than 60 percent of the essential requirements which form the backbone of the job if you are to be seriously considered. It is optimal to be able to meet all of the essential requirements but there is some leeway for lateral skills and experience.
The desirables are nice-to-haves and the more of these you meet the better, but they are not the main issue. However, you can cover these in the letter of application (cover letter) to try to increase your chances of scoring an interview.

, If you don’t have it, then don’t proceed. This one is the killer and will knock you straight out.


If you do have it… make sure it’s the first thing you mention in your response. That says “this candidate understands what we need"".

, Also look to what opportunities and possibilities are in the job and whether you have the skills and personal qualities needed to make the most of these opportunities. Finally, but importantly, what challenges or barriers do you see as part of this job and do you think they're surmountable or likely to trip you up? Being honest now can save a whole lot of pain later; you might see the potential difficulties but rationalize that on-the-job training will overcome it; on the other hand, you might feel that no amount of training will change your inability to handle pressure, deadlines or multi-tasking, etc.

, You should try to follow the style of writing shown in the advertisement by using similar phrases and words. However, don’t just regurgitate their advert back to them; they want to know that you've really digested the job and you're able to phrase your suitability to it in your own words.

Analyze your skills by listing your top ten achievements or career events that you are most proud of.,
Ask yourself exactly what you did (try: where did I start?),
Consider what skills you used when you did the thing you achieved (how did I do that?,
List all of your skills so you can rate them for transferability; most of your skills will transfer to another job quite easily.,
Draw yourself a square box.",How to Analyze Your Skills and Job Options," You should do this by looking at your achievements, which are your richest source of information providing concrete and tangible evidence of what you have done so far. Use an active verb at the beginning of the phrase, and you’ll hear how much more powerful it sounds.;
, Then think about what happened next (or perhaps - what did I say?).

, What did I need to do it?) You'll end up with very clear statements of your real capabilities.

, Think not just ""how good am I?"" but ask ""how much do I enjoy this?"" The skills that score most highly on both counts are your most transferable skills and you will be able to use them in many different settings. Write them down (score them out of 10 then add up); the highest skills analysis scores are the ones you can use in your self-marketing statements to best effect.

, Divide this box into four by drawing a horizontal line across the middle and a vertical line up through the middle. The horizontal line we're going to call ""Enjoy Doing"" with a scale running from left to right. The vertical line we're going to call ""Good At"" with the scale running from bottom to top; what we've got now is a 2 x 2 quadrant so admired by MBAs.


At the top left we've got high ""Good At"" with low ""Enjoy Doing"" so this is often where we've developed a high level of skill to deal with a task that's unavoidable but we don't want to do any more than is strictly necessary. Some people who don't manage their careers too well often end up here because their organizations push them to where they're seen to be good. Think about the Finance Assistant who ends up as an unwilling Credit Controller because he had some success getting some bills paid.






Lower left is where too many people find themselves job wise - doing something they don't enjoy and are not particularly good at. This is where necessity and stress sometimes come head-to-head, causing regular sick-leave. You'd be advised to try to change this if it's you.






Lower right is where enjoyment is high but skill not necessarily so. The person who enjoys amateur dramatics may be an example or a spare-time painter or the average DIYer.






The small square at the top right is where the high scales of ""Good At"" and ""Enjoy Doing"" end up, and this is where we all want to be. Success usually springs from enjoying and being good at something, but only if you want to repeat it. To choose your options bear this in mind and don't start with a job title. Instead start with the ingredients of a successful role, based on your honest appraisal of what you enjoy and want to do, plus an objective view of what you are good at and can replicate.

Accept the salary if you think it’s reasonable.,
Negotiate the salary if you aren’t satisfied with the original offer.,
Inquire about the benefits.,
Ask about vacation.,
Accept the offer over the phone first.,
Express your appreciation.,
Ask for a written letter.,
Ask about the start date.,
Address the email to the person who offered you the position.,
Make your email brief.,
Clarify any questions you may have had.,
Inform the contact of any scheduling conflicts.,
Accept the offer directly.,
Read over the email.",How to Accept a Job Offer," Ask yourself if the salary is appropriate for the area you will live, your personal budget, and the amount of experience you have in your profession. You can figure out if the salary is appropriate by checking salary guides online, talking to mentors, or looking into what the company usually pays employees in your position. If you don’t think the offer is reasonable, you can try to negotiate the salary., If you’ve done your research and feel that the offer isn’t enough, then you can try to negotiate for a salary that you would be happier with. Negotiating salary is not unusual, so don’t feel shy about doing it. Come up with an amount that you think is realistic. Then, contact your potential employer by phone, email, or in person and tell them what your ideal salary would be. Keep in mind that they may say reject the offer. If they do, ask to take some time to make a counter offer or have a counter offer ready.Explain to them why you would be a valuable employee and why your ideal salary is reasonable.
Tell the potential employer how you are genuinely interested in the job.
Do not get defensive if the answer is no in the end.

, Benefits should be considered along with salary. Benefits include important things like healthcare, but it also includes more minor things. Consider if your company has a gym, wellness programs, tuition reimbursement, and flexible hours. You can negotiate for your benefits when and if you negotiate salary. It’s also an option to negotiate for better benefits if the company is unwilling to compromise on salary.Benefits also include your 401(k), travel stipend, and paid time off.
You should research what benefits are typical for someone in your position.
Check out what the company’s competition offers as a benefits package if possible.

, You shouldn’t ask to go on vacation right away, but it’s okay to ask what the vacation package is like. Consider how much vacation you will need to visit family or keep from burning out at work. If the offer has less days than expected, you could try to negotiate. Research what the typical vacation time is for someone in your position with your level of experience. Come up with an amount of vacation time that seems reasonable. Present this amount of time when and if you negotiate for salary and benefits., You may be offered the job directly on the phone. If not, you might be asked to call back. It's best to call the hiring manager responsible for interviewing you. You can go ahead and let them know that you intend to accept the offer, or have questions answered first before accepting.Don't leave a voice message indicating your acceptance of the job offer. If the hiring manager isn't present, leave a voice message indicating you'd like to talk to them about the job offer.

, It’s important to express your gratitude for the opportunity. Let them know how excited or thrilled you are to have been offered the position. If you aren’t ready to say yes at this point in the call, expressing appreciation is vague enough to let them know you’re interested without committing before questions have been answered., Once you’ve had all of your questions answered, ask for the details of this conversation to be sent to you in writing. Ask them to write down the salary, benefits, start, and start dates that were discussed during the phone call. That doesn’t show your potential employer that you don’t trust them. It’s just a way to protect yourself in case the employer goes back on their word., It’s especially important to know this if you currently have a job that you need to give notice to. You can ask for a later start date if the date given doesn’t work for you. Don’t push it too much, though., You can address it to a different person if you are asked to, though. Make sure to write down your contact information and phone number at the end so the employer can get in touch with you.

, Your future employer may already know that you've accepted the job, so don't ramble on about how good of a fit you are and what you can offer the company. They know this by now if they offered you the position. You should, however, include the following:Thanks and appreciation for the opportunity
Direct acceptance of the job offer
Starting date of employment

, Because it's sometimes tough to recall every single detail of the job before you've actually started it, you may need to ask your contact questions about your future employment. Don’t feel like you’re being annoying. This is expected by the employer. These questions can include, but are not limited to:


Questions about supervisors and/or who you'll be reporting to.
Questions about work eligibility and/or visa requirements if accepting a job overseas.

, This may not be applicable, but it is good to let them know if there will be any conflicts. You don’t want to surprise them after you’ve started the job. Be sure to remind your liaison of any dates you will not be able to work on because you scheduled something before you accepted the position.


For example, if you agreed to travel across the country for your grandfather's 80th birthday two weeks after your start date, inform your liaison that you won't be able to work those days because of a prior scheduling conflict

, Finally, you can say “yes” to the offer. Congratulations! You can say something like “I would be happy to accept this position.” Or, “I’m thrilled to accept the offer and become a team member.”, Make sure that your email is well-written and that you've proofread it for typos and grammatical errors. Even though you already have been offered the job, you want to make sure all your correspondence is professional. They likely won’t revoke the offer due to a few grammatical errors, but it could be embarrassing."

Place your address on the top right, followed by the date—spelled out.
Below that, on the left, place the recipient's name (if known) and address.
Open the letter with a formal business greeting. Ex:
Dear Ms. Smith,
Dear Sir or Madam, (if you don't know the recipient's name)

, Let the company know right off the bat that you believe in this person. You don't have to be over the top or insincere, but a positive note to start will make a big difference.


""It makes me extremely happy to recommend Michael for the position of Director of Development at XYX Corporation.""
""Any company should count themselves lucky to have an employee as bright, friendly, and dedicated as Gina.""
""No matter what she does, Helena Bonham does it well.""

, Give some context for your recommendation. Let the reader know how you met them, how you worked together, and your basic qualifications.


""As VP of Application Development, I was Michael's direct supervisor from 2009 through 2012. We worked closely together on several key projects, and I got to know him very well during this time.
""I was both Gina's adviser and teacher throughout her time at Hamilton College. I watched her shine both in the classroom and in office hours, and had the joy of watching her meet and then exceed expectations with her thesis.""
""As the Dean of Students, I deal with many young people throughout the day. However, I was lucky to spend several hours a week with Ms. Bonham in her role as Committee President. In my 32 years as Dean, I have rarely been so impressed.""

, Describe what the person has done using specific instances and examples, rather than generalities. Whenever possible, give evidence or stories to back yourself up.


""Michael's sophisticated grasp of database architecture, combined with an innate feel for UX design and a warm, personal approach to his in-company client base dramatically improved the productivity of our company's merchandising, creative, and editorial departments. His approach to managing application support, maintenance, and training was highly professional and greatly respected, both by end users and by the executive team.""
""Gina was always inquisitive but never pushy. Despite being able to answer almost any question, Gina would rather sit back and help others find the answer for themselves. Countless students, who I thought were doomed to struggle, happily told me how tutoring sessions with Gina helped them turn the corner. And I had many conversations, both as her professor and a peer, that I will remember happily for years.""
""When Ms. Bonham hears the word ""no,"" you can almost see the gears start to turn. She is mover and a shaker -- interfacing with students, faculty, staff, and even outside agencies to find solutions to any problem.""

, To put the candidate's accomplishments into perspective, include comparisons so that the recipient will have some basis to understand why you are recommending this person.


""Michael's output of completed projects has exceeded the combined results of all other development efforts I've witnessed during my 8 years at UVW Company.""
""The best students are ones that genuinely love to learn. A student that pushes themselves ever day to learn more and be better, and enjoys every minute. Gina is that kind of student.
""I can say with confidence that my job working with the Student Committee was never easier, nor more enjoyable, than when I got to work with Ms. Bonham.""

, Don't put the candidate on a pedestal. Not only does it not look plausible, it will also set expectations for them that will be next to impossible to meet. If they have an Achille's heel, don't exaggerate it, but don't hide it, either.


""Despite coming in as a novice, Michael has worked hard to improve his documentation and commenting of scripts and processes, making it easier for those filling his shoes in the future to work effectively.""
""Gina is always on the move -- tutoring, taking classes, joining clubs, etc. -- and though her schedule is perhaps too tightly packed, she somehow manages it all with a smile on her face.""
""Of course, Ms. Bonham's determination and drive occasionally led to butting heads and conflicting opinions. However, though she is never one to shy away from conflict, Ms. Bonham passion was never mean-spririted or rude.""

, Begin each paragraph with a punchy, active affirmation of the candidate's qualities or character. Strong verbs are your friend.


Don't say ""Over the course of the last couple years, I have been pleased to watch the ongoing development of Michael's talents."" Say instead, ""Michael's skills have grown rapidly in the last couple years.""
""Gina exhibits the drive and dedication of the best students. Her writing is clear and concise, a rarity among many young people but effortless for her.""
""Ms. Bonham fights for what she believes is right, even if it doesn't mesh with her own preferences. This clear-eyed and selfless attitude will catapult her far in life.""

, Reiterate your recommendation of the candidate and, if appropriate, invite the recipient to contact you.


For example, say, ""For all of these reasons, I think Michael will make a fine addition to your team. Should you have any questions, I invite you to contact me at the number or address, above.""
""Gina is the kind of person I would love to hire to work for me, and I know she will be an incredible asset for you.""
""I have no qualms about giving Ms. Bonham the highest recommendation for the position. If you have any questions, please contact me.""

, Above all, be professional. If the you're sending a physical letter, print it out and sign it by hand. Otherwise, just typing your name will do.


""Sincerely,""
""Best regards,""
""Thank you,""

, Don't ramble, but do flesh out your key points. Try to keep it at one page, covering the various aspects of their recommendation in brief, specific detail.

Your qualifications, how you know the candidate, general recommendation.



Professional Success

Why they will be effective, productive workers. Examples of successes.



Personal Testimony

Why they will be a great addition to work and office culture.

, Is it for an academic post, a job, a volunteer position, a background check, or a personal reference? Write your letter so that it is focused on this purpose.


For example, if the letter is part of a job application package, it should focus on the professional qualifications and conduct of the candidate.

, Get a copy of the job description, if you can, and talk to the person you will recommend. If you know the intended recipient of the letter, ask them about the position as well.


The more you know about the position, the better you will be able to tailor your letter to suit the needs of both parties.

, Spend some time talking to them about their goals and the position they are applying for. Gather together their current resume, any memos or notes you may have on them, and any other information that will help you as you write the letter. The best recommendations are thorough and specific, and having all the information at hand will make the process much easier.


You put your own reputation on the line when you write a letter of recommendation. If you feel you do not know the person well enough, or they are somebody you cannot in good conscience recommend, decline their request.

, If you're not sure of your letter-writing skills, or if your letter will carry a great deal of weight for the candidate's application, ask for feedback from a trusted colleague who may also know the candidate. If you are putting your reputation on the line for this person, you want to put your best foot forward with this letter.

Being laid off
Losing a job because of downsizing
Quitting because of harassment or significant family responsibilities;
, You must meet your state's ""base pay"" requirements, which ultimately determine the amount and duration of your unemployment insurance benefits. Each state computes this differently, though most will look at your earnings over the last 12 months that you worked.


Some states will set a flat dollar amount for qualification. For example, you should have made at least $2,500 over the past 12 months in order to qualify.Other states will set a minimum based on your highest paying quarters. For example, a state may set a flat dollar amount that you must have earned in your highest quarters.A state may also combine this calculation method with a requirement for a certain amount earned over the entire 12 month base period. For example, a state may require that you have earned at least $2,000 in your highest earning quarter, and also require that you have earned 150% of that ($3,000) over the entire 12 months.
Another popular method is to require that you have earned a certain amount based on a multiple of your weekly unemployment insurance benefit. In these cases, states will calculate your minimum payment based on your highest paying quarters. Then, they will require that you have made some multiple (usually 40 times) that minimum weekly payment. For example, if you qualify for $150 a week based on your highest paying quarter, then you will need to have made at least $6,000 over the entire 12 month period to qualify for any benefit., Unemployment benefits are available only for those lawfully living in the United States and who have proper work authorization at the time they claim unemployment benefits. You are eligible if:


You are a United States citizen.
You reside in the United States as a lawful permanent resident.You permanently reside in the Unites States “under the color of law,” which typically means that Congress has enacted a law allowing you to be in the country during the base period., Once you receive your denial notice, read it carefully. In most cases you will be denied for not meeting one or more of the eligibility requirements outlined in Part 1.

, Each state has its own appeal process. However, the two most common ways to appeal are to fill out a form or to draft a letter.


An appeal form may be included with the denial letter. If not, contact your state's unemployment agency, at the phone number or address listed in the denial letter.
If you have to submit an appeal by letter, then you should keep your appeal simple. You do not want to say anything that could hurt your case.
An acceptable letter would state: ""I am appealing 's decision to deny me unemployment insurance benefits. I believe the agency made a mistake and that I am entitled to benefits under the law."" Also include your full name, telephone number, social security number, and your unemployment insurance claim number (if provided).

, You should appeal as soon as possible. States have a statute of limitations period for appealing. Though you may be very emotional at losing a job and being denied benefits, you must nevertheless meet the filing deadline or else your appeal could be dismissed.


In California, you have 20 calendar days from the mailing date of the denial letter.In Connecticut you have 21 days,and in Maryland you only have 15 days from the date the decision was mailed., A critical piece of information may be your insurance file. Some states maintain a file, which you can ask to see.


The file may contain statements from your employer, for example, detailing why you were laid off. The information may be unflattering and difficult to read. Nevertheless, you will want to know what your employer will claim at the hearing.
Ask for the file as soon as you receive your denial letter. You want to give yourself enough time to read it so that you can know what kind of evidence you need.

, At the hearing you have the opportunity to present evidence to support your claim that you are entitled to unemployment insurance benefits. You can also rebut any claim made by your employer. Review the denial letter and locate the grounds for denial. Then gather documents and contact witnesses who can support you.


For example, if you were denied benefits because you allegedly failed to meet the earnings requirement, then you should bring pay stubs to support your claim.
If you were denied because you quit your job for unacceptable reasons, then you could invite a former co-worker to testify who can support your claim that you left because of ongoing sexual harassment.
If you want a witness to appear, be sure to subpoena him or her. Subpoenas should be available from your state’s unemployment insurance agency., Agencies base their decision to deny benefits in part on rules and other cases that define key terms. For example, if the state agency determines that you were fired for ""misconduct,"" then you will want to know what qualifies as ""misconduct.""


The agency may tell you upfront how it defines certain terms. For example, Michigan defines “misconduct” as “willful or wanton disregard of the employer’s interest, or negligence of such seriousness as to imply disregard of the employer’s interest.” Nevertheless, you will want to read the facts of different cases to provide context and detail as to precisely what conduct rises to the level of “wanton disregard” or “negligence.”
Not every state publishes its decisions or rules. Visit your state agency's website and look for a link.

, Losing a job is incredibly stressful, and being denied unemployment compensation only compounds the stress. An attorney can ease the process of preparing for the hearing. If costs are a concern, seek out low-cost alternatives:


Contact your local bar association and ask about pro bono representation. Some attorneys may be willing to represent you for free.
Contact local legal services organizations. Many large cities have organizations that will offer free assistance. In Washington, D.C., these organizations include Workers Rights Clinic. Other organizations include the Employment Justice Center.
Some states provide advocates who will work for free. In Michigan, both employees and employers can seek the free assistance of an advocate.

, Depending on your state, unemployment insurance appeals will be conducted either in person or by telephone. For instance, Texas holds appeal hearings by telephone. Either way, an administrative law judge or representative from your state unemployment insurance agency will conduct the hearing.


The hearing will probably be recorded in order to make a record.
The agency representative will open with introductory remarks.
You should give yourself plenty of time to get to the hearing. If you fail to attend, then your appeal will probably be denied and you will not be allowed to refile your appeal.

, You will be asked questions related to your insurance claim. This is your opportunity to explain why you are entitled to unemployment insurance benefits and to present evidence.


Your employer may also attend the hearing and ask you questions. Try to remain calm and professional regardless of how angry you feel.
If you have an attorney, practice being asked tough questions about your job performance. Even a few practice runs will make the actual experience of being examined less surprising.

, You also can present the testimony of other witnesses, as well as cross-examine any witnesses your employer offers.


Witnesses must have first-hand knowledge of any event they testify about. If someone witnessed harassment, be sure to call that person as a witness. A different co-worker cannot testify as to what she heard someone else tell her.

, Your state agency will send you a decision after the hearing. The decision will state the facts found as well as the basis for the decision.


If you lose, you may appeal again. The deadline and rules regarding further appeals will vary by state but should be included in your letter.
If not, contact the agency at the phone number or email address listed.

Sit back and wait.",How to Write a Follow Up Email for a Job Application," Though there are mixed reports about how long you should wait to follow up on a job application, the general consensus is that you should follow-up no sooner than three to five days. Some say that you should wait a full week or longer, while others say that five business days is appropriate. Just remember that it's likely that dozens, or even hundreds, of applicants applied for the same position as you did, and that it takes time to sort through applications and find qualified candidates for the next round; you don't want to seem pushy or impatient by following up too soon.In fact, some hiring managers say that they prefer not to receive follow up emails at all. They believe that this tactic is attention-grabbing and takes away from the time they need to select qualified candidates; that said, other hiring managers say that following up will make you stand out and will show your enthusiasm and passion for the position.;
, Ideally, you should address your email to the same person you reached out to when you applied for the job. If you have the person's name, then this will show that you've really done your research; if you've searched everywhere and can't find it, then ""Dear Hiring Manager"" may be the best you can do.If you do enough poking around on the company's website, you may be able to find the contact information for the hiring manager.
You can also check out the company's page on Linked In to see if you can find contact info for a hiring manager there.
You should avoid calling the office to ask about the name of the hiring manager. If you can't find the name of the point of contact, don't call just to ask.
Always check the spelling of someone's name. Nothing can create a negative connection quicker than misspelling someone's name.

, Once you know the name of the hiring manager, just write ""Dear"" in front of it before you get into the body of your email, just as you did when you wrote your cover letter; ""Dear Mr. Smith"" is an appropriate salutation. Don't try to get chummy or informal and say ""Hi"" or ""Hey"" just because it's an email; it's important to keep things on the formal side.


As for the subject of your email, something simple like, ""Application Follow-Up for Editor Position"" will do the trick. If the position had a reference or requisition number, then you can add that to the subject.
Remember that the hiring manager may be hiring for multiple positions at once, so it's important to be as specific as possible. You can even put your name in the subject to make it easier for the hiring manager to find your application.

, Keep it short and simple. Just start off by saying when you applied for the position, how you found it, and that you have not heard back. You can add that you would like to make sure that the hiring manager received your materials if you didn't get any kind of confirmation of receipt; this is a sneaky way of following up. You can say something simple like this:Dear Mr. Smith,



Last week, I applied for the Editor position you advertised through Jobster. I have not yet heard back from Writerly Company regarding this position and would like to confirm that my application was received.





, Now, in just one or two sentences, you should tell the hiring manager that you're excited to apply for the position and explain why you'd be a great fit. This makes the email more than just a pesky ""checking in"" email, but one that reinforces your qualifications for the position. You can say something simple, like this:My enthusiasm and experience make me a great fit for this position. I have been an editor for a lifestyle magazine for the past five years and am excited about the opportunity to take my writing and editing experience to the next level with your company.

, Close with a positive statement saying that you look forward to hearing from them soon; make an offer to resend any files in case they were not forwarded to them correctly and reaffirm your contact details while making sure to thank the hiring manager for his or her time. Keep it short and simple while showing how much the position would mean to you. You can say something like this:



Please contact me at any time if you have questions about my qualifications or need any additional materials. I look forward to hearing from you and want to thank you for your time.



Sincerely,
Martha Jones





, Give the email a break for a small period of time and come back to it. Check for spelling and grammar mistakes and assess and fine tune the general flow of the email. Getting this right can be as important as having a polished cover letter and resume, so give it the attention it deserves.


You can even try reading your draft out loud to make sure it flows smoothly and makes sense. This can also give you a sense of whether or not you've maintained an enthusiastic, respectful tone.

, Once you have completed the necessary checks and you are happy with the email, send away. But do not send more than once––the last thing the hiring manager needs is 50 emails from you by misclicking on the send button. Take a deep breath, click that send button, and step away from the computer for a while.

, Now that your email is complete, give it some breathing room. Do not follow up with a phone call 30 minutes later to make sure they got the email and do not write another email tomorrow. At this point, you can consider that you tried your best to apply for the position: You submitted a strong application and followed up on it. Be confident that the strength of your resume and cover letter coupled with your persistence in following up, will put you in a strong position to land an interview.


Don't be discouraged if you don't hear back right away. It can take hiring managers weeks to sort through the applications of potential candidates, and some of them may never reach out to you at all because they are so overwhelmed with work. Try not to take this personally and move on toward your next opportunity.
Though some people are tempted to follow up over the telephone, you should make sure you've been patiently waiting before you consider this move. This can also make you stand out as a candidate, but it may also come off as pushy, so make sure you sound confident, remind the hiring manager why you're a good fit, and stay respectful if you do decide to make that call.

Think and stay positive about your abilities and the available jobs.,
Look back over your previous job-hunting effectiveness for the past year.,
Consider whether you need to brush up your professional or technical skills.,
Start looking for suitable positions.,
Prepare well for interviews.,
Be patient.",How to Set Your Sights on a New Job in the New Year," While the economic times are still low, your worth shouldn't be; you're a valuable asset to any company and this is how you need to think about yourself. Whatever the doldrums in the economy, there are still jobs to be had for the right person in your field, and this year it's going to be you. If you've been hunting around for a time, use the vibe of New Year to reinvigorate your search and to get back into the swing of searching further afield with eagerness. It is important to keep in mind that your attitude and posture will impact the way that a potential employer feels about you, so if you're not feeling positive, this will come across in the interview.


Do things that maintain your confidence. Volunteer part-time in a place that appreciates your skills. The gratitude and the feedback will help to maintain your morale and the volunteering can continue to show your interest in what you're doing, as well as your continued updated experience.
If you're feeling low after a period of searching and not getting far, this is a good time to regroup and think about ways to bolster your confidence. If you're concerned that you may be suffering from a very low dip in self-esteem, consider talking to your doctor or therapist about options to overcome this fallen resilience. If you're just feeling flat, use this time to spruce up your image by getting a new haircut, buying something new to wear to interviews, or changing something about your clothes, fashion style, or makeup that represents the slightly older, slightly wiser you this year.;
, If you've been job-hunting for a while, this may suggest that it's time to reassess your approach and to inject new strategies into your job-hunting. Even if you haven't been looking until spurred by a New Year's resolution, the following tips are a good steer:


Think about unsuccessful applications and interviews. Try to pinpoint what you did or didn't do that probably lost you the opportunity and a make a decision to remedy that part of your job-hunting.
Go through your CV. Look at how to improve it and how to represent yourself in a stronger light. What areas are you underselling yourself in? Just as some people exaggerate their values, quite a few more people make the opposite mistake of downplaying their skills and accomplishments. Think about what you have done so far and look for transferable skills and experiences that you can offer a new employer – this will help you to step out of the rut of staying within your same job type and will open up many more job possibilities. Stick to the truth, use concrete examples to back up your transferable skills and move yourself beyond your current or previous job description.
Have someone else read through your CV to pick up on mistakes and to check that it is making sense in the most concise way possible. If possible, have someone familiar with the industry you're aiming at working in read through your CV to see if it would make their radar pick up. It is important not to be defensive about needing help from other people to prepare yourself as best as possible for the job market; find people you can trust and who resonate with you and you'll receive invaluable guidance.

, This might be a great time of year to enroll in courses that build on or extend your existing knowledge, as a way to improve your job prospects. If you're already working, look for courses offered within your organization. If not, there are many opportunities offered through community colleges, night classes, and other courses that can boost your existing skills, whether or not you have college degrees. Sometimes it's the smaller but more specific skills that can set you apart from the other equally qualified people seeking the same job, and if having an up-to-date first aid certificate or computing skill can boost your chances, then give the course some consideration.

, The broader your potential job pool, the better chances you'll have at finding a new job this new year. Don't be shy at selecting as many relevant jobs as possible that match your skill set and are realistically doable for you.


Think beyond where you live. While this might be a scary thought initially, if you are prepared to relocate from where you currently live, you widen the potential job pool even more, especially if you're prepared to move to a place that is a hub for the skills you've got. Even overseas might prove a promising option if you're keen and able to move this far.

Network more. Networking is important for finding new jobs, and people are more inclined to feel positively about someone they've met and connected with positively than only knowing a cover letter and CV. Don't overdo the job hunting around them though; simply be positive, interesting and interested in them, and try to keep in touch with them after meeting.
Take great care with your cover letter. One-size-fits-all cover letters are the least likely to get you the job; personalize the cover letter to the job in question every single time. Make sure the cover letter is addressed to the person who will be reading it, clearly point out how you meet the requirements outlined in the job description and keep it short (about 3 to 4 paragraphs).Read How to write a cover letter for more details.

, Common interview mistakes include dressing down, not knowing much (or anything!) about the place you'd like to work for, and poor interview mannerisms. If you have problems with interviews, it is possible to get coaching but if that's not an affordable option, at least read as much as possible about interview techniques, and even better, have a friend or family member role play interview situations with your, using a range of normal to tricky questions. This will help to build your confidence, as well as getting you habituated to being interviewed and answering questions quickly but well.


Anticipate the key questions such as telling the interviewer your strengths and weaknesses, what you bring to the job, what interests you about the company and position, your willingness to work extra hours/travel/relocate, the ways in which your previous experience is relevant, and being asked if you have any questions. For some industries and jobs, it is also important to have a realistic but fair idea of what salary you believe is appropriate.
Read How to prepare for interview questions thoroughly, How to perform well in interviews, and How to limit your mistakes during a job interview for suggestions on interview preparation.

, While this is your New Year's resolution, changing or getting a new job can take time and much of the year may pass before you find a new job. Provided you're expecting it to take time, you're less likely to fret and more likely to persist, which is important in ensuring that you don't lose sight of what you really want from your resolution to get a new job.


Plan a timeline. While you're still feeling enthusiastic and full of renewed vigor about the New Year, making a plan for the coming year's job search is useful because it can determine your goals for job-hunting this year and it will serve as a reminder of where you're headed should you find yourself feeling off course later during the year.

Try to get an offense sealed or expunged from your record.",How to Get a Job with a Criminal Record1," In some cases, you don't have to tell a potential employer about your history. Such cases may include:When an arrest is not currently pending or doesn't result in a conviction
You're going through a pre-trial adjudication for an offense that isn't criminal by statute
A minor drug offense occurred, and a certain number of years have passed since the conviction
You've erased your offense by obtaining a certificate of rehabilitation or a similar document
You were convicted by a juvenile court and you are now an adult. You may need to have your juvenile records sealed or expunged
;
, The nature of your conviction matters. Certain types of convictions will disqualify you for certain types of jobs. For example, financial convictions will make it impossible for you to work in insurance or banking. You need to think about your conviction and what types of jobs that have nothing to do with your conviction. It is best if the conviction is completely unrelated to the job you are applying for.


Do some research before you make any determinations. Don’t just assume that your record will disqualify you from holding a certain job. Consider the relationship of your conviction to the position.
Eliminate jobs for which your record will automatically disqualify you. Your record may disqualify you for some positions, especially government jobs requiring security clearances, positions with financial responsibility, or jobs working with children., For most employers, it is illegal to immediately and completely disqualify anyone with a conviction or arrest record. This is because many ethnic minorities, such as African Americans and Latinos, have been over-criminalized by society and are disproportionately impacted by such a policy.Employers must also demonstrate that your conviction is “job-related” and would hamper your ability or trustworthiness to perform your job.
Employers should consider the amount of time that has passed since the conviction or completion of your sentence. It is more difficult for an employer to justify making a hiring decision based on a very old conviction.
The type of job you are applying for should also be considered. For example, if you were convicted of a violent assault, it would probably be difficult for you to find a job where you have to interact with people (e.g., sales).

, If a friend or family member is either hiring or knows someone who's hiring, then ask your friend or family member to hire you or to advocate for you. You'll have a much better chance of finding work when you talk to someone who knows you or your family and is interested in you.


Have your advocate write a letter of recommendation to your potential employer. If your advocate and your potential employer know each other well, it is also appropriate for your advocate to call your potential employer and vouch for your character. For example, your advocate can talk about how long they have known you, and what type of person they know you to be. Your advocate can also talk to your potential employer about how you have changed since your conviction or how the conviction was the result of a mistake that you are not going to repeat.

, In many cases, having personal connections can get you a job that you might not otherwise be considered for. Create a professional profile on LinkedIn and Twitter. Find an association in the industry you want to enter, and become a member. Attend industry meetings and get to know people., You may have a good chance to get jobs in maintenance, upkeep, restocking shelves, etc. You may not be able to get positions which may have you handling other people's money or put you in social situations.Employers in restaurants and bars are often understanding of past criminal records., Understand that when a person sees your record, he or she may be reluctant to hire you for a position with a lot of responsibility. That same person may be more than willing to give you a chance in another usually lower-paid position. You can use this chance to demonstrate that you are a reliable and trustworthy employee.


Try applying with a temp agency. You will need to disclose your criminal record to the agency. However, these agencies are sometimes able to place employees at other companies without running additional background checks, which can give you the chance to prove yourself.Do what it takes to get your foot in the door. You may have to start at a lower-paying job for which you are overqualified. You can use this time to rebuild your resume.
If you were incarcerated, the gap in your employment history may pose as much of an obstacle as your conviction. You may need to build up a job history again by working smaller or entry-level jobs before trying to re-enter a career field.

, You may want to lie when an application asks if you have a criminal record, but you must be honest with potential employers. Many employers now conduct some sort of background check. If they find that you have been dishonest on the application, you will not be hired. If you’ve already been hired and the lie is discovered later, you can be fired for it.


Criminal background checks may not pick up older convictions or convictions in different states. Still, if they miss your conviction and find out about it after they hire you will most likely be terminated.
You have certain rights regarding background checks. Your potential employer must get your permission to run a background check. If you are not hired after the background check is run, the employer must give you a copy of the report. They must do this before they make the final hiring decision. This gives you an opportunity to correct inaccurate information. It may also give you the chance to advocate for yourself.Several states now have a “ban the box” policy that requires employers to remove questions about convictions or arrests from their initial job application. They may only conduct background checks after the hiring process has been started. You can see whether these laws apply in your area to by going to www.nelp.org/banthebox.
Lying on some applications (such as for military enlistment) is a criminal offense. It is better to be honest!
Explain your answer if you're asked about convictions or arrests during an interview. Job applications and interviewers will give you an opportunity to explain the circumstances behind the offense or alleged offense. You may find that the interviewer is interested in someone who made a mistake but is now motivated to get a job., You must be honest about your background when filling out a job application. However, you do not need to offer more information than the application requests.For example, if the job application specifically asks whether you have ever been convicted of a felony, you do not need to disclose misdemeanor convictions.
Some applications may ask specifically about convictions related to particular offenses, such as drugs, alcohol misuse, or sexual misconduct. If a question asks about specific offenses that do not apply to you, you do not need to disclose convictions or arrests that are not related.

, There are several organizations that are focused on helping people with criminal records find jobs. Get in touch with an organization or agency in your area.


The National Transitional Jobs Network provides job skills training, job placement services, and support to individuals who may have barriers to finding traditional employment.
America Works also assists individuals who may have difficulty finding work., Even if you committed an offense as an adult, you can try to get an offense sealed or expunged from your record. Ask your attorney, public defender or your parole/probation officer whether you may be able to get the offense expunged (removed) from your record. If you are successful, then you can legally answer “no” to conviction questions.

Employ yourself.,
Consider joining the military.,
Volunteer.",How to Get a Job with a Criminal Record2," If you’re willing to work extra hard and you have marketable skills or abilities, you may be able to make your own opportunities. The advantage of employing yourself is that you do not have to submit to background checks or other hurdles.Consider becoming a skilled laborer, such as an electrician, plumber, or barber. Some professions require you to get a professional license. In many cases, the licensing process may require you to disclose a criminal record. However, a conviction on its own is usually not enough to disqualify you from licensure. This is especially true if your conviction was a long time ago and/or you have not had multiple convictions for the same type of crime.Most state licensing boards will have a list of criminal convictions that may pose a barrier to entering a specific profession. For example, a person wishing to become a cosmetologist would likely have trouble getting licensed if he or she had a conviction involving children, sexual misconduct, or personal assaults. This is because a cosmetologist often has direct contact with the public in unsupervised settings, so a history of crimes against people could pose a threat.Consider what you’re good at. If you have maintenance or lawn-care skills, try starting a small business that uses those skills. People who employ handymen or lawn-care specialists are more likely to judge you based on the quality of the work you can do, not your background If you were part of a work release program, you may consider staying in the industry that you worked in.
You’ll probably need to have another job while you’re getting your business on its feet.

, Some people think that the military will take just about anyone, while some think that you can’t get in at all with a criminal record. In the U.S., they’re both wrong.Depending on the type, number of offenses, and the length of time since your offense, you may be able to get a waiver that will allow you to enlist. Waivers are easier to get with misdemeanors and non-violent offenses. Multiple felony convictions are usually an automatic disqualification, as are convictions for distributing or selling illegal drugs.
You may be required to provide letters of reference that attest to your character. If you can get strong letters from responsible community members (employers, ministers, law enforcement, etc.), you have a better chance of getting a waiver.Before you enlist, consider the potential risks and benefits of joining the military. The military can provide job training and instill discipline. Some civilian employers may be more willing to hire you if you have military job skills. However, there are also risks, such as the possibility of deployment, injury, or death.
Lying to a military recruiter about your criminal history is a felony—don’t do it.The military has the right to investigate your entire criminal record, including offenses and records that have been sealed or expunged. When applying to the military, you cannot legally answer “no” to questions about your criminal history, even if records were sealed or expunged.
Some branches of the military, such as the Army and the Marine Corps, may be more willing to grant waivers to individuals with felony convictions., Even if you can't get a paid position to start, volunteer work looks good to employers. It can even count as job training for many professions and the Department of Social Services. Find a local soup kitchen, animal shelter, or even an advocacy organization to join.


Working as a volunteer gives you the chance to show that you are responsible, dependable, and trustworthy. It will also give you the chance to make a good impression on people in charge of you, who can vouch for your character when you apply for jobs.

Begin thinking about options while incarcerated.,
Contact a local advocacy group for people just getting out of jail or prison.,
Take advantage of education or job training programs that may be available to you after you are released.",How to Get a Job with a Criminal Record3," Education opportunities are available in most correctional institutions.Take advantage of opportunities to get your G.E.D., start or complete your college education, get vocational training or other unique skills. For example, culinary skills or sales/business development skills would help you in the food service or retail industries. Good preparation is especially important if you have been incarcerated for an extended time, if you have limited job skills and experience, or if you will not be able to return to your previous area of employment.


For example, If you were a bank teller and were convicted of theft, you will almost certainly not be able to work in banking.

, These groups can help you find and apply for positions that don't require a squeaky-clean record. To find a local group, ask your probation or parole officer or look online.


Try searching for “Ex-Offender support” or “Re-entry resources” to find assistance in your area.
To find out more information about the types of services these groups offer, visit the National Institute of Corrections website (http://nicic.gov).

, Government agencies and non-profit organizations provide many opportunities for job seekers to get more training or education.


For instance, the Second Chance Act, a federal law passed in 2008, funds local groups that help newly released prisoners with substance abuse issues.In 2012, the Second Chance Act funded programs in Los Angeles, California, San Francisco, California, Florida and Texas.
Goodwill Industries runs several programs that help ex-offenders find training and employment.Goodwill re-entry programs exist in many states, so contact your local Goodwill to ask about possible programs you can apply to.
The experience and skills you develop in these programs can make a big difference in the success of your job search. Some agencies will also help you to find a job after you complete your training program. Stop by your local library and check out adult education centers in your area to find out what they offer.

If you know which company you want to work for, start by checking out their website. You will likely see a tab labeled “Job Openings” or “Career Opportunities”. Click the tab to see what is available.You can also use online job search engines to widen your search. Enter keywords and geographic location on popular sites such as Indeed, Jobs.com, TheLadders, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn.For example, if you are looking for a job as a medical equipment salesperson in Chicago, your search terms might be “sales” and “medical” and your geographic area would be “Chicago, Illinois”.
Craigslist is also a good site to search. It is especially helpful if you are looking for immediate employment.;
, Social networking sites are not just for fun and keeping in touch with old friends. They can also help you find and apply for jobs. If you choose to use social media in your job search, consider setting your social profile to “private” and creating a new, professional profile that you share with potential employers. The following sites are great tools for job hunting:LinkedIn: You can use this site to create a professional online profile. You can post a biography that lets potential employers get to know you. You can also post your current resume for others to view.
Twitter: People are increasingly using this tool to find jobs. You can follow companies that you are interested in and see posts advertising jobs. You can also search the site using popular hashtags such as #jobs and #jobhunt.

, You can also use the internet to search employment resources in your own state. Each state has an online collection of available jobs known as a job bank. Find the job bank for your state and start searching.Much like other job search engines, the state job banks will allow you to search by keyword and city.

, Networking is a chance to strengthen connections with people in your career field. It’s also a time to meet new people. Put yourself out there and start communicating with people who could be helpful in your job search.You can say something like, “I’m just getting started in marketing, and I wondered if you know of any opportunities that could be right for me.” Consider reaching out to:Former professors
Past employers
People at the company you want to work for
Anyone you know who has a career similar to the one you want

, Friends and family can be great resources in your job hunt. They might know of openings that you aren't aware of. They could also have a friend of a friend who is looking to hire. Make sure that everyone in your circle knows that you are looking for a new job.


You can say, ""I'm looking for a new job in publishing. Can you let me know if you hear of any openings in that field?""

, A job or career fair is a great opportunity to meet new people and learn about potential employers. Both cities and universities have job fairs. Sometimes private organizations will also hold job fairs. Check your city or university website to find information about upcoming job fairs.
At a job fair, you can gather brochures and other information from companies that are hiring. You might also be able to speak to recruiters.

, Having a concrete plan will be one of your best resources. Write down a job search plan. Take some time to create a plan for how you will go about your job search. Make a calendar of weekly or daily activities related to your search. On this calendar you can include tasks like:Look at online postings
Reach out to your network
Work on resume and cover letter
Apply for a certain number of jobs each week

, Your resume is a way to list your skills and qualifications. Just as importantly, it can be used to show potential employers that your skills fit their needs. Take the time to tweak your resume to each job that you apply for. Look for keywords and themes in the job description and make sure that your resume highlights those terms.For example, maybe a job requires “outstanding communication skills”. Make sure to list specific examples of how you have used your communication skills in the past.
You don’t have to totally revamp your resume each time you post it. Just make sure it emphasizes your skills that are most important for that particular job.

, Start your resume by telling employers a little about yourself. Write a brief paragraph that tells the employer about your skills and lets them know what specific qualifications you can bring to the job. Keep it brief and professional.In a few sentences, describe your most important skills.
Stay away from vague skills such as “organized”. Use descriptive terms such as “negotiator”, “decision-making”, and “time management”., A lot of jobs will simply require a resume, but others will ask for a cover letter. Have a draft on hand and be ready to tailor it to the specifics of each job. A good cover letter should explain your experience and qualifications. You should use specific examples to describe why you would be a good fit for the job you’re applying for.Maybe a job description calls for someone who can work as part of a team. You could write about how, as an intern, you were in charge of organizing a project that multiple interns worked on.
Try to keep your cover letter to one page in length.

, Look over your resume and cover letter and then look them over again. Make sure to fix any spelling or grammatical errors. Ask a friend or family member to give your materials a read. A fresh set of eyes can catch errors that you may have missed., The modern job search is conducted largely online. It’s important that you make a good impression online. Take care to create positive, professional social media profiles. You never know when a potential employee might be viewing your information.For example, take care to create an impressive LinkedIn profile. Your headline should be succinct, like “Research Analyst”.
Use the space provided to list your qualifications and experience.
Don’t forget to edit your profile.
Include your contact information and a link to your resume.

, Your first step in applying for a job is to find out what the job entails. Give the job description a thorough read. Focus on what qualifications are required and what the job duties are.Don’t apply for jobs that you are absolutely not qualified for. For example, if you do not speak Spanish, do not respond to an ad that states, “Spanish required.”

, Pay attention to what the description emphasizes. For example, if it is a job in marketing, you might see terms such as “digital marketing”, “SEO”, and “Google Analytics”. Make sure that you mention those terms in both your resume and your cover letter., Many job search engines and company websites will ask for you to submit your materials online. Before you hit “submit”, take time to proofread everything you have written. This includes your resume and cover letter. You should also look over the fields that ask for your personal information and make sure all of your information is entered correctly., Hopefully, all of your hard work results in an interview. If you get asked to come in, take time to prepare. Make sure to have examples ready to explain your past accomplishments and how you can help the company. For example, you could say, “I know you’re looking for a fresh take on how to increase sales. I’d love to tell you about my ideas for a direct marketing campaign.”Dress professionally.
Make eye contact and speak confidently.
Arrive on time.

, If you’ve had an interview, it is proper business etiquette to write a brief thank you note. Typically, this is done by e-mail. You can write, “Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I enjoyed learning more about your organization and am excited about the idea of working as part of your team.”You can also follow-up after sending a job application. You might write, “I’m writing to make sure that you received my application materials. I’m happy to provide further examples of my qualifications if you would find that helpful.”

",How to Get a Job Teaching English in Japan," Having at least a bachelor's degree is a requirement. This is not a requirement for the job, but rather for the work visa. Without a work visa (or a spouse visa if you are married to a Japanese citizen) you cannot legally work in Japan. This is an immigration law. Without a bachelor's degree, Japan will not issue you a work visa. You don't want to break the law in Japan. If you are caught working without a visa you will be detained and deported. Your bachelor's degree doesn't need to be in English or teaching, but it might be more useful. Any bachelor's degree will do.;
, If you do want to work in Japan then you will need a lot of money. It is recommended to bring at least $2,000 with you to help you get started before you get your first paycheck. In addition, you will need to buy suits for your job. Most schools will require you to wear a suit, but some let you take off the suit jacket in the classroom, especially during summer time. You should have at least 3 nice suits. Also, you will have to pay for your plane tickets. Depending on your interview location, you may need to fly there (even within your own country). You also need to pay for your own flight to Japan.

, In other words, no arrests. The government will not issue a visa to someone who has committed a crime. Small crimes several years ago may be overlooked, but anything in the past 5 years is almost a guarantee than your visa will be denied.

, There are hundreds of English schools in Japan. Most of them are private and they are usually called ""Eikaiwa"" which means ""English Conversation"". These schools generally offer a good work environment and are very easy to join. They also help you with getting your life set up in Japan. The pay is also good for an entry level job.


Use the internet and read about the different types of schools. There are maybe 4 very famous ones with branch schools all across the country, but hundreds of smaller ones too. Start by making a list of the famous schools in Japan. Or, if there is a particular city that you want to go to, try looking for schools in that city.
Read former teachers' experiences on the internet. Many teachers will write about their experiences while working at their schools. This is a good way to see the pros and cons or each place.
Visit the school's website directly. They will provide a lot of information on salaries, types of lessons, housing, responsibilities, and so on.
Read students' comments. If you can read Japanese, it is a very good idea to read student's comments about the school they went to. This will give you the best information on that company's atmosphere. Students' comments usually differ greatly from teachers' comments because they see the school from a different perspective. Reading both will help you choose the school that's right for you.

, Your work life is only a part of your life in Japan. You should read up on Japanese culture and mannerisms. Read people's personal experiences rather than books. Books often contain stereotypical or outdated information. Real people's experiences will give you better insight on life in Japan. Does this type of life suit you? Remember, you will be working in a Japanese work environment (depending on the school), and probably all of your students will be Japanese, so it's essential to understand their culture.

, You will probably have a short English test at the interview. It will include conjugating verbs in different tenses (for example: Past Perfect), and also a spelling section. It is highly recommended to find a list of commonly misspelled words and to practice conjugating irregular verbs, even if your native language is English.

, You don't need it for your job, but it's useful for reading student's names and also for using the computers. You will likely need it for you life in Japan, especially if you don't live in a big city.

, In other words, you must live in Japan and work at that company for at least 1 year. You will have Golden Week, Obon, and New Year's vacation which you can use to visit your family in your home-town. Other than that, be prepared to be separated from your family and your friends for at least 1 year.
Do not break your contract. It is not easy for a company to scout new teachers, do the paperwork, and train them. Between the time you leave and the time a new teacher comes, your school will be in a lot of trouble. They will have to send a substitute or emergency teacher, which is very expensive. If you break your contract the company can hold you accountable for those expenses and will charge you, even if you move back to your home country.
Furthermore, the students need a teacher who will be there for them. If you leave suddenly then your students' motivation will drop, and they don't deserve that. Are you ready to make a minimum 1-year commitment?

, Find a suitable interview location and time for you. Follow the school's instructions on the website and apply.


You might have to write an essay about why you want to work and live in Japan. Follow the guidelines set by the company. Following guidelines is not only important in these schools, but in all of Japan. You should write about how you love Japan and love teaching. Highlight your strengths in the essay as well.

These schools are looking for enthusiastic teachers, so you might want to include words like ""deep interest"" ""overwhelming passion"" ""intellectually stimulating"" and so on. For example ""I have held a deep interest in Japan and teaching since I was in junior high school. In our history class, we learned how to write our name in katakana and it really piqued my curiosity in the culture. Furthermore, I have an overwhelming passion for learning and teaching and hope to pursue it in my future."" Using these words will let the employer know more about your personality.


Your essay should show your personality, but it should also reflect your English ability. You will probably be required to teach students from beginners to advanced. Using advanced vocabulary and expressions will make your essay stand out. For example, instead of saying ""I have always wanted to be a teacher."" say ""I have always had my heart set on a teaching career.""
Do not use slang, which can be considered unprofessional. Being professional is extremely important and these schools pride themselves on that image. Show that you are a well educated, determined, professional, and competent individual with a lot of energy and passion.

, This is pretty simple. If you don't know how to do this, there are some great articles about writing resumes on wikiHow.

, A sure way to get your application denied is to have it be riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes. Proofread it several times and have someone else read it too. If you really aren't sure about some of the grammar, read about grammar rules on the internet. Chances are, you will be doing this anyway at your future job for more advanced grammar so you can explain it clearly to your students.

, You should make a 50-minute lesson plan about what type of lesson you want to teach. If you are accepted for the interview, you will choose any 5 minutes of your plan that you want to demonstrate to the interviewers. Make your plan for a beginner class (intermediate may be acceptable). Make it fun and engaging. The only speaking you should do is giving instructions. Make the plan so the students do the speaking or activity amongst themselves. Remember, you are applying for a job teaching English conversation, so make the students practice conversation. Give them some target vocabulary, a grammar point, and a situation to work with.

,, Most applications are accepted, but the interview is where most people are weeded out. Your interview will likely be in a hotel, so book a room there. The interview may be in two stages, with each stage on different days. If you pass the first stage, then the next stage will be the next day. Book at least 2 nights in the hotel.

, Just as there is no excuse for being late to work, there is never any excuse for being late to an interview. Arrange your travel plans accordingly.

,


Bring two suits, nice shoes, a nice pen, a pad of paper for notes, and any props or materials you want to use for your lesson. If you have print outs, print them in color. If you are using flash cards, laminate them. Make it as professional as possible. Your lesson demonstration is only 5 minutes, but the amount of work you put into preparing will impress your interviewers. Never start your demo lesson without some pictures or props. Iron your suits and polish your shoes.
Don't bring perfume, extra makeup (foundation only is okay) more than 1 pair of earrings, more than 1 ring, any other flashy or colorful accessories. While people in Japan do wear many accessories, they do not wear them in the office. Excessive makeup like eyeliner and eyeshadow is frowned upon. Painted nails are a big no-no. (Clear polish is okay though). These things are unprofessional and won't even be allowed at your school if you are hired.
If you are a woman, wear stockings and closed toed heeled shoes. Do not wear ballet shoes. No bright colors (pink, red, yellow, orange) and also do not wear all black. Schools want to show a professional, but ""bright"" friendly image. Think about that before you go.
If you are man, shave your beard or trim it very short. It is relatively rare of men in Japan to grow beards, especially businessmen. If they do have one, it is always neatly trimmed. This will be a requirement at the school if you are hired.
Hide any tattoos. Your school will not hire you if you display a tattoo. Some schools are okay if you have one, but you must keep it hidden and never tell students. The students ""might"" not care, but if they tell the staff at your school then you may have trouble.

, This is important for your future job and most events in Japan. Always arrive 10-15 minutes early.

, Japanese is usually not required for this job. Also, at your school you will likely be prohibited from speaking Japanese to the students or even in front of students. Speaking Japanese to an interviewer or during your demo lesson is a good way to fail your interview. Again, the schools do not want you to speak Japanese at the school.

, Take notes and listen carefully. Ask questions to show your interest and show that you are actively listening.

, You should have already decided which 5-minute part you want to demonstrate. There will be several interviewers and many interviewees. The other interviewees will be your students. And you will be their students when it is their turn. You will likely have more than 1 interviewer watching your lesson. Be prepared for it. Take a deep breath and drink some water.

,


Smile a lot. This is a huge plus. Smile and make your students smile. Happy students are students who will want to continue studying and will love to come to your class. So, smile.
Give instructions clearly, slowly, and simply. Speak only when necessary.
Use gestures. Go overboard. Be funny. Schools want a teacher who can explain things without using words and also someone who can hold students' attention. Using gestures and smiling a lot will also help you forget about your nervousness. Enjoy yourself and your students will enjoy it too. And so will your interviewer.
Teach them something. Even if they have ""free conversation"", teach them more advanced phrases. For example, if the topic is ""Talk about a trip you took"" and a student (interviewee) says ""It was great."", teach them ""it was fantastic"" or ""it was out of this world"". Teach them something, but make sure they talk a lot and practice what you taught them. You can even make them repeat once or twice.
Don't get upset with your students. Chances are, one of your students (another interviewee) will try to make your demo lesson harder by asking an unrelated question or by not following instructions. Don't worry. Just smile, answer it if you can, and continue the lesson. If you cannot answer their question, do not worry! Just say ""That's a very good question (student's name). Let's talk about it together after the lesson. Let's continue now."" In your school, you will have student's like this. Knowing how to handle them and control the lesson is essential for a teacher. Promise to help them, but at a later time.
Don't talk too much. Don't lecture. You are teaching English conversation. You want your student's to talk.
Don't make another interviewee's demo lesson hard. Be a good student. Do exactly as you are told. Interfering with another person's demo lesson will look unprofessional.

, You will either be invited to a second interview, or you won't.

, It will likely be only 1 interviewer and you. They will ask you the typical interview questions. Be prepared with your answers.

, You cannot prepare for the second demo lesson. It is sprung on you without any warning. It will probably be a kid's lesson. The interviewer may show you a book, open to a page, and tell you ""You have 1 minute to prepare and then 3 minutes to teach me something from this page. Also, I am a 5-year-old."" The interviewer will leave the room and you have a short time to look at that page and decide what / how you want to teach. Let's imagine there are zoo animals on the page.

, The interviewer will return but they have the mindset of a 5-year-old. They won't act up, but they will act sometimes like they don't understand you. Do what you need to to teach them something and make it fun. Even be funny if you have to. If your page is zoo animals, make animal noises and then say the animal's name. Use gestures too. Make your arm an elephant's nose. Say ""together"" and do it with your student and then repeat the animal's name. This may be weird for you, but it's fun for a 5-year-old. Also, they are unlikely to forget the vocabulary you taught them! You will have to be able to teach lessons on the fly sometimes, so being able to prepare in a short time is essential.

, Be specific. Big city, small city, countryside, ocean, mountains, and so on. Also tell them if you want to teach kids or adults. Tell them exactly what you want. If they want to hire you then they will find a good place for you, even if it takes a few months.

, Wait for a phone call.

, If you were an energetic and friendly teacher who put a lot of effort into preparing a demo lesson and could also teach a fun lesson off the cuff, then you should get a job as an English teacher in Japan.

, Ask any questions that you may have.


They'll send you a contract. Read it very carefully. Very carefully. Remember, it is a legal agreement. Don't break it and don't take it lightly.

,, Some medications are illegal in Japan.

, Bring only the bare necessities. You can buy things in Japan when you arrive or have your family send them to you later. Your apartment will be small and the training center will be small too. Just bring suits, casual clothes, and things for hygiene. Maybe a book for studying Japanese.

, Go with your trainer and new group to your training center. You may receive training there for a while. Get friendly with your fellow trainees.


You'll receive a few days of training. Do not take it lightly. It can be fun, but it's long. You will receive homework and assignments. They will help you learn how to do your job for the next year. Do not skip them. Do everything meticulously. It is possible to get kicked out of training and never sent to your branch school. Again, if you don't take training seriously, the company can send you back home.

Get the offer in writing.",How to Negotiate a Higher Starting Salary," If you're someone who feels reluctant to ask for more money for reasons ranging from fear of asking through to issues of self-esteem and a lack of confidence in your worth, it's time to face your nemesis. Being so grateful to get work in hard times, anxious about receiving a ""no"", or not being bothered to even ask are not good approaches. Whatever the reason stopping you from are ways of stopping you from getting the best deal. Here are some common factors that hold many people back from negotiating the best possible deal:


Fear: Probably the most common reason people don't ask for more money, this relates to fear of being rejected, fear of coming across as too pushy, fear of resentment from your future bosses and fear of being miserable if the answer is no. Fear is a killer of all good things in life and the sooner you face it, the better off you'll be, mentally and financially.
Excusing the salary offered: Telling yourself that the offered salary is already good enough, that you don't need more or that you will love the job so the money offered will be sufficient, etc., are all excuses. They're excuses to not even try, to not engage and to not negotiate. You deserve more than excuses. After all, do you love the job enough to come in for free? No, of course not––it's not that kind of passion!
Humility: A dash of humble thoughtfulness is perfect now and then but it doesn't pay to be a lifelong doormat, especially not when your well-being is at stake. Worrying about things like being paid more than your friends or family members, not being seen as humble or downgrading your worth because of innate talent rather than effort are not healthy signs of humility––they're ways of putting yourself down. There will be ample time enough to display humility on the job when a boss takes all the glory for your work! If you really do have a problem with not been seen to be humble, practice having gratitude for the ability to make the request in advance of your asking––that way, you can work around the worry of not being considerate of others or harbor unnecessary guilt.
Lack of self-esteem: By being unsure if you're worth more, telling yourself that other people are more clever/worthy than you or deserving of larger money amounts, you're putting yourself down in the worst possible way. Stop this, before you fade into anonymity!
Lack of confidence: This is linked to lack of self-esteem, fear and humility. You worry about getting knocked back for asking or looking pushy or vulnerable. This is a very unassertive way to begin the relationship with your future workplace––and they'll notice. At the very least, consider asking for an assertiveness training course to be included as part of your package if you can't stomach the thought of asking for cold cash!
Apathy: You don't care. Maybe past experiences have taught you that it's a waste of time to try. The trouble with apathy is that it creeps into every part of your life once you've let it in. Knock it on the head, now.
Strange notions: Some people carry around odd cliches and social notions about earning more money, such as rich people being snobs or greedy, money matters being a nuisance or beneath oneself to deal with or worrying about compromising relationships with the boss or other coworkers. If you have any such skewed perspectives, realize that you're carrying baggage that is holding you back––ditch these strange notions now! Your bank account will thank you.;
, Think about it: If you don't ask, your future employer is not going to fill the gap for you––they're not mind readers, nor do they suddenly feel like upping a salary offer without being pushed to do so. Remember that while ""no"" is one possible answer, so is ""yes"", ""we'll see what we might be able to do"", and ""how about a compromise?"". In each case, the employer is going to be listening to you, gauging your willingness to engage and seek the best, something that they will extrapolate to your work performance in giving and getting the best for the company. Even if the answer is a ""no"", you've opened the employment relationship with a positive message of assertiveness and pluck, and it will be remembered when it comes time to discuss pay rises in the future––namely, that you're someone to be taken seriously.


If you don't ask, you have potentially left a pool of money for someone bolder to take. Be the bold one instead!
After discussing pay at this nascent stage of your employment relationship, you will have a really clear understanding of what is expected of you in order to earn more later on via pay raises. That's a very healthy position to be in.

, Know in advance how you'll react if the answer is a ""no"". Aim to be gracious but also try to think outside the square. Acknowledge that the employer came to the negotiating table in good faith.


Remind yourself that you are not your salary. This is not personal––it's business.
See the previous step for raising other non-monetary possibilities in the fact of a ""no"".
Even where it's a ""no"", well done for trying. You have just proven that you can ask questions and stand up for yourself. You're going to get on well in this job.
Last but not least, remember that a ""no"" could be a veiled ""not now but we can't explain why to you""––namely, the economic times don't warrant it at the moment but the company isn't going to reveal its bottom line to you. However, if you stick with the firm as times upswing, it's possible that future pay rises can make up for the original ""no"".

, Although personal to you, it's an impersonal issue for the company, which simply wants your backside on their chair as soon as possible now, for as good a price as they can get you. It's another chance to sell yourself to them in the comfort zone of knowing you already have the job, as well as a slight upper hand in being able to ask for a higher salary before accepting the job.


For the introvert, hipster or shy sort who feels a sense of panic and intense dislike at the thought of ""selling"" themselves, don't confuse selling your professional worth with your personal worth. Your personal worth isn't up for examination. It's your professional worth that you'll need to spend a little time polishing into a standard spiel. Treat this like the business transaction it is and keep everything professional; you're not selling out by promoting what is valuable about yourself.
Recognize that a high percentage of companies expect renegotiation of salary offers and set their salary offer lower than what they expect you to accept, on purpose. While this won't hold for all companies (and be careful with government organizations where set pay levels are published and clear) but why accept the chance that you've been offered less based on this rationale? Give it a go!
Realize that those who ask get heard. The squeaky wheel is real, now and in any other workplace transaction.

, If you're the sort who gets the jitters when asking for something and find this matter of salary negotiating even harder than attending the actual interview that won you the job, then spend time practicing asking. Stand in front of the mirror and out loud, give your reason for asking for more, the suggested figure and your reaction to possible questions, including rejection. This is time to develop your ""pitch"", in the freedom of your own space.


Have a trusted friend be the boss at the other end. Ask your friend to respond with different scenarios so that you can practice each one––the ""yes, of course we'll increase your salary"" scenario, the ""no way"" scenario"" and the ""we'll need to think about this"" scenario.

, This is about establishing your professional worth, and is about clarifying and confirming to yourself the reason for asking for more. Compare your skills and experience against others in the same field and write down key factors that demonstrate why you're a cut above these others. In particular, select your strengths that are outstanding and demonstrate your unique style, talent and draw card elements. While some of this will have come out through your CV and interview, there will always be more concrete facts you can present to win over your future employer, and this is a chance to show expanded, detailed evidence of your worth when stacked up against peers. Consider:


your level and extent of experience in the field
your educational background, including ongoing education and expected future education
your ability to draw new clients or use your contacts/network
your level of knowledge about your new employer, along with knowledge of competitors and how to take advantage of this knowledge for your new employer's sake.

, You can't negotiate without the facts. Moreover, you can never assume your new employer has them all at hand––they're not paid to watch out for your interests! Once it becomes clear to you that you've got the job, now is the time to know what others in your position are earning in the industry. Coupled with your specific expertise and experience, this should give you a fair and objective idea of what is a good salary for your position and to know whether the offer is reasonable, well under, or awesome (it being presumed that ""awesome"" is a fairly rare reaction to a salary offer!). Look for hard facts that back up your statements. Some important things to do are:


Check salary guides (many exist online but ask at the local library if in doubt)
Talk to your mentors and former bosses
Talk to colleagues to see if they can point out skills that really stand out for them in their experience and ask who has demonstrated these skills in the past
Talk with clients if relevant and get their feedback on your value
Look into what the company has traditionally paid employees in your role.
It's recommended that you reach a reasonable figure to give as a suggestion to your future employer. It's harder to say no to a specified, thoughtful and fair figure than to an unknown and possibly ""sky's the limit"" request.

, After conducting market research on your potential job and an evaluation of your previous company’s compensation, define a good counteroffer. For negotiation purposes, it is best to determine a number that will make you ecstatic and a baseline number that you will accept, given the value of the entire compensation package.


This is your salary range.
You can then use this range to set your counteroffer.
Having these numbers will help you be prepared to make your counteroffer and either accept or decline the employer's final offer.
Consider location. Region and cost of living can make a huge difference. A Marketing Manager in Greensboro, North Carolina will not merit the same paycheck as one in Washington, DC. The cost of living will be a factor in determining a candidate's salary.

, Don't expect the stars when you have just been given the moon. A higher salary is a good goal but an astronomical one is edging on greedy or an impossible promise to live up to. Never ask for an amount above the top end of your position's market worth unless you have an exceptional reason to do so. Again, this is about doing thorough research but it is also about using your intuition, general knowledge and knowing how to pitch this just right.


Accept the fact that you have been given the job as an important part of your negotiation process. It's precisely what your future employer is thinking constantly and pushing too far can hurt your cause.
Accept the reality that some companies can only afford so much before your ""unique factor"" is out of their league. Do bear in mind that even large, wealthy companies need to remain profitable by not bloating employee salaries to any ridiculous extent. Indeed, increasingly outrageous salary packages are viewed by a majority of citizens now as an unhealthy evolution in employment and the next decade will undoubtedly see reasonableness becoming a key element of salary determination, even for top CEOs.

, Ask for a breakdown (in writing) of the full compensation package including costs of offered benefits (dental, medical, etc.). A full compensation package includes not only your salary, but other benefits including vacation or paid time off, company phone and medical, dental, vision, wellness and life insurance.


Once you have received this information, you can include increases to these benefits as a part of your counteroffer.
For example, you can ask for increased salary specifically to compensate for spending more on medical benefits. Or, you could ask for another week of paid vacation.
Remember, sometimes asking for non-monetary compensation can give you more leverage when making your counteroffer.

, If you can comfortably make a counteroffer after the initial offer is made, by all means go ahead. If you need more time to evaluate information and determine a counteroffer, say (as mentioned above) “I would like to have some time to think over your offer”.


Then, provide a time of when they should hear back from you.
For example, “Can I give you a call back by noon tomorrow?”
Asking to think things over will show that you will not accept any offer and that you put thought into your employment decisions. This should not be perceived as a bad thing to potential employers.

, Before making your counteroffer, express that you have great interest in the job and working for the company. This reassures the recruiter that they made the right decision by offering you the job.


For example, “I am really pleased that you have offered me the job and I am excited to have the opportunity to contribute to your company”.

, Based on your research as described above, provide your ideal salary followed by an acceptable range.


It can be a good idea to state your ideal salary as the maximum upper limit of a reasonable range.
For example, if you think it is fair for you to be paid $90,000, ask for a bit more when stating your ideal salary.
Try saying, “My ideal salary is $95,000 with a range of $84,000-95,000”. Your ideal salary explains what you would love to make, and your range shows what is acceptable.
Given this example, you would accept no less than $84,000.

, Let the recruiter know you did not just make up these numbers in your head.


Explain that you have done research on acceptable salary ranges for the position in your area.
Also explain where you believe you fit in this given range based on the value you bring to the company.
Factors of why you feel you deserve your ideal salary could include:

Experience.
Education.
Skills.
Abilities.
Personality.



, If you did your research and used it as a guideline, your counteroffer should be reasonable. When making your counteroffer, it is best to sound firm and confident without mumbling, apologizing, or avoiding a number.


This will show the employer that you truly believe in your ability to do the job, understand what you are worth, and have a minimum salary that you will accept.
Standing firm places you at an advantage at this point because the company clearly wants to hire you and does not want to spend the additional time and money to find someone else.

, The employer may need some time to think before making another counteroffer. If this happens and you are not yet ready to settle, it is important to let the employer know you are serious about the job.


You can say, “I would like to settle on something that makes us both comfortable as soon as possible”. This shows your sincerity and that they are not wasting their time with you.
Expect your future employer to want time to consider and to perhaps ask for more negotiation with you. One possibility is the open-ended but potentially positive request for time for reflection, followed by ""let's negotiate some more"". Your future employer may not meet all of your request (very likely) but may be willing to compromise. See these reactions as good signs and be ready to negotiate if needed.
If you're asked questions, answer them calmly and with patience even if you feel you're being re-interviewed. Your future employer may be probing you for more details to help the decision.
Sometimes your commitment to the company may be tested. Provided you've done your homework for both the interview and this request, you should pass this test with flying colors. Just be careful not to suggest that your commitment is commensurate to your pay level––this is a fairly delicate dance, so simply stick with reassuring how keen you are to be a part of a company that recognizes your skills and experience.
If you've done your research and judged that it's appropriate to do so, you can make suggestions of compromise during a negotiation that open up the possibility of different types of reward, such as additional leave, time off to volunteer, annual bonuses or stocks, a larger office, flights home if you're working interstate, a personal development course, membership to a club, a car park space, etc. In many cases, the company may have leeway on non-monetary recompense that they'll be happy to add to your package.

, Whether or not you've been successful (and in many cases, you may not know as many employers will ask for time to consider your request), end everything politely and without begging. A simple ""Great, thanks"" to the employer's response is a good and neutral way to respond. Keep smiling––your friendly and easy-to-negotiate-with approach matters.


Don't gush and thank them for considering it with oodles of superlatives. It sounds desperate.
Never turn a ""no"" into a backlash, such as pointing out you know that everyone else in the new firm is getting paid heaps more than you, blah, blah. This is an invitation to withdrawing the job offer!

, Whatever your offer is, never take a job without the entire package being signed off, in print. Go forth you smart negotiator, your new job awaits!

Be as honest as possible.,

Ask for inside information.,
Stay organized.,

Don’t quit your job before getting in touch with a headhunter.,
Don’t pester your headhunter.,
Watch out for scams.",How to Work With a Headhunter," Headhunters are not career counselors, job advisors, or life coaches. Their job is not to “find you a job,” it’s to recruit the best and brightest talent for on behalf of companies looking to fill open positions.Headhunters are third-party recruiters, hired by companies, working on commission, meaning that there’s little incentive in trying to hook up candidates with jobs they’re unlikely to get. The headhunter’s client is the company that’s hiring, not the job-seeker, meaning that it’s not in the headhunter’s job description to find jobs for everyone who comes in asking.;
, Headhunters commonly work in healthcare, information technology, science and technology, finance, and medicine. Often, you won't have to find a headhunter, but an executive recruiter will get in touch with you, if you're an attractive-enough candidate for an open job. Headhunters can be found online and advertised in most job-finding resources.


To give yourself the best chance of getting in touch with a recruiter, try to stay as connected to business networking as possible. Start a LinkedIn page and keep in touch with business contacts as much as possible.

, Before you visit with a headhunter or write a letter of introduction, it’s critical that you have prepared a detailed, professional, and specialized resume to consolidate your experience, references, and job descriptions. Again, it needs to be specialized, which means that it needs to be related skills, not part-time jobs or outdated study-abroad experiences.


Recruiters don't help you write resumes, so you'll need to have one ready. Again, it's your job to make it easy for the headhunter to match you with the right job openings, it's not the headhunter's job to guide you through the process. You should be ready to sell yourself the moment you get in touch with a headhunter., Write a brief letter to the prospective headhunters stating what you are looking for and where you're looking. State in your closing that you would be happy to provide your resume should the recruiter feel your skill set matches their current needs.


Generally, headhunters won't keep resumes on file for the future, even if you're an attractive candidate. Again, it's not their job to worry about getting people jobs, they're worried about filling positions. If you get no response, don't' take it as a sign that you're not right. Wait an appropriate length of time and try again in the future.
Keep it brief. With no more than a half a page, it may be appropriate to provide bullet points give a brief summary of your experience. Most headhunters won't spend much, if any, time looking over letters, so get to the point and keep it extremely brief. Front-load with the most important information.

, It's sometimes the most effective way of getting a quick answer about whether or not you might be an appropriate fit to consider for recent openings if you just call directly. Even if the answer is no, you won't have to wait around wondering and hoping for an answer. You'll just know.

, Remember: headhunters can’t give you a job, which means it’s not your job to go about the business of impressing them. It’s your job to go about the business of proving that you fit the bill for the opening. You need to be upfront and frank with a headhunter when it comes to compensation requirements, your experience level, and the other qualifications for the job. There’s little sense in wasting time with opportunities you’re inappropriate for.


It is important to be well put-together for meetings with headhunters, since you're going to be representing them as much as you'll be representing yourself at the interview. If you look disheveled and like a poor candidate, the company will be less likely to go through that headhunter again.

, The headhunter’s goal is to match people and companies, and you have to have information to do that, but it needs to be summarized and condensed into a manageable and tiny chunk for the headhunter. This includes a good resume, a short blurb, and additional background information from a phone or in-person interview. Recruiters then have a better idea if you fit that client's culture as well as technical requirements. And sometimes the information that you give the recruiter may open up another position that will be an even better fit.


Don’t expect recruiters to pour over your resume, or even be familiar with it. The average resume gets approximately 5-10 seconds of glance time., Get your headhunter to give you as much information as possible before an interview regarding the company and the people you're interviewing with. Ask your headhunter to confirm how other candidates who have interviewed for the same job you are interviewing for have failed so that you avoid making the same mistakes. If the headhunter has worked with this company before, there may be some helpful information out there.


Don’t expect a wealth of inside info. It’ll be your job to get ahead and figure out how best to sell yourself in the interview. The headhunter can only show you to the river, but can’t show you how to drink.
Ask for honesty. Lots of headhunters want to provide a variety of candidates for jobs, even if they're unlikely to get it. That's because companies will think more favorably of the headhunter who provides lots of great candidates, compared to someone who provides just one perfect candidate.

, It's still your job to get the job you want. Again, headhunters aren't there to guide you through the process of applying or getting in touch with the company, figuring out what information you'll need to provide, or other materials. Some headhunters may offer some guidance, but you shouldn't expect it. Remember that it's your responsibility and stay focused on doing it alone. Treat any outside help you get as icing on the cake.

, Their job is to fill the job with someone, not necessarily you. Use headhunters to supplement your job search.


It’s also true that headhunters are generalists working in a field of specialists. The job of the headhunter is to match appropriate candidates with hiring parties, not to judge who makes the best candidate for the job. In other words, just because you’re an experienced research scientist, you shouldn’t expect that your headhunter will have any clue what you’re researching.

, Swamping a recruiter with huge portfolios of your work, super-long intro letters, your college transcript, and supplementary recommendations from your previous employers is a bad idea. Remember, it's not the headhunter's job to give you a job, and the headhunter probably isn't all that familiar with your line of work in the first place. Talking to a headhunter is about credentials. Provide those, and save the rest of the stuff for your interview with the company you're hoping to work for.

, Traditionally, headhunters will not work with unemployed recruits, but with gainfully employed and attractive candidates looking to make a change in their employment. You're a more attractive candidate if companies think they're stealing you away from somewhere, plus you'll also be able to position yourself for more leverage when it comes to pay. Stay employed, even if you're unhappy with your current position, while you're talking with headhunters.

, Only follow up with a headhunter that responds to queries in the positive. Don't write again the next week hoping for a response, unless you want to get blacklisted for life. Headhunters are super-busy people who don't have a bunch of time to mess around answering emails from people who don't fit the bill. Know when to be quiet.


If you start working with a headhunter, it's also important to keep organized and focused, but don't blast off thirty emails a day to headhunters asking if they've found you anything yet. It's in their best interest to fill positions, meaning that you'll be the first person to know if you serve a role in the process. Be patient.

, People may contact you claiming to be a headhunter with a great job for you, but they won't give you details of the job, and ask a lot of questions about your work history, and other personal questions. These are scam artists. Some may indeed be headhunters, but they are only asking about your job history and the names of contacts in companies you have worked for to get their foot in the door as a head hunter for those companies. Others may be identity thieves.


To avoid being scammed, insist on details of the job they are trying to fill. Ask where the company is located. Tell them that you already have a headhunter sending your resume to companies in that town, and in order to avoid duplicates insist they tell you the first letter of the name of the company. If you are familiar with the names of companies in that location, begin a guessing game with the person based on the letter they give you. If they refuse, stop all communications with them.

Suggest something your ex-boss could do differently, on top of what they've already done.,
Keep in mind that the writer of a Letter of Recommendation is a sensitive relationship.,
If you think your ex-boss's attitude is redeemable, and is likely to give you a better letter with some prodding: the key is context.,
Once you've fully understood your own needs, explain them to your subject.,
Stay focused on a result, not on resentment.,
Try it out.",How to Tell an Ex Employer That Their Reference Letter Isn't Good Enough," You never want to tell someone ""that was bad or that was wrong,"" unless you're training them. (Even then, there are better ways to modify behavior.);
, This is a person who has agreed to help you, as a favor. It doesn't matter how much you worked your butt off for them - technically, they don't owe you anything. So having a confrontation won't be productive. Or, even if it makes you feel better to get it off your chest - you won't win. And your goal is to get a better Letter of Recommendation, not a cranky ex-boss.

, Context means breaking down for them what you need, and why. To do this, you may have to re-imagine for yourself: ""What do I need this letter to say, and why?""

, Use an introduction like the following:


""Hey, Mr. Rogers - thanks so much for the letter! It looks great . Tell you what - I just found out that, for the position of Janitor / Software Engineer / Student at Harvard, they're especially going to look at my sources to say: . Is that something you feel comfortable saying?""

, By approaching it this way, you have told your ex-boss that a) they did nothing wrong, and in fact you're grateful they took the time to write a letter, b) that you have specific needs, and c) would they mind filling them for you. Basically, you asked them to do a simple task and you did all the thinking for them, while making their answer (""yes"") seem obvious. This is the key to persuasion - recommend a new action and make it seem simple, without assigning blame.


Make sure you give your ex-boss a deadline by which you need the revisions!

, If it doesn't change your ex-boss's approach, then reconsider what you'll do. If you feel like your ex-boss is impervious to suggestions, find someone else. You'd be amazed at the people who can recommend you - a teacher, a business partner, a clergy member, a babysitting client, an employer of any kind, even a volunteer coordinator. Be creative when you think of sources.

Get the best answer down and move on.,
Seek feedback.",How to Succeed at Psychometric Tests," Knowing why companies and organizations use psychometric testing can ease some of your possible concerns that the tests are out to typecast or dismiss you. On the whole, the tests are aimed at finding out the most able and best suited persons for a job or course of study in the most efficient manner.


Psychometric testing can be an indicator that there are a lot of applicants for a job and the employer is seeking to identify the most suitable candidates in the most economical way possible.It is viewed as an efficient way of gauging a potential employee's thinking, ability to be a part of a team, and personal priorities.See it realistically: if you're not the best fit, you're better off not working in this work environment. It doesn't reflect on your worth as a person.;
, Psychometric tests can be given in the potential workplace, or on the premises of a business that runs the testing on behalf of the company or organization. Read the attendance instructions carefully and if you don't know where to go, be sure to work it out well in advance rather than turning up late. Also, read any instructions about the test itself with great care and learn what you can about the types of questions, the timing permitted, and the sequences the testing will be provided in.


Psychometric tests can be written (pen and paper), on a computer, or a combination of both.
While most testing will take place seated at a desk, it's also possible to be given psychometric tests while undertaking a workplace task, or even when in a gym or on a running machine.Average testing time is around 15 minutes but it varies depending on the extent of tests being taken.Even the timing can be treated as part of the assessment of completion or non-completion of particular tests.
If you have a disability that might impact your ability to take the test, let the employer know in advance. They may be able to rearrange the testing process to accommodate your needs.

Dress smartly. You are competing with other people; every little part of you that suggests you care and are taking this seriously will count in your favor.
Bring along anything you're asked to bring, including gym clothes if necessary.

, This can be hard if you're prone to dismissing the worth or resenting taking psychometric tests. You might harbor personal disbelief or even disgust at the use of such tests to sort through people but it's about facing the reality that these tests stand between you and a job, not about fighting your personal war against using psychology as a corporate tool (Use your blog for the latter!). Instead, expect to give the tests your absolute best shot by taking the right mental approach and being determined to work hard.Sleep well the night before.
Look forward to the challenge.

, For those who have never had psychometric tests or who have been out of formal education for a while, practice can be an important introduction to the things that you'll be expected to answer. As soon as you're told to attend for the tests, start practicing. Practice is the best chance that you have for succeeding, especially when you work with materials that are similar to those you'll be tested on.Mike Bryon recommends that you do a minimum of 20 hours of practice if you can,, so if you have enough lead-in time, break up the practice to a few hours a day.


Ask the potential employer for samples of the questions expected. If you receive any, this will give you an opportunity to work out the type of questions you'll need to practice.
Find websites and books that have practice tests. Do as many as you can before your own testing day.
Focus on your areas of weakness. If you're great at spelling and word association but lousy at spotting patterns or number skills, don't spend too much time on the easy stuff. Instead, focus most of your energies on practicing the skills in which you're weakest, to improve them and your confidence.
Challenge yourself and push past what you cannot do. Practice will only be effective when you force yourself to do that which you don't believe you can., As most of the aptitude part of psychometric tests are timed, it pays to practice under pressure. Practicing this will get you used to answering a lot of questions in a short space of time and to learn to balance speed and accuracy. Use a timer to practice with; a good time period is to allow yourself about 20 seconds per question before moving on the the next one. Either follow the time allotted on the practice tests or use a 10 to 15 minute period (the time you're likely to get in the actual test).


Practice time-keeping without checking the clock. Get to know how long 20 seconds feels like when approaching and answering each question.
Don't fuss about running out of time. Just keep practicing to improve your time.

, As well as using psychometric tests, find all sorts of relevant test material to broaden your knowledge and fast answering ability.


If you find magazines that have surveys that tell you your personality, do these; again, set up a timer for 15-20 seconds per question. Usually, the personality tests are not timed, but there are a couple of hundred questions - it's about sufficiency of evidence in this case. The timer part of this step is, again, about helping you get used to reading quickly, and to give you some more practice at time pressure.
Any sort of IQ test, visual puzzles, Trivial Pursuit style questions - the name of the game is to buff up your mental mathematics, reading, and comprehension skills. Do all of this within short time frames.
Find puzzles where there are simple graphics. The types of questions you'll be asked will include picking the odd one out, or ""if this is to this, then that is to ...?"" type pattern sequences; these kinds of tests look at your reasoning and spatial abilities. Find them, time them, do them. Sudoku helps you look at patterns, and again, add a timer to spur you on.
Use any online word-of-the-day type services, along with crosswords, hangman, word match, and other sorts of word puzzles. Keep doing the puzzles with a timer, and try to get faster, and of course, accuracy is the name of the game. Challenge colleagues, friends and family.

, Mathematics questions usually take the form of problem, with five or six possible answers. If you've slipped away from percentages, fractions, decimals, proportions, ratios, and numerical relationships - it's time to return to those kinds of questions and get them accurate.

, Once it is test time, be prepared. Read or listen to the instructions with great care (after all, if you can't get that right now, will you actually listen on the job?). Avoid feeling pressured and be prepared to enjoy the experience. If there are sample questions, use these as a way to warm up calmly, check your answers, and to get a feeling for the layout and style of the questions.


If you're not clear on the time period allotted, ask again. Be aware of the need for any delays prior to or after tests.
The timing doesn't start until you start the test, so spend a few moments relaxing and getting yourself ready for action.
If you don't feel well, have the test rescheduled and get a doctor's certificate. This isn't ""I've got the butterflies"" type of unwell but genuine sickness.

, Trust yourself. You get a better chance to find questions you can answer if you move on rather than spend two minutes grinding away on a single problem. Doing that would waste the opportunity of another 6 questions at 20 seconds each! Just keep working through and if you have time left, come back to skipped questions. Remember that everyone will get something wrong and it is better to push through to answers in which you excel than to remain stuck in the ones that won't click.

Be early, not just punctual.",How to Ace a Teaching Interview," Teaching certifications are generally essential in most places nowadays. This might mean that you need to get at least a minor in education even if you have other degrees.;
,,, The central offices interview is to screen for the more and the less qualified applicants.


They will not keep the paperwork you filed for more than a few months, if you are not hired (in that school year).

, Just do it.

, The individual schoolmaster/principal, most often has the final say on who is hired. A copy of your application and transcripts will be viewed by each principal, before they see you.

, If you have experience and training for a certain grade, it's a good idea to stick with that grade until you have more experience. That will be dependent on the school, of course, but it is important.

, Smile, relax a little, believing (deeply) that they will hire you, but don't brag or show-off about your grades or test scores, but mentioning them is fine.

,


""Progressive discipline"" is one good idea: meaning start with simple explanations, repeat key words, be clear and mild and increase the intensity.
Explain that you would never hold grudges against students, nor put-down or make a threat/or promise that you can not easily enforce (threats are challenges for them to test you).

,

Write that out in advance and edit your reasons. You'll probably need to explain clearly but briefly on the application, or attached.


""What do you want to know about the pay?"" Caution: Never talk about teacher ""pay or holidays"" as reasons to teach. Pay and benefits are not an acceptable reason to teach!.

Say, ""I know teachers are paid on a scale, and I'm not concerned about that.""


""Do students need to love you to be able to learn?"" (Develop the idea of why not: ""It's not love -- not be too personal, but insist on mutual respect for all, accepting differences, not comparing students, consistency, reasonableness, fair with firmness, manners and courtesy as very important... and not too judgmental, but teaching responsibility""

Follow up.",How to Ace a Job Interview (Teenage Girls)," If you're going to an interview, you need to dress professionally. Jeans and t-shirt will not impress an interviewer. Even if it's just a casual, part-time job, dressing up will help you make an impression.


Choose a nice blouse and dress pants or a skirt. Jeans or leggings are not appropriate job interview attire.If you wear make-up, do light, work appropriate make-up. Avoid bright shades of eye shadow and lipstick. Instead, go for conservative, neutral shades that match your own skin tone.Do not forget your footwear. Sneakers, flip-flops, or other casual shoes are not interview appropriate. Stick to professional looking dress shoes.;
, You should always have some knowledge of a company before going into an interview. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with a company before attending an interview.


Employers want to hire someone with a vested interest in their company. You can convey your interest by having some knowledge of the company and its goals and ethics ahead of time. Spend an hour or so the night before researching the company and the position.If the company you're interviewing for has a website, you can probably find basic information about that company online. Browse their ""About"" section. If you know any former employees, try sending them an e-mail asking them about their experience with the job., Even if the job doesn't specifically ask for a resume, spend some time working on one before applying. Showing up with a solid resume will impress an employer.


If you've never written a resume before, try asking a teacher or guidance counselor at your school to help you out. He or she can help you with formatting, style, and let you know the typical conventions of resumes.Consistency is important for most resumes. For example, if you're using bullet points to list your experience for one job don't suddenly switch to sentences when talking about your next work experience.Do not downplay experience. Many teens have limited professional work experience but you can find other relevant materials to list on your resume. If you've worked volunteering, have babysitting experience, have had a paper route or mowed lawns, or taken on any leadership experience in schools, talk about it. All these experience show you are capable and responsible, even if they're not as related to the position as you would like., Spend some time researching typical interview questions and how to answer them. During a typical job interview, you can expect some of the following:


""Tell me something about yourself."" This is an open ended question that allows you to show off your skills, experiences, and interests. Talk about your passions and how they manifest. For example, ""I'm really interested in helping my community which is why I've been a volunteer for Little Brothers, Little Sisters for two years.""""Why do you want to work for us?"" This is a question that allows you to convey you've done your research. Never say ""Because of the pay"" or ""Because it seems like a low pressure position."" Even if the job is not your dream job, emphasize that you're enthusiastic about the opportunity to build your resume. For example, ""I think working with customer service would be a great way to work on my people skills.""""Why should I hire you?"" This is your chance to brag about yourself. Even if it feels unnatural, try to talk yourself up so the interviewer so they feel you're the best person for the job. Say something like, ""I have a strong work ethic and a desire to learn and grow through my work experience."", Showing up too early might be in bad form as this might make the interviewer feel pressured to conduct the interview before he's ready. However, showing up 5 to 10 minutes early can show you're punctual and take initiative. Aim to get there early if you want to ace the interview., At many job interviews, you'll be given an application to fill out before hand. Make sure you look over the forms closely and fill out all the information. Accidentally leaving a section blank can reflect poorly on your when the boss reviews the applications to make a final decision., Remember, many people will be interviewing for the same position. It's important to find creative ways to be memorable during the interview.


What do your friends and family members like about you? Are you particularly attentive to detail? Nicer than the average person? Do you have a great sense of humor? Find ways to appropriately incorporate that into the interview.It's also a good idea to incorporate any talents applicable to the position into your interview. Say you're applying for a job as a library aid. Make a reference to one of your favorite books or authors to convey that you're well read., Employers are inclined to choose those with confidence. Use your body language to convey confidence during the interview.


Sit up straight and make eye contact during the interview. Show you're listening as well by smiling and nodding as the interviewer speaks.When you enter the room, keep your gait steady and your back straight. When you shake the interviewer's hand, give a firm handshake while smiling and maintaining eye contact., At the end of the interview, it's standard for an interviewer to ask if you have any questions. Always ask a couple of questions. This conveys your interest in the position and increases your likelihood of hearing back.


Do not simply ask questions regarding logistics. Things like ""How much does this position pay?"" and ""When will I hear back?"" will not impress an interviewer. Instead, focus on open ended questions that show you're interested in the position on a deeper level.Good questions ask about the company's atmosphere and ethics. Ask something like, ""What do you like about working here?"", ""What does a typical day in this position look like?"" and ""How would you describe your company culture?"", When leaving the interview, make sure to maintain confidence. Remember, you're being judged from the moment you enter the interview room up until the moment you leave.


Say goodbye to the interviewer and thank him or her for your time. Offer a handshake and maintain eye contact, giving a smile as well.When you walk out, stand up straight and walk in a steady, confident gait., Send the interviewer a brief e-mail or letter thanking them for their time. This can help you stand out from the crowd. It does not need to be more than a few sentences. Something, ""Dear Ms. Johnson, I really enjoyed talking to you about the salesclerk position at Sear's this weekend. I appreciated you taking the time to interview me. Good luck selecting a qualified candidate for the position."", It's always a good idea to follow up about a position. If you haven't heard back in a couple of weeks, call or e-mail the person who interviewed you and let him or her know you're still interested in the position."

Learn as much as you can about the company.,

Practice your responses to questions.,
Arrive early on the day of the interview.,
Walk into the office with confidence and a smile.,
Repeat the interviewer's name when you first meet.,
Take your time when dealing with difficult questions.,
Keep track of the body language of your interviewer.",How to Ace a Management Interview," Start preparing by collecting as much knowledge about the company as possible. The more you know about the company you are aiming to work for, the easier it will be to show your interviewer that you are the right person for the job.;
, If there are important dates that stand out regarding your career you should have them memorized so you will not have to use a paper copy much. Also, try to memorize some important facts about the company. Not only will you impress the interviewer with your knowledge of the company you want to work for, you will come across as well prepared and confident.

, Interviewers will ask questions regarding your strengths and what makes you management material. You should also have a planned out answer to the question ""why should we hire you?"" Your answers should showcase your talents and strengths, and tell what you can bring to the company. If your interviewer asks you what your flaw is, list just 1 and also mention steps you have taken to correct it. You may also be asked to describe your management style.


When answering questions about salary, be careful of your answer. Giving a number that is too low can make you seem less qualified for the management position. Answering too high can cost you the job. The best thing to do is to do a little research prior to the interview. Research other companies and find out their salaries for managers. When answering the question in your interview, answer with a range.

, The best way to practice is to use something that will allow you to see yourself, such as a mirror, a video or even a friend to help you. This way, you can see for yourself how you sound and look. Do you seem confident? Do your answers come across as too rehearsed?

, Get to the interview about 15 minutes early. You do not want to be running in the office at the last minute, and you definitely do not want to be late.

, As you enter the office, stand tall with your head up and shoulders back. Exude confidence that you are the right person for the management position. Shake your interviewer's hand with a firm shake.

, Repeating the name back will help you to remember it. Also, use the interviewer's name in key points during the interview. This will show the interviewer that you are able to listen.

, Give yourself a couple minutes to structure your answer before you begin, especially when you're answering a case question. If applicable, write down your plan attack so you don't become flustered and forget later.

, If they respond positively to your answer, you'll know you're on the right track. If they seem to be guiding you in another direction, let them. The interviewer knows the answer that they are looking for. If you start to veer off track, they'll probably give you little clues or ask specific questions to try to make you stop and rethink how you're answering the question.

Know what's important.,
Listen to the problem.,
Devise a problem solving structure.,
Communicate as you work through your process.,
Step back periodically.,
Relax and enjoy the process.",How to Ace a Case Interview," Don't go into the interview with the assumption that your mathematics skills are the most important thing. While they are definitely valued, you can impress your interviewer even more by being knowledgeable on topics that are directly related to consulting, such as economics.;
, Make sure you understand exactly what you are being asked to do. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification if you're unsure about a particular point.

, Your interviewer will give you a couple minutes to look over and take notes on the data that they give you. Use this time to your advantage. The interviewer doesn't care if you're smart enough to wing it; you'll look much more impressive if you use the time and are able to communicate your answers in an organized, well thought-out way than if you don't take the time to prepare and end up stumbling over your words.


Remember to use the simplest framework you can to still answer the question thoroughly. While it's tempting to use a complex framework to show off to the interviewer, know that they're looking to see that you can solve the problem in the most efficient manner.

, Be honest if you don't know something. Don't be afraid to ask the interviewer a question if you're unsure of something. Not only will this help save you embarrassment later, but it may even work in your benefit, because you're willing to admit that you don't know everything. As stated above, the most important part of this interview isn't that you get the right answer, but that you're on the right track to a sound structure and thinking process.


Even if you do understand everything, communication is very important. Explain each choice you make thoroughly, and give an honest opinion based your own analysis of the data in front of you.
Avoid the temptation to speak really fast and shoot out answers as fast as possible. It's okay to take your time, especially if you come back with a strong response.

, Summarize what you have learned and what the implications appear to be. Summarization is really important for a couple of reasons. For one, it allows you to refer back to your key points and lump them together in an impressive bundle. Generally, you should limit the ""key points"" to about three—any more will bombard your interviewer with information, and they may miss the most important points. Secondly, it puts all of your correct answers at the forefront of the interviewer's memory. This is an elegant way of directing your interviewer's attention away from any mistakes you may have made.

, Think of the interviewer as a teammate in a problem-solving process and the case as a real client problem that you need to explore and then solve.


Stay calm and collected. While your interviewer should always be professional, sometimes they'll heckle you a little to see how you respond under stress. Being grouchy or rude is probably just them testing the way you respond to stressful situations. If you get asked additional questions or your conclusion gets contradicted, don't lose hope. Stick to your guns and try not to let the stress get to you.

Conducting the interview with this in mind will make you seem like a good long-term investment. You should also be ready to talk in depth about the industry, the organization, and the position you are applying for.


Learn your interviewer’s name and job position before going to the interview. You may need to call the company to find out.
Talk to current employees. Show initiative while getting a feel for the office environment. Learn as much as you can about the company from people who work there.
Know as much about the company as possible. You can't change your employment history or your qualifications, but you can work harder than every other applicant by being supremely knowledgeable about the company. Use the company's website, their annual report, and newspaper/business magazine articles to gather as much information as possible.

, Participating actively during the interview gives a good impression of your level of interest in the job. It's a good idea to come prepared with at least three thought-provoking questions to ask your interviewer. (Avoid asking anything that could be easily answered through a quick internet search, or you will simply come across as lazy.)


Ask questions that reflect your interest in future prospects. “Which are new markets the company is planning to explore in next couple of years?” or “What are the chances for professional growth in this job opportunity?” Both show that you want to be on the same page as the people you’ll be working for.
Ask questions to bond with the interviewer and project your enthusiasm. Inquire about his/her position and background or how long (s)he has been with the company.
Ask questions about what is discussed during the interview itself. Though you may be tempted to respond to everything with an “Absolutely!” or a “Sure thing!” to show how competent you are, this will actually make it look like you’re not listening. Show that you are paying attention by asking for more details whenever something isn’t clear. (Avoid asking questions for the sake of asking, though, or it’ll seem like you can’t keep up.)

, If you have a friend who is also preparing for an interview, consider preparing together. Not only will this give you a way to structure your preparation, but it will also help you get comfortable with giving answers, telling anecdotes, and using appropriate terminology. Practice giving concise, complete answers and maintaining eye contact with the interviewer(s) while you give them. Make sure you aren't speaking too slow or too fast and that your answers are stated with confidence.


Get feedback from a friend. Even if you think their feedback isn't on the mark, it's something to consider: We don't always know how we come off to other people, and the actual interviewer could share some of the same concerns.
Know basically what you want to talk about before the interview. If you're stumbling and fumbling for an answer on a very basic question, you're not putting your best foot forward. Have your very basic answers down pat, and anticipate some of the tougher questions before you step into the interview.

, It’s best to prepare for a wide variety of questions by thinking about your own career goals, long-term plans, past successes, and work strengths, but you should also brace yourself for the deceptively simple questions that most employers like to throw at their interviewees.


“What’s your biggest weakness?” is a classic canned interview question that many people dread. Answering this question is a bit of a tightrope walk: While you don’t want to be too honest (“I have a really hard time staying motivated”), you won’t fool anyone by trying to spin an obviously good quality into a weakness (“I just can’t bear to do less-than-outstanding work!”). Instead, think of a genuine issue you have as well as ways you have managed to work with/around it (“I’m not naturally a very organized thinker, but I’ve become very organized on paper and in my personal space as a result”).
“Where do you see yourself in five years?” is another common question that can take you off guard if you don’t see it coming. Your panicked reaction might be to blurt out, “Working diligently for you, of course!” but unless you are actually trying to get a job in your chosen career, this probably isn’t a good strategy. If you’re going after what will clearly be a short-term job – or even one that lasts only several years – be honest about what your greater aspirations are (ex. going back to school, starting your own business); ambition is a very desirable trait in an employee – to say nothing of honesty.
“Why do you want this job?” is so straightforward it can throw you for a loop. If you’re going into a field you care about, you will have a much easier time answering this. However, if, like many people, you’re just trying to make ends meet, you can answer the question by using it as a way of highlighting your skills (“I shine in fast-paced, high-pressure situations and would love to have the opportunity to cultivate my talents here”).
“Why did you leave your last job?” is a common question that shouldn’t be hard to answer provided that you didn’t have a major blowout with your previous employer. If you did, be honest (without being bitter or laying blame, as this will make you look ungracious and hard to work with) and try to put a positive spin on things.
Don't be afraid to admit that you don't know something. While you definitely want to seem knowledgeable, don't lie to make it seem like you know something you don't. You probably won't fool your interviewer, and admitting to not knowing something is much more impressive than lying during your interview. If need be, just acknowledge that you do not know the answer but will find out more about it and let them know afterwards.

, In any workplace, your wardrobe is a sign of your professionalism and is sometimes used to gauge your level of competence. When your coworkers and customers look at you, they should immediately feel comfortable working with you. It's easy to rule yourself out of a job just because you didn't take care of your appearance. As a rule of thumb, you should dress for the interview the way you would for the job itself. If the job is unusually casual, however, you might want to show up in business-casual clothes, but it's always better to be formal. Both men and women should choose subdued colors (blues, browns, grays, black) which make a professional impression. Make sure that your clothes are lint- and wrinkle-free. Avoid wearing perfume, after-shave, or scented lotion (but do wear deodorant).

, Dressing professionally means wearing a smart knee-length skirt suit in a dark color, along with sheer, non-patterned hosiery, closed toe shoes and subtle makeup.

, Choose a white shirt, dark-colored suit and tie and dark-colored shoes.]


Applicants in the service sector may sometimes be invited to wear business casual to an interview, although business formal is optional and usually best. For women, this means a simple, knee length dress with conservative shoes (no jeans). For men, this means dark or khaki pants with a collared button-up and leather shoes.If you're unsure of the customary interview clothing expected by the company, simply ask the HR rep or interview liaison. There's no shame in it. There is shame in feeling horribly under-dressed when you show up for an interview.

, Make sure you know exactly how to get there and, if you drive, just where to park so that you can arrive 15 to 20 minutes before the scheduled interview time. Go to bed early the day (or the days) before the interview so that you look rested and healthy on the big day. Bring an extra copy of your resume, CV, and/or references in case your interviewer wants to go over any points with you or neglects to bring their own copy.


If the interview is in the morning, be sure to eat a healthy breakfast. This is not just an empty suggestion. A breakfast high in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and foods high in vitamin E, such as nuts and seeds, will help improve brain function and leave you feeling more alert and invigorated.Consider exercising before the interview to annihilate stress and increase blood flow.If you're generally nervous or fidgety before an interview, it might be a good idea to work out before your interview. Go hard for an hour, and give your body at least another hour to calm down. Shower after exercising.

, This means everyone from the reception staff to the interviewer herself. You never know who has input in the hiring process, and you can only make a first impression once.


Look everyone in the eye and smile. Looking people in the eye will telegraph alertness, and smiling will signal friendliness.
Speak clearly and say ""please"" and ""thank you."" Make sure the people you talk to during the interview can make out what you're saying. Talking audibly, with good enunciation, tells people you're confident, while good manners tells them you're considerate of other people.
Don't noodle around on your phone or electronic device while waiting. In fact, leave it in your car. Even though it's practically acceptable, playing around on your phone can communicate boredom and frivolousness (even if that's not the case). Stick with a book or review your notes while waiting.

, Many people think that an interview is the perfect time to embellish. While you want to structure your answers so that your best, most qualified aspects take center stage, you don't want to deceive or outright lie. Companies do perform background checks, and lying about your experience is simply not worth it.


In a pinch, take a cue from politicians. When a politician hears a question they don't like, they simply answer a different question. You don't want to do this all the time, but you can do it in a pinch.

, Talking about yourself can be very difficult to do well: You're trying to convince someone you don't know that you're qualified for a position without sounding too cocky or pompous. Stick to what you know well, and keep things short and sweet.


Structure your answers so that you're talking in 30-90 second chunks. Any less and you're likely to seem unqualified; any more and your interviewer is likely to lose interest in what you're saying. In the ""tell me about yourself"" question, highlight 2-3 illustrative examples about yourself before wrapping up. Don't use slang or off-color humor during your interview. It's important not to say ""awesome"" or ""rad"" during an interview, unless you're interviewing for the local lifeguard position. It's also a good rule to avoid off-color humor; you never know when someone might take offense, and it's best not to risk it.
Talk about what other people think you do well. Don't add the preamble, ""My friends think I'm a competent social organizer."" Just go out and say it with the right touch of confidence and humility. Women tend to underestimate their overall job performance,so be aware of that before you second-guess or undercut yourself, because it's unlikely to get you a job.
Don't criticize your former employer. When you're talking about your past experience, be courteous about your former places of employment. Be honest about your experience — what you liked and disliked — but don't indict your former boss unnecessarily. Your class and restraint will shine through.

, Try to come off as a genuinely likable person if you can. If you're cynical, pessimistic, and absolutely disabused of any faith in humanity, try to tone it down during the interview. Being personable is about getting the interviewer's emotional side to like you and believe in you. Employers don't always hire the candidates most qualified for the job, but rather the candidates they like the best.

, Try to invest some feeling into the handshake and pleasantries, even if you think you bombed the interview. The interviewer should give you a time frame for when to expect to get a callback, if applicable.


Hold your head high and keep your cool. Your emotions are probably teetering at the highest of highs or the lowest of lows, but try to stay measured. Project a cool confidence — not cockiness — and walk out of the interview with your head held high.
If the interviewer does not tell you when they will contact you if you're a good fit for the position, it's appropriate to ask, ""When can I expect to hear back from you about the position?"" This will prove important later on.

, Now is a good time to thank the person you interviewed with, even if it's just a formality. You can say something like:



""Dear , Thank you for the opportunity to discuss my qualifications with you. I remain very impressed by , and invite you to contact me if you have any further questions. I look forward to hearing from you about this position.""

If you missed any important points in your interview you wanted to stress, you may include one or two in the thank-you letter. Keep the points brief, and tie them into a discussion point that you or the interviewer made during the interview.
If you received any help in getting the interview, follow up with appropriate parts of your network. Inform them that you received an interview, are grateful they helped you in your career search, and would be eager to help them in the future.

, You should have received some information about when you could expect to hear back from the employer. The standard time is about two weeks, but it can depend. If you've waited past the designated callback date — or the callback date wasn't set and it's been two weeks — follow up with the interviewer in a short email. You can say something like:



""Dear , I interviewed at your company , and am still interested in the position if it hasn't yet been filled. I'd greatly appreciate any information you might have about my candidacy. I look forward to hearing from you.""

While you can't control your past experience or the way someone measures you against someone else, you can control how much of your time you dedicate to showing the interviewer you really want the position. Don't be needy, and don't be greedy, but be persistent and courteous. You'll work harder than at least half the other candidates, and it could be the decisive factor in getting a job offer.

Role play.",How to Perform Well in a Group Interview1," Don't just go to the company's website. Go to other sites that you can find online that discuss the company, such as news sites, reviews and even competing companies in the same field. Look for the company's financial performance information, company history and any big wins (and losses). Try to find out the philosophy driving the company, including reading interviews given by and biographies about key past and present key people in the firm.;
, Make sure you come into the interview able to describe what you think the job is. Think about how your skills and background fit into the job, as you may have to answer that question on the spot.


Consider how your existing skills demonstrate ability to do what will be required of you in this job. This includes lateral thinking, to transfer skills that are not spot-on fits for the role but display adequate knowledge and experience to allow you to quickly tailor existing skills to the new role.

, Practice this introduction with a friend.

, If you can, get a few friends or family members to role play a group interview with you. Give them the job description and a bunch of questions. Encourage them to ad lib as well as ask the questions. Divide them into competing interviewees and interviewers. As well as trying to answer questions, watch how others answer questions and the sorts of dynamics you might encounter in a group interview situation. While it's not the real thing, if your friends/family play along properly, you may discover some useful information and approaches."
"
Arrive early.,
Introduce yourself to the people from the company before the group interview begins.,
Stay polite towards your fellow interviewees throughout the interview.,
Be alert and ready for anything.,
Listen.,
Be considerate.,
Give others a turn.,
Make eye contact with everyone at some point.,
Include quieter people.,
Praise others for their good ideas.,
Don't be shy.,
Smile.,
Be sure to say goodbye to the interviewers before you leave.",How to Perform Well in a Group Interview2," Being early will give you an advantage over some of the other interviewees, as it allows you extra time to meet the interviewers, take in the surrounds and settle yourself. Of course, others in the group may well do the same thing, so introduce yourself (see next).

, Be polite and exchange a brief chat to show that you're friendly and team-spirited.


Be aware that you will probably be wanting some space to compose yourself, and so will your fellow interviewees, so don't chew their ears off.
If another interviewee is too talkative, invasive or even trying to psych you out, be firmly polite and explain that you need a few minutes to yourself before the interview starts and simply move to another part of the room.

, Usually group interviews are designed to see how you interact with other people so be courteous to your fellow interviewees.

, These interviews are interactive. Pay attention, as you will be expected to participate and any lack of participation or enthusiasm will be noted.

, The interviewers will usually give an overview as well as detailed instructions. Some group interviews involve training and exercises involving several steps. For example, you may have to perform a mock sales pitch using the companies steps to a successful sale.

, Interviewers may be looking for leadership skills, but this does not mean talking over others or trying to be the loudest. Instead, act as a 'facilitator': say ""Shall we take a vote?"" and then count the votes. This shows that you are confident, but willing to listen to others.

, Again, if trying to show leadership, delegate tasks to others. Don't try to do it all yourself: no good leader would do that, but if you can co-ordinate others, this works well.Take detailed notes if you are allowed to do so.

, Direct your pitch at everyone, and don't focus all your attention on one person.

, If someone hasn't said much, ask their opinion. This is great as it shows you are considerate and a real team player. (But don't defer to someone else when it's your chance to speak.)

, This is a good way to seem friendly and a little authoritative at the same time.

, Speak out, but don't cut other people off or go over your allotted time for the question or exercise. If you are broken up into small groups, realize that people will still come over from time to time to hear what you are saying.

, It might be nerve-wracking but if you appear morose you shan't fare well.

, Send a follow-up letter that thanks them for the opportunity and their time.

Ask about next steps.",How to Ace a Lunch Interview," Visit the restaurant website to get an idea of the restaurant location, atmosphere, and menu. Consider visiting the restaurant before the interview so you know what to expect. Read the menu ahead of time. This will give you an idea of the type of food on offer and the range of prices, which should make ordering less stressful and time-consuming on the day. Don’t worry--your interviewer will cover the meal, but price should still be a consideration when ordering. More on that later.;
, Before the interview, make sure you know exactly how to get to the restaurant and how long it will take you to get there. Planning your route will allow you to arrive at the restaurant early, which is always a good idea for lunchtime interviews.


Remember to take lunchtime traffic conditions or public transport schedules into account.

, Talking to people you’ve never met before in the weeks leading up to the interview will help improve your ability to converse with strangers. It will also help you feel more comfortable, making you appear more confident and genuine. Start by giving a simple greeting or compliment to a person nearby. That compliment or greeting may evolve into a conversation.
Choose relevant conversation topics. For example, if you are in a mall, you might ask the person about their favorite store.
Practice daily--the more you practice small talk with strangers, the easier it will become. , You should be prepared to answer questions related your skills and experience. Emphasize how your skills and experience make you an ideal candidate for the position., Interviewers will be looking to see if you have a solid understanding of the company and your potential position. Do your research beforehand. It will show you are informed and serious about the company. , Lunch interviews tend to include more smalltalk, so make sure you are aware of current events, especially during the week leading up to the interview. Read a newspaper or watch the news the morning before your interview. This is a great way to brush up on current events directly beforehand. Read a large-scale, broadsheet newspaper rather than a local or tabloid paper. Pay particular attention to articles or sections of the paper that may be relevant to the job - whether that's finance, business, politics or international relations.
You should also listen to or watch the news the night before and morning of the interview. You don't want to be embarrassed by being unaware of any recent important events.

, You should dress for a lunch interview in the same way you would dress for a normal interview - in formal attire. This is true regardless of the location or type of restaurant. Make sure your interview outfit is clean and well-pressed. Make sure your hair and nails are neat. Don’t wear too much make-up.
Don't worry if your interviewer is dressed more casually than you are. Remember that it is always better to be overdressed than underdressed when it comes to interviews.

, Print out an up-to-date version of your resume and pack a bag with paper, pens and any other documents you might need. Your interviewer may not request them during the interview, but it's best to be prepared anyway., Try to arrive at least 15 minutes early--it is best to arrive before the interviewer. Put your phone on silent before the interview.If you arrive at the restaurant before your interviewer, wait for them in the waiting area, lobby, or just outside. Avoid waiting at the table or at the bar. , It's important to order carefully at a lunchtime interview. You want to avoid ordering messy or strong-smelling foods, as these can be awkward to eat and off-putting for the interviewer. Avoid foods that contain large amounts of garlic or onions, as these often have a very strong odor. Avoid messy foods like spaghetti, burgers loaded with condiments, messy sandwiches, large-leafed salads, greasy French fries, and foods that are overly loud and crunchy.

, Choose foods that are neat and easy to eat in small bites, like a chopped salad, penne pasta or fish. It will be easier to eat politely, and you won’t distract the interviewer. , Avoid ordering the most expensive items on the menu, such as steak or lobster (unless your interviewer insists), as this may be perceived as taking advantage of the company credit card, which will not produce a favorable result.Try to follow the lead of your interviewer. Ask them what they recommend, or wait for them to order and then select a dish at a similar price point.
You should refrain from ordering dessert unless your interviewer orders it first.

, In general, it is best to stay away from alcoholic beverages during lunchtime interviews, even if your interviewer is drinking. Alcohol can lower your inhibitions and cause you to speak or behave in a way that is less than professional. This does not mean you have to stick with water - order a soda or an iced tea instead., It is highly important that you display good table manners throughout your lunchtime interview. Poor table manners can be very off-putting for an employer, as it tells them that you cannot handle yourself in a professional setting.


Go back to basics- remember to place your napkin on your lap, keep your elbows off the table, keep your mouth closed while chewing and avoid talking while eating.

, Try to match your eating pace with the interviewer's - avoid eating too quickly or too slowly. This can be tricky, as you will probably be talking a lot and answering many questions over the course of the lunch.


Avoid making the interviewer wait for an answer as you struggle to chew and swallow a large bite. Take small bites that you can eat quickly and easily.
If your interview asks a complex or important question, consider putting your knife and fork aside for a minute or two while you take the time to answer.
Make sure you do eat. Picking at your food can make you seem nervous. , Lunch interviews are typically conversation oriented. Answer questions thoughtfully and carefully, and be aware of the conversation’s movement between more personal questions and questions relating to the position. , A two way conversation means that both parties should ask questions. Asking questions will show you are excited about the company while giving you more insight into the details of your position. , However, sometimes the employer will deliberately bring up tricky topics just to see how you handle them. In this situation, make sure to think before you speak so you can express your point of view clearly, without coming across as judgmental.


If you need more time to formulate an answer to a question, take a bite and and use the chewing time to think., As with any other interview, you should sell yourself. Make it clear to the interviewer why you want this position, and why you are a good fit for the company. However, you shouldn't immediately begin selling yourself. Allow the interviewer to guide the conversation. If there are multiple interviewees, say enough that your interviewers can evaluate you, but don’t dominate the conversation. Give others a chance to speak as well., You should be careful when dealing with an overly-friendly interviewer. Regardless of how informal they are with you, you should make an effort to behave professionally. Remember, they are still judging your behavior, so don't say or do anything risky., Your interviewer will be watching you closely to observe your social skills, and this includes your interactions with the waiting staff. Therefore, it's important polite and courteous to your waiter. A simple thank you or a nod or smile to the staff whenever they take your order, bring your food and clear your dishes can go a long way to prove that you are polite and have good social skills. Even if you are served a wrong dish or you do not like what you have ordered, try to go with the flow.

, While you are engaged in a conversation with the interviewer, be aware of whether they sound interested in continuing the conversation after the lunch or if they are keen to end it immediately after the meal. If the interviewer asks you for any final questions, it is time to wrap up. However, if the interviewer wishes to continue their discussion further over a cup of tea or coffee, you need to show your enthusiasm and follow suit.

, The interviewers will almost always pay for the meal. Be gracious and thank them when the bill comes. , Thank your interviewers when the check is being paid, and when you leave. Following the interview, remember to send the employer a note to thank them for their time and for the lunch. This can usually be done via email., Asking about the next steps in the process shows you are interested and gives you an idea of what to include in your thank you note. Say something like, “Thank you for you time. What are the next steps, and when should I expect to hear back?”

"
Do some research about the company ahead of time.,
Anticipate and practice your answers to common interview questions.,
Come up with a good strength and weakness.,
Bring some good questions of your own.,
Avoid clichés.,
Complete all necessary documents ahead of time.,
Dress the part.",How to Pass a Job Interview1," You will make an impression as a serious candidate if you come to the interview with some background knowledge about the company and the direction in which it’s heading. Try to figure out the goals of the business or the organization that you're applying for a job with, getting some sense of their style and the way they situate themselves against their competitors.


Focus on using the vocabulary that shows up on the company’s website. If you’re applying for a serving job at a “farm-to-table” restaurant, you should probably be familiar with what that means. If you're applying to work as an editor with a holistic magazine, you need to do some research into holistic medicine.
Knowing your interviewer's name and some details about that person's role in the company can help you have a more conversational dialogue during your interview, which often leads to the interviewer forming a more positive impression.;
, The most stressful part of the job interview is figuring out how to answer the questions that you’ll be asked. What does the interviewer want to hear? Trying to do some digging and anticipate possible questions will help you practice your answers before hand. Come up with answers that are sincere, but still reflect positively on you as a candidate. Frequently asked interview questions and possible answers include:


What do you know about this company?
Why are you a good fit for this company?
What do you bring to a team?
Describe a time when you overcame a challenge at work.

, What is your most difficult work-related challenge? What is your biggest strength? Biggest weakness? These are some of the most commonly asked interview questions, and the interview is the last moment you want to be struggle for a good answer. You'll be asked this question in almost every single job interview.


Good answers to these question are sometimes couched in self-praise: ""I'm very organized when it comes to my work and my schedule, but you'd never know it if you saw my desk"" is a good answer. Likewise, ""I tend to take on responsibilities but sometimes forget to ask questions when I need help"" can be honest and effective.
If you're applying for a leadership position, it's important to emphasize your leadership qualities and your self-reliance. A good strength might be, ""I'm good at communicating my vision to people and getting others excited about a common goal."" A good weakness might be, ""I have to remember to slow down and take on one project at a time. Sometimes I want to do too much.""If you're applying for an entry-level position, the interviewer won't be looking for you to prove leadership credentials. A good strength might be, ""I follow directions extremely well and I'm a fast learner. If I don't know how to do something, I'm always keen to learn and improve, so I won't have to ask twice."" A good weakness might be, ""I'm not always the best idea person, I'm mostly happy to help other people implement their ideas.""

, Interviewers will often ask if you have any questions during or after the interview, which can throw a lot of first-time interviewees. Asking a question shows you are engaged in the conversation, so come up with a list of questions to ask so you are prepared in case you can't come up with one quickly when you are prompted. Good questions might include:


How do you like working here?
What does someone need to be successful at this company?
Who will I be working with most closely?
What do the day-to-day operations consist of?
Is there room for growth with this company?
What's the turnover like for this position?

, Interviews are a time to let your potential employer get to know you, the real you, not a pumped-up, cliched version of yourself who's giving canned answers to Try to get a job. The purpose of the interview isn't to suck up, show off, or tell the interviewer what they want to hear. The purpose is to give sincere answers, not to insult the interviewer's intelligence. Avoid interview lines like ”My only weakness is that I’m a perfectionist"" or ""This company needs someone like me to turn it around.""

, Depending on the interview process, it is really helpful if you bring along an extra copy of your resume, references, work portfolio, and a cover letter, if applicable. Look over all documents for typos and grammatical errors. If you have time, give them to someone else to review and catch any silly mistakes you may have missed.


It's also important to familiarize yourself intimately with your resume, CV, and other application materials. It can look suspicious if you have trouble recalling content from your resume, so you want to make sure all names, dates, and described responsibilities are clear.

, Pick out an outfit that makes you look professional and feel confident, as well as something that matches the business to which you’re applying.


In most cases dark-colored suits are appropriate for interviews, unless you are interviewing for a job with a very casual dress code, in which case dress pants and a clean, collared shirt are appropriate.

Get there on time.,
Be yourself.,
Listen closely and pay attention.,
Sit up and keep your back straight.,
Think before you speak.,
Be willing to do what it takes.,
Sell yourself in conversation.,
Take notes.,
Follow up.",How to Pass a Job Interview2," Nothing looks worse than arriving to a job interview late. Show up at the appropriate time, ready to go. If your interview is in an unfamiliar area, drive to the location the day before to make sure you aren't late because you got lost. Aim for no more than 10 or 15 minutes before your assigned interview time.


While it’s important to show up on time, showing up too early can be frustrating for potential employers. If they told you to be there at a specific time, that means they want you there at that time, not 30 minutes before. If you want to make a good impression, follow instructions specifically.
Stay busy as you wait, writing notes or reviewing the job description and company information. Keep documents and materials in your left hand so you are prepared to get up and shake hands as soon as the interviewer comes out to greet you.

, At an interview, you'll likely feel nervous and want to perform your best. It's a scary situation, no doubt about it. But Try to remember that you don't need to put on an act to get a job. You just need to be yourself. Focus on remaining calm and listening closely to the conversation as it unfolds. Be yourself.Interviewers expect you to be nervous. Don't worry about saying so. It might help to get it out of the way and get to know your interviewer on a more personal level, which can help you to stand out. Don't be afraid of small talk.

, One of the worst things you could do in an interview is have to ask an interviewer to repeat their question because you weren't paying attention. Don't disqualify yourself by letting your mind wander. Most interviews won't take more than 15 minutes, and certainly never longer than an hour or so. Focus on the conversation at hand and respond actively.

, Lean forward and listen closely during an interview, using open and interested body language. Look at the interviewer when you're talking and when they are speaking.

A great interviewing trick is to look at the bridge of the interviewers' nose, between the eyes. They will have no idea you aren't making eye contact and it will help you relax a little. Try it with a friend, you will be amazed.







, Another common mistake in an interview is talking too much and too quickly. You don’t need to fill awkward silences with chatter. Especially if you’re a nervous talker, don’t feel the need to fill the space with talking. Sit back and listen. Don’t give away too much.


When you're asked a question, you don't need to have an immediate answer. In fact, it can be a turn off for an interviewer to feel as if you've given no thought whatsoever to a complicated question. Slow down and think about it. Pause, say, ""That's a great question, let me think about a good answer.""

, Your go-to answer in a job interview should be ""Yes."" Are you willing to work nights and weekends? Yes. Are you comfortable taking on multiple clients? Yes. Do you have experience working in a high-paced environment? Yes. Most jobs provide enough on-the-job training for skills that are essential to conducting the day-to-day operations that you'll be able to pick up anything you're unfamiliar with after you get the job. Don't disqualify yourself ahead of time. Be agreeable and sort out the details after you get the job.


Don't lie about some things. Being willing to do what's necessary for the position doesn't mean that you should stretch your experiences or tell fibs that'll get you outed the first day on the job. If you've never cooked a meal in your life, you shouldn't tell the kitchen manager you're a great cook.

, In general, the purpose of the interview is just to get to know you as a person. They've got your resume, your experiences, and your essentials on paper. What they don't know is you.


An interview isn't an interrogation or an argument. It's a conversation. Participate in it. When the interviewer is talking, pay close attention and listen to what they are saying, listen, and respond honestly. Some interviewees are thrown when interviewers don't instantly launch into a series of questionnaire-style questions.

, Carry a pen and paper in your portfolio or briefcase to jot quick notes if necessary. You may also bring extra copies of your application documents and questions list to refer to if needed.


Note-taking makes you appear engaged and well-organized. It also helps you remember important details and names, which can be useful later in the interview, or when you are making follow-up contact. Be careful to only take brief notes when necessary to take any at all, since extensive note-taking can be distracting.

, It's usually a good idea to get in touch shortly after the interview to keep your name somewhere in the conversation. Unless you've been explicitly told not to, make contact to follow up on your interview. Calls are usually discouraged, but emails or other correspondence would be a good idea. Since many companies have a lot of references to check, make sure your references are ready to receive the call and get back to the employer.


Summarize important details of the interview, using your notes to refresh your memory. Make sure to thank the interviewer for the opportunity, and mention that you look forward to hearing from the company soon.

Don’t show up with coffee.,
Turn off your phone and put it away.,
Don't talk about money.,
Treat your interview like a conversation, not an interrogation.,
Don’t knock your previous boss.,
Avoid pre-interview cigarettes and alcohol.,
Don’t be afraid to reveal yourself.",How to Pass a Job Interview3," For some reason, lots of people think bringing a to-go cup of coffee to a job interview is a great idea. To an interviewer, this looks informal at best and disrespectful at worst. You're not on your lunch break, so treat yourself to a latte after the interview, not before. Even if the interview is early, or you might end up waiting a long time to get through with it, don't show up with a cup of coffee. The plus side is you won't have to worry about spilling it.

, Biggest faux-pas of the mobile phone age? Using yours in a job interview. Never ever take your phone out and look at it at any point in the job interview. As far as your interviewer is concerned, you should be a troglodyte who's never even heard of an app. Turn your phone all the way off, keep it in your car, and never, under any circumstances, give the interviewer the impression that a text message takes precedence over getting this job.

, In the interview, it's not the time to ask about benefits, the possibility of a raise, or really even bring up the topic of money. If you're applying for a job, it's time to focus on your skills and qualifications.


Sometimes, you'll be prompted to provide a base salary requirement for the job. The best answer for this is that you're willing to work for the lower end of the average salaries for your position. Express that you really want the job and that you'll be fine with what's being offered in the legal limit.

, Never get defensive in an interview, even if you feel like you're not getting on perfectly with the interviewer. It's supposed to be a conversation, so try to assume the best in people. Nobody is trying to antagonize you on purpose. Treat it as a chance to prove yourself and come up with a good explanation, not a defensive snark.

, Making petty comments about previous coworkers, superiors, or other job in general should be avoided. Even if you're applying for a rival business, avoid painting yourself like someone with a grade, or like someone who'll be difficult to work with. It's bad form to gripe about your previous job.


If you're asked why you're leaving your current job, say something positive. ""I'm looking for more out of my work environment and I'm excited about getting a fresh start. To me, this looks like a great place to do it.""

, Even if you indulge in the occasional smoke, avoid smoking before a job interview. A recent study revealed that up to 90 percent of employers would hire a nonsmoker over a smoker of equal qualification. Right or wrong, smoking makes the interviewee looks nervous.Likewise, having a few drinks to soothe tense nerves should always be avoided. You want to be sharp and on point, not sloppy. Interviewers will expect you to be nervous. It’s a job interview.

, Billionaire mogul Richard Branson claims to hire primarily based on personality, as opposed to experience or quantifiable skills. Each job is different and the essential aspects of the job can be learned. Focus on selling yourself and letting your true personality shine through, not on trying to be something you’re not."

Don't practice too much.,
Ask friends to listen.",How to Develop Your Personal Elevator Pitch," The very first thing your pitch should do is introduce you to your listener. Immediately launching into an anecdote about your accomplishments or a list of your skills might leave your listener feeling a little bewildered.


For example, you can start by saying something like, “Hi, I’m Amanda Smith. I just recently graduated from the University of Maine’s marketing program,” or, “Hi, I’m Ryan Long and I work in manufacturing sales.”
In both examples, your listener immediately learns your name and the most important thing about you.;
, Now that your listener knows who you are, tell them why you are at the event you’re both attending. It might be a job fair or an industry conference or you might just be dropping off a resume. In each situation, you should know why you’re there.For example, if you’re attending a job fair, your objective is probably to get a job. You could say something like “Hi, I’m Amanda Smith. I just recently graduated from the University of Maine’s marketing program. I’m looking for an entry-level position in social media coordination.”
You could also say something like, “Our auto parts manufacturing business has been growing, but I’m looking to take our sales numbers to record-breaking heights.”
In both examples, your listener has learned who you are, what you do, and what you’re looking for next in only two sentences.

, The best way to convince your listener that you can reach your stated objective is to share past successes. This tells your listener that you already have a good track record in your field. Use the CAR technique for this: Give the context for your accomplishment, the action you took, and the result of that action.For example, your accomplishment might be that you improved your company’s sales over the last quarter. The context might be that sales were okay, but you believed they could be better. Your action might have been that you sat down with the sales team and reworked your entire selling strategy. Your result was that your company’s sales increased., Telling your listener what skills you have allows you to emphasize what you can do for them in the future (and not just what you’ve already done for someone else in the past). Share both your hard skills – things like degrees, certifications, and work experience – and your soft skills – things like being good at interpersonal communication or an excellent writer.For example, you might say something like “I have a Master’s Degree in Business and worked for eight years as the assistant sales manager for a smaller auto parts manufacturer. My superiors have always commented on my ability to communicate clearly and effectively with our clients.”

, Your call to action is basically what you can do to seal the deal after you’ve made the pitch. This will look differently from situation to situation, but it should set up the next step in your relationship with this new contact.For example, you can end your pitch by saying something like “Can we set up a meeting to discuss how I can increase your company’s sales?” You can also end it more simply by saying “I think I could be a great asset to your company; can I give you my business card?”

, When you’re giving your pitch, don’t stare at the floor or the ceiling or your listener’s shoulder. Look them in the eye while you’re speaking to them. This can make your listener feel more connected and you seem more professional., Introducing yourself to a complete stranger and then listing your accomplishments and goals can make you feel very vulnerable. However, acting confident even if you don’t necessarily feel that way can make a big difference in how your listener perceives you. If you sound like you believe you are qualified for a new position or can accomplish the goals you lay out, your listener is more likely to believe it, too., The best way to keep your listener engaged is to use words that grab their attention. One of the reasons some people sound as if they speak with low energy if because of their word choice.


Some examples of attention-grabbing and descriptive words include ""immediately,"" ""guaranteed,"" ""instantly,"" ""explosive,"" ""exclusive, ""amazing,"" ""eye-opening,"" and ""fearless.""

, You want to make sure that you seem friendly, open, and inviting as you give your pitch, and the best way to do this is through body language. Face your listener straight on, keep your hands out of your pockets, and stand up straight., The most engaging elevator pitches are those made by people who make you care about what they are saying. A good way to get your listener to care is to share your motivation for meeting certain objectives.For example, your motivation for increasing your company’s sales numbers might be that you believe that the services your company provides will truly improve your clients' quality of life. This is an excellent motivation beyond wanting more clients or to make more money.
You can say something like “I spent a few weeks on a study abroad trip in India, where I learned just how important clean drinking water is to a family’s overall health. I believe that getting our water filters into as many homes as possible will truly help to improve our clients’ and clients’ families’ quality of life.”

, The quickest way to lose someone’s attention during an elevator pitch is to use field- or company-specific jargon. If your listener doesn’t understand what you’re saying, they won’t stay engaged for long. The simpler and more direct your language, the better., When you’re giving your pitch, don’t just drone on to the end of it and then walk away. Ask your listener questions – what do they do for a living? Where did they go to school? Showing interest in your listener makes your pitch part of a conversation and not just a monologue., Once you have what you feel like is a good draft of your elevator pitch, time how long it takes you to say it out loud in a conversational manner. Set a timer on your phone or computer or just by looking at your watch, and see if you can share everything you need to in 60 to 90 seconds.If it takes you longer than 60 to 90 seconds, don’t just speed up. If you speak too quickly while you’re giving your pitch, it will become obvious to your listener that you’re giving them a canned speech, and they’ll likely lose interest.

, Once you’ve said your pitch out loud a few times, you’ll want to revise it. It might be too long, which requires streamlining some of the information you include. You should also continuously update your pitch to include new experiences and skills or changing goals., You won’t be giving your elevator pitch to the same person in the same situation every time you give it. Make sure you practice your speech before each new event or situation and tweak it to match.


For example, if you’re at a career fair, you’ll want to emphasize goals that relate to getting a job (or changing jobs) and the skills that make you an excellent new addition to an existing team.
If you’re going to a networking event that might help you expand your client base, emphasize the goals related to customer retention and the skills and accomplishments that will attract new customers to you.

, Although you should practice enough that you can comfortably share everything you want to say within your time limit, you shouldn’t over-practice. If you do, your pitch will end up sounding rehearsed and, even worse, you could sound bored when you’re saying it. You should know what you want to say but it should also sound fresh., Once you feel comfortable with your pitch, ask at least one of your friends to listen to it and offer feedback. They can help you determine if you’re speaking too quickly, if you sound too rehearsed, and if you’re engaging."

Drink electrolyte-replenishing sports drinks as soon as possible.,
Pop a pill.,

Use eye drops to remove redness.,
Go through your typical grooming routine.,
Dab concealer over under-eye bags.,
Check it before you wreck it.,
Rehearse how you plan to respond to questions.,
Be punctual.,
Know when to reschedule.,
Bring water with you.",How to Interview for a Job when You Have a Hangover1," This will help ease any symptoms of dehydration, which often goes hand in hand with a hangover.


The processes that break down alcohol also produce lactic acid and other chemicals that interfere with the production of glucose (sugar) and electrolytes; that's why sports drinks are a good idea.
While coffee will help with alertness, it actually dehydrates your system, and might further upset your stomach, so avoid it.;
, Taking a non-acetaminophen over-the-counter painkiller like aspirin or ibuprofen can be beneficial. Take a few extras with you if you are going to be interviewed outside the recommended time frame for taking the next pills.


Alcohol disrupts how the liver processes acetaminophen, so taking that may lead to liver inflammation and permanent damage.

, Make a bacon sandwich (with burnt toast) with a side of bouillon soup.


The toast boosts your blood sugar. Carbon in the burnt part helps filter impurities, which is why people hospitalized for alcohol poisoning get a potent carbon slurry pumped into their stomachs.
The protein in bacon breaks down to amino acids to help replenish brain neurotransmitters that were depleted by the alcohol.
The bouillon soup restores salt and potassium.

, A few drops of solution may help. Follow the directions and give the drops approximately half an hour to start working.

, Showering and grooming will be especially important as you may look (and smell) like something the cat dragged in. Be sure you wash well to reduce the possibility that you still smell like a beer-soaked cigarette butt.

, Even men will benefit from a few dabs of concealing make-up if dark circles or bags have surfaced due to a night of partying.

, Have a friend or spouse give you the “once over” before you leave. Have someone else evaluate how you look before you leave and ask for an honest opinion. Ask your friend or spouse for suggestions if they think you look disheveled or unprofessional.

, Your brain may not be working at full capacity so try to keep answers and comments concise and to the point, remembering that you might have a tendency to ramble just to cover up your pain or distress.

, As with any interview situation, hungover or not, your punctuality is crucial to a good beginning. If you're late, not only is this the first blot on your character but it will intensify the scrutiny of your presentation and appearance; it's only human to start wondering what might have caused the tardiness.

, While you may not want to reschedule the interview, heading out may do more damage than good, especially where the interview is with the firm you're already working for and everyone knows your usual bubbly self. Indicators that rescheduling is the only sensible option include:


You're ready to puke. All you need is to shake hands with your prospective employer and then vomit all over the room. If you feel as if your stomach can’t take the interview, don't even attempt it.
You're damaged goods. Fights, falling downstairs or even hickies that can't be successfully hidden, all warrant rescheduling.
You're still drunk. Never attend a job interview if you think you still have a buzz or you're still drunk. No employer will find this humorous or will look past it, no matter how talented or qualified you are for the job.

, Drink lots of water beforehand, and consider taking along a water bottle to your interview. Having such an item is commonplace and if you do need to hydrate during the interview and water hasn't been provided to you, you can excuse yourself to take a sip from the bottle where needed.


If it seems unprofessional to do this, don't hesitate to ask for a glass of water when being interviewed instead, it will help to hydrate and cleanse.

,How to Pass a Job Interview4,
"
Start preparing as early as possible: Larger corporations will generally contact you to schedule an interview weeks or about a month before the interview will occur.,
Get help from others.,
Write down and practice at least three questions to ask the interviewer, showing how much you care about this kind to work.,
Write answers to the basic questions that you expect to be asked.,
Make sure you are dressed appropriately.,
Leave your calculator and gum at home.,
Remain respectful, professional and confident, smiling a little (not with a pasted on grin) and be as calm, yet enthusiastic as possible.,
Sell yourself.,
Be inquisitive.,
Be polite.,
Be persistent.,
Be savvy during phone interviews.,
Be savvy during Skype Interviews.",How to Have a Good Job Interview," You should spend this whole time prepping so that you're comfortable and knowledgeable going into the interview. Be ready to ask the right kind of questions--and also, to respond well to any questions that will come your way.


Do your research. Research the company and specifically the job description and how it fits in the particular business unit or department. Get as much background information as you can to show your abilities for doing the job responsibilities and duties--so that you won't get caught speechless, if you're asked to talk about how you work and handle fellow employees, any client contacts, and disciplinary issues (and even more so, if you will be a supervisor, manager or teacher, etc).
Also use internet search engines to research corporate officers who you know or think will be interviewing you. If you're having trouble finding people and information, try Linkedin. Use it as your career networking site for helping you build professional connections.;
, Don't prepare for a job interview by yourself. There are some valuable resources that can help you along your way to ask for help:



Seek out experts. Find yourself a mentor and/or an alumni from your university currently working in your desired career. Talk to them and get an inside scoop. Ask for advice. Career Business Discussion Boards is a good website you can use to connect with such people.

Find a friend who is also preparing for a job interview. Interview each other so that you get comfortable with the verbal and social aspects of the interview. You can also tell each other your anecdotal stories/examples of your strengths, etc. that you're considering for the interview. Ask him or her what each story portrays about you, and use the feedback to choose the ones that best represent the parts of yourself that you want to illustrate and ""sell"" nicely to the interviewer.

, These should not be things that can be easily discovered through simple research (learn long before the hiring interview about the expected pay range and company benefits such as profit sharing plan, etc., as this interview is not the time for that). Think about what you want to know about the specific company, and what your responsibilities and opportunities will be there. Remember that an interview goes both ways, and that you have to show that you're very interested in this company; say very rapidly, ""I love this opportunity"". Then, you want them to know that you really care--so ask your great questions. Your three or four serious questions might include the following points:


Asking about ""room for growth"" within the company shows commitment. Sure, you're applying for a specific position, but you can show that you plan to stick around for the long haul.
Asking nicely about ""who I'll be working with most closely"" can show social skills and good attitudes. ""I am very interested in the people I'll be most often interacting with in the company."" This can help you show that you're a good fit the job. It may turn out you would be spending a lot of your time working with one of the interviewers or a company officer that you may be able to meet on that day, and you can show them how they will like you, and you them. Be courteous and show that you are nice and happy to meet them.

Say, ""This is great."" I'm impressed."" ""I really like this company/love this department"", etc.--if you get to meet some people in the offices, sales and shop, etc. Show gratitude and happiness at this opportunity--not embarrassment or shyness. Make acquaintances/friends (confidently), but don't overdo it, not mushy or sappy!


Asking for more information about one or two of the toughest (most important) tasks that are part of the job description will show that you've closely read the job description. Now you are revealing what your daily life and contributions at the company will look like.

, Though an interview always has the potential to surprise you, there are a series of basic questions that you'll tend to see in an interview, so it's best to be prepared to answer them thoroughly and honestly before you walk into the interview. Don't look like you're caught off guard or like you haven't spent any time actually thinking about the job responsibilities. Compose good answers to key questions that you will probably be asked:


What are your strengths? (For example: a teacher or supervisor/management applicant needs to have a philosophy of progressive discipline and having only a few Rules, but plan to teach as ""procedures"" as needed/when needed.) Can you give us a concrete example to illustrate them?
What are your weaknesses? (Neither give many bad faults nor say ""I have none or one."", as if you've never made a mistake. Because this will make you look like you're dishonest and full of yourself.)
Why do you want to do this work/for this company? Why do you think you'd be a good fit?
What are your long term career goals (such as training and certifications you want)?
What was the biggest professional challenge you've ever solved/faced? How did you tackle it?
Are you good at working in teams and sharing your better ideas? Can you provide an example of your strong team work?
Why are you choosing to leave your present company? (If you're currently employed elsewhere, be honest about wanting to leave without being overly negative or talking bad about your employer. You should be respectful of management at all times.)

, Your wardrobe is a sign of your professionalism and is sometimes used to gauge your level of experience and competence. When your coworkers and customers look at you, they should immediately feel comfortable working with you. So, dress as casually or formally as is appropriate, in a professional style for this line of work, a dark suit and conservative necktie for a man--jacket and modest skirt for a woman--is good, even if you will work in a uniform or blue jeans. You can show them that you do look good when you should.


Show up a little early with have everything you need (30 minutes is good) to not be late, dashing about, rumpled and possibly breathless and upset. Carry a nice portfolio/expanding folder, containing loose leaf paper and extra copies of your resume. Make sure to also bring a couple of pens and pencils so that you can jot down notes. Be prepared with a pen and paper, if you're asked for one.

, If you absolutely need to bring your cell phone, make sure it's completely powered off before you go into the interview.


Do not bring anyone with you to the interview, unless they drop you off and wait at a coffee-shop nearby.
Do not roll into the interview with your cup of Starbucks. This shows that you're taking a much-too casual approach or that you're too inexperienced.

, Don't act nervous, tapping fingers, wagging your legs or wringing your hands (crossing ankles or arms is considered defensive/in a standoff), nor sitting stiffly as a statue, but also not flopping around like you're lazy (silly or too relaxed). If you're asked to answer a case (what if...) question, talk through the process you would use, in such a case. Don't be afraid to ask whether your ideas sound thorough enough—you'll be evaluated on your ability to structure your thinking and to share your thoughts well, not on the number of questions you ask. In fact, talking through your process is a great way to engage the interviewer and turn the interview into more of a give and take discussion. This can give you valuable clues and a guide on what they want to know (so you can show how you can fulfill their needs).


If you need something clarified, don't be afraid to ask. You'll do better, if you know exactly what is being asked of you. Don't ask a question every few seconds, or you'll sound confused (you want to show that you have good motivation toward what's good, reasonable and logical).

, What are your unique selling points and how can you match your highlights to what they want? Make sure you use plenty of examples as proof of your abilities. Show the interviewer that you can find the positives in your past experiences—this is not a time to complain (and shoot yourself in the foot) about what you hated in your previous work situation(s). Focus on how this really is good/much more suitable to you.


Remember those examples of your strengths that you wrote down earlier? This is exactly when they'll come in handy.
There's a difference between being confident and bragging. Make sure you show what a capable, intelligent employee you are without singing your own praises.

, Don't forget to ask your questions. Pay attention as the interviewer answers—you may even want to jot down notes. This is both to prove that you are listening and also to give yourself a way to reflect on the interview later, if you end up having to decide between multiple positions.


Don't ask the same questions at every interview. Ask questions that are tailored to the company to show that you've really done your research.

, Listen to each question fully before you begin to respond. Never assume that your interviewer has read your CV, but don't treat him or her as though he or she hasn't, either. After the interview, do not forget to send a follow up thank you-email. These are generally better than hand written thank you notes, as they are quicker than snail mail. However, you should be sure that it is well proofread and addressed to the right person and identifying yourself and the matters involved, before you send them.


Part of being polite is remembering to thank the interviewer for meeting with you after the interview. Show him that you really appreciate the time and effort he spent on speaking with you.

, Keep interviewing. The more you interview, the better you will become at it. Don't get discouraged. It's unlikely that your first interview will lead to you landing your dream job, but that doesn't mean you should lower your standards after the third interview. Keep aiming for what is realistic for your goals and background, and you will eventually find what you're looking for.

, If it is a phone interview, it's usually with a PR person who knows very little about the position and technical terms related to a specific job. Make sure to use keywords and buzzwords while answering questions because you are trying to paint a picture with words, since the interviewer has no visual clues of you. Do this and you will pass the phone interview.


Treat the phone interview like a real professional interview. Go to a quiet place, don't get distracted or do anything else but speak, and talk slowly and clearly.
Keep your notes in front of you, but still be prepared to talk on the fly. Having your notes can make you feel more confident about what to say, but don't lean on them.
Dress for business. Dressing in a professional manner will make you feel more prepared, than if you do your phone interview in pajamas or shorts.

, The Skype interview is becoming more popular than ever, and has been a great way for employers to weed out employees that may not be a good fit during the first or second round of interviews. So, find a place with good lighting and a simple professional background, dress up and groom properly, and test your camera and microphone beforehand to make sure you're ready for the interview.


Treat the interview just as you would a face to face interview. Don't think it's less serious or professional just because you're meeting over the computer.

Ask Questions.",How to Limit Your Mistakes During a Job Interview," You might not have enough idea about the company when you applied for a job but that has to change between the time you're asked for an interview and the time you're sitting in there explaining why you want to work for the place so badly. Not knowing much about the place you're interviewing at reveals to the interviewers that you don't really care and that sets the interview offside from the beginning. Do some background research now and gather as much information about the organization as possible. Some ways to do this include:


Read the company's or organization's annual report and related documents. Know all about their latest ventures, financial situation, philanthropic endeavors, awards and achievements. In particular, know what they expect from staff and how they reward high performing staff.

Do a search online for the company or organization. Few businesses stay offline, so even if it's just a Facebook page, you can find out information about your potential employer. Read through the website or related pages and soak up everything you can.
Be knowledgeable about the company's or organization's products and/or services, expertise, and milestones. If there is a long history, read up on it.
Avoid rote learning company facts. They don't want facts recited back at them; as you learn, think about how your job skills will match what you've learned and what you can do to help the company or organization achieve more of the goals its aiming for.;
, Take extra two or three copies of your resume, cover letter, references, college transcripts, professional documents, and anything else needed with you. Do this even though you already submitted them earlier.


Ensure that all documents produced by you are well typed, free of typos and organized.
Carry everything in an ordered file or folder; this neatness and organization already reveals the level of your professionalism when the interviewer sees you refer to it or hand documents to them from it.
Keep a pen, small notepad and a flash drive with your important documents in it in case they want a soft copy of anything.






Take some time before the interview to run through some ""practice questions."" Plan to have specific examples of past challenges and successes you had, and gear your answer towards the job for which you are applying. For instance, if you are interviewing for a management position, be prepared to give examples on how you motivated people, or effectively led a group of individuals to achieve company objectives.

, First impressions last. It is human nature to presume that a person turning up in jeans to an office job really doesn't have their mind on the job and therefore really doesn't want the job. Same for unironed clothing, clothing with obvious stains, disheveled clothing, and clothing that is too revealing or informal. Once the interviewers have a negative impression from your clothing, it's hard to shake this. Don't allow your clothes to let you down; this is one area in which you can excel. And be sure that over-dressing is always preferred to under-dressing for a job interview; it shows you're serious about the job.


For men: wear professional suits, slacks, and a formal shirt. Make sure your socks match your pants; alternately, match your shoe color.






For women: Wear a suit with either pants or skirts.






Don't neglect the shoes. People do look! Make sure they're polished and match the outfit.






Use excellent grooming - comb or brush your hair neatly, clean your teeth, all the usual things your mom taught you.







, Always arrive 15 to 20 minutes before the interview time. Allow time to park your car or for the public transportation to get you where you need to be. Go inside the building and use the additional time to relax until you are called on. Practice some deep breathing while you wait and go over interview answers in your head if you need to, otherwise just focus on peaceful thoughts. This way you don’t have to rush in, and you can stay calm and focused during interview.


You may be the best in your field but also least punctual person in your region. However, your employer doesn't need to know this yet. If you do have a problem with always been late, raise this with your boss after you've landed the job and work out special dispensations for your night owl tendencies then. Societies that value punctuality do not place talent before being on time, so don't push your luck by being late to the interview.

, When you enter the interview room and meet the interviewers, be respectful to them and greet them with a smile on your face. When you are asked to have a seat, sit up straight and stay confident. This way you will look professional and mature, as well as setting them at ease about your intention to listen and respond with eagerness.


Always bear in mind that you're human and your interviewers are too. And basically, humans want to get along with one another. So, being affable and likable is a big part of selling yourself; your interviewers are trying to see if you are someone who will ""fit in"".

, There might be situations when you're asked something and you think you don't have clue as to how to answer. Don’t be nervous – the fact is you think you don't know but if you've done your research as outlined earlier, there will always be an answer, even if it has to be a lateral one.


If you don't know something technical, answer confidently that that area is not your field of expertise and you would like to gain knowledge on that in future.
Answer all the questions politely and take notes if required.

, When asked about your qualifications and why they should hire you, be specific. State in a way that catches interviewers’ attention and make them feel that they would make a mistake if you are not hired., Most of the time, interviewers ask some tricky questions because these are how they separate the people they want to work with from everyone else. And quite simply, if you're not well prepared, you will get caught off-guard. So be ready to answer the typical questions that throw many interviewees:

What are your strengths and weaknesses?
Why do you think they should hire you? Tell them something unique about yourself.
Why did you leave your previous job? What went wrong? Read How to answer an interview question about your previous job and How to answer an interview question about why you left a job for more information.

More ideas for great answers can be found in How to answer tricky interview questions, How to answer tough interview questions, and last but not least, How to answer a weird and wacky interview question.

, Be positive about your past experiences and qualifications. Show them how much knowledge you gained by giving examples and how they can be useful to them if you are hired.


Remember not to brag or show off as it might kill the entire mood.
And definitely don't roll your eyes and launch into a completely negative explanation about how your previous boss and co-workers were the worst so-and-so's you've ever had the misfortune to know; nobody will employ someone who is both so negative and so ready to dump on others!

, If you have a phone interview always remember the only impression your interviewer can get about you is the way you speak. Make sure you use right key words to create a good feeling. Smile when you talk and stay confident because interviewer can sense that even though s/he can’t see you., If you get the job you applied for, don’t forget to send a thank you email or a note. And even if you don't get it, it can't hurt to say thank you for their time. Going that extra mile even when you don't get the job can be something that gets remembered when they do need someone with your skills base and they still have your notes on file. You might be their second choice, or tied for first and showing the appropriate professional courtesy may give you the advantage you need over their other choice. Never shut the door., You will be given the opportunity to ask questions. Remember, you are interviewing them as well. The time to find out you don't like the manager or the team is before you're hired. Recall scenarios you didn't like at previous jobs and ask how they handle the same situation. You may only get to ask one or two questions, so make them count. For example, if you like structure and documented processes, ask about their Procedures Manual. If they tell you their procedures aren't fully documented, you might not be a good fit there (or you may be able to document their processes for them for extra points)."
"
Be minty fresh.,
Realize that your concentration is probably going to be below par during this interview.,
Don't lose your focus.,
Take great care not to fidget.,
Breathe deeply.",How to Interview for a Job when You Have a Hangover2," Just before the interview starts, use a strong breath mint or strip. It's important to get rid of any traces of alcohol in your breath, which might still be lingering in your lungs.


Don't take a mint that you'll still be chewing on during the interview. Strips are better as they will dissolve quickly.

, This means that you'll need to try extra hard to stay focused and to really listen to the questions.


If you need to pause to recompose yourself at any stage, do so; this is far better than regurgitating a lot of nonsense just to fill the gap. People will respect a thoughtful pause and consider that you're taking the matter seriously (which you are, of course).

, Pick a spot in the room behind the interviewer's head that you can use to keep refocusing your attention on.


Even if it's blurry, it'll be a safety spot for you to return to, making it appear as if you're focused on the interviewer without having to actually maintain complete direct eye contact all the time.

, Fidgeting comes from nerves, boredom and wanting to be distracted (or somewhere else). Unfortunately, if you're experiencing a hangover, you may just be feeling all three things and be tempted to fidget to overcome the desire to leave or fall asleep.


Do something to keep yourself focused and alert, such as pinching the palm of your hand regularly or knocking your knees together gently (choose a focusing technique that doesn't look obvious to the interviewers or they'll be worried about your sanity).

, Taking deep breaths during the interview will not only help you relax, but it'll also ensure that your blood is getting enough oxygen and make you feel a little bit more fresh and alert. Sit up straight, and avoid sighing when you exhale.

""I don't take initiative as much as I'd like."",

""I talk too much."",
""I'm not great at public speaking."",
""I'm not as organized as I could be.""",How to Communicate Your Weaknesses," When you’re asked about your weaknesses, especially in an interview, it’s usually not the weakness that’s the most important thing. It’s whether you are aware of your weaknesses and what you do about them. If the answer is “I don’t have any,"" then it becomes obvious that the primary weakness is a lack of self-awareness. Also, it's important to understand that being aware of weaknesses is not the same as being weak. Knowing about and compensating for your weakness is in fact a very important strength.

, You should regularly examine yourself to identify your primary weaknesses. If you don’t know what they are, you can’t communicate them to others. If you already know the answer, you won’t have to fumble and you will have considerably greater esteem in the eyes of the interviewer.

, As indicated above, this is not a one-time shot. You should do this exercise on a somewhat regular basis. Start with a 3-month recurring cycle and if that’s too often, drop it down to once every 6 months.

, Saying ""I'm a perfectionist, and I hold people too accountable"" when you're not, and you don't, isn't a good idea. When someone asks you about your weaknesses, be honest. Tell the truth. At the same time, learn how to massage the truth to put your best foot forward. (This is called ""public relations."") This will help you present yourself as a more well-rounded candidate.

, Twisting your answer to make it seem like your primary weakness is that you’re already perfect will always fail. “My greatest weakness is that I’m too much of a perfectionist"" would make the interviewer think you live in denial of yourself. If this is truly an area you struggle in, make your answer honest and relatable to the interviewer with a response such as, “I sometimes over-analyze my work products which can cause me to fall behind in other tasks.”

, Don’t overstate things or ramble. The interviewer is looking for something very specific in this question.

, You’ve clearly identified your weakness, stated it concisely and shown that you have good awareness of your personal issues. You can now show them what you are doing to work on this problem.


“I sometimes over-analyze my work products which can cause me to fall behind in other tasks. To avoid that, I set aside a specific amount of time for review. When that time is up, I move to the next task on my list of priorities.” You've now proven that you can not only identify your weaknesses, but develop useful methods to overcome them.

, After you answer the question, stop talking. Wait for the interviewer to speak next. You’re done. You’ve given them what they asked for, so wait for a response. You might have to wait an uncomfortable amount of time.


The interviewer might very well insert (on purpose) a lengthy pause to see what you’ll do. Look them in the eye with a comfortable expression on your face and wait for them to give you feedback.

, You should have three weaknesses and compensatory techniques at your fingertips. The interviewer is quite likely to ask you the same question a second time and often a third time.


If you get asked a fourth time, there’s a good way to handle that. “When I do this exercise, maybe once a quarter or so, the list might change from time to time. I limit my focus to three current weaknesses so I don’t become overwhelmed. If you ask me again in June, I might have a different answer for you then.”


, Employers generally like people who take initiative. For one, they don't have to babysit you while you sit back and wait for tasks to be given to you. Second, it means that you're constantly thinking about how you can add value to the company. Here's how you might approach this weakness.


""I don't take initiative as much as I'd like. My last job was one in which following orders was very important, and one in which improvising was frowned upon. I realized that I gradually shied away from doing things independently for fear of upsetting my boss or undercutting company policy. Moving forward, I realize that most positions, and especially this one, value a degree of initiative. I try to be absolutely clear about the expectations of the project before I start working so that I can attack different angles or follow different leads while still staying on track.""

, Managing your time is crucial to employers. They're looking for someone who can ideally do the most amount of work in the least amount of time. You really want to hit this answer out of the park if you choose it. At the same time, a lot of people are bad time-managers, so don't expect to tell the interviewer anything s/he hasn't heard before.


""I don't always manage my time effectively. To tell you the truth, sometimes I get sucked down a rabbit hole and neglect to balance all the other responsibilities of my job. I'm compulsive about getting things right the first time, sometimes at the expense of other tasks. This causes me to fall behind on projects periodically. Moving forward, I'm learning how to get better at tying one project up when it looks like I'll fall behind on another, without using shortcuts or mailing in it. I'm planning ahead, asking appropriate channels for help when necessary, and finding more efficient, equally effective ways, of getting the job done.""

, This weakness is the polar opposite of weakness #1, failing to take initiative. Employers might be nervous about you stepping on your bosses toes. Instead, assure them that you understand what you are doing and are learning to be a role-player when needed:


""I take on a leadership role when it's not designated to me. Sometimes, this caused tension between me and the project lead, who understandably is trying to do her job. I'm learning how to trust people with their own responsibilities, and not smothering a project because of my own ego. I realize that letting people do their designated job makes a team a lot more successful in the long run, even if the team drops the ball in the short term. I'm focused on becoming a better team player by letting everyone do his or her own job, and helping when necessary.""

, Certainly, this isn't a weakness that you can profitably use if you're introverted, laconic, and shy. In other words, make sure you are who you say you are. Employers will want someone who is focused on work, not on telling jokes or learning about each and every coworker's weekend. Reassure them you're prioritizing the right kind of communication:


""I talk too much. I'm a very extroverted, sociable person, which means that I have a weakness for not-always-workplace-related interactions. I'm getting better at channeling that extroversion into the right kind of communication. I'm leaving weekend updates for happy hour, and learning how to listen first and speak second, instead of the other way around. I know that I can sometimes drown other voices out, so I'm proactively asking colleagues to cut me off if I go off-topic or start dominating the conversation.""

, This one is kind of a ""spin"" response, because for most positions, you're not going to be expected to speak in front of large audiences. But this response could actually be a sympathetic weakness: some people have a soft spot for verbal fumblers. Again, focus on drawing out some positive aspect of your phobia if you plan on using this weakness.


I'm not great at public speaking. I ham up in front of groups that are larger than a dozen people. I start sweating, fumble my words, and can't seem to communicate the ideas I'm actively thinking about. Public speaking to me is less a phobia and more of an anxiety about how people will judge my speaking ability. I understand that being in a group setting is an integral part of this position, and although I'm not perfect at it yet, I feel like I'm improving. I joined a hobbyist's debate club to improve my exposure to larger crowds. I'm forcing myself to speak up in smaller groups, focusing less on my ego and whether I ""did well,"" and more on what I communicated and I how I communicated it.""

, Certain professions, such as accountant or office assistant, really depend on consistent organization. If you're interviewing for such a position, think twice about giving this response. On the other hand, many professions, especially ""ideas"" professions, don't rely on expert organization to get the job done.


""I'm not as organized as I could be. I didn't used to keep organizers, or write down dates, because I was lazy about it. In college, I got by because I could keep my schedule in my head, and I could afford to be wrong once or twice along the way. Moving forward, I know that simple disorganization can produce errors or miscommunications that are unacceptable. I've taken to writing down every contact, meeting, and project goal in an online itinerary and syncing it in the cloud that I can have access from theoretically any computer. I've gotten a lot more scrupulous about organizing the things that make my job possible and filing away the ones that don't.""

Define your corporate goal.,
Ask veteran employees about their experiences.,
Remain motivated in your position.,
Understand the company structure.",How to Work Your Way up a Company1," Your ultimate goal may be to hold a top leadership position in a company or to manage a large department. Be specific about your career goals. Write your goals down and keep them in your desk so that you can remind yourself to stay motivated.;
, Ask them to explain to you how they worked their way up the corporate ladder. Their advancement paths and strategies might resonate with you and give you inspiration. However, remember that each person's path to success is unique.


Approach your co-worker when they have free time. Tell them that you admire their work, and that you hope to increase your value to the company. Ask them: ""How do you recommend pursuing a promotion here?"" or ""How did you work your way to your current position?"". You could even praise them for a specific task that they recently completed, and ask them how they went about accomplishing it.

, Understanding your role's value to the overall process and to the company will allow you to demonstrate the proper commitment. Maintain a positive attitude; you never know who is paying attention.

, There may be multiple departments with various levels of management within each. Familiarize yourself with the company structure by studying its organizational chart and learning the important players in management."
"
Demonstrate your commitment.,
Network with co-workers.,
Attend company-wide social functions.,
Take on additional responsibilities.",How to Work Your Way up a Company2," Show the higher-ups that your goals align with the goals of the company. Stuffing envelopes or filing paperwork may seem below your skill level, but remind yourself that your work is important and may lead to company sales. Bringing an executive their morning coffee may seem far removed from your goal of being an executive, but it will allow you to build interpersonal relationships and will help the executive to better perform daily tasks.

, Build positive relationships with people at all levels of the company. One of your co-workers may become your boss some day. A colleague with whom you have a personality clash may wind up in a position to chime in about your suitability for a promotion. Treat everyone with respect and fairness, and they will be likely to pay you respect in return.Show your appreciation for others. Acknowledge the contributions of colleagues who help you solve difficult problems. When leading others, let them know that you appreciate their individual strengths.
Greet people warmly. Whether in an elevator with a top executive or standing in the company cafeteria line with an employee from another department, take the opportunity to introduce yourself and strike up conversation.

, It might be tempting to skip the company's holiday event, but attending such social gatherings will allow you to interact with a wide variety of company employees. It will also increase your visibility and your chances of being viewed as an integral member of the company.

, Lighten your boss' workload by offering to oversee a small project. Stay late to master new software, make sales calls, or organize paperwork. Make sure that the additional tasks that you pursue contribute to greater productivity without jeopardizing your relationships with colleagues.Avoid stepping on other people's toes or crossing boundaries. Your goal is not to outdo your supervisor or to highlight the inadequacy of your colleagues, but rather to offer vital support.

Enroll in classes to strengthen skills.,
Take courses offered by the company.,
Learn a new language.",How to Work Your Way up a Company3," Learn the information and skills that you need to progress to the next level in the company. If your goal is to work your way up from administrative assistant to project coordinator to project manager to department director, always prepare for the next job in the sequence of promotions.Look for courses offered online, or skim your local newspaper for opportunities. Community college courses can also be a helpful and affordable option. Ask your co-workers or your boss if they have any recommendations for you.

, Some companies offer training and development programs to help employees gain new skills. When given a choice, use these opportunities wisely by choosing classes that will prepare you for a future role. Your boss will be impressed that you are working to better yourself in order to become more of an asset to the company.

, Many companies will be more apt to promote someone who is knowledgeable in more than one language, since it gives them an edge over their competition and helps them to get their message across to a larger audience of consumers.Find out whether your company has an office or market in a foreign country. You will have a better chance at career advancement if you learn the language in that particular country. If your company has an office in Berlin, for instance, it could help you to learn German. Or if your company does business in Madrid, you may want to become fluent in Spanish.

"
"
Apply to relevant job openings.,
Ask for a promotion.,
Be patient.",How to Work Your Way up a Company4," Many companies tend to promote from within, since they value employees who wish to stay with their company for a long time. Ask your employer if there is an internal job postings site, as some opportunities might be shared within the company before they decide to outsource or open the role to new hires.


Be sure that you possess the right qualifications and experience for any position to which you apply. Be realistic about your capabilities, and make logical progressions.

, If you have been working hard in your position for over a year, and feel that you are qualified for a higher position, it cannot hurt to inquire about opportunity for promotion. Apply for the job before approaching your boss. Be honest about your goals, and about why you think you would be a good fit for the new role.Discussing a salary raise or the terms of your employment with your boss can be intimidating. Describe how you have positively contributed to the company thus far, and how you hope to assist the company in achieving its goals going forward. Create a presentation highlighting your skills and your job performance. Say, ""I am the best candidate for the role because..."" and then list your assets.Have confidence in yourself, and remain open to the possibility that your boss may not be quite ready to promote you. Do not give up; instead, use this as motivation to work even harder so that your employer will realize your full potential.

, Plan to stay in each position for a reasonable amount of time. Although the right amount of time is largely dependent on the needs of the particular company, staying in a position for at least 1 year is a common expectation.It often takes that long to master the responsibilities, to contribute value to your company, and to train others before being promoted.

Assess everything that needs to be done.,
Make an outline.,
Learn to say no.,
Limit your goals.","How to Work Smart, Not Hard1"," Before you plunge into something headfirst, remember that enthusiasm needs to be tempered with wisdom. Look over every aspect of the job, and allow yourself ample ""pondering time"" so that you can be sure that every detail is accomplished on time and accurately.;
, Whether it's in your head or on paper, you should have a checklist in mind and follow it in order. You don't want to repeat steps, duplicate the efforts of others, make mistakes or forget anything.

, Avoid over-scheduling yourself and be realistic about what you can accomplish in a single day. Sometimes you just have to cut yourself off because in most professions, there is almost always something that could be done.

, Try to avoid multi-tasking because you often get less done since your brain is switching back and forth between tasks. Pick one thing to work on and put your best effort into that until it is accomplished. Set a time limit for when you stop working on the task at hand and take a rest.

Control clients by communicating properly.,
Never accept a bad job.,
Re-bid if necessary.","How to Work Smart, Not Hard2"," Make sure your clients will understand what the normal turnaround time will be for a project. Do not be influenced by their insistence that their job requires a big rush. Most businesses have more than one client, yet many clients forget that their job is not the only one you're working on.



Give one to three choices - never more. Handing a swatch book to a client and saying, ""Tell me which colors you are interested in"" is deadly. Too many choices will cause horrible delays as the customer peruses ALL possibilities and later tends to second-guess every decision. Instead, say things like, ""Do you like this blue or this green better?""

, You know when a job is going to be great. A client or boss who pressures you into areas where you are not comfortable, either because it is an unreasonable expectation or because it's outside your scope, needs to be made immediately aware of your discomfort with the job as proposed. If you are self-employed, declining a job like this is much smarter even though it's hard to let money go.

, Don't accept so many changes that you end up doing a much more complicated or expensive job than you bid for. When you realize you're into new territory, stop work and draw up a re-bid, showing the entire job as originally envisioned and overlay the scope of the new work. Let the client know it will cost $x more than the original bid to proceed. It's the client's decision how much to pay. How smart you want to be while you're working for them is your decision.

Consider your materials.,
Evaluate your methods.,
Look for shortcuts.,
Delegate to the right people at the right times.,
Avoid procrastination.,
Be flexible.","How to Work Smart, Not Hard3"," Don't take shortcuts on the quality of your materials. Cheap materials or tools are harder to work with because they aren't as sturdy or nice. Trying to save a few bucks, but spending an extra hour or two because those cheap things didn't install properly doesn't make any sense.

, You want them to be as efficient as possible. Do your work when you have no distractions surrounding you. Try to do things in one batches rather than one at a time. You want your efficiency to be maximized as much as possible.

, This does NOT mean taking the easiest method for the sake of it or being lazy. For example, if you respond to numerous e-mails per day and answer the same questions again and again, save your responses. When those questions come up, you can cut and paste your canned response. You might have to make minor edits, but the bulk of it will already be written.

, Make sure your team is well-ordered. If one person is faster, put him or her on the part of your task that will take longest. If one person is more skilled and accurate, put him or her on the part of the task that is most critical.

, Every time you surf the net or needlessly check e-mail at work, your day becomes longer. Push yourself hard to do work when it's time to do work and enjoy these activities once you're done for the day.

, Your day will not always go as planned. Be open to trying new methods and doing new things.

Rest.,
Periodic breaks.,
Recognize the point of 'diminishing returns.'","How to Work Smart, Not Hard4"," You should ideally be getting eight hours of sleep every night. You can certainly pull continuous 12 hour days at work, but it's not sustainable. After a certain point, your body becomes tired and your mind wears down, leading to more frequent lapses in concentration and careless mistakes.

, Even at the office, you need to allow time for your mind to regroup and recharge. Push yourself hard for the first 50 minutes of every hour and then reward yourself with a 10 minute break.

, The above steps do not imply that you should work yourself to the point of exhaustion. You need to protect your health and the integrity of your job. Working yourself to a frazzle constantly makes you prone to mistakes. When you're so tired that you realize it's taking you twice or three times longer to do a job than normal, you need to call it a day. Rest at least a few hours and come back fresher, so that you can be strong at the end of the job. Learn how to power nap.

Remove the clutter to extinguish the “white noise.” One reason your cube may be sending harsh vibes your way is because you're trying to work with numerous papers, staplers and office supplies (not to mention your lunch) splattered all over the space that is there.,
Organize work into specific piles.,
Subscribe to the clean desk policy.,
Adjust the lighting.,
Create a restful ambiance by adding low wattage bulbs to your desk experience via the addition of a small lamp or two.,
If you'd like more natural light coming to your desk space, talk to your supervisor.,

Have a colorful candy dish somewhere permanent in your cubicle.,
Use humor to improve your cubicle life.,
Cope with ""hot desking"".",How to Turn Your Office Cubicle Into Your Personal Sanctuary," Clear the clutter and you may begin to find peace.;
, Not only will you start feeling more Zen, you will also most likely work at a more efficient level if your work isn’t strewn across your desk. Begin by creating small piles of work––items you're currently working on, items you've completed and items that should be archived. Create a pile for non-work related paperwork or items on the floor in your space to eliminate them from the work area.


Add an organizational system to your desktop. Purchase on your own or talk to your purchasing manager about getting an organizational system for your cube. Whether it’s file cabinets or an in/out box, address the amount of paperwork and other items housed in your cube in order to find each pile a specific home. Also, any extraneous items that detract from your work focus should be either brought home or placed in an area away from your immediate work space. Not only will doing so reduce clutter but it'll also help free yourself from the panic brought on by looking for lost information.

, The IBM Corporation has a clean desk policy where employees must clear and secure all paperwork and items by the end of the day. Whether your company mandates this type of policy or not, subscribe to having a clean desk by the time you leave work, so that when you arrive in the morning the tone is set for a peaceful day (what happens after you arrive, however, is anyone’s guess).

, Lighting can have a serious impact on overall mood. Harsh fluorescent lights may be “shining” down on you, but you don’t have to live completely with the imposed stark environment. To improve the lighting as best you can, here are some suggestions:

, Purchase a small lamp that is compatible with a low wattage bulb like a 40 watt. Place the lamp near your computer or workspace to create a softer flood of light. Angle it to fall where it lights your work but does not bother your eyes. After you've added a lamp, you'll wonder how you managed before––this personal light source will improve your sense of the lighting considerably and you may not even notice the fluorescent lights anymore.


It is not unknown for some workers to dress their cubicle with little fairy lights on a cord. These are for effect rather than useful light but they can look very effective, especially during the darker months.
Add a small real or fake fish tank with light. If you have room, a small fish tank or even a lava lamp can create a groovy, peaceful environment. Choose a warm colored light such as orange or red to bathe the area in soft, mood soothing lighting. Just be cautious in a conservative workplace though––lava lamps might not be viewed as compatible with taking the work seriously.

, It may be as simple as changing the angle of your cubicle, or it may be as complicated as shifting you somewhere else. But raising it is important if it matters to you––stewing about your sallow complexion and miserable positioning won't change anything. Ask nicely and you might receive.

, After you’ve cleared your space, consider re-populating it with a few choice, meaningful pieces from home. Make sure you have room for a few items and that any picture frames or toys from home won’t add more clutter to your space. When dressing up your cubicle sanctuary, remember that less is always more but a homely touch will increase your sense of belonging. Here are some sanctuary-inducing additions to your space:


Family and pet photos. One of the best ways to add warmth and personality to your cube is to place a few family and pet photos in your area. Consider adding your favorite photo next to your computer or workstation and then a few smaller framed photos on shelves. It'll cheer you to see these faces regularly and family members and pets always make great talking points with coworkers.

, If you have room, a nice green plant can remove the sterility from a cubicle environment. Select a plant that requires very little maintenance or go for a realistic silk plant. You'll also need a mist spray bottle for regular watering.

, Is the office chair uncomfortable or perhaps it feels cold in the morning? Add a small throw blanket or pillow from home to make your space more inviting. Choose a color that makes you feel peaceful or energized.

, Images of your favorite vacation spots, outdoor areas and beautiful scenes can brighten up a cubicle space and remind you to plan that next vacation!


Inspirational or motivational posters can create a sense of harmony too. Find a phrase or an image with a quote that brightens your day and let everyone else enjoy it too by pinning it up. A nice phrase is one from Dr. Jill Bolt Taylor that requests: ""Please take responsibility for the energy you bring into this place."" And, of course, you can't go past the perennial phrase ""Think Outside the Box.""

, Since you're working in a cube, be conscious that others can hear any sounds coming from your area and they deserve their own cube sanctuary too. Before you add anything that makes sound, check with your neighbors and the boss to ensure you have the “go ahead” to proceed. Here are some additions that might work for you:


Small fountain. Home decor stores sell small water fountains that can be placed on a shelf, providing the restful sounds of running water. Fountains range in size, with the smallest being able to fit in the palm of your hand, making it very unobtrusive.
Sounds of the ocean or other natural sounds. Numerous New Age or nature sounds CDs can be purchased to conjure up the sounds of the ocean, running water, birdsong or children at play. You could play the CD during stressful times during the day or while you are taking your break and need to relax. Bring along headphones if playing the sounds on low still irritates your neighboring coworkers.
Small rotating fan. Talkative neighbors or loud noises around your cube? Don’t let exterior noises add stress to your day––consider adding a rotating fan that provides white noise and a little extra air. However, if you plan to include a fan, point it toward the wall of your cube so it doesn’t blow papers across the room.

, Not every workplace will allow this suggestion, so it's for the more enlightened or creative place (in which case, you might have an open-space desk rather than a cubicle) but if you can, the addition of some fish in a tank can help improve your mood and create a sense of a sanctuary. However, this is not for the person who doesn't want responsibilities––you'll need to feed the fish daily (and rig up something for the weekends) and clean the tank or bowl weekly, as well as make arrangements for when you're away (are your coworkers up to it?). If you can't have fish, then try sneaking your cat in to work now and then!


Images of animals can help turn a cold cubicle into a sanctuary. Use images from your own photo collection, from old calendars (or hang a current calendar up with animal photos), and from print-offs from the internet.

, Spare the planet's resources and bring your own mug and bowls for constant reuse rather than using the Styrofoam disposables in the office. These will definitely add to the homely feel, they're a much nicer tactile experience and everyone will recognize your mug and bowl over the office eclectic mix in the kitchen cupboard.

, Bring along a tray, add a coffee pot or teapot to it, your favorite beverage in a tin or jar, your favorite cookies and any other treats. Make it so that it can be moved as one to make way for workspace and then simply transported back to where you're sitting to enjoy the drink and nibble, any time you take a break.


Some people join forces and create small tea or coffee drinking ceremonial spots somewhere central to their cubes or within a cubicle space where they open out onto one another. This can improve coworker bonding and if you love collectibles, can be a place to display teapots, samovars, coffee pots and accompanying spoons, cups, etc.

, Always keep it filled with your favorite treats, either for yourself or for you and everyone else too. If you're on a diet, switch it to carrot sticks and goji berries, or whatever else works for you!

, Having funny things on the cubicle walls can provide good relief from shuffling around in a little box all day long. Also, humor will be welcomed by your coworkers if it's displayed where they can read it too. Ideas include funny posters, cartoon strips, a joke-a-day or a joke-a-week, funny images (for example, LOL cats) and so on. Just make sure it's acceptable humor and doesn't demean anyone or any group of people.


Changing the humorous items regularly will keep them fresh and will have your coworkers flocking to your cube all the time to ""check out the latest"", creating a convivial atmosphere around your spot.
If you have any funny comic strips that you enjoy, print them out and pin them up on your pinboard or walls of your cubicle. (Make sure they're professional.)
Put googly eyes or stickers on things - staplers, tape rollers, even your monitor. They'll give you and your co-workers a chuckle even on the glummest of days.

, Hot desking is when you are given a desk a day, in anyone's cubicle. It's a lot harder to make this feel like a personal sanctuary because you're constantly being moved on. However, it is possible if you make yourself a carry-pack of sanctuary goodies. To a small bag or carry-box, add a photo or two in a standalone frame, your favorite teabags, a spray scent (if permissible––some people object to such odors), a battery tea light candle, headphones for your MP3 player and a small figurine or flower in a vase. Each morning you set up, quickly arrange these goodies out of their little bag or box and create your instant ""my space."" Perfect the art of whipping this up and packing it down in two minutes flat.

Meditate on this: How many people say on their deathbed, “I wish I'd spent more time in the office.” Make it a habit to periodically ask yourself, throughout the day, ""If I died in my sleep tonight, would I be happy with the way I spent my day?""",How to Stop Being a Workaholic," Unless you are truly convinced in your heart that there are some other things more valuable than work, it is unlikely the other steps will be effective. You won't be able to say “No” to overtime unless you are sincerely saying “Yes” to something you truly desire. Ask yourself if you value any of the following enough to give them higher priority than your work:



Your family. Is your work so important that you would rather risk a divorce and wreck your relationship with your children rather than cut back on your work?

Your health. Are you willing to get a stress-related disease and possibly die before retirement because your work is so important?

Enjoyment and peace of mind. Workaholics often claim they work so much because they enjoy their work. But if you focus on only one type of enjoyment, you are likely to miss out on the happiness and peace of mind that come with a more balanced lifestyle, with time to nurture meaningful relationships and savor simple pleasures.

Money. What's the point of having so much wealth if you don't have time to enjoy it? If you are doing it for the sake of those you love, remember that the gift of time is worth more than the gift of money.
Once you have a firm determination to tackle your work addiction, the following steps can help:;
, Cut back on work which gives relatively little benefit for the time invested. For any item of work you take on, ask yourself: “How many people will get a significant benefit from this? How many people are eagerly waiting for me to finish this?” If the answer is, “Hardly anyone” think twice or three times about whether you should really do it, or continue with it.

, Finish one item of work before starting another one. Don't feel that you have to finish every item of work that you have started. Just because you've already wasted a lot of time on a piece of work, it doesn't mean you have to waste more. Don't throw good time after bad.


If you have trouble turning down assignments, you may benefit from reading How to Stop Being a People Pleaser and How to Break the ""Nice Guy"" Stereotype.

, Set aside one day of the week, such as Sunday, as a day of rest. Be strict with yourself in not working on that day. If the computer is your main work tool, try not to use the computer at all on your rest day. Set office hours for yourself, outside of which you don't allow yourself to work. For example, no work before 8 a.m. or after 7 p.m.

, If other people set deadlines for you, so be it. But try not to set deadlines for yourself. Don't do today what you can reasonably put off until tomorrow.

, Don't always aim for super high quality work when it isn't necessary to achieve the purpose of the work. As Chesterton said, “If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.” Especially if that frees up time to do something else even more worthwhile. See How to Control Perfectionism.

, If you can be highly productive in a relatively short time, you can use your achievement to calm your workaholic conscience and allow yourself to relax outside your set work time. If you stop being a workaholic, it doesn't mean you can't work hard, work efficiently, and aim for excellent quality. But you set sensible limits on your work so that it doesn't eat up the rest of your life. See How to Work Smart, Not Hard.

, As somber as it may sound, looking at your life from the perspective of your deathbed can jolt your priorities into place.

Sell the fruits of your labor.,
Learn to manage your money.,
Do things that cost nothing or very little.,
Remind yourself when it feels tough that it's not all about work.",How to Survive at Your Dream Job Without Starving," Were those sparkly stilettos or that plasma TV really worth the number of hours you had to spend in a cubicle, or getting yelled at by your boss, or dealing with impossible clients, in order to pay for that purchase? What in your spending diary would you happily give up if it meant spending 8 hours a day doing something you actually enjoy doing? For example, you might not splurge on take-out and beer four times a week if you weren't so depressed and/or frustrated about your job.;
, If you can't find the motivation to pursue your passion part-time, you'll never be able to push yourself and make it work full-time. Prove to yourself that this is really what you want to do, and test the waters without quitting your day job. Whether it means volunteering, getting a part-time job, taking an art course, or just locking yourself in your room with a guitar, a pencil, and a piece of paper, get down to business.


Take the leap once you're more confident about the likelihood of success. When the income you're bringing in from your passionate endeavors can reliably cover your living expenses, make the switch. Write that glorious resignation letter and become one of those people who wakes up and actually looks forward to going to work!

, Show people your work. Talk about it every chance you get. Ask for feedback. Start a website. Use social networking to promote what you do. Most importantly, learn not to take criticism personally. When you're passionate about something and others aren't so enthused, it's easy to feel like they've just told you your child is ugly. Remember that if you want to do what you love for a living, you have to offer the world something they want. That's the deal. Keep up your end of the bargain.


Have courage. Doing what you love is often a balance between producing what you know your clients want and being bold. With focus and determination, you can take some risks in trying out new ideas and approaches that are untested––just be sure to keep the things that you know do work running as well.

, While you may have hated math in high school, tracking the flow of cash through your life might be the only way you can avoid selling your soul at a job you hate. Learn the difference between what you need (a roof over your head and the lights on) over what you want (this season's fashion trends) and apply this to all spending decisions. And while treats are not out of the question, they are not a regular indulgence when you're sticking to a budget (but that only makes them all the more special when you do treat yourself).


Draw up a weekly budget. Stay within the limits you've set yourself, as well as setting aside an amount for saving each week.
Keep a spending diary––record each and every one of your purchases in a single notebook. You might be surprised at some of the frivolous purchases or at discovering where you could be cutting costs.
Build your emergency fund. This is for unexpected things that happen in life, like the car ceasing to work or your computer dying. This must be earmarked for a specific purpose and cannot be dipped into for indulgences. It's a safety net both in reality and psychologically, that lets you have more wiggle room with your low pay.

, In terms of your time off your passion, avoid activities that suck up money. There are plenty of free or cheap ways to enjoy yourself in your downtime and in many cases, these will probably enhance your creativity and enthusiasm for what you're doing. Make a list of the things you love to do that don't cost much, such as hiking, visiting the park, going to galleries, checking out the museums in your area, people-watching, having a long, slow coffee in a vibrant coffeehouse, reading books that take you out of your comfort zone, sitting on the beach, etc. And if you love to shop, try to shop as a way of gaining ideas rather than goods; turn yearning into learning by soaking up ideas for your next project from shop window inspirations, watching people's approaches to shopping to inspire your next novel or finding fascinating objects to snap for your photo collection.

, There will be times when you feel some annoyance or disappointment that you can't have what some people do or that your status doesn't seem as ""important"" as someone with a high level title––it's only natural. And when this does happen, apart from not comparing yourself to others, look for all the good you have in your life as a result of your choice. Think of the non-monetary gains such as time, living up to your principles, having fun and giving the world your authentic self. If you're good at what you're doing, proud of it and enjoying it, you're living the way many people more cashed-up than you can only dream of.


Dreams matter but always be conscious that the dream must be broken into manageable actions that cross into reality and get achieved. Use the ""dream"" part of your dream job to stay enthused and motivated; the ""job"" part is all about the doing.
Have a purpose larger than yourself. If you aim to make a meaningful contribution to the world and stay focused on helping others through your talents, whatever they may be, you'll make a positive dent on the universe. To do this, develop a vision that is something others can understand and that causes you to inspire others when you discuss it. The vision will help you through the leanest of times, as well as convincing others of the worthiness of what you're doing.

Listen quietly instead of loudly. It's a common misconception that blasting music loud will help keep you awake. Actually, turning the music down to a very low level is more effective. It forces you to try to listen closely in order to hear the instruments, lyrics, and percussion. If you're having difficulty discerning the lyrics, then the volume is just right, because this means your mind's working.;
, Getting interested can work as a distraction. If you are interested in something, your brain is focusing.You can get interested in your work or something that is happening in your surroundings.

, Preferably, natural daylight. Your body's internal clock (its circadian rhythms) are regulated by your exposure to sunlight. This means you can trick your body into believing it should be awake even when it feels tired.


Step outside, even just for a bit. If you can step outside (even on a cloudy day) or look out the window for a full minute, you'll be more alert.
Work the artificial lights. Even if you're in an environment where there's artificial light, brighter is better. Wherever you work, see if you can replace the light fixture or add a lamp that will brighten your workspace.

, If you chew ice, it's almost impossible to fall asleep. The chilling temperature keeps the brain on its toes, even while you are driving late at night, exhausted, and what you really want to do is fall asleep.


Chewing anything, even if it's just your pen or pencil, causes your body to think you are about to eat. Your body will prepare for food intake by releasing insulin, which will make you more alert.

, If it's a little cold, take off your sweater or jacket so you stay on the chilly side. Open a window or put on a small fan, pointed at your face.


The reason your body responds the way it does to cold is that it's prepping itself to work to keep you warm. Your body needs to regulate your internal temperature to keep all of its organs functioning. So if it detects ice or extreme cold, it will work to keep itself awake longer.

, A pungent scent — good or bad — can make you more alert very quickly. Aromatherapists often recommend essential oils of the following plants to stimulate the nervous system and reduce fatigue. Open the bottle and take a big whiff of the following when you're feeling drowsy:


Eucalyptus blue gum
Peppermint
Coffee; beans or brewed, both work: a study has shown that simply smelling coffee can awaken a person.Of course, not all of us have essential oils stored in our file cabinets. Using hand lotions or burning candles with these same scents could help. Herbs like rosemary and peppermint can often be found fresh or dried at a grocery store; for a little pick-me-up, take a pinch and roll it between your fingertips and smell it.

, Eating can help you stay awake, as long as you avoid a full stomach. As most of us know, eating to excess often makes us sleepy, so don't eat a full pizza or that 12 oz. steak during lunch.


Munch on snacks all day rather than having a big meal. The key is to not get a spike of sugar intake (followed by the inevitable crash). Predictably, the same goes for caffeine: break your coffee, soda, or energy drink consumption down into small doses.
Avoid breakfast that are high in carbs (muffins, toast, pastries, bagels, etc.). You're giving your body a reason to crash at about 11 AM because it gets a sugar spike early on.
Put a small handful of sunflower seeds in your cheek and crack them open one at a time, using only your teeth and tongue; this will require just enough active thought and tongue movement to prevent you from dozing off, and the salt of the sunflower seeds is invigorating and stimulating; spit out the sunflower husks into a paper cup as you go, as quietly as possible so as to not disturb others around you.

, The internet is full of interesting websites where you can choose from a variety of games to play online. Pick a word game, or a puzzle, a car racing game or anything that suits your liking. Spending just about 15-20 minutes playing a game will awaken your mind because it is not taxing or boring in any way. It's more fun if you pick a game you're good at.

, Stretching and twisting your body can help improve blood circulation, which helps keep you awake. Rolling your head/neck for about 20 seconds can help as well.

, Massaging any of the following points will improve circulation and ease fatigue:


The top of your head. Lightly tap it with your fingertip or use a scalp massager.
The back of your neck.
Back of your hands. Right between the thumb and index finger is best.
Just below the knees.
Earlobes.

, Just because you're sitting down doesn't mean you can't use your muscles. So exercise at your computer, or get up every once in a while and stimulate some blood flow to keep you alert.


Try simple exercises like jumping jacks, push-ups, crunches, and squats. Don't push yourself like you do in the gym; instead, just exercise enough to get your blood flowing and keep your coworkers from noticing your strange behavior!
Stay on your feet as much as possible. If you're sitting most of the time, get yourself up every 20-30 minutes. If you need any motivation to stand more of the time, consider this: people who stay seated for less than three hours a day add almost two years to their life expectancy.If you have to sit down, get the most uncomfortable chair you can find. Try not to sit in anything that will make you sore if you stay there. Make sure the back is upright, forcing you to sit up very straight. Don't allow your head to rest on anything — your hands, the desk, the wall.

, Some people take a short walk to re-energize themselves. It's generally thought to be a good distraction, especially if you're sitting in front of a computer screen all day long.


Any paperwork that may be pending which you have to carry to your colleagues or a manager (like signing a cheque or documents), keep aside. When you feel sleepy, take it to the person for signing (or any other action). Upon returning to your desk, you'll feel more awake again and you'll have been active.
Studies show that taking short breaks from work actually helps your productivity.So if you're worried about missing that deadline, don't stress! Walking breaks will help you. (You can let your boss know.)

, If you have the time, sleeping for just 15-20 minutes can increase your alertness by leaps and bounds if you have a cup of coffee (or any other form of caffeine) right before you fall asleep. The caffeine will take about 20 minutes to begin working, so you shouldn't have any trouble falling asleep right away, and you'll wake up refreshed.


Sleeping just 20 minutes helps activate the right hemisphere of the brain, which is responsible for processing and storing acquired information.

, Brains benefit greatly from schedules. If you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even the weekends, your brain know when it's time to sleep and fall into a pattern. Getting proper nutrition will also ensure that your body has the proper energy throughout the day without having to resort to naps for extra strength.


How much should you sleep to ensure that you're properly rested? Adults need anywhere from 7-9 hours of sleep per night.If you are pregnant or older, you may need even more sleep, anywhere from 10-11 hours.
Some recommendgoing to sleep with your curtains halfway open. The early morning sunlight will send signals to your body to slow production of melatonin and start production of adrenaline, making it easier to wake up.

, It sounds hard, but don't let your mind go into the ""fuzzy stage."" When your mind starts to go blank, think about something, whether it's a joke, a movie, or anything else to keep your mind working. Even thinking about something that makes you mad can be extremely helpful. Unless they're drinking, you typically don't see an angry person abruptly fall asleep.

, Make a call to a friend or a cousin or anyone who makes you laugh. A light conversation will definitely refresh your mind and you will be ready to start working before you know. Take a stroll while talking on the phone. It will keep you active. People tend to converse more animatedly when they walk and talk.

Accept your bad mood.,
Tell others.,
Look inside first.,
Remember the good stuff.,
Let it pass.. You’ve been in a bad mood before.,
Take some quiet time.,
Start your day over.,
Leverage Your Next Good Mood.",How to Turn Around a Bad Day at Work," Being in a bad mood is not that bad! Trying to force yourself to cheer up is much, much worse. Fighting bad moods only prolongs them, so if you’re mad or sad, be mad or sad. This does not allow rudeness and unpleasantness to innocents, it just means you need to recognize and accept your mood in order to be able to do something about it.;
, Others will notice if you try keeping your bad mood secret with a happy mask and will wonder if they ticked you off. Tell them you are not having a good day. Simply say, ""Listen, I’m in a really sour mood today. I’m not sure why, but it’s nothing you've done. If I do bite your head off, I'm apologizing in advance.""

, Successful people aren't always the smartest, but have acquired emotional skills, and rely on being able to recognize and to deal with one's own emotions. We tend to think that a bad mood is always caused by something or someone else (like trying to deal with a difficult boss). Bad moods aren't always connected to obvious, external factors. Perhaps you just slept poorly, are getting the flu, or are just having a bad day. Don't try to justify a bad mood. Instead, try to look inside yourself first, in order to ascertain possible precursors to your emotional state.

, When you’re in a foul mood, everything is bad. But the good things you appreciated yesterday, when you weren't as annoyed, should be there - you just forgot them. Spend time considering at least one or two things that aren't all bad (something you look forward to, a person you like, something nice that happened recently) and be thankful for that.

, It passed, so will this. It’s no big deal. If you can't shake the mood, simply wait it out.

, To avoid doing or saying something you might regret, withdraw a little if you can. Walk during your lunch break, sit and work someplace quiet. Take a long bathroom break. Consider going home early, or taking the day off.

, Why wait until tomorrow to start your day over. Do it now. Leave your desk, or where ever - leave - decide to start over, as if you slept. Return to work with a fresh attitude. This really works, more so with practice.

, Once the bad mood wear off, and you feel better, figure out what helped: was it a thought? a song? a friend? an event? When the next ""red zone"" comes, you will have developed an array of techniques to pull yourself out.

Identify the ways in which you're covering up for your coworker.,
Consider how covering for the coworker interferes directly with your job and even your personal life.,
Acknowledge your stress and the impacts on the quality of your own work and home life.,
Consider talking frankly but politely to your coworker from this point on.,
Tell your coworker that you have something important to discuss with him or her and that you'd like his or her full attention.,
State that you can no longer cover for your coworkers inefficiency or ineptitude.,
Refuse to be your coworker’s cover in the future.,
Embrace some failure in this process because, in all likelihood, it's going to be an issue.,
If you have the time and expertise, offer to assist your lazy coworker with anything he or she seems particularly stuck on.,
Return to improving your own work performance and restoring organization to your life.",How to Stop Covering for a Lazy Coworker," There is a difference between being a supportive team member and enabling a team member's laziness. If you've become so deeply mired in always covering your lazy coworkers tracks, it might have been so ingrained, you're barely noticing what you're doing anymore. Here are some key signals that you're being too helpful in covering your lazy coworkers tracks:


You end up finishing projects he or she is responsible for because you don't want the team to look bad. Sure, he or she promised to get it done on time, but as the deadline loomed, it was patently obvious that this wasn't going to happen.
You're finishing projects because his or her performance impacts your own job. Your coworker is slacking off but his or her inability or refusal to do a good job has direct ramifications on your performance.
You're making excuses for when your coworker comes up short on a project or deadline. Rather than specifying the real reason as to why the deadline went whooshing by and the work remained incomplete (your coworker didn't provide what he or she promised), you fudge around the edges and blame it on everything from lack of printer ink to unverifiable information that has to be chased down from some archival vault halfway across town. This makes the entire team look bad, not just you.
You find you're constantly having to micromanage your coworker in order to get tasks accomplished. From keeping the coworker on schedule to sending reminders of an important meeting, you’ve become his or her assistant without applying for the job. And guess what? He or she is loving it.
You're lying to your boss about your coworker’s whereabouts every time he or she goes missing in action. Although it may not take a lot of time to make up a story about where Janet may be (you tell the boss she is in transit from one office to the other, but she’s really having a three martini lunch), this is a breach of trust and it's going to wear you down quickly. By lying to your boss you are just as culpable as your lazy coworker, and when the truths begin to surface (and they will), your lies may jeopardize your job.;
, Whether you're pulling double duty and doing his or her job and yours too, or you're having to make excuses or even lie on a daily basis, covering for a lazy coworker will take its toll. Some indicators of the toll covering up for a lazy coworker can have on you include:


Time with your family dwindles down to next-to-nothing because you're too busy working two shifts––yours and your coworkers. If you're working two jobs, you most likely have no time for family or a social life, or you're squeezing everything pretty hard.
You feel burned out and anxious. All work and no play creates an anxious individual. Plus, if you're lying for the coworker, guilt may be taking hold. Your health is starting to be impacted, with tension, stress and guilt mounting up.
Your own work performance has started to suffer. With one job, you likely have the time to brainstorm and think of creative ideas. However, when time is limited, you can only attend to the bare necessities.
Your boss has started to make negative comments about the quality of the work you're producing. Be wary when there are comments prefaced with ""You used to be more careful than this..."" or ""I'm really surprised that you didn't pick up on that/made that sort of mistake... it's not like you to be so careless"", and so forth. And you just know that your less-than-usually-stellar performance is all down to trying to juggle two workloads.

, Based on this honest assessment, make a decision to put a stop to the covering up and running around for the sake of your lazy coworker. It's time this person pulled his or her weight or found something else to waste time on. There are a few things to face before you move on to telling your coworker what's what from here on though. Consider the following:


Why are you covering up for this coworker? For some people it's all about perfectionism. It starts when said coworker turns in sub-standard work which you know you could churn out at much higher quality ""just like that"". And so, you do, instead of returning it to your coworker with a suggestion to redo it. The pattern is set and over time, the complexity increases and your lazy coworker has become ever more reliant on you fixing everything. Does this sound familiar? If so, you'll also need to tackle your perfectionism.
Another reason may be a lack of assertiveness, especially if you were new to the team when this started. Lazy coworker eyeballed you and spotted your for a hard worker, got the praise in and once you were buttered up, sent everything your way and you just couldn't say ""no"". Now that the always accepting your coworkers botched jobs has become routine, you've never learned to say no and it just keeps on getting worse. In this case, you'll need to focus on building your assertiveness skills.
One more difficult reason is fear. If your lazy coworker is a bully or has made threatening remarks about undermining you in front of the team or your boss, you may feel too afraid to say no to covering up for your lazy coworker. In this case, as hard as it is, you must find the courage to talk to either your boss or human resources to explain how you feel. If you are being intimidated or harassed, it's time the workplace took action to prevent this from continuing. Do not feel bad for your coworker––he or she should have known better.

, The next time your coworker comes to you with work half done or expecting you to make major fixes to vaguely thought through proposals, tap your hand on the chair next to you or wave him or her through to a private meeting room, and say very sweetly: ""Have a seat. We need to talk.""

, Don't waffle on about friendship or anything of that ilk, this is a professional talk and you need to get to the point as quickly as possible.


Explain how you feel personally impacted by having to finish his or her work or cover for him or her. Give a few facts that demonstrate concrete examples of such occasions so that your coworker doesn't think you're just generalizing.
Feel free to pepper some of this discussion with praise for the things you know that your coworker is good at and actually gets done. Indeed, use these occasions to prove to your coworker that you know he or she is capable and that it'd be great for the whole team if everyone got to see more of that capable side of your coworker.
Ask him or her if there are specific impediments to getting the work done well or in a timely fashion. Probe gently and let your coworker lead with information about any issues that might be hampering his or her ability to contribute more fully. Don't agree with his or her statements, simply acknowledge that the experiences must be hard for him or her.

You might like to suggest that both of you look into finding solutions that will help your coworker to be more productive, such as talking to the boss about doing a course, or sitting somewhere quieter, etc. However, don't too caught up in nannying their way out of it––there is a certain level of expectation that every employee is capable of asking for help with productivity issues.


If your coworker is glib and refuses to divulge anything that might be causing lackluster work efforts, avoid getting confrontational. Simply acknowledge his or her point of view but stick to your story of the impacts on you of the inadequate work performance. This allows you to continue on with finding solutions rather than focusing on the coworkers challenging attitude.
At all times during the discussion, relay your observations in a manner that is non-confrontational or non-aggressive. Don’t say, “You’ve made me lie to the boss” or “You made me finish the projects.” Instead, make it clear that you own your behavior in response to his or her laziness, remarking that you shouldn't have let things get to this state and that you've decided that it is no longer tenable.

, Avoid judging their behavior but instead, use the impacts on you to make it clear why it can't continue this way anymore. For example, you might say that because of ""X, Y, Z failing to materialize on time, I was not able to attend my grandmother's funeral and I am never going to let that happen to myself again."" Then proceed to discussing the way forward.


Avoid discussing any personal issues of the coworker, such as marital or child raising problems. Divorce the work performance from personal things.
State clearly that from today, you will no longer be covering for your coworkers efforts. This means that should he or she wish to slip out early today, your coworkers input will remain undone until your coworker returns the next morning to complete it.

, Now it’s up to you to stick to your guns. It may be difficult at first if this has become a bit of a habit between the two of you, but if you don’t follow through, the cycle will not stop and your coworker will keep pushing the same buttons.


Stop lying for your coworker when your boss asks you questions. However, instead of completely throwing him or her under the bus, consider acting as though you don’t know where your coworker is or how many clients he/she has seen during the day. Just say something like: ""Sorry boss, I know the report's due at 5 and it's already 3 but I really haven't a clue where she is right now. I saw her at 10am in the tearoom though, so I do know she came to work today.""
Don’t cover for him or her, even if it to do so would only take a few minutes. One small cover-up will lead to another, and then you are back to square one (remember how you got into this in the first place). Hold firm and stand your ground no matter what.

, This means allowing your coworker to fail––even if it impacts your job. The only way your boss will discover who the weak link is, is to expose him or her through work performance (or lack thereof). If you're part of a creative team and your lazy coworker is the one who is supposed to write the copy, but up until now you’ve been writing it so the projects are completed, allow the copy to be absent. When the client or your boss asks, make sure he or she knows who is responsible for copy writing.


If this seems too daunting to you, consider talking to your supervisor in confidence. Explain what has been happening, and how you have personally enabled some rather non-constructive behavior to grow within the team and that you're now putting a stop to it by making everyone own their piece of work. Your boss will be informed and may even be impressed at your honesty and willingness to take responsibility. Even if not, your integrity stays whole.

, Perhaps the laziness is just a cover for feeling inadequate, incompetent or overawed. By offering to help with learning new skills, you can acknowledge the value of this coworker without unearthing his or her insecurities and take hold of his or her willingness to learn and make something good come out of this.


Don't assume your coworker wants your help. Ask first.
Be open to offering tips as you feel they're needed. Don't overdo it though and be friendly, not bossy. And be conscious of your coworkers reactions––sometimes it will be more than apparent that you've offended rather than assisted––be ready to apologize for overstepping any mark.
Send links to helpful things on the intranet or internet that might open your coworkers understanding a little more––self-directed learning is often the most effective and doesn't smack of teaching the person how to crack eggs.
Don't play psychologist. Your lazy coworkers work inefficiencies or personal problems are not your personal challenges. Avoid falling into the role of playing agony aunt or unctuous uncle. You can help with anything work-skill related but you can't be his or doctor, so don't try.

, Whenever you feel tempted to cover for a coworker, remind yourself of where this leads and make strict boundaries for such situations. Obviously, covering for a coworker who is away sick for a week is a necessity but covering for an ongoing lazy coworker is never going to be part of your job description again.

Set your limit.,
Identify the essential.,
Eliminate the rest.,
Batch.,
Do it in stages.,
Decide what to do with excess time.,
Watch communication tasks.",How to Work Less1," Decide the maximum amount of time you are willing to work in a week. It is suggested to set something like 4 days a week. You might be ambitious and shoot for 3 days, or even less. Or you might go for 5 days a week, 6 hours each day instead of 8 hours. Whatever seems ideal to you, go for it!;
, If you have less time to do your work, how do you get that done? You have two choices: 1) work faster; or 2) do less work. It is recommended to take the second option. You need to determine what exactly you really need to accomplish within the limits you’ve set for yourself. If you cut your work week by 20%, for example, you need to cut out 20% of your work. That means identifying what must be done, and what can be put off. Make a short list. Do what must be done first, and don’t muck around.

, If you have a short list of your essential tasks, take a look at what’s not essential. Is there any way to eliminate it? Delegate it? Outsource it? Delay it? Think hard about this, because if you can somehow eliminate 20% of your list, you’ve made huge strides to meeting your self-set limits.

, If there’s something you do every day, consider batching it all into one day. For example, you can write all your invoices at once instead of doing them every day. It saves time. You could do that with almost anything. Same thing goes for something you do throughout the day, like email or phone calls. Consider batching tasks like that into one session per day.

, If you have a big cut in work hours as your goal, you might not be able to accomplish it all at once. Go for a gradual change. First, set a smaller limit (maybe 1 hour less per day, for example, or only a half day on Fridays). Focus on making that first stage work, and when you’ve got that down, make further cuts. Keep doing this until you get to where you ultimately want to be.

, Setting limits on your work isn’t going to work if you don’t know what you want to do with that extra time. Decide on working 1 hour less each day? What are you going to do with that hour? It can be anything: fun projects, creating a side business, spending time with loved ones, reading, exercising, going to the beach, whatever. But set aside that block (or blocks) of time for something, and be sure to do it.

, Whether it’s email, phone, IM, Skype, Twitter or whatever, you can fill your work day with communication tasks. It will fill the time allotted to it. Instead, allot a small amount of time for each vital communication method (30 minutes for IM, 30 minutes for phone, 1 hour for email, or whatever) and don’t allow anything outside of that limit.

Manage expectations.,
Use free time for other projects.,
Work from home.,
Move to task goals, not time goals.",How to Work Less2," You need to start with a conversation with your boss about expectations he or she has of your work. Talk about wanting to be more productive, which doesn’t mean producing more, but producing more important stuff. And then make that happen. If you can change the expectations that people have of you, you are well on your way. Here are some questions to raise:


What is it that they really want you to accomplish?
Is it so important where or how long it takes for you to accomplish that?
If you are able to do it from home, or in fewer hours, would that matter?

, You might be able to free up time by limiting your work to 6 hours a day (for example). But perhaps you can’t just leave work after 6 hours. Instead, use the extra time for new projects (work-related or otherwise, depending on the flexibility you have) that you’ve wanted to work on but couldn’t.

, If you can work from home, you’re set. You need to show your boss, through a one or two day trial run, that you can actually produce more from home. Know what your boss wants you to complete for that day, and do that and more. Once you get approved to telecommute, you can then set your work hours. Just be sure to get the work done, but how you do that is up to you.


See How to Convince Your Boss to Let You Work from Home.
Perhaps you can have your boss read How to Virtualize Your Workforce.

, This goes back to managing expectations, but you want your boss to set goals for you that are based on tasks or projects, not on how long you work. If you can do that, you have taken a big step towards being able to limit your work hours.

Select your three most important tasks each day.,
Schedule tasks according to your energy levels.,
Take breaks.,
Delegate tasks that don’t require your attention.,
Stay off social media.",How to Recover from Back to Work Blues1," Getting off to a good start on your first day back can be a challenge. Reduce overwhelm and streamline your day by focusing on just three priority tasks. This can help you feel productive and get you back in the swing of things without feeling so devastating.For instance, you might need to prioritize answering emails and phone calls, completing a past due project, and completing your expense report. Do your three priority tasks first. If nothing else gets done, you will at least have tackled the most important tasks.;
, If your vacation took you to another time zone, you might have some trouble getting back in-synch. Or, if you have been staying up late with a new baby, mornings may be a challenge. Think about the times of the day when you are likely to have the most energy, attention, and focus. Schedule your priority tasks for this time period.For instance, you might feel groggy when you first get in, so it may be best to stick to answering emails. About two hours into your day, you may have the mental acuity to get started on more challenging tasks.

, Nothing makes a first day back to work longer than trying to stick it out until lunch. Break up your workday and revive yourself by taking a short break every hour or so. During your break, you might chat with a coworker, stretch, refill your water or coffee, or go for a walk outside., If you have minor tasks that can be better completed by someone else, activate your network. Most people fail to make use of the resources they have at hand, trying to do everything on their own. Don’t make this mistake—ask for help, if you need it.You might delegate household or childcare responsibilities to a spouse or family member. Similarly, you might delegate filing, answering emails, or researching tasks to an assistant.
You might also have to delegate certain tasks that you are physically incapable of doing. For instance, if you just had a baby, you might need to avoid lifting heavy boxes for a while.

, You’ll worsen your back-to-work blues if you log onto your favorite social media outlet. Not only will you spot photos on friends’ feeds that cause vacation-envy, but you will likely lose a lot of time in the process. As a result, you’ll be in a foul mood and struggling to catch up.Power off your cellphone unless you need it for work. Log out of social media apps and shut off notifications.

Wear a new outfit the first day back.,
Plan to go somewhere interesting for lunch.,
Schedule an exciting activity for the upcoming weekend.,
Confirm your next holiday or vacation.,
Check in with your loved ones.",How to Recover from Back to Work Blues2," If you purchased a spiffy new dress or handsome button-down during your time off work, plan to wear it upon your return. Even if you wear something old, select some of your favorite pieces. Wearing new or exciting clothing can make you feel more confident and boost your performance at work.If you have been home recovering from an illness, injury or childbirth, you may have been wearing only sweats and t-shirts. Putting on your nice clothes may help you get back to feeling like yourself again.

, If you’ve been on vacation in an exotic outdoor destination, staying in the office all day can induce claustrophobia. Avoid eating lunch in your cubicle, if you can. Arrange to go to the deli on the corner for a healthy salad or wrap.


If you insist on bringing your lunch with you, take it outside to get some fresh air. , If you’re returning on a Monday, you may need some inspiration to get you through the week. Plan a relaxing spa day on Saturday, or buy tickets to a musical or sporting event. You might even call up a few coworkers and friends and arrange for after-work drinks on Friday.


This can help you transition back into your typical social activities, and make your ordinary week not seem so mundane.

, It can be motivating to pinpoint the next time you’ll be off work. Look at your calendar and figure out your next escape. You might look for the next three-day weekend, national holiday, or confirm your overseas vacation three months away. Doing so can help you keep your eye on the ball at work., If you are a new parent who just returned after maternity or paternity leave, your nerves may be fraught with concern for your newborn. It can help to use a break and contact the child care professional or family member who's looking after your little one. Knowing that everything is fine at home can help you stay productive at work."

Organize your to-do list and flag emails before you leave.,
Go back mid-week.,
Take some time to reintegrate yourself.,
Push meetings to the latter part of the week.",How to Recover from Back to Work Blues3," You can set yourself up for success and decrease your back-to-work blues by planning ahead. If you take just an hour out of your day before you leave for vacation to identify your priority tasks, set up a vacation auto-responder email or voicemail, and delegate any tasks beforehand, you’ll have a lot less to face when you return., If you dread returning to work on Monday after vacation, plan your time away so that you can return on Tuesday or Wednesday. Coming back mid-week makes the remaining days seem less discouraging.If you take this route, be sure to speak with your team and assistant in advance to make sure important tasks are handles in your absence.

, Returning to work after a long vacation requires an adjustment period in which you gather your wits and get your bearings. Diving headfirst into your day can be overwhelming. Plan ahead by scheduling in several blocks of time for you to play catch up.For instance, you might carve out the first hour of your workday for returning calls or simply reviewing your previous work tasks.

, Nothing can throw off an otherwise productive workday like a meeting. They often run too long and end up serving as social calls as opposed to productive ways to stay up-to-date. If you can, schedule any meetings for later in your week so you can catch up first."

Act from your gut.,

Refuse to do what you don’t want to do.",How to Make Work Feel Effortless," A lot of the time you might resent working because you're trying to force yourself to do something you don’t feel like doing. Naturally there will always be some things you’re not crazy about doing (like cleaning the toilet). But how often do you force yourself to work more, when you really want to relax? When you force yourself to work when you’ve promised yourself a break, you’ll likely just end up distracting yourself with other things and put off working. Then you get stressed and end up resenting work. Instead, follow your natural rhythms. When you feel like working, work. When you don’t, don’t. Don’t over complicate things. Also in situations where you are forced to work make sure you set some small reward for yourself on the completion of the work. This will keep our motivation high and also help in keeping you focused.;

, You wouldn’t put sugar in your gas tank right? It doesn’t make much sense to fill your body up with unhealthy fuel either. If you don’t have the energy to get the work you need to do, work will feel forced.

, What’s making you avoid working? What’s making your work seem like drudgery rather than joyful? It might have something to do with your beliefs about yourself. Maybe you believe you’re not good enough, smart enough or don’t have enough experience. Question your beliefs about what you can and can’t do.

How to Build Self Confidence

, Work can easily become a chore when you’re trying to constantly be perfect. The truth is, some of your ideas might not be so great. Others will be mind-blowing. If you can accept that and just do your best, you stop judging yourself. Guess what it feels like when you’re no longer picking over everything you do with a fine-toothed comb? It feels extremely liberating. It feels like you can actually enjoy your experience, rather than worrying about how everything is going to turn out. That is working effortlessly.


How to Be Laid Back

, When you think you have a great idea, believe it. Follow it. Chase it until you’re out of breath and can barely hold yourself up. Because if you don’t trust yourself, you’ll regret it later. The best way to live is to follow your intuition and trust life. If nothing else, trust yourself. Because if you can’t trust yourself, how can you trust your mistrust? That’s not very smart, is it?

, Our minds are constantly pulling us in different directions. We have to wash the cat, buy more apple cinnamon oatmeal, finish writing that resignation letter to your no-longer-boss at your dead-end job, and all sorts of other things. We have a tendency to follow what’s urgent instead of what’s important. In order to get the important things done, we have to be ruthless at removing distractions. If it takes bringing a laptop (or notepad) to a cafe to write your grandiose novel, then do that. Avoid the vacuum of minutiae urgency. Remove all distractions so you can focus on the important things. Better to spend 4 hours working on an important project, than 4 hours spinning your wheels and scratching your head trying to figure out what you did today.


How to Avoid Multi-Tasking

, If you often avoid working because you're trying to do things you think you “should do”, then you are being given a big clue. If your mind says: ""I think I should read more because it will make me smarter."", or ""I think I should buy new clothes because it will make me cooler."", or ""I think I should work on this project because it will be good for my resume."", then you're in a trap. Forget what you (or other people) think you should do (except maybe paying your rent). Do what you want to do. Other people will understand. In fact, they’ll probably envy you.


How to Stop Being a People Pleaser

"
Act as both a manager and a leader for the team.,
Set goals for the team.,
Use the power of delegation.,
Know what you want and say it.,
Empower each team member by giving them controlled discretion.,
Give credit where it is due.",How to Help Your Team Perform1," You have to perform both the roles independently and in synergy so that you can use these roles as a catalyst for getting the best out of the team every time. Approach each unique role as follows:


Leader: As a leader it is in exhibiting your human qualities that you are accepted as a leader by the team. Human values require the leader to have a sense of self, an ability to read the relationship dynamics clearly, and to see the relationship between the emotional, economic, and personal input to the organization. Moreover, a leader needs to have the ability to feel separate from the organization in order to be able to see beyond the company's immediate needs and to focus on the team needs instead. Here the order of preference is: the team member, the team, and then the organization.

Manager: As a manager you have to get the performance out of the team as per the organization's objectives. Here the order of preference is: the organization, team and the individual.
The balancing act: As a team leader and manager, you need to perform both the roles efficiently, to be able to blend both leadership and management within the team context. This will take practice -- but it helps to treat team members as individuals all the time -- while keeping your eye focused on the integral, common goal.;
, Every team member has to understand the short and long term goals for the team. They should also understand the path for fulfillment of the goals, the segments (breakdown) of the project, the deadlines, the processes and the procedures involved. As team leader, you have the responsibility for ensuring that all of these things are clear to each member of the team. You have to clarify goals and clear all the doubts at the time of goal setting, and to regularly check that the understandings continue to hold.


Devise a well known means for keeping track of progress toward intermediate and final goals and signaling, to everyone, the nearing of the various deadlines on work toward completion.

Clarify assumptions. Remember to clarify all parties' assumptions, and set parameters as to the premise underpinning the work or project, its required format, any specific or general criteria, the timelines or stages, and so forth. Often different assumptions can lead people to go off on different tracks, resulting in frustration and loss of buy-in, as well as loss of time and traction. It is better to overspend time on clarifying conceptions than to ignore possible miss-perceptions.

, Delegation of responsibility provides you with the time and energy to better manage the team and monitor their work regularly. Non-delegation will lead to early burnout for you and marginalisation of the results (team members won't feel so responsible without delegation). Some leaders make the mistake of thinking they are the only one with the big picture view and therefore are too afraid to delegate. However, this is a dangerous way to think and will end up in less team cohesion and a worn out leader. Consider your job situation and all its demands and pressures to get things done right. Ask yourself how you can begin to delegate and empower others through the principle of completed staff work at every stage and segment.


Focus on each team member's strengths when delegating. Give them just a bit more than what you know they're capable of, so that they have a challenge to strive for and will meet it because of your faith in their ability.

, Establish a definite understanding of the desired results. By stating openly and clearly about what is expected -- with guidelines, documents, parameters, rules -- you create a psychological contract of clear expectations between yourself and those you lead and supervise.



Answer team member's questions promptly. When explaining things, do not see questions from the team as divisive or obstructive. Questions are an excellent way of eliciting whether or not people have truly grasped what is expected of them and you can guide their understanding with your answers.

, Help your team members to understand that they will be called upon to give their best thinking in solving problem-making decisions and when formulating recommendations. Identify the criteria to be included in recommendations so that they know how much detail and original thinking is expected. Opening up the thinking and solving processes gives team members freedom to wander within the parameters and to possibly find better solutions than the ones originally posited. It will also help team members to feel empowered and not merely contributing within a narrowly defined area.



Ask questions. As part of empowering the team, ask your team members for their input and ideas. Ask them such things as: ""What is your recommendation? How would you solve this problem?"" or ""How would you implement this policy?"" Get into the habit of soliciting ideas at all stages of a project and be attentive to their responses. Obviously, not all the ideas will fly and not everything they suggest will be credible but a willingness to listen with an open-mind will ensure that team members feel valued.

, Give credit and recognition to others for their contributions and do this regularly rather than holding back until the very end (or there may be no ""end"" until the employee gets up and leaves without forewarning).


Don't risk having your team members see you as exploiting them for your own recognition or benefit by letting your superiors think that all the ideas and best thinking came from you.
Acknowledge team members' contributions openly within the team and openly to others within the company, especially in front of those team members.

Arrange your desk so no one can see your computer screen.,
Scatter work materials around your desk.,
Learn to quickly switch between tabs and windows.,
Open decoy tabs that look like your work.,
Scribble or type furiously.,
Sit up straight and look at your work.,
Use your cell phone to call your desk phone.",How to Look Busy at Work Without Really Working1," If you work in an office or cubicle of some kind, you don’t want someone to walk up behind you without you knowing it. Arrange your computer so you are facing the entrance to your area. If you have non-work windows open, you can quickly close them without them being seen.In many cubicle-style settings, your desk will be set up in a fixed position. At the very least, turn your screen away from the entrance and angle your chair toward the entrance.;
, Peel off four or five sticky notes and write messages on them. Even peel off a few and leave them blank at different spots on your desk in case you need one in a hurry. Set out binders and open them to project pages. Leave a few documents that look like what you should be doing.


Don't bring things from home that don't look like work. Use old projects or make some decoy documents that look like what you'd be working on.
There may be a fine line between a messy, work in progress desk and a desk that is just a mess. Keep things in check so it doesn't get too out of hand.

, Keyboard shortcuts allow you to toggle between windows and tabs. Use this trick to switch from watching internet videos to checking over the latest customer data. Practice the shortcut so you can tap it quickly without thinking.Use Alt+Tab on PCs to switch from one window to another window. On Macs, use command+tab to switch between open applications.
Use Ctrl+Tab on PCs to switch between tabs within the same window. On Macs, use control+tab to switch between tabs in the same window.
For example, if you have a Mac laptop, open iTunes, two different tabs on Safari, and Garageband. Hold command and press tab to switch from iTunes to Safari. Then hold control and press tab to switch from one Safari tab to the other Safari tab.

, If you are an accountant, always have a couple of spreadsheets open. If you do graphic design, have a couple sketches that you're ""working"" on. Open these tabs first thing in the morning, or set them to open automatically when you open a browser.


Never close all of your tabs so just your desktop is showing. An essentially blank screen will be a dead giveaway that you are not doing anything.
Email, Word, Google docs, business websites, news sites, are all good to keep open, depending on what type of work you do.

, The key to looking like you are busy is to always be doing something. If you appear to be sitting completely still, it’s going to be obvious you aren’t working. Anytime you get bored or have a lull in your work, grab a notebook and start writing something or peck quickly on your keyboard.It doesn’t matter what you are typing or writing, if you seem to be paying close attention to it, you’ll look busy.
This works better if you have a document on hand that is work-related. If you are asked, show the decoy document as proof of what you’re doing.

, Slacking off without being noticed has a lot to do with how you look. If you are slouching in your chair, leaning against something, or staring off into space, you’ll look lazy. Good posture and keeping your eyes on something that looks like work will do a lot for your image.If you stand while you work, don’t be caught sitting down or leaning up against something.
If you’re going to zone out, make sure you have some work out in front of you and keep your head pointed toward the work stuff.

, Being on the phone, if it’s part of your job, is a great way to look busy. If the phone is slow sometimes, dial your desk phone from your cell and then answer the desk phone. Depending on how good you are at acting, it’s easy to kill 10-15 minutes a few times a day on fake phone calls.You’ll probably want to have a plan for what the fake phone call is supposed to be about. If you seem to be rambling or not making sense, it will be obvious you are faking it.
If you want to really put some effort into it, write up a script for a standard conversation you’d have at work. Write dialogue for two people, but make sure you only read the part that makes sense for you to say.

Provide the necessary resources -- including time and access to people -- and critical information, in written form either online or on paper, that will ensure each team member is capable of completing their part in the project. Nothing is more frustrating to people than to be expected to do complete work without the necessary information, tools and resources.

, Having an open door, be accessible as manager when necessary to give information and feedback of the organization.

, Schedule a time for presentation and review of the team's completed work at various stages. Give each team member a chance to make an effective presentation of their aspect of the work.

Disable the sleep mode on your computer screen.,
Leave your work area looking like you’re in the middle of something.,
Carry a prop.,
Visit a coworker in a different department.,
Ask a lot of questions.",How to Look Busy at Work Without Really Working2," To save power, many computers go into sleep mode after a certain time of inactivity. If you leave the desk for long enough that your screen saver comes on, it’s a giveaway that you’ve been gone awhile. Turn the sleep mode off so that the screen always looks like you just left.Make sure to leave a few windows open so it appears that you were working on something right before you left your desk. Never leave anything like a shopping site or a game open on your computer when you leave.
Another option if you work on the computer is to leave something open that says “Loading” or “Installing,” because this gives you a good reason to leave your desk.

, Fill your work area with several projects that you are in the process of doing. Cover your desk with open binders, highlighted reports, tools, or partially unpacked merchandise. If it appears that you are working on something, people who walk by will assume you’ll be right back.Don’t leave the same fake setup every day or people will start to notice.
If you sort through a box of items, leave piles halfway sorted.

, If you walk away from your desk empty-handed, it’s going to look more like you’re not doing anything. Carry a binder, a notebook, or a small stack of papers so it looks like you’re on your way to meet someone. In other settings, carry a tool, a box of merchandise, or a piece of equipment.The best thing to carry will be determined by what your job is. Don’t carry the same prop every day or it will begin to be obvious that it’s a prop.
Choose something that is easy to carry and can be set down and picked up without too much effort.
A small item will make you look busy while not drawing too much attention.

, Think of a work-related topic, like a recent policy change or a big project your firm is working on, and go discuss it with someone. When you go chat with the person, mention the work related thing, but talk about other things to use up more time. If you make up a fake topic, make sure it seems real enough to be a good cover.


Mention what you are doing to someone who works next to you to establish the alibi.
Say, ""I wanted to double check and make sure both of our departments were on the same page about the new ad campaign. I know it's an important issue and I’d hate to have any mix-ups.""

, Asking questions about projects, tasks, company policies, job duties, promotion opportunities, or anything else related to your job, is a great way to seem highly engaged while not actually working. This is especially useful during transition periods because it makes sense to ask a lot of questions.Be careful what questions you ask because you don’t want to sound incompetent at the job you’re required to do.
For example, ask a boss if they have copies of designs that your current client has previously requested. When she shows them to you, find things about them to discuss further.

Connect the dots.",How to Keep a Career Log," It might be a good idea to have a distinctive look so that it jumps out at you and makes it easy to find. If you use an iPhone, Blackberry, or other PDA then utilize a note-taking application.;
, Places like next to your computer, on your desk, or in your drawer at home are all good places. A smaller notebook could fit in your purse or pocket for convenience and privacy. The most important thing is to not bring it to work; the risk of it being found and read by your co-workers or boss outweighs the benefits.You could keep your notebook in the computer, but the computer isn't always handy. Write in your notebook and put it on the computer when you can. If you do enter your notebook in the computer, it becomes very easy to search for specific parts.
Check into keeping a blog. You can make it private so that it can only be viewed by you. That way, no matter where you are, you can access it. Go to your favorite search engine and do a search for 'free personal blog' or something similar. Be sure that it will allow you to make it private, or not.

, You can do this as you go, if you want, but having a direction established will help. Here are some reasons people start career journals:


Switching jobs - You'll want to examine what you want from the new job and what you have to offer.

Switching careers - Research potential careers. Analyze your own skills, talents and experience. Establish a plan for transitioning from one career to the next.
Preparing to enter the work world for the first time (e.g. student) - Record results from self-assessment tests. Get advice from teachers and others. Sharpen your job-hunting skills.
Preparing to re-enter the work world (e.g. after traveling, or raising children) - A mix of the above.
Developing your existing career path - Filling in the ""gaps"" for becoming well-rounded in your role. Brainstorming conferences, books, seminars, and further education that may enhance your career. Networking.


, Write everything that you remember in the past that you have done. Brainstorm to jog your memory. Form and flow don't matter, just remembering. A few simple notes jotted frequently will add up to more information than long but occasional memory dumps. It will also help to record the information when it is fresh in your mind. The remaining steps will give you some ideas to get started.

, This will help you to 'see' what exactly you do from day to day. What's the first thing you do in the morning? And depending upon your result, what do you do after that? And after that? Doing this will give you a clearer picture of what you accomplish daily, and it is useful in staying focused through the day. If your daily routine doesn't really fit into a flowchart, you could also write a paragraph or more about what you do, draw a mind map, or write notes or an outline.

, You will need certain pieces of your work history for just about any job application. It's easier if you keep this basic information together, in a different section than your reflections. It will be especially useful if you ever apply for something that requires a full life history, such as citizenship, a professional license, or a security clearance. Keep careful records of these details, especially when you change jobs:


Start and end dates at each company where you worked.
Your salary history, along with dates when it changed.
Your official title and, if it is not descriptive (Staff Member, Associate IV), a description of your job function.
Addresses and phone numbers of the companies where you worked (even if out of date).
Short summaries of your work.
Names and contact information of managers/supervisors and references.
Addresses and phone numbers of your personal residences (for life history applications) and contact information for landlords or management, even if it is outdated.

, Even a simple gripe about your job (""I hate processing forms"") can provide insight into your career preferences and work habits. If you hate processing forms, is it because you dislike tedious and repetitive work? Do the forms or the process need improvement? Should the forms be processed by someone else or abolished altogether? Use your career log in your current job to identify ways that you can show initiative or improve your work. Then, when you have shown initiative or improved something, record the accomplishment in your log.

, Make sense of what you have written. Give it some order. Look for strengths and weaknesses. Notice what you love, what you hate, and what you tolerate. Notice what you admire and dislike in your supervisors and coworkers, along with how you interact with them. Notice trends. Your career may evolve with stops and starts, but it will evolve. Is it going the direction you want? How could you improve it?

Work for a company that can give you room to grow.,
Concentrate on just doing the best you possibly can in your current position.,
Make sure people know you're doing a great job.,
Be popular.,
Make sure the right people know you want a promotion.,
Apply for jobs within the company.,
Seek out new skills.,
Get a mentor.,
Groom a successor.,
Develop a new position.,
Seek employment elsewhere.",How to Get a Promotion," The type of company you work for can determine your potential for promotion. When applying for jobs, seek out companies with opportunity for advancement. You don't have to work for a huge corporation, although these usually offer plenty of promotion possibilities at any given time, but you do want to look for a company that has enough going on so that you can be assured you're not running into a dead end. Preferably this company will be doing well and growing, though many companies, especially very large ones, tend to grow in cycles.;
, Excellent performance reviews aren't sufficient to get you a promotion, but they're necessary for it. So are good attendance, punctuality, and a willingness to go the extra mile when the company needs it. Showing up 5 minutes early and leaving 5 minutes after your shift can turn into a fortune of extra income over your lifetime when you are the one that gets the promotion.

, You don't want to toot your own horn too much, but you can't always expect your merits to speak for themselves. Keep in good contact with your supervisor, and make sure he or she knows what you've been up to (assuming you've had some smashing successes). Don't be an attention grabber or ""brown-nose,"" but make sure people know who you are and make sure you get credit where credit is due.

, In an ideal world, promotions would be based solely on merit. We don't live in an ideal world, though, and office politics will often play a role in who gets promoted and who doesn't. Use and develop your people skills. Be kind and helpful to your coworkers, supervisors, and underlings. Develop relationships with people you work with, play golf with the boss, and get to know people (other than your immediate supervisor) who make decisions in the company. Be present at company events and network with people from outside your department.

, Don't be afraid to tell your supervisor about your career goals--most good supervisors will ask you about them and try to be helpful. Continue to do a great job in your current position, and don't seem fed up with your current work, but let decision makers know if you really want a particular job.

, These days you can't just wait for a promotion to fall in your lap. That happens sometimes, but most promotions, especially at large companies, require you to go through the application and interview process, and usually you'll have to compete with candidates from outside the company.


Apply for the right positions. Don't just apply for any opportunity that pays a bit more than your current job. Look for opportunities that you are genuinely interested in and that you are qualified for. You don't have to have all the skills listed in the job description, and you probably won't, but you want to be able to make a good case that you'll be able to get up to speed quickly.
Take the application process seriously. Too often, internal candidates figure they've got the new job in the bag, but studies show that as few as 1/3 of internal candidates win the better jobs they seek. External candidates can be extremely competitive because they have no pretenses of security--they want the job, and they know they'll have to put their best foot forward to get it. In addition, companies sometimes want to bring in new people to bring new skills or perspectives to the organization. The lesson here: don't be complacent, and remember to ""sell"" yourself as you would if you were applying for any other job.

, If you become the best customer service representative of all time, you're well on your way... to remaining a highly regarded customer service representative for the rest of your career. It's not enough to be great at your job; you also have to develop marketable skills that prepare you for more responsibility. When you gain skills and qualifications far beyond what your current job requires, your employer may see keeping you in that job as a waste of your talents.


Go to school. If you haven't earned a Bachelors degree, do it. If you have, consider earning a Masters or PhD, but only if one of these qualifications will help you achieve your career goals. Don't just go back to school for the heck of it. Instead think about what programs will help you climb the corporate ladder. Sometimes specialized professional designations or licenses can be far more important to getting a promotion than degrees, and sometimes you may just need to take some classes to improve your computer skills or accounting ability, for example. There are a wide range of education programs available that allow you to go to class in the evenings or on weekends, and there are also ample opportunities for accredited self-study and online learning. What's more, your employer may reimburse you for certain tuition expenses, so it may be possible for you to expand your knowledge at no cost to yourself.

Learn a second/third language. Due to the increasing globalization of the world in general, more and more companies will be looking for people that know multiple languages. Learning more than one language also means you don't need a translator, which opens up international posts (such as a manager for an entire continent, as opposed to a state or small country).


Take on temporary projects. Temporary projects can be a great way to broaden your skills and network with people from other areas of the company. Many people feel uncomfortable volunteering for these assignments because they can be challenging and can force you out of your comfort zone. That's the point.

Volunteer. If you're not getting new skills at work, consider volunteering your spare time to a non-profit organization. Large, well-recognized non-profits almost always offer a wealth of opportunities to learn new things, and smaller organizations may also have suitable projects you could work on. Successful non-profits typically look to fill volunteer positions with people who are qualified to do the job, but with a little persistence you should be able to find an opportunity that uses your existing skills and helps you build new skills. Your community involvement can also be a plus toward your getting your promotion.

, A strong relationship with a manager or someone higher up in your department can open a lot of doors for you. For one thing, you'll likely learn a lot about the organization and about the jobs you might want to get in the future. For another, you'll have an ally who will be willing to go to bat for you when you do decide to apply for a new opportunity. Finally, your mentor may groom you to succeed him or her when they move up or retire.

, It's a common paradox: you're so good at your job that you're indispensable, but you're so indispensable in your current position that the company would fall apart if you were to leave that position. The solution to this problem is to take another employee under your wing and train him or her so that they will be ready to fill your shoes if you get promoted. Some people are afraid that their understudy will take their job if they do this, but as long as you're a great employee and continue to develop your skills, the only way you'll lose your current job is by getting promoted. Training another employee (or several) also shows that you have management skills and that you care about helping other employees develop their skills.

, If you figure out a better way to do your existing job or see the need for a new position, don't be afraid to talk to management about creating this position. Since you're the one who saw the need and, presumably, you're best qualified for the position, this can help you take on new responsibilities, even if you don't get a big pay raise at first.

, If, for whatever reason, you seem to be at a dead end with your current employer, it's time to look for better opportunities elsewhere. This can be hard if you feel a loyalty to your employer, but you do need to do what is in the best interest of your career or you will become unhappy with your job. Recent surveys show that as many as 75 percent of employees are looking for new jobs at any given time, so you won't be alone.

Use earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones.,
Organize your work differently.,
Listen to music.,
Take breaks from the noise and relax.",How to Concentrate While There Are Background Noises1," Earplugs are great to cancel outside noises and cheap to buy.Noise-cancelling headphones are more expensive, but may be useful as a substitute or in addition to your earplugs.


If you are in an office, social or studying environment, you may want to explain why you are using earplugs or headphones. Assure people that they can still talk to you and encourage them to tap you on the shoulder, step next to you, or otherwise get your attention. Of course, make sure that your boss has agreed to this arrangement beforehand.
There are different types of earplugs, headphone, and noise-cancelling devices. Experiment on what feel good to you; everyone has a different preference.;
, Identify when the noise is the loudest and reserve the easiest tasks for that moment. If you are at work, see if you can move to the library, a different cubicle or a conference room if you require greater concentration.


It might not always be possible to move from your desk. If there is really nothing you can do about the noise, acceptance and adaptation is sometimes the best solution.

, If you are able to think, concentrate, and study when listening to music, this technique can be an excellent way to cancel background noises. Lyrics-free music, such as classical, trance, or ambient music, is often the best choice for concentration. Think about the volume. If the music is too loud, you won’t be able to concentrate and you might bother your colleagues.






As an alternative, use white noise. White noise is a static sound used to block background noise. It is commonly used with babies. If white noise doesn't suit you, try pink noise, grey noise, or brown noise. You can easily find these on the internet or download an application for your phone.
Put on headphones, but do not listen to anything. For some individuals, simply putting on headphones muffles sound enough to concentrate without any enhancement.







, Background noises can be extremely stressful and detrimental to your health. A good way to regain your concentration is to take a short break and go for a walk or to the toilets. You can also try different techniques to calm yourself:


Sit comfortably, breathe deeply and slowly. Once your body get used to this, close your eyes and focus on something relaxing. Do this for at least ten minutes.






You can also try to relax the muscles of your body. Sit comfortably and stretch the muscles of your face. Gently rotate your head and move your shoulders. Stretch your arms and your legs and rotate your wrists and hands."

Address the problem.,
Arrange the room to block external sounds.,
Call a professional.,
Move out.",How to Concentrate While There Are Background Noises2," If you cannot get away from a noise, such as a radio playing at work, consider raising the matter politely with everyone involved. It is important that everyone in a workplace or study environment feels comfortable. You may find out that you are not the only one who has an issue!


If your colleagues refuse to keep the noise level to a minimum, consider talking with the HR department.
If you have to deal with noisy neighbors, always stay calm and polite. Disputes between neighbors can become ugly quickly.

, This is a short-term strategy to isolate the room you are working in. Make sure that your windows and your doors are closed. Sounds usually penetrate through holes and gapes. The following ideas can help you reduce the level of background noise:


Various barriers can mute distracting sounds. Place a few pillows against the wall to absorb the sound from the other side of the wall when in bed.
Buy thermal drapes for your windows. They stop outside sounds as well as the flow of heat.
Place a carpet on the floor to block the sound from downstairs.







, If you work at home and own the place, you can call a professional to soundproof your room. This solution will be expensive but will also give you more freedom and long-term satisfaction.


There are several ways to soundproof your house. Soundstop panels can be installed on the walls and rubber mats placed on the floor.
Always ask for a quote and call a few professionals to compare. Don’t pick the first one and try to bargain.

, Moving out of your rented house or flat might seem like a drastic solution but if you are poisoned by background noises and are working at home, this might be the simplest long-term option. You need to take care of your health and your stress level.


Plan your move correctly. Ideally, you should research different area and investigate the noise level. You don’t want to move in another noisy place! If you find a place you like, visit it at different times to be sure that the noise level is acceptable.
Identify potential problems. Do not move next to a football stadium or a nightclub. Avoid bars and places where there are high concentrations of students.

Make sure you're not hungry or thirsty.,
Avoid stimulants such as coffee, energy drinks, sugar, and tea.,
Sleep well.,
Relax outside of work.",How to Concentrate While There Are Background Noises3," Being hungry or thirsty will decrease your ability to concentrate and will make you more vulnerable to external stimuli like noise. Try to eat healthily. A high blood sugar level is proven to have an impact on your concentration.Junk food is also linked to a decreased attention span.Drink plenty of water. It's good for your body and research has demonstrated that it boosts your brain's ability to concentrate., While caffeine can give you an energy boost immediately after consumption, the benefit can be short-lived. The consumption of caffeine can trigger withdrawal effects which include headache and a difficulty to concentrate., Being sleep deprived is bad for your concentration and will make you more sensitive to background noises.

If you work in a noisy environment, try to come rested., If you're over-stressed by the noise, try to relax at home. You could try aromatherapy or go for a massage. Your global well-being will inevitably have an impact on your ability to resist external noises.


Sport is a great way to relax your muscles and body.
Meet your friends and try to forget about your working environment. Don't become obsessed with the noise.
If you cannot relax anymore, talk to your doctor. Stress and noise can lead to a burnout and it might be time to take a break."

Change your internal monologue.,
Stop hanging out with negative people.,
Create a positive mental image.,
Keep the benefits of work in mind.,
Take note of positive contributions you make.",How to Enjoy Your Job1," How do you think about yourself and your job? Negative thoughts are probably not helping you enjoy yourself. Work on being conscious of what you're thinking and replacing negative thoughts with positive ones.For example, stop when you think things like, ""This job is awful and I'll never get a better one."" Instead, try to focus on the positive aspects of your job.
For example, instead think something like, ""This job stresses me out because it's complicated, but I'm learning a lot. This will be beneficial for my career."";
, In every place of work, there are chronic complainers. There is no need to hang out with people who complain frequently as such people will only drag you down. Surround yourself with positive people at your office to avoid being weighed down by the negative.Don't engage in office gossip. Not only does this contribute to feelings of negativity, it could potentially get you in trouble with your boss or superiors.

, Have a place in your mind where you can take a mental vacation when you're feeling stressed. Close your eyes and imagine a relaxing scenario. Try to use all your senses to envision how this place feels, smells, tastes, and so on.For example, say you love camping. If you get stressed, close your eyes and imagine being in a tent in the woods. Think about how nature feels, sounds, tastes, and smell for a few moments. This should calm you down.

, Everyone works for a reason. Even if your job isn't something that's going to change the world, you need to work to afford basic necessities like food and shelter. If you find yourself stressed by work, think something like, ""This job may be stressful, but I'm lucky to get a paycheck.""It can help to think about buying small rewards every time you get paid. For example, order take out every payday. This way, you will keep the benefits of your job in mind.
Each time you make a necessary purchase, remember how your paycheck contributed to this. Think to yourself, ""I'm lucky I'm able to work so I can buy these groceries.""

, Think about the good things you do at your job, even small things. If you're working a dull data entry job at a non-profit, think about how data entry benefits the organization overall. Even if you're a tiny cog in the machine, you're keeping it going and you should be proud of that.Even if you're not passionate about your job, maybe you bring something to the office. If you're kind to your co-workers, you probably contribute to a positive work atmosphere.
Even low level jobs are important. Handing someone a latte at a coffee shop can make their day, even if you don't think much of the task.

"
"
Request new responsibilities that interest you.,
Make to-do lists.,
Concentrate on one thing at a time.,
Take action to change your job for the better.,
Teach yourself a new skill.,
Take breaks during the day.",How to Enjoy Your Job2," If you're doing the same task day in and day out, this can get repetitive and boring. Instead of accepting the tasks you're dealt, volunteer to do something new. Approach your boss and ask if you can take on some new responsibilities in the office.See if there are any places in your office where extra help is needed. For example, maybe your company's social media profile is a little lax. Volunteer to ramp it up a little.

, One reason people dislike work is that they feel overwhelmed. If you go into work every day feeling incredibly stressed, you're likely to be unhappy. Work on organizing tasks into a to-do list every day to help yourself remain calm.Prioritize items on your list. For example, separate it into sections of items that need to be done today and items that could wait.
You'll get a feeling of accomplishment crossing items off your to-do list. This can lead to you enjoying your job as you'll feel a sense of pride.

, If you're concentrating at the task at hand, you'll have less time to think about stress or dissatisfaction. When working on something, give it your full attention and push worries or fears out of your mind. This will keep you occupied, allowing you to better enjoy your work.If you have a lot of downtime, you may find yourself worrying then. Try to bring things like books and crossword puzzles to the office to keep yourself occupied during downtime.
It can initially be hard to focus on one thing at a time. It takes practice, but with time you should be able to increase your concentration, leading to a happier work environment.

, If there's something you don't love about your job, take action to change it. Bosses love employees that are always looking for ways to better the office, so be on the lookout for ways to make positive changes that benefit everyone.For example, say you're using a somewhat dated software in the office. Suggest that your boss upgrade to a software that's easier to use. Volunteer to teach other employees how to use the software so things run smoother.
Maybe some people are struggling with deadlines. Volunteer to teach a brief class on time management with employees to improve productivity.

, If you're feeling like your job is stagnant, try to learn something new. Whether it's a software you don't know how to use or a particular type of copywriting, use downtime at work to forge new skills. If your boss sees you've learned something new, you may be able to move up in the office. This can lead to better positions down the road., If you get five minute breaks, take them. Stretch your legs, take a walk, have a snack, or do something else to relax. Even if you don't have actual breaks, get up for about 30 seconds and stretch. Even tiny breaks from work help.

"
"
Switch off when you leave.,
Remember you are not your job.,
Volunteer on the side.,
Indulge your hobbies and passions.,
Ask to telecommute some days.",How to Enjoy Your Job3," If you find yourself thinking about your job after leaving work, try to avoid this. Think to yourself, ""I did what I could today, and now I can relax."" When you're not at work, focus on things like your hobby, friends, family members, pets, and other aspects of life outside the office. You work hard and are entitled to unwind at the end of the day.

, If you're unsatisfied at work, you may internalize these feeling and start feeling negative about your life overall. Strive to remind yourself you are not your job. You have other things going on, like friendships and family obligations, outside the office. Place your focus here when you feel discouraged., Not everyone can work a job that fulfills their dreams. If you're not in the exact field you love, pursue your passions outside of work. Volunteer at an organization that could use extra help.For example, if you're working an office job, but your goal is to work with kids, volunteer at a daycare, library, or school to help tutor kids.

, Work doesn't have to be your only outlet in life. Think about your passions and find ways to indulge them on the side. Form a band with friends if you're interested in music. Join a local theater troupe if you're interested in acting. There are many things you can do to feel fulfilled outside of work., Sometimes, simply being out of the office can help you feel more positive and energetic about your job. Telecommuting can help you develop work/life balance. See if your office has policies regarding telecommuting and ask if you can work from home some days."

Make it clear what you want.,
Be trainable.,
Get in your peak physical condition.,
Practice your land navigation skills in private.,
Reapply if you’re not accepted the first time.",How to Join Delta Force," You must have a minimum of four years in Service to qualify for Delta Force, so your first step in becoming a Delta Force operative is to enlist in the Army as a regular soldier and work steadily to rise through the ranks. Take and pass the Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA) and qualify for security clearance with your recruiter and discuss your ambitions to join Delta Force.


All applicants for SFOD-D must be male, at least 22 years old, have a general technical score of 110 or higher. You must attain the rank of E-4 through E-8, with at least four years in service, and have at least two years remaining on your contract to qualify.
To get started on the right foot, talk to your recruiter about your eventual desires to end up in an elite unit like Delta Force, so you'll be advised correctly. For the most part, you'll want to volunteer for a combat arms job, to qualify more quickly for more advanced training and specialization.
For the most part, Delta Force soldiers are Green Berets or Rangers first, then are recruited out of their specialization. Make joining the special forces your first goal.

, OSUT combines Army Basic Training and Infantry AIT (Advanced Individual Training) in one 14-week course, giving you the fundamental skills to transition from a civilian into a soldier, and a specialized soldier at that.If you want to end up in Delta force, you should go into OSUT expecting to develop your proficiency in a variety of field tasks, including:


Weapon and vehicle operation and maintenance
Land reconnaissance
Map reading and navigation
Minefield safety
Communications equipment operation
Preparing fighting positions
Constructing barriers

, Special Forces troopers who eventually want to join Delta Force must qualify for and complete airborne training, in addition to AIT and other specialized training.This is a voluntary training that some soldiers elect to take to ""earn their wings,"" becoming paratroopers. It's four weeks of jump training, starting on the ground and eventually moving to completing a series of jumps at an altitude of 1,200 feet (365.8 m)., These four-week courses typically lead up to the Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS) program, which you must pass to be admitted to Special Forces training and continue your rising in the ranks.


The SFAS program assesses and selects Soldiers for attendance at the Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC). This program allows Special Forces an opportunity to assess each Soldier's capabilities by testing his physical, emotional, and mental stamina.
Once you pass the SFAS, you'll move on to the SFQC. The SFQC teaches and develops the skills necessary for Special Forces. The enlisted applicant's SFQC training will be scheduled upon successful completion of SFAS.

, During this period, soldiers are trained on specialized skills necessary to Special Forces work. Training is 40 days long and covers land navigation, cross-country map exercise, and small unit tactics. The specifics subjects and methods of the training process aren't public, and will be made more clear to soldiers who are admitted.

, Training for this phase is 65 days and culminates with a mission planning cycle, during which you'll put your leadership skills to the test, as well as hone your particular specialities and skills that you've been developing over the course of your training. Different soldiers, depending on their experience, training, and specialities, will have different responsibilities during MOS., During this 38-day period, Soldiers are trained in Special Operations (SO) classes, Direct Action (DA) Isolation, Air Operations, Unconventional Warfare classes, and receive Isolation training. This is one of the most mentally tough and physically strenuous training sequences in all of the United States military. You'll be put to the test and expected to perform at a high level. Many soldiers scrub out.

, Language training is required for all incoming Delta soldiers and expected of advanced-level Special Forces soldiers from all backgrounds. Typically, languages are assigned in relation to the score from the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB), which you'll take during your training.

, The military respects ambition and rewards skill and dedication. If you want to join Delta Force, make it clear to your commanding officers and other ranking officials. This is the best way to be recruited to train and possibly qualify for part of this elite unit. If you leave your desire a secret, it's unlikely you'll be tasked with joining up. Be honest about what you want.


Get to know your COs and other ranking officers very well. It's no understatement to say, like anything else, there's a political element to getting promoted and getting what you want in the military. Make friends in high places and you'll have someone's ear, and also have a good line into what other COs and ranking officers expect from the soldiers. Keep an ear out for tips and tricks. Talk to the right people.

, Your job during the selection phase is to show your potential and train-ability under stress. Focus on giving every task that you are faced with 110 percent effort and never ever quit. You are not expected to be a super-soldier right off the starting line, but you are expected to be considerably above average and to remain committed to improving your skills and being a teachable soldier.


Remember, once you're admitted, you'll be trained extensively, and put to the test mentally and physically. You just have to get there. If anyone asks if you're ready, your only answer should be ""Yes, sir.""

, Delta Force soldiers need to be beyond fit. Even if you haven't enlisted as an infantry soldier yet, it's a good idea to start getting into your peak physical condition, focusing specifically on building endurance and cardiovascular strength.


Practice walking for very long distances (30mi or more) with a weighted (60lbs) rucksack. Try for 15 minute miles, though you will be expected to travel at a much faster pace during Selection.

, Land navigation skills are key to successfully completing the Delta Force selection course. Know how to use a compass and map intimately, practicing your skills as often as possible. If you've already got that down, it's one less thing you'll have to focus on learning during training, so you can focus on improving other aspects of your candidacy.

, The majority of applicants to Delta Force will be rejected and most accepted applicants have previously applied. Of all the people in the army, only a fraction of them become Airborne Rangers and Green Berets. Of all the Airborne Rangers and Green Berets, only a fraction of them are selected for Delta Force.

Be confident in yourself.,
Dress for success.,
Be confident of your own authority.,
Don't appear self-important.,
Make a good impression.,
Learn to speak up.",How to Gain Authority in the Workplace1," You have little hope of gaining authority if you don't believe in yourself. If you constantly second-guess yourself, you will not seem authoritative to anyone. If you hear your voice in your head telling you that you can't do it, don't listen to these internal negative messages. Believe that you can do anything and those around you will begin to notice your confidence.


Even if you get negative feedback at work, remember how sure and capable you feel about your job requirements. Don't let anyone make you doubt yourself.
It is also helpful to be well-informed about your job, your position, and how you fit within the company. Know your place and show your coworkers and bosses that you can do what is required of you.;
, When you go to work, dress to impress but don't go over the top. Figure out what is respectable for your particular position and work from there. Don't look like a carbon copy of everyone around you, however. Dress for success, but also remember to follow your own style, and feel confident in what you wear. The better you look and feel, the more authoritative you will appear.For example, don't show up to work in wrinkled jeans and a t-shirt where people in authority positions wear nice suits and dress clothes every day. Dress for the position and environment you are in.

, When you are new at a job or position, or if you are just trying to gain more authority in your current position, make sure you know what responsibilities you have. Be clear about what your job description is and what is expected of you. If you are in a managerial position, make sure you move projects forward, look after your fellow employees, and resolve problems that arise that you are responsible for.


When you make these decisions, make them with confidence. Don't second-guess yourself; you have the right to make choices. As long as you are clear about what your job entails, you can exert as much authority as your position will allow, if you are confident in your actions., One of the main ways to lose authority in the workplace is to act as if you are the most important person in the room. Even if your job description says you are higher up in the company than everyone else, don't act like it. Try to positively influence the workflow of those around you without seeming self-important. Strive to always be mindful of how your job relates to those around you.


This doesn't mean you should act as if you are not relevant. There is a balance between acting confident and in charge and acting self-important; expecting everyone to bow down to you and your authority. This will likely make your coworkers and employees lose respect and faith in your abilities., Whether it is with your boss, coworkers, or employees. When you interact with anyone at work, be on your best behavior. Don't make inappropriate comments or make anyone feel uncomfortable with your interactions. Put your best foot forward. You can't do this if you aren't mindful of your interactions with others. Make sure your projects, reports, or other work documents look as professional as possible. These presentations are how you interact most with your coworkers and bosses, so make sure they are clean and well designed.


This is true of e-mails as well. In the current workplace, you will likely interact with your coworkers through e-mail and other electronic communication on a daily basis. Make sure you are respectful as well as neat and grammatically correct in your messages. This will make you seem more confident and authoritative.

, There are times when you will be called on to help with a problem at work. Instead of being timid about a solution or worrying about overstepping your bounds, learn to speak up. If you think you have a solution to a problem, express it to those around you. They can be coworkers, employees, or bosses.


Try coming up with alternate solutions to problems. If there is a problem that is an ""either/or"" issue, try to make it a ""this and that"" solution."
"
Don't fill all silences.,
Stop caring if you're liked.,
Make sure you are on the same page as your boss.,
Encourage others to succeed.,
Watch how you address others.,
Be a good listener.",How to Gain Authority in the Workplace2," When you talk to other people in your work place, make concise, intelligent statements. If you are constantly trying to fill silences with nervous chatter, you will seem less authoritative and people will not see you as confident. Once you make a point, leave it at that. Don't try to fill any empty space if your coworker or employee doesn't respond right away.


Don't rush to answer a question, either. It is fine to take a minute to answer a question once you've been asked something. This shows that you have been listening and thinking about a proper response. Avoid blurting out the first thing that comes to mind., When you are trying to gain authority, you can't worry about being everyone's friend. Often times people in managerial positions have to make hard decisions that not everyone will like. Instead, assert yourself in a confident manner and people will not only appreciate you, they will take you more seriously., One way to undermine your authority at work is to have to backtrack on what you say. Before you make big decisions, tell other employees what to do, or start on a project, make sure you and your boss are clear on what is expected from you and your team. Have a clear understanding of any deadlines involved.

, If you are trying to gain authority in the workplace, you will need the help of those around you. Since you cannot do all the work yourself, encourage others to do their best as well. Your encouragement to do their best will empower them with new confidence. This will not only help them to accomplish their goals, but will help you gain better influence in the workplace as well.


For example, a coworker is working hard on a project but gets stuck. Instead of pointing out his errors, offer encouragement. Let him know that he has your support.
If you do this with enough people, you will be in favor with your coworkers and employees and will have gained respect from them as well., When you speak to those around you, watch the tone of voice you use. If you are making a declarative statement, speak in a strong, even tone. Don't end a sentence with a question mark unless it is a question. Watch out for filler language as, which uses words such as ""um"", ""like"", and ""I think."" These make you sound less sure of yourself. Also attempt to be as direct as possible. Even if what you have to say is uncomfortable, say it in a direct, head-on way. Those around you will appreciate your straightforward approach and respect you for it.


Don't be defensive when you talk, either. If someone is challenging your authority or decision-making process, being defensive will make you seem less confident than simply sticking up for your own decision in a calm, collected manner., Although it is good to make sure your voice is heard and to give your opinions, make sure you don't offend the opinions of others. Give fellow workers the respect they deserve by listening to their opinions. Listen to what others have to say and take their comments to heart.


If you internalize their comments and do something about their concerns and complaints, they will see that you are fair, which will in turn make you more authoritative.
If you are trying to gain more authority with those on the same level as you, become their confidant by listening to their issues. This will make you seem like someone they can turn to for support, which will give you authority."
"
Continue to get better.,
Be okay with not knowing.,
Manage your emotions.",How to Gain Authority in the Workplace3," Just because you are in a place where you are gaining more authority doesn't mean that you are a perfect worker. Always strive to do better and to improve your work ethic. Make smart decisions that will help your company, not hold it back. This will give you more authority as well, since your bosses will see how smart and forward thinking you are.


If you are not sure what to do to improve your position, ask your boss, manager, or supervisor. They will likely tell you what you can do to improve, what responsibilities you can take on to help the company, or how you can become more involved. This will also help raise your level of authority because it will show your initiative., There may be situations that you are uncomfortable with or don't know how to handle. One of the signs of an authoritative worker is being able to handle any situation that comes at you. When a situation presents itself, be okay with saying something like ""I appreciate your question, and I'll think it over and get back to you."" It shows that you are considerate of your coworker's thoughts and will consider their questions and opinions.


This also has the added bonus of giving you time to contemplate questions coworkers bring up and get back to them with well thought out, authoritative answers., One of the worst things you can do is get angry in front of your coworkers. If you are confident and have authority, you do not need to get angry at certain situations just because you have the power to fix them. Even if a situation upsets you, don't let it show in front of others. If you do, it will appear that you do not know a more effective way to approach the situation.


This is true for when you have to discuss sensitive issues with co-workers as well. For example, if you have to talk over an employee's performance issues, remain calm and collected. Be concerned and stern, but not angry or hostile."

Surviving spouses who are not receiving DIC benefits;
, In order to qualify for a VA loan, you need to have served for a sufficient amount of time either in the armed forces, the National Guard, or the National Reserve. The length of time will depend on the war in which the service member fought. Furthermore, surviving spouses are limited as to when (or if) they can remarry.


Generally, a qualifying tour of service requires two years of active duty and an honorable discharge. Six years of Reserve/National Guard time is typically required for those members.A full list of requirements is available on the VA website at http://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/purchaseco_eligibility.asp. Check to see that you meet the requirements.

, In order to get a certificate, Veterans Affairs must be able to verify the dates of service. Often, dates of service can be verified by data in the VA systems. However, you should also have proof of service available. Proof of service is required if you entered service after September 7, 1980 and were discharged before serving at least two years.You will need the following:If you are a Veteran or a Current or former National Guard or Reserve member who has been activated for Federal active service, then you will need DD Form 214.

Thank a veteran.,
Remember holidays that honor veterans.,
Pick up a veteran’s tab.,
Listen to and share their stories.,
Write a letter to a veteran.",How to Help Veterans1," When you meet with a veteran you know, or you meet a veteran for the first time, offer a heartfelt word of thanks. You’d be surprised how far a simple “thank you” can go. A number of veterans never hear it. A simple word of support shows them that they are noticed and appreciated., Show your appreciation for veterans on these days. Holidays like Veterans Day and Memorial Day are popular for honoring those who have served in the military, but there are other lesser-known dates--some that correspond to particular service positions--that you may not be aware of. Here are just a few:

Vietnam Veterans Day honors those who served during the Vietnam War.
Silver Star Service Banner Day honors wounded service personnel.
Armed Forces Day honors those who served in the U.S. Armed Forces.
POW/MIA Recognition Day honors those who were captured or imprisoned during their service.
Gold Star Wives Day honors those who lost loved ones in the line of duty., The next time you see a veteran waiting in line to pay for their drink or meal, offer to buy it for them, or do it anonymously. Anyone would appreciate the gift of having their coffee, dinner, gas, prescription, or even groceries paid for., Many veterans’ stories will go unheard or untold. Lending an ear to a veteran in your neighborhood can be a good showing of community support.Organizations like The Veterans History Project collect stories and archive them in the Library of Congress.Offer to interview a veteran so that their story can reach a wider audience.

, Writing a heartfelt letter to a veteran is a good way to show your appreciation and is one of the most cherished contributions.This is an especially good option if you don’t know any veterans in your immediate area.


Organizations like Operation Gratitude will help put you in touch with those who could use your support. They will also allow you to put together and send care packages."
"
Give a veteran a ride.,
Foster or train a companion or service animal.,
Deliver meals or groceries to a veteran.",How to Help Veterans2," Many veterans with disabilities incurred during their time in service can't drive and are in need of help getting from place to place. Ask them if they need a ride to the supermarket or to an appointment, for example.

If you can offer a ride, but don't know a veteran, contact The Department of Veterans Affairs (DAV) Transportation Network and they will pair you with someone., Many veterans are in need of companion or service animals to cope with physical and mental disabilities. You can help foster or train service animals that will help reduce veterans' physical and mental stress.Reach out to organizations like Pets for Vets to find out how you can help pair veterans with therapy animals.Contact a group like Patriot PAWS to volunteer raising service dogs for disabled veterans.You can also support military working dogs by purchasing pet food and treats from companies that donate money to assist the dogs after they retire., Some veterans have trouble performing everyday activities like shopping for groceries or making meals. They may be unable to drive or navigate a store.Help them out by volunteering to deliver food.

If you can’t schedule time to deliver food to veterans, you can point them to grocery or meal delivery services such as Meals on Wheels or the various transportation services provided by the Disabled Veterans National Foundation."
"
Join or start a community support organization for veterans.,
Volunteer at a hospital.,
Volunteer to help build homes.,
Organize or volunteer for a Stand Down event.",How to Help Veterans3," Government financial support can only go so far, so many veterans rely on help from community-based centers.Check if there’s one in your area; if not, consider starting one.

Try raising funds through already established community organizations you are a part of, like your church, school, or civic/business group.
Try expanding your reach by advertising your cause to local media outlets.
Ask local businesses if they will donate to your cause or match contributions., Spend a few hours visiting wounded and recovering veterans. VA hospitals often welcome volunteers to help out with recreational activities, or just to provide companionship., Organizations like Building Homes for Heroes help build or modify homes for wounded veterans. The houses are given to veterans and their families at no cost.You don’t need to know how to build a house. They'll also need help with painting, carpentry, plumbing, wiring, and other services that complete a house.

, Stand Down events are organized by volunteers who spend 2-3 days providing homeless veterans access to healthcare, hygiene services, food, and clothing, as well as housing, employment, and counseling referrals.You can apply for grant funds with which to organize a Stand Down event in your city through the U.S. Department of Labor.The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs provides a list of upcoming Stand Down events in areas across the U.S."
"
Support emergency shelters in your area.,
Donate your old electronics.,
Give to a non-profit charitable organization.",How to Help Veterans4," You can donate money, but shelters are also always in need of clothing, personal hygiene products, or non-perishable food items. Look for things that you no longer have a use for or have too many of and consider donating them to veterans in need., Some organizations, like Cell Phones for Soldiers or Veterans Advantage Recycle and Reward program, will refurbish your old, unused electronics to raise funds for veterans or provide them with better access to updated technology., Charitable organizations can’t support services for veterans in need without monetary donations. There are many organizations who will gladly accept your contribution. Here are some of the most well-known ones:


Disabled American Veterans: This organization provides guides disabled veterans toward resources such as disability assistance, pensions, and job programs.
Wounded Warrior Project: They provide wounded veterans with rehabilitation and career counseling.U.S. Vets: This organization provides veterans with the mental and practical tools they need to reintegrate into society following their service."

Get a sponsor.,
Bring pertinent documents.,
Get enrolled in DEERS.,
Ask your sponsor to sign a DD FORM 1172-2.,
Get your ID card.",How to Get a Military ID1," Your military member is your sponsor, and the reason you will receive some benefits. The benefits include, but are not limited to, the privilege of driving on post, use of the base/post exchange, buying groceries at the commissary, and Tricare health insurance. If you do not have a sponsor, you will not be able to get a dependent ID card. The following is a list of the most common dependent recipients:


A lawful spouse
A widow
Children under 21-years old
Children between 21 and 23 who are going to college
Adult children unable to care for themselves;
, Pretty much every form you sign while in the military, or part of a military family, is going to require multiple forms of ID. You’ll need to bring your photo ID (e.g. a driver’s license), a social security (SSN) card, and a birth certificate. For different dependents there are specific forms of ID required:For a spouse, the wedding license is required.
If a couple already has a child before marriage, the child’s birth certificate and SSN card is necessary.
If the military member is adopting his new spouse’s child, then the child’s adoption papers, birth certificate, and SSN card are required.
All these forms have to be originals. No copies are accepted.

, All service-members are in DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System), and so are their legal dependents. It's essentially a worldwide-accessible database of names that identifies military sponsors, their families, and other applicable personnel who are eligible for benefits.You can either go to your local Military Personnel Office (MILPO) or access the Real-time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS) site.

, They must sign the DD FORM 1172-2 (Application for identification card/DEERS enrollment) for you to obtain any benefits. For deployed military members, there are three possible substitutions:A DD FORM 1172-2 can be notarized and signed abroad, as long as there is a verifying official (VO) on hand.
A special power of attorney for IDs and DEERs, common for families experiencing separation, can be granted to a dependent of legal age.
The RAPIDS site can be used with an active Common Access Card (CAC) to digitally sign a document. Once the document is digitally signed, it can be accessed remotely wherever the dependant attempts to sign up for an ID card., After your enrollment in DEERS has been verified, you’re almost finished. You’ll need to bring two different forms of ID to MILPO, and one of those must have your photo on it. There are two different forms left, however, that can be filled out at the MILPO:



DD FORM 1173 – This is the form titled United States Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card, for dependents of active duty, Reservists who are active duty for greater than 30 days, retirees and those receiving retiree pay, Medal of Honor winners, and a few other eligible dependents.

DD FORM 1173-1 – This form is titled the United States Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card (Guard and Reserve family member). It is for dependents of Reservists, former Reservists, and Reservists who die after they become eligible. "
"
Complete a completed DD FORM 1172-2.,
Fill out the service-corresponding form.,
Go to the MILPO location.",How to Get a Military ID2," For retired veterans, this process should already be completed during service or during the End Term Service (ETS) out-processing. If, however, it is not completed, retirees must still fill out the form to be part of the DEERS database., Depending on your military involvement (i.e. Active Duty, Reserves, National Guard), or the level of your service-related disability, there are two possible options for retiree ID cards. Either of these forms can be filled out beforehand, or when you arrive on site.



DD FORM 2 – A blue ID card is issued after filling out this form. Those who may submit this form are the following former military members:

Retirees who are receiving retired pay, or are entitled to retired pay
Former service members who are on the Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL)
Former service members who are on the Permanent Disability Retired List (PDRL)DD FORM 2A – A red card is issued after filling out this form. The DD FORM 2A is specifically for people under the age of 60 who are retired from the Reserves or National Guard., Most military bases will allow someone on post with a temporary pass if they don’t have a military ID. You’ll need a valid reason to get through the gate, but if you tell them you need to get your retired ID card they’ll most likely let you through.


Be sure to get directions to the MILPO location and head there directly. You will only be permitted to go to the locations you’ve been authorized.
Your car will most likely be inspected prior to being allowed on post. Be sure to remove firearms from the vehicle beforehand.
Bring your proof of retirement from the military, along with the aforementioned forms.
Once you present all the appropriate forms, you should receive your appropriate retiree ID card.

"
"
Go to the DMV.,
Ask about your state’s offering.,
Present proof of military service.,
Receive your Veterans ID card.",How to Get a Military ID3," In most states there is a method by which former members of the military, who are not retired or in some other way in possession of a traditional military ID, can prove their former service.


In some states the local circuit court clerk may serve as an alternate location.

, Each state differs, but all states offer some way to identify those who have served honorably. There are essentially three variations offered: A stamp or designation may be placed on the normal driver’s license. This is typically displayed as a red “V” or with the word “Veteran” somewhere on the card.
In some states, a special driver’s license for veterans is available. The license is slightly different from typical licenses depending on the state.
Those states without driver’s license modifications provide a unique veteran’s ID card. This card is one specifically designed to identify you as a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces, and is supplementary to your driver’s license., In most states, proving your service is done by presenting your DD FORM 214 (DD214), the Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, which is probably the most coveted and popular form for former service members. In absence of the DD214 there are three possible alternatives:


Presenting the DD FORM 215, which is the Correction to DD FORM 214, has enough information to show your honorable discharge from service.
Showing an active duty CAC can obviously be used to display your current service.
Displaying your retiree military ID card can be used to get whatever designation your state offers.

, Depending on state, this process could require a minimal waiting period and a small fee. Additionally, the waiting period may be extended if your state requires the VA to vet the veracity of your documentation."

Know who you are talking to.,
Know the core values.",How to Enlist in the United States Air Force," Not everyone is cut out for the responsibilities of active serve. However, if you can join, the Air Force offers a variety of benefits, including technical training. Consider the various careers available and decide which might be appropriate for you.


The Air Force offers its members vacation time, free healthcare, consistent wages, on the job training, and tuition support. There is even an Air Force Academy that the enlisted can attend for college credit. Not everyone in the Air Force is a pilot. There are jobs available in air traffic control, nursing, repair, computer science, electronics, law, and transportation. Visit the Air Force careers website to see what careers might be available to you.;
, To even be considered for a job with the Air Force you must be between 17 and 39 years of age. You must also be either a U.S. citizen or legal, permanent resident. Furthermore, you must either have a high school diploma or a GED with at least 15 college credits.Age requirements differ depending upon your desired field. Most applicants must begin Basic Military Training by the age of 27. Officers must be commissioned by the age of 34. Those in medicine must begin by 39. Those who have served in the past can often return at a later age than a new recruit would be able to join.
If you are 17 years old, you will need to ask your parents for permission to enlist. Otherwise you can wait until you turn 18 to self apply.

, A birth certificate, driver’s license, social security card, high school transcripts and, if you have it, college transcripts, will be necessary when you apply. These will need to be original certified documents, not copies. Try to have these ready before you meet with a recruiter.Sometimes additional documents will be required. If you have a passport or marriage license, you should bring them. You might need legal records or a credit report. Bring your resume, with records, locations, and contact information for all of the places you have worked for the past 5-10 years. You should have at your disposal address you have lived at for the past 7-10 years, dates and locations of international trips, contact information for people you have known for at least ten years, and medical records for any serious conditions you have suffered from., He will be your source of information and guidance through the process. Because of budget cutbacks, jobs are scarce and you will want to impress the recruiter by having all of your documents available. Know what jobs you are interested in and ask what current requirements for those positions are.You can find a local recruiter on The Air Force’s Recruiter Locator. Don’t drop by; call ahead of time and ask for an appointment. When you meet the recruiter, ask to schedule a follow-up meeting., Once the recruiter has explained the requirements for the positions you are interested in, begin preparing to meet those requirements. Find the “The Ultimate Basic Training Guidebook” and begin the regimen that it lays out to get in adequate physical shape. Research The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery and begin studying for the test.


Unfortunately, there are some things that you cannot prepare for. Prior medical conditions or a criminal background might reduce your chances of being recruited. However, you are more likely to succeed if you are honest and disclose this information to the recruiter., Your recruiter will schedule a trip to the MEPS to complete your enlistment. At the MEPS you will undergo a full battery of tests and background checks. Afterward you will be counseled about what careers are appropriate for you and, if you agree on a career path, make the Oath of Enlistment.


The MEPS will often be far away. The Air Force, however, will pay for transportation, meals, and a hotel.You will typically do a lot of waiting at MEPS. Bring a book to keep yourself entertained.
You should look presentable when you arrive at MEPS. Your clothes should also, however, be comfortable and warm. Do not wear a hat or anything with offensive statements., This test will determine what careers you have the mental qualifications for. It can be administered both on a computer or as a paper test. You should bring identification with you and study ahead of time. The test will often take multiple days.


For the paper test, you will have 11 minutes for General Science, 36 for Arithmetic Reasoning, 11 for Word Knowledge, 13 for Paragraph Comprehension, 24 for Mathematics Knowledge, 9 for Electronics Information, 11 for Auto and Shop Information, 19 for Mechanical Comprehension, and 15 for Assembling Objects. For the computerized test, the sections are the same, but time limits might vary slightly.Tell your recruiter if you took ASVAB in high school. If you did, you might not be required to take it again at MEPS., At the MEPS you will also be given a physical. This will determine if you have any disqualifying medical conditions. More generally, it will also determine what jobs you are in good enough physical condition for. You can begin a regimen of physical exercise to prepare for the physical, but the most important factor in the physical is whether you show signs of injury.The physical does not include any exercise, but it does test balance and flexibility. If you are overweight, your percent body fat will be measured.
The physical will measure your height, weight, hearing, and vision. Urine, blood tests, and drug tests will also be administered.
If you wear glasses or contacts, bring them with you to MEPS.
You should bring in medical records for any conditions that you might have. Additional, specialized tests might be administered if you have any medical conditions.Although you should try to come into your physical in decent shape, it is particularly imperative that you not be injured. Before arriving you should work out, but refrain from anything that might result in injury.
For both the physical and the ASVAB, requirements vary considerably depending upon the desired position and the Air Force’s need for people. Your recruiter is the best person to explain your requirements.

, After the tests are administered, a counselor will present you with a list of jobs that you are qualified for. Remember, even if you were found to be qualified for the job you wanted, you might find that the Air Force does not need anyone in that position. The counselor should be willing to explain why you are being offered certain jobs and what each of them entails., If you and your counselor agree on a job, you will raise your right hand and repeat the Oath of Enlistment. An officer will be present to administer the oath. You will then take the final step and sign your contract. Take pride in your accomplishment.

, Before you ship off make sure to play it safe. While you are in what is known as Delayed Entry Program (DEP), avoid legal trouble or injuries that could compromise your enlistment.Exercise regularly to prepare for basic training., You won't have a very good time in BMT if you upset your superiors. One of the many things you should have memorized before arriving the reporting statement that you will say to your military training instructor every time that he addresses you.


Your reporting statement is ""Sir/Ma'am, trainee (your last name) reports as ordered.
You only need to say ""Sir"" or ""Ma'am"" once in your statement. Don't make the mistake of throwing an extra one in at the end, like ""Ma'am, trainee Porter reports as ordered, Ma'am"", The best way to show your commitment to the Air Force is to know the culture like the back of your hand. The Air Force Song and the Airman's Creed will be recited throughout your time at BMT. Memorize these early on unless you want to be the one in the crowd who doesn't know what is going on., You should always know your place in the Air Force. Being flippant with a general is a mistake you won't live down anytime soon. Every rank has its own special insignia. Learn what rank each insignia means and know who is above you in rank., Before you become an airman, you need to know what it means to be an airman. The Air Force's core values embody what that means. Have these memorized:


""Integrity first/Service before self/Excellence in all we do."""
"
Talk to your child and understand why they want to go to war.,
Show your child how much you love them and would miss them if they left for war.,
Show your child war statistics.,
Ask veterans you know to share their experiences.,
Make sure that your child understands the operation of the military.,
Explain to your child that discipline in the military is absolute.,
Make sure they understand the commitment.,
Be supportive.",How to Convince Your Child Not to Go to War," Listen carefully to their reasons—you might learn something about your child that you did not know before. Make sure that they want to go to war in order to serve their country, and not to get away from something at home. If the reason they give is the latter, help them find a way to deal with their issues in a more constructive way.;
, Of course you should be showing them affection and gratitude throughout their lives, not just to stop them from enlisting, but emphasizing your emotions at this time may sway their decision.

, There is a very real but slight possibility that they may return deceased, disabled or with psychological problems. Make sure they understand the risks.


On the flipside, be fair about the benefits of military service. It can be a big career boost and teach valuable life and job skills. They will not find it difficult to find employment afterwards. Look at unemployment rates among veterans; they are staggeringly low.

, The best way for your child to make up their mind is to talk with an active duty service member and learn the truth from someone who knows it firsthand. An anti-war protester will paint a biased picture, as will a war supporter who has never been out in the battlefield themselves. Have your child talk to someone who is already serving, who you know will be completely honest about what they have gone through.

, Once a person joins the armed forces, they are not allowed to choose which wars they fight. They are obligated to serve their nation without question until they are discharged.


Additionally, there is no set schedule of the hours your child will work. On average, service members in combat arms jobs work from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. While deployed, the military tries not to overstretch their work-load but when overseas, a service member typically works an average 9-12 hour day. While deployed, service members work through holidays and weekends. However, military salary is very sufficient. On average, a service member earns about 20% more than their civilian peers when you factor in all the extras.

, The most common form of punishment is a ""smoke session"" and being yelled at, where the offending service member does intense physical exercise for a brief amount of time to remember not to make the mistake again.

, Your child must know is that someone who joins the military cannot simply resign, on account of contractual obligations. The military invests a great deal of time and money into training each recruit. If your child decides that the military is not for them, help and support them to finish their current enlistment period.


Recruits whose enlistment periods are cut short are not role models for your child; they are typically drug addicts or they go AWOL (absent without leave). The military does not tolerate drugs or people who cannot fulfill their contracts honorably. If your child has recently struggled with substance abuse or other serious personal problems, make clear to them that they are not suitable for the army's standards of conduct.

, If you have tried everything and your child is still determined to join the armed forces, let them know that you love them and support them. Remember that at the end of the day, they are a legal adult and joining the armed forces is their decision. A parent also needs to realize that joining the military is not a death sentence; few members are in combat, even fewer see death or kill someone themselves. It will not be helpful for either you or your child to become estranged before they leave, so spend as much time together as you can before they are deployed.

Consider a post-trial appeal.",How to Face a Court Martial," A court martial is a type of trial for criminal misconduct defined in the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).The key difference is the inherent authority of the court, called jurisdiction. There are three areas where the military justice system is different than its civilian counterpart.


The UCMJ only applies to military personnel, members of designated quasi-military support services, military prisoners, prisoners of war, and very limited categories of civilians. This jurisdiction applies whether the accused is active duty, reserved, or retired. National Guard personnel are not covered by the UCMJ unless the units are performing active duty.Unlike civilian court, where you have to be inside the state or federal district, the UCMJ applies to criminal conduct that happens wherever in the world that you may be deployed.
The UCMJ is a compilation of criminal laws. Most of the laws you might see in the state or federal courts are included. However, there are additional crimes that are purely military in nature and can be punished through a court martial, such as mutiny, sedition, failure to obey an order, insubordination, and misconduct as a prisoner.Military law runs concurrent with civilian law. In a crime that is covered by equivalent state, federal, and military laws, the prosecutors can decide which court you will appear in. Additionally, the rules of double jeopardy are different. If you are convicted in a military court, you can still be tried again in state court for the same offense.;
, While the common term ""court martial"" is used for all military prosecutions, there are three different types of legal actions. Like civilian courts, there are levels of seriousness, depending on the nature of the accusation.


A summary court martial is often used for minor charges against enlisted personnel. The fact-finder can be any commissioned officer qualified to determine the guilt or innocence and render an appropriate punishment. Except for the Air Force, the accused is not entitled to appointed representation, but may hire a civilian attorney.A special court martial is the second level of military courts, roughly equal to a civilian misdemeanor court. The court panel is generally six officers (although the accused can ask that two be enlisted personnel) acting as military judge, prosecutor, appointed or retained defense counsel, and a panel of three jurors. The accused can also waive the jurors and face trial in front of the judge alone.The most serious is the general court martial. In the civilian world, this would be the district court where felonies are heard. Along with the military judge, there is a prosecutor, appointed or retained defense counsel, and a panel of five jurors. On request, the court panel can be up to one-third enlisted personnel., Depending on the type of court martial, penalties range from confinement in a military facility for up to 30 days and loss of pay grade for a summary court martial to the death penalty in a general court martial.


Additionally, a general court martial may reimpose sentences of confinement of over one year, hard labor, loss of pay and pay grades., If you are active duty and subject to a court martial, you will be notified of the charges against you by your immediate commanding officer. Regardless of your duty status, you will also be served with a written copy detailing the charges against you., In a special or general court martial, you have the right to have military counsel appointed to defend you at no charge to you. For all levels of court martial, you always have the right to retain the lawyer of your choice.Unlike civilian courts, you do have the right to request to be represented by a specific lawyer. If she is available, she will be appointed to your case.
A military lawyer will be more experienced and comfortable with military protocol and procedure and can make the most of your case when it is being conducted in front of a board of officers. A member of JAG is almost more familiar with the effect of different penalties on your career, such as loss of pay grade or rank, and craft a plea agreement that gives you the best outcome.
A civilian lawyer is likely to have more trial experience in examining and cross-examining witnesses and arguing the weight of the evidence. If you have the resources to hire a civilian lawyer, look for one with experience in court martial procedures.

, If you are facing a special or general court martial, you should discuss the idea of a Chapter 10 discharge with your lawyer. This would be a type of plea bargain where you would leave active duty rather than face a more punitive sentence. If a Chapter 10 discharge is a possibility, you must discuss it with a lawyer, appointed or retained, to comprehend the effect on your return to civilian life.


In a Chapter 10 discharge, you will be required to admit guilt to at least one of the charges against you. This admission bars further prosecution in federal court, but not in state court.
A discharge under this chapter will most likely be ""other than honorable."" This will bar you from future civilian educational benefits and veterans benefits.
Depending on where you are deployed, a less than honorable discharge can have financial and administrative consequences that can complicate your leaving the military.
You will be barred from reenlistment in the armed forces of the United States.

, If you decide to move forward with the court martial, you must be fully honest and cooperative with your attorney. Any discussions you have with your lawyer, even in a military setting, are covered by the attorney-client privilege and are totally confidential. You must disclose everything you know, including potential witnesses or location of evidence that may support your case. You should tell your lawyer everything, even if it implicates a senior or commanding officer. Without total honesty, your lawyer can't make the best case on your behalf., Originally, the UCMJ did not allow for plea agreements. However, Rule 705 of the Manual for Courts-Martial allows for a written pre-trial agreement that could result in dismissal of some or all charges in exchange for acceptance of an agreed punishment.Like civilian courts, a pre-trial agreement avoids a trial and gives you a known punishment. Your attorney will negotiate with the prosecutor and other governmental representatives. No pre-trial agreement is valid unless you agree to it in writing.

, Military proceedings are more formal than civilian courts and you should take extra care with your appearance. Active duty personnel should wear Class A uniforms. In forward deployed areas, the judge has the discretion to allow local field uniforms. Retired or non-active duty litigants should dress neatly and professionally.A summary court martial may be held in your commander's office or conference room. In this situation, a neat and fresh duty uniform is appropriate attire unless you are instructed to dress otherwise.

, Military courts usually do not have the long dockets of civilian courts and your case will be called exactly on time. You should arrive early to confer with your attorney. Additionally, if your case is called and your are not present, the court may issue a warrant for your arrest.

, A military court is equivalent to a federal court and the atmosphere will be very formal. Do not bring food or drink to the court (water may be supplied). No tobacco products or gum is allowed. You will not be allowed to record or take photos during the trial.


Do not react during trial testimony. Do not gesture, roll your eyes, or make any noises. You may take notes and direct them to your attorney.
Turn off your cell phone or tablet. If possible, leave it in your vehicle or quarters.
Even if your military job classification allows or requires you to carry firearms, do not bring your weapon to court.
Stand when you address the court and refer to the judge as ""Your Honor."" Do not directly address anyone else in the court unless instructed by your lawyer.

, This is a strategy discussion between you and your attorney. In a special or general court martial, you have the right not to testify and cannot be compelled to testify, even by a superior officer.


If you do testify, you will be subject to cross examination by the prosecutor.
In a summary court martial, you will be expected to answer the presiding officer's questions and present your own side of the story.

, Like a civilian trial, either the judge or the trial panel will deliberate and come to a decision. The judge or trial panel will complete a findings and sentencing worksheet and the results will be announced in open court., You have the right to appeal any decision and sentence of a special or general court martial. Generally, your sentence is first reviewed by the command authority. The second level of appeal is one of the intermediate courts. There is one for each branch of the military.


In certain circumstances, including death penalty cases, the Judge Advocate General can refer a case to the civilian appellate court and ultimately to the Supreme Court.
Appealing a case decided under the UCMJ is very precise and complicated and should not be done without the assistance of experienced legal counsel.

Fiverr.com offers small projects that pay five dollars each.
Flexjobs.com and Freelancer.com both offer data entry projects that you can do from home that pay a varying rate.;
, There are many scams online that try to take advantage of people that are looking for work that they can do from home. Make sure that you confirm that the company you do work for is legitimate, as you will probably need to provide them with personal information in order to receive payments.It's important that you research companies to make sure that they are not part of a scam.

Look up the company on the Better Business Bureau's website to see if it is legitimate at www.bbb.org.
Websites like ConsumerFraudReporting.org can also help you identify potential scams.

, While websites that offer projects to freelancers can be a great way to supplement your income, it can be difficult to earn a living through them, and even more difficult to secure benefits. You may want to seek a full time position with a company that permits you to do the data entry from home.


Use websites like Monster.com and Indeed.com to look for data entry positions that allow the employee to telecommute.
Websites like Craigslist.org can be a great resource, but be aware of how to avoid scams on Craigslist.


, Social media platforms like LinkedIn can be a great way to look for open positions as well as to network with people already working the field you want to find a position in. Make sure to include the terms “telecommute” or “work from home” in your search.


Start by creating a LinkedIn Account.
Search for open positions and reach out to others in the field you are interested in to help you identify open data entry positions that you may be able to apply for.

, A phone screening is often the first stage of the interview process. A human resources professional will contact you to conduct a brief interview over the phone to determine if you meet the requirements to be interviewed by a hiring manager. Treat a phone screening like any other interview: don’t be late for the call, be courteous and professional, and speak to your strengths as a data entry employee as well as your ability to work without direct supervision.
Make sure to put your best foot forward when conducting a phone screening.


, If you do well on the phone screening, you will likely receive a call to schedule a follow up interview. Because you will be working from home, there is a likelihood that you may need to conduct the interview through a teleconferencing website that allows you to see and speak to your interviewer from the comfort of your own home.


Although you may be conducting the interview from home, treat it as though it is an in person interview regarding what to wear and how to interact. Follow the common practices necessary to do well in a job interview.

You may also be required to conduct the interview in person. Be sure that you arrive on time and with a few copies of your résumé.

, The software and hardware required to do data entry from home may vary based on the company you work for and the type of data entry you are doing. Before you can begin working, ensure that your work space and computer are prepared for the task.


Install any necessary software you may need to complete your data entry tasks. Many companies may use web portals instead of software on your computer, so ensure you have the necessary login information and receive training on how to properly use it.
You may need to create a PayPal account or establish a different method of receiving payment from your employer like direct deposit. Make sure you speak to your supervisor or manager about how payments are made and what you need to do in order to receive them.
Make sure you have a telephone, printer or any other devices that are required to complete your data entry work.

, Working from home has a number of perks, one of them being that you may be able to set your own schedule. Although this offers a significant amount of freedom, it can also make it difficult to get yourself going in the morning.Set a start time to begin working every morning to avoid procrastinating.
Set a time that you finish work each day. It may be tempting to work longer hours than necessary when working from home because you never really leave your place of work, but it’s important that you allow yourself time to rest and take care your obligations at home.

, Although it’s important that you stick to a schedule, it’s equally important that you allow yourself breaks when you need them. The freedom provided by working from home allows you to take breaks when necessary.In most work environments, you get two fifteen minute breaks and a thirty-minute break per eight-hour work day. Try providing yourself breaks in a similar fashion.
Breaks are important to keeping you refreshed and to stave off fatigue. You will likely be more productive during working hours if you take breaks.

, It may be tempting to knock out some housework or take care of your children during working hours because you’re home. It’s a bad habit to get into, as it can dramatically reduce your productivity during your work day, as well as add to your stress by feeling as though you should be doing both professional and housework in the same amount of time.Treat your working hours as though you are in the office; you need to devote yourself to your work while “at” work.
Consider using daycare or a babysitter for your children if you have any so you can focus on getting your work done.

, It’s important that your management knows that you are staying on task and being productive. In most office environments, you will see your supervisor or manager regularly throughout the day, so when working from home make sure you keep open lines of communication with them throughout your work day.If you communicate via e-mail, make sure to keep your e-mail window or software open so you can be aware when receiving communications from your management.
If you miss a call or message from your supervisor, make sure to get back to them as quickly as you can.

, Data entry, like any job, has specific requirements that you will need to meet in order to be considered for the position. Before you can locate a data entry position to apply to, you’ll need to ensure you have the appropriate skill set.Data entry requires the ability to type quickly and accurately.
Basic computer skills are a requirement for all telecommuting data entry jobs.
It is often expected that you have experience working with word processing, database or presentation software like PowerPoint to be considered for data entry positions.

, Working from home requires that you are able to keep yourself well organized and on track. The best way to do so is to create an office space in your home that you use for nothing else other than work.Your office space should permit you enough room to keep all of your work related materials in one place and well organized.
It helps if your office space provides you privacy from distractions or interruptions.

, Applying for data entry positions that allow you to work from home still requires a professional looking résumé. Your résumé is often what makes the difference between getting to the next level of the interview process or not.


Ensure that you highlight the skills required for data entry on your résumé.
Ensure that your résumé is well organized and looks professional.

, Working from home usually requires that you provide the equipment necessary to do the job. Depending on the nature of the position you apply for, the equipment requirements may vary, but the common requirements are as follows: A reliable computer with access to a high speed internet connection.
A dedicated telephone line that you can use for work specific phone calls.
An office software suite such as Microsoft Office or Apache Open Office.

Understand the reason for the opposition.,
Decide if the opposition is worth answering.,
Decide how to explain your enlistment, if necessary.",How to Deal With Opposition to Joining the Military," Your parents may have a knee-jerk reaction due to fear for your safety. War is dangerous and violent, and no parent wants to see their child harmed. Friends may feel abandoned by you, or react out of jealousy. The military, while tough and demanding, also has many rewards and opportunities that are not found in the civilian world. Teachers may be opposed to their students joining the military, preferring them to go to college right away after high school, regardless if they have the means to pay for college or not. Other people may react in a very negative way due to pure bigotry. To some people, the military represents various things that they may hate; from Government authority to violence and war. As a representative of that, you may become the target of their anger.;
, If the person opposed to your decision is family or a friend, then it is probably worth while to try to explain your decision and calm their fears or reassure them that their opposition is not justified. If a teacher is opposed to you joining the military, or is known for having anti-military sentiments, you may be able to avoid bringing up an enlistment. If the person is a total stranger then chances are, a confrontation is not worth it.

, There are many reasons for joining the military; from service to country to college money or a desire to face a challenge and experience adventure. Point out the benefits and positives. If the violence and danger of war are brought up, point out that the U.S. Military is the best trained and armed military in the world and you will be surrounded by the best of the best to have your back. If poor military pay is brought up, point out the health care and educational benefits that offset this. If the long work hours and heavy work load are brought up, point out that many people find overcoming such challenges to be extremely rewarding. If you are female and you are told that the military is rampant with sexual harassment and assaults, point out that the military also has tougher punishments than any civilian job for that sort of behavior.

Consider all different branches and their benefits.,
Consider the different experiences you'll get in each branch.,
Think about your future.,
Consider your spouse.,
Join as an officer if you can.,
Take the Oath of Enlistment.,
Start your career.",How to Choose a Military Service," Not all are the same, but there are some benefits in common between all branches. To decide whether the military path is right for you, consider some of the benefits:



Family life. It may surprise you, but the Military allows for a balance between work and personal life. In fact, service members enjoy many opportunities to relax with their friends and family, including 30 days of paid vacation a year.

Housing. Many factors come into play when determining housing for a military service member. Some of these include where a service member is stationed, whether they’re an active-duty member, Guardsmen or reservist and if they have a spouse or kids. Plus, qualified service members can live off base in civilian neighborhoods using an allowance they receive for housing. Housing on base is also included as a part of your compensation package. If you are married and on-base housing is not available, or you would like to live off base, a tax-free monthly housing allowance will be provided. The military also pays all travel and expenses for required moves.

Other Benefits. Beyond their salary, service members enjoy an exceptional quality of life while serving. Benefits include:

Educational benefits - GI Bill, tuition assistance, service member opportunity colleges, education on duty, etc.
Advanced technical and specialty training
cash bonuses
Tax-free housing and food allowances, or free room and board
30 days of vacation per year
Space A travel - Free flights between bases
Substantial discounts and deals throughout the private sector
World travel
Health and dental care for you and your family
Special deals on home loans
Pension
Being part of a larger family with a proud history - the military tradition
The pride and honor of serving your country

;
, There are differences between the branches. Talk to representatives from all of them to understand which would suit you best, and consider some of the following distinctions:


Army and Marine Core - These services tend to be very ""hurrah and gung ho""... but the majority do their time, and come out without any applicable skills (they have to go to school after). Plus, some feel they are treated like a child that must have his hand held. If you want to be a warrior only, this is the place for you.
Air Force and Navy - These are very technical branches. They teach you skills you can use immediately after your time is served. The Air Force especially, gives you 50%-75% of an Associates Degree just for the training you receive (you must finish it on your own....but it's free). Plus, you are treated like an adult; they won't constantly hold your hand. It's up to you to stand tall among your peers. They merely offer guidance.
The Air Force has more Special Forces Teams than the Army, if you still want to go full ""hurrah"" and maintain a very high standard of living. (PJ,Combat Control, SERE, TACTICAL AIR PATROL, EOD).But be warned, these fields have a high wash-out rate.... it's not easy.
The Air Force is the most family friendly of all branches. They even allow you to live on base with your family while you are in Technical School (AIT for Army).

, Most people join the Military for one of four reasons: Because they have limited options for work and want something new, because of family tradition, to pay for education and get a boost in their careers, or to prove something to themselves or others. Whatever the reason, it often comes down to a future for yourself and future family. So if you do go in... don't jump into the first ""bullets, blood and guts"" job you find. It may be the macho thing to do, but you can still be all that and choose a job that has marketability in the civilian sector (ie. a technical job).

, For those with spouses, they can respect the fact that you are doing this to secure your future together. Plus, military spouses get free education and preferential job placement (at least in the Air Force). More than likely, they could easily get a job working at the hospital or at some other function on base serving our service members

, Joining as an officer is different as opposed to joining as an enlisted personnel. For one, a minimum of a Bachelor's degree is required, but your degree must also match up to current military job requirements. For example, most people get a business or accounting degree in college. Those particular degrees are not highly sought after in the military. A better choice would be an engineering degree, aeronautics or something similar. After you pass a background check (must be clean, no arrests/drug abuse etc) and your physical, you will have to go through officer training school. Officer training school is different for all services, but the average cutoff age is 29. Another option would be for you to sign up for college under the ROTC program.

, Before you sign up and join, there are a few things you will have to go through first.



1. Drug test and tattoo check. Every service has a different standard for tattoos, but all have the same drug policy. No drugs, if you test positive its over. No chance of joining.

2. Physical (MEPS). You will be taken through the Military Entrance Processing center, where they will evaluate your current and past physical and mental condition. If you have any history of depression, self-harm, Suicidal tendencies or have had major surgeries, you will be disqualified on the spot.

3. ASVAB. You will be required to take a test so they can accurately gauge what skill-set you fit best into. The higher you score, the more jobs you are qualified for.

4. Basic training. Just because you are in basic training, doesn't mean you are totally in yet. They will teach you military standards and practices specific to your branch. You will also be required to meet the physical Fitness standards required. If you can't make it, you will be sent home. Basic training is meant to shock you so they can mold you into the perfect soldier, sailor, marine or airman. Once you move on from basic, everything is much different and not at all like basic training.

, You will be shipped to the location of your first tech (or AIT) school where you will be trained on the basics of your new job. All training has different time constraints and locations. After you graduate that, you will be shipped to your first duty station, where you will continue to serve and advance in rank during your career.

Many follow this with a bachelor's degree, or even a master's, or engage in other kinds of continuing education that can prove extremely useful at any stage in a medical billing and coding career.


Programs that specialize in billing and coding focus on developing skill sets beneficial to the positions. Areas of study include: medical terminology and anatomy, medical billing software, medical documentation evaluation, government programs, basic math, keyboard and computer skills, and other administrative duties.Programs also seek to develop traits in students necessary for success in the field, such as efficiency and precision while processing and entering large amounts of data.
You can find a list of accredited programs from the Commission of Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education
;
, In addition to taking classes from accredited educational institutions, certifications are available in the medical billing and coding field as well. Institutions such as the American Academy of Professional Coders offer both credential training and certification., Many in the medical billing and coding field may have started in scheduling or elsewhere in a medical office and gained on-the-job experience. Some doctors’ offices may allow appropriate former experience instead while others will not.

, Stay current with the most recent methods and standards available in the field via workshops, conferences, and continuous practice.

, Universal coding practices like the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 or ICD-10) contain thousands upon thousands of codes that professionals needs to be able to work with quickly and efficiently.Current Procedural Terminology—CPT—is another set of codes in which all professionals in the field must be fluent, Understand the uses of forms such as HCFA billing documents, explanation of benefits documents, and other sorts of documents involved in medical billing and coding. This knowledge will also help you advance your career in this field.

, Most of those who end up working from home in medical billing began with a more conventional job in a medical office. Starting out in a medical office helps you prove that you have the ability to work on site and that you can handle the full responsibilities of the field.


Once on the job, a medical coder can expect to spend time assessing and coding data. Medical coders do not interact with insurance companies or patients very often. Every duty performed in a medical office has a particular code assigned to it, and each one needs to be coded properly for billing purposes.The coder will convert medical charts and records into billable code and enter the data into a coding software program that will also be used by a medical biller.
If you think medical billing is more your speed, this position entails making sure everyone is being billed correctly. This often involves speaking with patients and health insurance companies to ensure all invoices are paid on time. Medical billers should still understand coding language to efficiently read medical invoices. The position is perfect for someone who wants to have a balance of working with people--though mostly on the phone--and also spending time assessing invoices and data., Completing your education and certification give you a great leg up in the field, but refining best practices, learning new methods, and constantly evolving with the industry are necessary in the field of medical billing and coding since the field has to keep pace with the ever-changing world of medical supplies and procedures.

, While working on site and being in contact with medical professionals, do as much networking as possible. Some of the most successful home medical billers and coders perform the duties as independent contractors, so networking early on helps landing as many of those contracts as possible later, One of the first steps for those who are already working in a medical office of medical billing and coding and want to work at home is to inquire about any available choices that the employer grants to long-term workers. Ask about a time frame for arranging work-from-home opportunities, or what sorts of situations would allow you to work at home.

, Individuals who show themselves to be capable, reliable, and independent self-starters will eventually earn the autonomy necessary to propose working from home.


Over time, you may shift your office job into a work-at-home role by carefully negotiating with management or making job changes within your chosen career field.

, If a current employer will not allow you to work from home, it's possible that others will. Many medical billing and coding professionals need to pursue additional opportunities while working a job in order to keep earning income while finding work-at-home options.

, If you can't find medical billing and coding jobs from home, you may be able to use the above qualifications and expertise to start your own medical billing and coding business. You'll need to figure out how to deal with legislation like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other industry-specific requirements. But if you have the ability to start a business, as well as competence in medical billing and coding, you could find that self-employment is a better option for a work-at-home career.

, Whether your employer allows you to work from home or you start your own business, you will need to create an appropriate home space to complete the work. In order to set up a work-life boundary for a home office, it’s best to use a spare bedroom or some other dedicated space. Being able to compartmentalize these spaces at home increases productivity and cuts down on distractions.

, Since the job heavily entails translating a patient’s records with a provider into billable language for insurance companies, you must still be able to connect to a medical office to access their records. Luckily, nearly all doctors have moved to digitizing this information. The doctor’s office with which you work or are contracted will have specific network settings to share in order to ensure that you have access to the proper records and materials.


The home computer from which you work will need the appropriate medical billing software as well. Certain area doctors or insurance companies may be specific about the software they want you to use.
You will also still need access to a phone line that you can use for work-related purposes. Medical billers especially need to be able to contact patients as well as insurance companies directly to follow up on the status of invoices.
Since even the most proficient medical coder cannot memorize the thousands upon thousands of medical billing codes, reference materials should always be kept on hand. Additionally, some medical billing software may have integrated look-up tools to help assist with the reference process., One of the biggest additional responsibilities when working in the field from home is obeying the statutes of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The law includes the confidential handling of patient information, so it necessitates always working with patient records and personal information from secured connections."

Avoid scams.,
Identify reputable sources for at-home jobs.,
Think outside of the box.,
Learn how to package yourself.Think about the skills one needs to work at home.",How to Work from Home1," Oftentimes, when you see an ad that says “Earn thousands of dollars from your comfy couch,” “Want to work in your pajamas?,” or “Set your own hours working at-home,” you automatically assume it is a scam, right? If it seems too good to be true, then it probably is. Yet, with the growth of the digital and global marketplace, more and more companies are trying to hire at-home help. Learn how to distinguish between reputable job ads and scams.


Scams normally ask for a lot of personal information up front. Many people are desperate for jobs these days. The hope of future employment can make you vulnerable to scam artists. Don’t give up your personal information like your social security number, birthdate, or bank information until you have actually signed and thoroughly read a contract.
Many scams also ask you to invest money up front, pay for “certification” in their program, or complete a certain amount of work for free during a “training” period. Don’t fork over your money ahead of time without a signed guarantee of return payment. If it really is a scam, they’ll take your money or benefit from your time and then just abandon you.;
, Many online news sourcesand career-building websitescompile lists of reputable at-home job sources. These websites can be found through basic internet searches. Just be sure to avoid websites for services you’ve never heard of before.

, Many businesses in your local area might be open to at-home positions and not know it. Jobs that require a lot of typing or editing can be great work for at-home workers. Think about becoming a medical or legal transcriptionist.


Similarly, positions that require help with schedules, like personal assistants, can be done online and over the phone. Pay for virtual assistants can range from $15 an hour to over $100 an hour.Do you speak more than one language? Many websites build content in multiple languages and look for people who can edit their multilingual content.
Do you have great people skills and know a lot about traveling? Consider being a travel agent from the comfort of your own home. Many booking companies hire at-home workers to answer phone calls and work with customers online.Think beyond traditional typing and communication. Some companies are hiring at-home workers to test recipes for cookbooks and cooking shows. Others want people to create online visual content such as short videos on exercising properly, car maintenance, or gardening. In short, think about what you accomplish at home on a regular basis, then consider what companies could benefit from these activities. , Just like with any job, when talking to a potential employer emphasize those skills outlined in the job ad. Then focus on what makes an efficient employee who works from home. Emphasize organization skills and what elements of your home lend themselves to occupational success. Do you have dedicated space to work from home? Do you have a phone and internet access?

"
Create a dedicated work environment.,
Make organization a top priority.,
Plan out your day.,
Regiment your time.,
Get into a routine.,
Don’t check your social media.",How to Work from Home2," Choose an area in your home that has good natural light and is well ventilated. Working in the basement or a closet will really start to close in on you after a few hours at work and will not encourage you to ‘go to work’ each day.


Think about the furniture in the space too. A desk and chair are essential. Although you may not be in an office environment, you are still doing an income producing activity and therefore you should set yourself up as professionally as possible. Working at the dining room table is a viable option if you do not have a separate study or office area in your home, so long as you are preparing your work area daily and it’s not cluttered with household items., Getting organized is the first step to a really productive day. The main steps are decluttering, strategically organizing forms and information, and maintaining that organization. First, get rid of anything you don't need while you're at work. Knick knacks and family photos are ok, but anything else should be put in another room. You need to create a clean space free of distractions. Second, determine what forms or information (e.g. business cards, standard forms, email lists, payroll logs, or data reports) you need to have readily available. Purchase folders and place each kind of information in the same place. This way you'll know where to find it in the future. Third, at the end of everyday, do some basic maintenance to your organization system. Make sure all forms are put away properly. This way when you arrive in the morning, you won't be confronted with a mess.Arrange your work area with all the ""office"" tools you need (e.g. printer, PC/laptop, stationery). A carafe of water, phone chargers, and a great filing system are other essential things you'll need., Make to-do lists with the most important tasks at the top. As the day progresses, you’ll have fewer and perhaps easier tasks to complete. It will keep you motivated during the day.


In your day planner/diary, write down all the things that need to be done – everything from doing the laundry to making those important calls. Block out times for them as accurately as possible. Try a weekly/monthly planner to see your tasks at a glance. Alternatively, you can put a number next to each task in order of importance. For example, the top priorities of the day would get a number 1, the lowest priorities would get a number 5. This will assist you in ensuring you have great time management and are productive., Decide what your office hours are and stick to them. Take into account your household chores, kids (if you have any), personal commitments, and plan your office hours accordingly. Your business/work-from-home job is your main priority, so make sure you set your office hours and commit to working within this time frame. It's best to keep your office hours as consistent as possible., The sooner you get into your routine, the better and more productive you will become. Work at times when you have the most energy. Work everyday at those times.You will be surprised at how your creativity and concentration increases after having set specific working hours and routines when you need it most, and in the evenings when it is time to wind down, your mind will be more relaxed.

, Social media in the workplace can be a big time-waster. Not only does it take time to post, chat, and tag, it also disrupts your work flow. You'll find yourself stopping and starting repeatedly.If you have problems with this, there are various software programs that will block access to such sites. Look up programs like Freedom and Anti-Social."
"
Dress for success.,
Conduct yourself professionally.,
Leave the household chores alone.",How to Work from Home3," Working from home has many benefits. You may be tempted to wear your pajamas everyday. Resist it. Check your emails with a cup of coffee first thing in the morning, but when your work day begins you should be dressed appropriately. It's all the about how you feel. Think about how different you feel in the evenings when you are in your comfy PJ’s – relaxed and winding down. This is not the mindset you would want to project on the phone when speaking to clients or bosses. Keep it professional all round and your results will reflect your professionalism.

, You will be dealing with the professional world. You will report to bosses and communicate with fellow employees. Conduct yourself with professional decorum during these interactions. Avoid inappropriate jokes. Be polite. Be congenial., You wouldn't do house chores, while you were at work elsewhere. Don't do them while working at home either. This is something that will take practice, but avoid all the home distractions as best you can. If there are home chores that need to be attended to, prioritize them. Sure, if it's raining outside and all your windows are open, you may want to attend to that right away, but generally everything else can wait. Watching an episode of your favorite TV show or taking your suit to the dry cleaners is not going to put money in your account.

"
"
Leave your home for extended periods of time.,
Get moving.,
Give yourself a break during work.",How to Work from Home4," Make a point of getting out of your house during non-work hours. Don’t spend your entire day — working and not working — at home. Eventually, you will get sick of simply being in your home. Get out periodically. Go to restaurants, movie theaters, shopping centers, sporting events, local concerts, and anything else that takes place outside your home.


Even consider working from a different location. Work at a family member's home. Work at a coffee shop with minimal distractions. Work at the park., Join a gym. Exercise is important for your physical and mental health. Sitting at your work area for hours a day will eventually lead to fatigue, lack of motivation, and disinterest.Studies show that brief workouts in the middle of a work day actually raise productivity. Researchers argue that dopamine releases during workouts, which carry on for a period following a workout, giving your muscles a chance to recuperate. This dopamine puts you in a better mood overall., Yes, you are working from home, but you are entitled to a break.


Walk away from your computer a couple of times during your work day – stroll around the garden, take a walk around the block, whatever feels most relaxing to you. Some fresh air will do you a world of good and refresh your mind. If possible, avoid watching TV or getting sucked into a hobby as this is a very easy way to lose track of time.

, The collaboration with the other half is always desirable. It constitutes the engagement that is called “marriage”. However, it is not always obvious. Discussing, or even lead to an establishment of special shifts between the two spouses will help.

, Even if it sounds tough, is the most common method to people who are involved with deadlines. Make a coffee (not very strong), say ""Goodnight"" to your children and instead of turning on the TV or the DVD player, turn on your computer. Even if you do not have the courage for intensive work, you can make certain drafts for the next day or to clean up some e-mails.

, This is certainly easier when there are at least two people to do so. Table games (that are not usually noisy), perhaps even games in the computer are the solution. Avoid the easy alternative solution with the DVDs.

, They probably believe, that each time they play, they have to play pillow fight, or games which require body skills. This is good, but it can also end up hazardous. Explain to them how much they should love each other. If this doesn't work, then you can create an ""award"" for the most quiet kid. That should do because people are born to be competitive.

, You probably know that already, and you love it. However, this is not a permanent solution. The grandmothers and the grandfathers are good and overindulge the grandchildren, but they are not responsible for their behavior. Keep this solution for a very important project that should be delivered immediately.

, Your nerves are in knots and the willingness of your children to do their homework or play quietly, is minimal. Then being in an environment of adults, probably helps. A disadvantage is that you should definitely have someone to babysit.

, That sounds so pleasant and pedagogic. Tell them to go to the garden or to the balcony or anywhere. Learn about the facilities of your town and entertain them. Do you feel bad as a parent? You shouldn't. Remember all these times that you wished to go out to play games with your friends and you didn't have the time. At least, learn to your children to have fun!

, They will probably still interrupt you occasionally, but it should keep them relatively busy for short periods of time while you get work done.

, If you are able to afford a nanny (even if you are still at home) then certainly go ahead. The nanny will have the chance and the skills to engage your children with other activities , rather than playing with your computer.

, You tried everything, but uselessly, your kids won't behave and you are exhausted. Deal with them. Read their beloved fairytale for the 189th time, buy them ice-creams and chips, and do whatever they want. In this way, they will feel appreciated and they won't be in the mood to destroy another day of yours.

, When you're working, you're working and keep to a schedule as best you can. Do take time out to play with the kids, even if it's just five minutes to get them started on something. But make sure you're either working or playing, not both at the same time, or nothing will get done.

, If you get pulled away from your work by your kids, it'll be easier to get back to what you were doing when they're done with you.

,How to Make a Resume1,
"
Format your text.,
Set up the page.,
Create your heading.,
Decide on a layout.",How to Make a Resume2," The first thing that a possible employer will see on your resume is the text. For that reason, it is very important that you make the right first impression. Choose a professional font in size 11 or 12. Times New Roman is the classic serif font, while Arial and Calibri are two of the better choices for sans-serif. Even though sans serif fonts are more popular for resume, Yahoo cites Helvetica as the best font to use for your resumé.


Many individuals find that Times New Roman is a little hard to read on a screen. If you are emailing your resume, consider using Georgia instead for a more readable serif font.
You can use multiple fonts for different parts of your resume, but try to limit it to two. Instead of changing between fonts, try emboldening or italicizing specific selections of text instead.
The font size for your header and the introduction to a section may 14 or 16, but otherwise, you should choose 11 or 12.
Your text should always be printed in solid black ink. Make sure to deactivate any hyperlinks (like to your email, address, and phone number) so that they don’t print in blue or another non-black color.

, Your page should have one-inch margins all the way around with 1.5 or 2 point line spacing. The body of your resume will be aligned to the left and your header should be centered at the top of your page.

, This is the section at the top of your resume which gives your contact information including your name, address, email, and phone number. Your name should be in a slightly larger size - either 14 or 16 point font. List your home and cell phone numbers.

, There are three general formats for creating a resume: chronological, functional, or combination. Your work history and the type of job you are applying for will determine the layout style you should use.


Chronological resumes are used for showing a steady growth in a particular career field. These are best used for someone applying for a job within their career-path to show an increase of responsibility over time.
Functional resumes are focused on skills and experience rather than job history. These are best used for someone who may have holes in their work history or who have gained experience from being self-employed for a time.
Combination resumes are, as it sounds, a combination of both a chronological and a functional resume. These are used to show off specific skills and how they were acquired. If you have developed a specific skill set from working in a variety of related fields, then this is the best resume option for you.

"
"
List your employment history.,
Provide your education history.,
Give special qualifications or skills.,
Provide your references.",How to Make a Resume3," As this is a chronological resume, your jobs should be listed in reverse chronological order with your most recent employment first. Include the name of the company, its location, your title, your duties and responsibilities while working there, and the dates that you were employed there.


It may be beneficial to list your title first, to show off your position in each job. You can also choose to list the company name first. Regardless of what you choose, be consistent down your entire list.
For each listing, write a “major achievements” or “accomplishments” section with a brief description of something important that you accomplished for that job.

, Same as with your jobs, you should list all of your education in chronological order with your most recent schooling first. Include any college degrees, trade schools, or apprenticeships you might have participated in. If you graduated with a degree, list the name of the degree as well as the year you received it. If you have not yet graduated, simply state the years you have attended the program as well as an expected graduation date.


For each listing, give the university/program name, their address, and your degree or area of study.
If you had a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher, be sure to list it along with your school/degree information.

, Once you’ve listed the most important information - your work experience and education - you can essentially choose to list anything else you find important. Create a section titled “Special Skills” or “Unique Qualifications” with a list of these things.


If you are fluent in more than one language, list the multiple languages here. Be sure to make note of your level of knowledge - for example, beginner, intermediate, novice, advanced, fluent, etc.
If you are well versed in a special area of work that other applicants might not be - such as computer programming - be sure to include your level of expertise here.

, You will need to provide 2-4 professional references (people who aren't family or friends)with their name, relationship to you, and contact information including their phone number, address, and email.


The best references to use are a manager or superior to you in your work, or perhaps a college professor whose class you did well in.
The place you are applying to may contact these people, so always call them in advance to let them know that you are using them for a reference and are currently applying for a job.

Detail your education history.,
Provide your awards and achievements.,
Note your special skills.,
List your employment history.,
List volunteer experience.,
Give your references.",How to Make a Resume4," Just like you do with jobs, you should list your education in reverse chronological order with your most recent schooling first. Include any college degrees, trade schools, or apprenticeships you might have participated in. If you graduated with a degree, list the name of the degree as well as the year you received it. If you have not yet graduated, simply state the years you have attended the program as well as an expected graduation date.


For each listing, give the university/program name, their address, and your degree or area of study.
If you had a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher, be sure to list it along with your school/degree information.

, If you were ever given a special award or recognition, list it here with the name, date, and purpose of the award. A common thing to list here is your presence on the ""deans list"" for high GPA at a university. Make yourself sound as successful and hardworking as you can by adding as many awards as you are able.


If you had a job in which you were given a special honor, make note of that here.
Even if you received an award for volunteering, you are welcome to place that under this section. Highlight the wondrous things you've done and been recognized for no matter the circumstance.

, Whereas your 'awards and achievements' section was very specific, your skills section is much more general. Create a short list of positive personality traits that you exemplify. For example: timeliness, outgoing, enthusiastic, diligent, or team-player.

, If this isn’t the strongest part of your life history, you’ll want to list it at the end so that the recruiter reads through your more impressive accomplishments first.


You should include sub-headings for the type of experience each job provided you with, such as “Management Experience,” “Legal Experience,” or “Financial Experience.”
For each job, be sure to include the name of the company, the city in which the company is located, your title, your duties and responsibilities, and the dates of employment for each employer.
Optionally, under each job description you can include a bold heading, which reads “Major Accomplishment” or “Achievements,” and list two or three achievements or a major accomplishment for that position.
Make sure to quantify your job descriptions, meaning that you place numbers of import on your experiences and achievements (e.g. Ramped production 23% over six month period). Providing numbers makes it easier for hiring managers to grasp the extent of your past experience and achievements.

, If you have done a lot of volunteering, make a list of it here. Include the name of the program, the dates that you worked there/the total number of hours you volunteered, and your responsibilities.

, The last thing on your resume should be a list of 2-4 professional references. These are all people who you are not related to, but whom you've dealt with in a professional manner. You might consider a previous employer, professor, or volunteer coordinator to include on your references page.


Include the name of the reference, their relationship to you, mailing address, email, and phone number.
The place you are applying to may contact these people, so always call them in advance to let them know that you are using them for a reference and are currently applying for a job.

Choose how you want to format your resume.,
List your employment history.,
Provide information about your education.,
Supply other pertinent information.,
List your references.",How to Make a Resume5," Because you are writing a combination resume, there is no strict format guidelines or boundaries which you need to follow. Multiple people will have very different looking combination resume, so focus on what you're good at. In addition to your work and education experience, you can choose to include skills, awards and achievements, volunteer history, and special qualifications.

, This can be done in one of two ways. If your work history includes positions in more than one field, you should list your jobs under functional sub-headings, which categorize the skills you used at each particular one. If you can demonstrate that your evolving work history highlights the key skills you want to promote, you may want to list your work history in chronological order, without including any sub-headings.


Be sure to provide the general information for each employer/position including the name of the company, location, your title, your duties, and the dates that you worked there.

, The details you include about your education will be the same as the details you’d include in other resume styles; the difference is in where you present the information on the resume. For each college, university, or trade school you have attended, list the name and location of the institution, the degree or certificate you received, and the years you attended.


If your grade point average (“GPA”) was 3.5 or higher, you may want to list it as well.

, After you've made note of your education and work history, give a list of any other information you feel like might be helpful for your employer to have. Choose to include any of the additional sections such as special qualifications, skills, awards and achievements, or volunteer service.

, Include 2-4 professional references (not family or friends)along with their contact information. Be sure to include their name, your relationship to them, and their email, address, and phone number.

Create titles that will catch the employer’s eye.,
Use keywords strategically.,
Use action verbs and active voice to describe your responsibilities and accomplishments.,
Spell check and proofread your resume.",How to Make a Resume6," Take a look at job position. Are they interesting and descriptive? Instead of saying you were a cashier, say you were a customer service professional, or rather than saying that you’re a secretary, say you are an administrative assistant. Do not use a job title that is misleading, however. Simply think about how well the job title describes the work, and how interesting the title is.


For example, “Manager” does not describe who or what a person manages. “Sales Staff Manager” or “Executive Manager” may be more descriptive and desirable job titles on a resume.
Visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook for an alphabetical listing of job titles to get ideas on how to make your job titles more descriptive.

, Because many employers now scan resumes with special software programs to determine the presence of certain keywords as a way of filtering them before a select few get passed along to an actual human being, you want to be sure that your resume contains all of the proper keywords for your industry, and the particular job for which you are applying.


Look at what words the employer uses in the advertisement. If an employer lists research as a required skill, be sure to include the word ‘research’ or ‘researched’ in at least one job description or skill set you include on your resume.
Avoid using every keyword mentioned in the job posting, however, or your resume will look suspicious.

, These will highlight your skills and your ability to do the job for which you are applying. Choose verbs that describe your responsibilities and then make sure to begin the descriptions of your duties with these verbs. For example, if you were a receptionist, you may want to use verbs such as 'scheduled', 'assisted', and 'provided'. You can do this by saying you ‘scheduled appointments’ ‘assisted clients’ and ‘provided administrative support.’

, This step cannot be overemphasized. Proofread your resume several times. Have someone else proofread it. Then, have another person further removed from you read it. Spelling and grammar errors in a resume will get it discarded regardless of your skills and experience.


Watch out for spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, incorrect contact information, typos, and misuse of apostrophes, plurals, and possessives.
Double check to make sure that your formatting is correct, and that you didn't forget any important information.

Take an ""inventory"" of the type of work that you have done for wikiHow.,
Look back through your fan mail, talk page messages, and awards.,
Compile examples of your work into a career portfolio.,
Incorporate your wikiHow skills and accomplishments in your resume.",How to Use Your wikiHow Skills to Advance Your Career," wikiHow work can encompass many disciplines and skills.



Writing. If you've written for wikiHow, you have written informational content for a large, international audience spanning a wide variety of ages and experience. Chances are you have also received feedback and criticism on your writing. What have you learned? How could you apply that to your job or your next intended career move?

Proofreading and copyediting. Do spelling and grammatical errors in writing catch your attention? Can you rewrite an article for clarity, continuity, style, and the like?

Photography and illustration. Some of our best wikiHow articles have step-by-step images guiding the reader through whatever procedure they describe. Have you developed any visual communications skills that you could offer to an employer?
Teaching and instruction. Have you gained any experience explaining procedures and other factual information clearly and concisely? Can you summarize or synthesize information?
Researching. Have you ever come across a terrible article on a subject you didn't know and read about it in order to improve it? Have you learned anything about locating and sorting information?

Information management and evaluation. Is a new article equivalent to something we already have? Is it accurate? Is it worthy of deletion or should it be improved or merged, instead? What articles do we have on related subjects? Have you participated in making decisions such as these? Have you learned anything about managing information and content?
Collaboration. Writing for wikiHow is a collaborative process. Have you learned anything about communicating over long distances, working together with others, resolving creative differences, or helping fellow contributors to feel like part of a community?
Initiative and confidence. Wikis, including wikiHow, are a ""do-ocracy"". Have you learned to jump in and take the lead? Could you apply that skill to your professional life, too?
Cleanup and administration. It isn't easy to clean up after all the mixed contributions that wander in from wikiHow's thousands of visitors, but collectively, the volunteers here do just that. Have you patrolled? Have you learned something about keeping on top of ongoing cleanup and administrative tasks? Have you learned anything about encouraging and guiding newcomers? Have you learned about giving constructive criticism?
Skills that are the subject of the articles themselves. Do articles you have written reflect skills you already mastered or skills that you learned or polished in order to write the article? Similarly, have you learned any new skills from reading and applying others' articles?;
, You can print some of these out, copy and paste, or take screen shots as you go. Look for clues about what talents others recognize in your work. How have your articles or your activities in wikiHow helped others? How have they helped wikiHow?

, Online, you could cut and paste small samples or even post the entire article. On paper, you could print articles or relevant portions.

, Organizations like employees who are proactive and reach outside of themselves to contribute to the community. It shows them that you aren't 'just' about you. Include concrete skills (such as editing or researching) in a skills section or mention your time and contributions to wikiHow in a section for volunteer work or (if you are a student) extracurricular activities. If possible, list concrete accomplishments, such as the examples below.


Very general: Volunteered for wikiHow.
A concrete statement of contributions: Patrolled over 2,000 edits for vandalism, content and style. Wrote 10 articles related to office and computer skills.
A concrete statement of skills: Edited factual content in a collaborative, online environment. Welcomed and guided new contributors and built community goodwill.

Consider how you found out about this great opportunity.,
Who are you working for and what do you do for them?,
Where does the money come from?,
Research the company.,
Read the employment ad.,
Do they want money from you before you get money from them?,
How thoroughly do they vet their potential employees.,
Check for other complaints.,
Beware of any job that could be done by anyone (or in some cases even by no one.)",How to Tell if a Home Base Business Opportunity Is a Scam," Reputable companies tend not to recruit through telemarketers, late night infomercials, or bulk unsolicited email. Nor do they vandalize wikis or employ spambots.;
, If you don't already know, it's probably a scam. Reputable companies want people to know who they are and they try to get the right person for the right job. When General Electric puts out a help wanted ad, it reads, ""GE is looking for a web developer to promote our online store."" not ""Want to work in a business associated with a Fortune 500 company? No door-to-door selling. Not a MLM."" Look for a company who tells you who they are, not who they aren't.

, Who is paying and what product or service of value are they paying for? Good businesses create wealth and distribute it so their employees, customers, owners, and suppliers are all satisfied. Scammers don't create anything of value. They just move money from their soon to be disappointed customers to themselves.

, Do they advertise? If so, are their marketing efforts focused on finding more customers, or on finding more distributors? Presumably, they know best what their product is and who pays their bills. If their primary product appears to be get rich quick plans with no other obvious source of revenue, then their money is coming from you. Where is your money coming from?

, Reputable companies will use most of the space describing that they expect of you as their employee or independent contractor. They don't show their vacation photos, their sports cars, or their piles of cash as suggestions for what you could do with all the money you're about to make. They also don't fill the page with testimonials telling how much they made and how easy it was with disclaimers at the bottom stating ""results not typical"". They don't post scanned checks as ""proof"" that it works. Since legitimate sites don't have any use for all that stuff, their page is probably no more than a screenful. If for some reason it's longer than that, it's probably well organized with tables of contents and section headings for readability.

, Reputable companies never bill their employees as a condition of employment. They consider training materials, background checks, software licenses, etc. as a cost of doing business if they want the right people for the job.

, Most real businesses don't want to bother with someone who isn't likely to be able to reliably do their job and screen their recruits accordingly. Unless, of course, the only ""job requirement"" expected of you is the ability to sign your name on a check and send it to them.

, Ask your Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau what they know about the company. A clean report might doesn't necessarily mean that it's safe to join. They might still be robbing people, but being careful to do so legally, or just too new to have attracted much negative attention. On the other hand, a company currently under investigation for fraud should be an immediate deal breaker.

, Why would they want to hire you to do that? One possible answer is that they're involved in money laundering, identity theft, or some other illegal scheme and don't want their activities traceable back to them. Instead they'll be traced back to you! Even if the paychecks are real, the men knocking on your door with guns and search warrants asking why all these electronics purchased with stolen credit cards were shipped to your house will also be real. You might not go to jail if you plead plausible denial-ability and cooperate with the investigation, but is it really worth it?

Understand the difference between a resume and a CV.,
Research the medical school to which you are applying.,
List your education as the first category of your CV.,
Identify relevant work experience.,
Divide all other relevant information into specific categories.,
List earlier experiences first.,
Keep format consistent.",How to Write a CV for Medical School," Resumes often list objectives, are limited to a single page, and contain a narrow list of categories. CVs, on the other hand, often leave objectives off, can be pages in length, and have numerous, more specialized categories.


Resumes are highly focused on personal accomplishments. CVs highlight research, education, and scholars or researchers under whom you have studied. In a CV, you should mention others in the world of academia with whom you have written a paper or done a research project.
CVs can have several specific categories, including training, teaching, workshops, seminars, research, lectures, conferences, publications, degrees, continuing education, scholarships, fellowships, volunteer experience, appointments, and more.;
, Gear your CV directly to that school so you can connect with their values and programs. Learn about the specific programs they offer. Read about the research their medical professors are currently undertaking. Find relevant connections between your interests and theirs.

, This is especially important since you are applying to graduate school. Highlight the college or university you attended, what degree you will graduate with, if you will graduate with honors, and if you have any concentrations or special interests within the medical field.

, Since you are applying to medical school, any work experience you have will place you at the front of the crowd of applicants. If you have interned at a doctor's office, served as a research assistant, volunteered at a local health clinic, or assisted with a health class, list that on your CV. Split them into specific categories.

, The way you organize your CV for medical school is determined by how much and what type of information you have to share. Categorize it so that your CV is easy to follow. If you do not have information for a specific category, leave that section out.


Research papers and projects, dissertations, theses, publications, and other research papers demonstrate the specific medical field you are interested in. They also reveal the depth of research you have already done. So do class projects.
Lectures, seminars, conference messages, or any type of public speech shows that you are recognized as a knowledgeable individual about that specific topic. It also demonstrates your teaching and communication skills.

, The chronology of CVs goes from oldest to newest. For example, in the work experience section, start with your first job and then move on to your most recent one. If there is a date range involved (i.e., 2002-2006) or when it is an ongoing activity (i.e., 2004-present), use the first date when organizing.

, There are several ways you can format a CV. The important thing is to keep it well organized and consistent.


Number the pages. Help reviewers refer to certain pages when they are discussing your CV and application to medical school.
Number long lists. This helps others see how much you have accomplished at a quick glance. It also helps when you try to refer to a specific role or achievement.
Use a template. You can find CV templates online or through your word processing program. Feel free to personalize it to fit you, but ensure that headings, font type, and size remain consistent throughout your CV.

Have someone else review your resume.,
Prepare a cover letter for each job application.",How to Write a CV for a Cabin Crew Position," Before updating or creating your new resume, take the time to review websites for airlines you’re interested in working for. Because it’s an airline, the main webpage may be directed towards the customer, but most of these websites will have a “careers” link somewhere near the bottom of the main page.Read through the general career information provided by the airline.
Look for information about the type of people they look for, and the type of culture the organization has (or encourages).
For example: The Virgin America career website includes key statements like:“We’re a collective of status-quo-challenging individuals who happen to dig planes …”
“We’re into shaking things up.""
“The task of re-invening air travel doesn’t lend itself to the meek, the satiated, and the comfortable.""
“Someone creative, compassionate, patient, visionary, spontaneous, articulate, attentive, ambitious, fun, humble, brave, sympathetic, unflappable, dedicated, curious, passionate, energetic, inspiring, and trustworthy.""


For example: British Airways career website includes key statements like:“A real team player, you’re passionate about people and driven to delight every customer.”
“… you’re always ready to adapt to change and innovation.""
“Your enthusiasm for creating great experiences means you’re totally engaged with everything from health and safety to our products and services.""


Both career websites provide an excellent selection of keywords you should consider including in either your resume or your cover letter (or both).
Both websites also indicate the culture within their organization and what they expect from their employees. Just the fact that the Virgin America website is displayed and written from a more casual perspective than the British Airways website says a lot about each organization.;
, The same career websites that contain general information about the organization should also include a list of available positions. Use the associated search function to look for open cabin crew positions at the airlines you’re interested in.Remember that not all airlines will call their cabin crew positions the same thing. Make sure your search criteria includes any positions that may be considered a cabin crew position by that organization.
Many career websites provide the user with the ability to create an account so they can setup notifications. You’ll be able to tell the system what types of jobs you’re interested in, and the system will send you an email notification when those types of jobs become available.
Pay specific attention to areas of the job posting that include specific requirements and qualifications.
Also pay attention to keywords used throughout the job posting that you can use in your resume or cover letter.
For example: In a Virgin America job posting for a In Flight Team Member important points to note are:

“Must be at least 21 years old.""
“Able to work nights, weekends, holidays and extended hours.""
“Physically fit in order to pass applicable training programs, including being able to … lift emergency window exits (approx. 30 lbs.) …""


For example: The British Airways job posting for a Cabin Crew member includes the following important points:""You genuinely enjoy customer interactions and place the customer at the heart of everything you do.""
""You appreciate the need to work in a timely fashion and appreciate the need for punctuality.""
""You are able to lift a weight of 9kg (20lb) from a height of 195cm (78”), this is the equivalent of lifting a medical kit from and aircraft overhead locker.""



, As you will probably find, not all airlines are equal. While they all provide essentially the same type of service, they provide that service very differently. You need to decide which airlines you prefer, and which airlines you do not want to work for.


Do not feel you need to apply for jobs at all airlines just to get your foot in the door. Pick only the airlines you feel you could work at for a long period of time happily.
If the airline’s career website doesn’t give you a good enough view of the organization, consider speaking to someone who works at that airline. Since many of this positions are customer-facing, it wouldn’t be hard to find someone to speak to even if you don’t know anyone already.
Narrow down the list of airlines you want to apply to and spend more time reviewing the website and job postings from those airlines.

, When writing each section of your resume, keep the keywords and terms you’ve found in mind. Incorporate as many of these keywords as you can, but don’t use ALL of them. Incorporate some of your own creativity into your resume and cover letter as well.


Example: From the Virgin America website — ""Someone creative, compassionate, patient, visionary, spontaneous, articulate, attentive, ambitious, fun, humble, brave, sympathetic, unflappable, dedicated, curious, passionate, energetic, inspiring, and trustworthy.”Profile Summary — incorporate some of these adjectives into your description of yourself. For example, instead of “experienced flight attendant with 5+ years of service,” put “compassionate in-flight crew member with over 5 years of dedicated and energetic experience.""

Core Competencies— incorporate both the adjectives and specific requirements into your list of skills and abilities. For example, instead of “hands-on experience in delivering onboard services while remaining in the boundaries defined by airline policies and protocols,” use “passionate about delivering a memorable and relaxing flight for all passengers by providing excellent service based on the airline’s safety procedures.""

Previous Experience — use the keywords and terms from the job positing to explain how you performed your previous jobs. Don’t worry if your previous experience isn’t airline-related. For example, if the job posting indicates that they want an ‘effective communicator,’ incorporate that term into your previous experience. Instead of saying “provided directions to local restaurants,” use “communicated directions to local points of interest.""

, Your previous experience section needs to list all your prior job information, including: your job title; the department within the organization where you job was; the name of the organization where you worked; the city, state and possibly country where the job was located; the month and year you started the job; the month and year you left the job; a list of tasks you completed; and a list of responsibilities you had.Make a list of all your past jobs and gather all the required information.
Include items as far back as possible. You can edit and remove unneeded jobs later if you need to.
When listing your previous experience on your resume, put the list in order of most recent to least recent.

, Once you have a list of all the past jobs you’ve had, make a detailed list of the tasks, activities and responsibilities you had for each one. The purpose of this list is to provide potential employers with an idea of the types of things you have experience with. But the list should be written in a clear, concise manner that accentuates the positive and results-based responsibilities you had. Rewrite your list using the following guidelines:


Use a present-tense verb at the start of each point for the job where you are currently employed.
Use a past-tense verb at the start of each point for the jobs where you no longer work.
It is helpful for each point to include WHAT you did and WHY you did it.
Examples of job description points are as follows:

Welcomed passengers as they arrived and checked their tickets (the ‘what’) to ensure that they are on the correct flight (the ‘why’).Demonstrated the use of safety equipment such as oxygen masks and provided advice on what to do during emergency situations.
Provided support to passengers who have missed their flights by arranging for them to embark on the next available flight.
Walked aisles of the plane to verify that passengers were in compliance with federal regulations prior to take-off and landing.Oversaw work performance of flight crew during flights and consulted with cockpit and cabin crew for travel briefings., Since you have limited space on your resume, you may not be able to include all your past experience. In most cases, it is unnecessary to include jobs held during high school, unless it was a job that is specifically related to the airline industry.There are three ways to reduce the amount of space taken by the previous experience section:

One, you can reduce the number of points included for each job.
Two, you can remove all the points from the oldest jobs and only include job titles.
Three, you can remove your oldest jobs completely.



, Another important section of any resume is the education section. This section should include any post-secondary education, training courses, or workshops you've attended. In most cases it will not be necessary to include high school unless you do not have any post-secondary education.Write down all the education you’ve received since high school.
For each education entry, you will need the following items: institution name; institution location; program start and end dates; degree, diploma or certificate program in which you were enrolled; and major (if applicable).
You will need to indicate which programs you completed with a graduation date. You may wish to exclude programs you started but didn’t finish if an incomplete program would cause too many questions.

, If you received a specific award, scholarship or honour at any of the institutions you attended, include that information on your resume.If you received 3 items or less, include your achievements as point forms under the appropriate education entry.
If you received more than 3 awards, scholarships or honours, create a separate section where you list these items. If you create a separate section, include the name of the award plus the year you received it.

, Important qualifications would include: certifications you have (e.g. CPR, AED, etc.); languages in which you are fluent; associations to which you are a member; and any special interests that might make you stand out. Certifications are especially important if they are required for the job to which you are applying.


If you are including certifications that have an achievement date (and an expiry date), include the month and year on your resume. List these certifications from most to least recent.Special interests could include things such as: volunteer activities, talents (e.g. piano player, ballroom dancer, etc.), and anything else that might start an interesting conversation in an interview., A profile summary may also be called summary, profile, professional highlights, qualification summary, etc. Choose whichever title you like best. The profile summary includes a very brief description, in paragraph form, about yourself. It should highlight some of your best qualities and features.This paragraph is at the top of your resume, so it’ll be the first thing an employer reads other than your name. As such, it should stand out and grab their attention.

, Your profile summary requires input from all sections of your resume, which is why it’s best to write it last. You need to summarize your abilities and experiences into 3-5 concise sentences that describe you as the perfect candidate to be a flight attendant.If you have no prior experience as a flight attendant, your summary should focus on the transferrable skills you have that can be applied to a flight attendant position.
If you have prior experience as a flight attendant, your summary should include specific examples from your previous experience.

, The best place to start creating your this portion of your resume is to grab a notebook, sit down, and think about your skills, abilities, and strengths. Most skills and abilities can be considered universal, which means they can apply to any job to which you apply. Other skills and abilities may be specific to a job or industry, for example flying a plane, programming a computer, fixing an engine, etc. For your cabin crew resume, use transferrable skills, abilities and strengths, or skills that are specific to the airline industry.Some examples of strengths are: adaptability, analytical, communication, consistency, empathetic, positivity, responsible, self-assured, strategic.
Some examples of skills and abilities are: ability to work under pressure, attention to detail, conflict resolution, delegating, diplomacy, problem solving, mediation, persuasion, patience, customer service, reliable, taking initiative, teamwork, creative.In addition to the above listed skills and abilities, remember to include any industry-specific skills that are more general in nature. For example, many job ads for cabin crew members may require the candidate to be able to life up to 50 pounds. Ensure you include the fact that you are able to life up to 50 pounds in this section so hiring managers are aware you meet these general requirements.

, A core competencies section is similar in nature to your profile summary, except it’s in point form and provides slightly more detail. This is a section where you can expand on your skills a little more, and include more detail. It is not a required section, but can be used to provide additional highlights after your profile summary and before your previous experience section.Your core competencies section can be developed in two ways. A point form list of skills one to three words long. Or a list of 3-5 points explaining your skills in more detail.
A short list may include the following items:

Pre/Post Flight Checks
Cabin Security
Meal Service
Inventory Management
Special Needs Assistance
Emergency Response


A point form list of sentences may include the following items:Competent at providing leadership by responding to a variety of onboard emergency and non-emergency situations.
Hands-on experience in delivering onboard services while remaining in the boundaries defined by airline policies and protocols.
Proven ability to communicate technical information to passengers in a precise and customer-friendly way.



, One creative way to make your resume stand out against many others is to develop your own tagline or motto. Doing this may take some time, but is worth it in the end. Some example taglines are as follows:


Dedicated to Making Each Passenger’s Trip Completely Memorable Through Impeccable ServiceHigh-end service provider giving the sophisticated traveller a stylish and tailor-made experience on every flight.

, You have several options for how to format your final resume. But there are several guidelines that are common between all resumes that you should follow when formatting your resume. The exact format you use for each section is up to you because there are so many choices. Search the internet for samples and use the format you like best. It’s okay to be a little creative. Create several versions if you’re unsure which format you prefer, then compare the printed versions.Your name should be the first thing on your resume, in the largest font. To make things easier to format, put your name and other contact info in the header. This also ensures it gets repeated on a second page, if you have one.
Your contact information comes after your name, and should also be placed in the header. Your contact information should be in a smaller font than your name.
Your tagline (if you have one) should come next, immediately under the header. Ideally it should be written in a font that stands out, possibly even bolded if it looks good.
Your summary, objective, profile summary, qualifications, etc., should come after your tagline. This section should have a section heading.
If you decide to include a core competency section, it should come after your summary section. Core competencies also needs a section heading.
Your professional experience should come next, and should also have a section heading.
Your education should come after your professional experience, and will need a section heading.
If you decide to have separate sections that outline additional qualifications, interests, awards, etc., you can place them as the last section on your resume.
Put the statement “References Available Upon Request” in the footer, if you decide to include it.
If you’re resume is longer than 1 page, include the page numbers in the footer. It’s helpful to put the page number and the page count together (1 of 2), rather than only the page number (1).

, When writing each section of your resume, use words that are specific to the airline industry. Also, if you have specific jobs in mind already, use keywords from those job ads in your resume (and cover letter).


Another purpose to keywords is if your resume is put into a searchable database, or posted online. Many large organizations scan resumes into databases for storage. When a job becomes available, they’ll search the database using specific keywords.
Keywords are also important if you post your resume online. Airline recruiters may search these websites using keywords to find the best candidates.
While you won’t necessarily know what keywords each airline may use for every search, you can be assured many of those keywords will also be found in their job ads. Reviewing multiple job ads for the airline industry before completing your resume is a valuable task.

, The final version of your resume should be no more than 2 pages in length. If printed, it should be printed double-sided so it only takes up one piece of paper. If your resume doesn’t fill 2 pages, attempt to reduce it to one page.There are many formatting tricks you can employ to reduce your resume to 1-2 pages if needed. They include:

Decrease the size of the margins, but don’t go smaller than 1”.
Reduce the space allocated to headers and footers. Reduce the text in the headers and footers to fewer lines.
Reduce the font used in the headers and footers to 8-10 pts.
Reduce the font used on the resume to 10-12 pts.
Alter the font size between section headings and section text. For example, use 12 pt font for headings and 10 pt font for text.



, Your contact information should include your: name (first and last at a minimum); full address (including city, state/province, and zip/postal code); phone number; and email address. Include only one phone number and email address. Double-check that all your personal information is accurate as there is nothing worse than an employer wanting to interview you, but having the wrong number.Make sure the phone number you provide have the ability to record messages.
Review the answering message on all the phone number you provide to ensure it is professional. If it’s not professional, record a new message.
Do not include email addresses that you have no control over, such as an existing employer. If necessary, create a new, free email account only for your resume and forward it to the email address you use most.
Do not use email addresses with unprofessional names, e.g. sexymama@gmail.com, etc. Create a new email account if you need a professional email address.

, There are a lot of awesome fonts available for free online, but a large portion of them are not appropriate for resumes. The font on your resume should be clear and easy to read. While you can use multiple fonts, limit your font selections to a maximum of 2-3. Use one font for all text, and another font for section headings. If you want to add a third font, use it for your contact information or your tagline.The most recommended fonts for resumes are: Garamond (classic), Gill Sans (simple), Cambria (clear), Calibri (simple), Constantia (friendly), Lato (friendly), Didot (classy), Helvetica (contemporary), Georgia (clear), and Avenir (crisp).The worst fonts to use for a resume are: Times New Roman (overused), Futura (impractical), Arial (overused), Courier (unprofessional), Brush Script (overused), Comic Sans (childish), Century Gothic (impractical), Papyrus (cliche), Impact (overpowering), and Trajan Pro (impractical).

, You will need to have references available for potential employers to contact. But you should not provide that information unless explicitly asked. You can, however, include the words “References available upon request” on your resume, but it is not required. It is safe to assume that most employers will expect you have references, so you do not need to mention it on your resume.You should, however, have all your reference names and contact information (phone number and email address) ready to send before you apply for a cabin crew job.
You must ensure the people you give as your references are willing to be your references. And that they have something positive to say about you. Ask them first. And inform them of what types of jobs you’ll be applying to.

, Errors and typos on a resume really stand out. A resume is being used to judge you as a potential employee, and errors may make you appear to be a bad hiring choice. If a hiring manager is looking at a large pile of resumes, they may immediately discount any resumes that have errors and typos.Use your computer’s spell check function first, but don’t rely on it as your only review method.
Walk away from your resume for at least a day, then come back and re-read it.
Print a copy of your resume and read it on paper. This helps ensure it looks good printed, but you may also be more likely to notice a mistake this way.
Read your resume out loud. This method may help isolate when sentences don’t make sense.
Review your resume from bottom to top. Because you’re reading your resume in a different way, your brain won’t automatically skim over things as easily as it would when reading it the ‘normal’ way.

, Have someone else read your resume before you finalize it. It can be anyone, they don’t have to be an expert on resumes. A fresh set of eyes may notice simple mistakes you've overlooked, and they’ll be able to tell you if there’s something that doesn’t make sense.You can also have a career advisor review your resume. They’d be able to provide you with feedback around the format and content, but they’d also be able to point out simple errors and typos.
If you’re currently attending a post-secondary institution, you will probably have free access to a career centre. Career centres usually have resume review services that are very helpful.
The ideal situation would be to have a hiring manager from an airline review your resume for you. They’d be able to provide you with specific feedback on industry keywords and specific skills that would be looked for.

, A cover letter is a vital part of every cabin crew job application. The cover letter is where you’re able to customize your application to the specific job posting you’re replying to. It’s also your way to make an awesome first impression.Your cover letter should tell your story, not list points.
A cover letter should describe how specific skills and experiences you have can be applied to the specific job for which you are applying.
Cover letters also provide a potential employer with an example of your writing skills and how well you can communicate.

, Familiarity with computers and software is essential for accounting positions. Employers will want to know if you are familiar with the software and programs they use.In addition to Quickbooks and Microsoft Excel, you may be expected to have working knowledge of Zoho Books, Wave Accounting, or Freshbooks, or others. If you do your research, you'll know what programs you'll be expected to know.
If you need to brush up on your computer skills, or learn new software, consider taking an online course. Many times, these courses are free or low-cost, and can be done at your own pace.
If you've received special certification in any particular computer area, list this here. Employers are always in need of additional IT experts.

, A professional reference is someone who can speak to your qualifications on the job.The ideal job reference will be able to address any questions regarding job capabilities based in his own knowledge of your workplaces skills, qualifications, and behavior.

Also experienced people tailor your resume to the job you are applying for. Use a modern but professional format. However, there is no set format for a CV, what you include is up to you., Research the company. A good CV is tailored to the specific job and company you are applying for. What does the company do? What is their mission statement? What do you think they are looking for in an employee? What skills does the specific job you are applying for require? These are all things to keep in mind when writing your CV.

, See if there is any specific information they want you to list in your CV. There might be specific directions listed on the application page. Always double check this.

, These can be both jobs you hold currently and jobs you have held in the past. Include the dates that you began and ended your term at each particular job., Unique interests or hobbies will make you stand out. Be aware of the conclusions that might be drawn from your hobbies. Try to list hobbies that portray you as a team-oriented individual rather than as a solitary, passive person. Companies want someone who works well with others and can take charge if need be.



Hobbies and interests that paint a positive image: Being the captain of your soccer (or football) team, organizing a charity event for an orphanage, secretary of your school’s student-run government.

Hobbies that imply a passive, solitary personality: watching TV, doing puzzles, reading. If you are going to put any of these things, give a reason why. For instance, if you are applying for a job at a publishing house, put something like: I enjoy reading the great American writers such as Twain and Hemingway because I think their writing gives a unique perspective into American culture at the time they were writing.

, These skills often include computing skills (are you a wiz at Wordpress? Excel? inDesign? etc.), languages you speak, or specific things the company is looking for, such as targeted skills.



Example of targeted skills: If you are applying to be a writer for a newspaper, list that you are fluent in AP style. If you are applying for a coding job, mention that you have worked with JavaScript.

, Are you going to break each section up with a line? Are you going to put each section in its own box? Are you going to list all of your information? Play around with different formats to see which looks most professional. Aim for no more than the front and back of a standard sheet of paper.

, It is important to make your name a size larger than the rest of the text as it is important for your reviewer to know who he or she is reading about. It is up to you as to how you format this information.Standard format would be to have your name in the center of the page. Your home address should be listed in a block format on the left side of the paper. Put your telephone number and email below your home address. If you have another address (such as your address while you are at school) list this address on the right hand side of the paper.

, This is an optional part of the CV that is good for giving your reviewer a more in-depth look at you as a person. This is where you sell your skills, experiences, and personal qualities. It should be original and well-written. Use positive words such as “adaptable”, “confident”, and “determined”.Example of a personal statement for a CV for a publishing company: An enthusiastic recent graduate looking for an entry-level editorial position that will utilize organizational and communication skills developed as a summer intern at City Lights.

, This section can be at the beginning of your CV or you can choose to list it after other sections. The order of sections is up to you. List your education in reverse chronological order. Begin with university if you attended or are attending it and work your way backwards. List the name of your university, the dates you went there, your major and minor, and your grade point average or A levels.Example: Santa Clara University, English and History 2009-2013 Subjects include: Medieval Literature, Victorian Literature, Criticism of Poetry, and History of Great Britain. Obtained a 75% on my 2nd year exams. (If in the US- Maintained a 3.7 GPA.)

, This is the section in which you should list all of your relevant work experience. List the name of the company, the location of the company, the years you worked there, and what you did. Start with your most recent job and work backwards. If you have a long list of work experience, only put the experiences relevant to the job you are applying for.Example: Diablo Magazine, Walnut Creek, CA, March 2012-January 2013. Fact-checked information, wrote articles for Diablo’s blog, assisted in researching of material for articles.

, This section is where you list the things you accomplished at your previous jobs, and the skills you have developed through your experiences. This is also the section where you list any of your published work, lectures you've given, classes you've taught, etc.



Example achievements: Successfully took a national bestseller from manuscript to publication; Received certification in copy-editing from UC Berkeley

, You should list any relevant interests that paint you in the most positive light. Choose several interests from the list you created while brainstorming for your CV (in Part One).

, If there is a noticeable gap in your CV or there is some other information you would like to share, put it in this section. This sort of information can include leaving work to take care of children, join the Peace Corps, etc.Example: I took two years off from my intended career path in publishing to teach English in Brazil through the TEFL program. Teaching English as a second language has helped me better understand the subtle nuances of the language.

, These are people you have worked with in the past such as professors, previous employers, etc. that have seen your work and can credibly support praises that they give you. The company you are applying to may contact these references to find out more about your previous work. You should talk with the person you would like to list a reference before actually listing them--it is best to double check that they still have the same number, are okay with giving you a reference, or that they remember who you are. Write down their full names and contact information (including their phone numbers and emails).

, Poor spelling is the quickest way to get rejected. If your CV is sloppy or riddled with errors, potential employers will be unimpressed. Double (and triple) check that you have spelled the name of the company correctly, as well as any companies you have worked for in the past., CVs that are concise and well-written tend to do better than long-winded CVs that have repetitive information. Make sure you don’t repeat yourself--it’s better to list many of your traits than the same few traits over and over again.

, What do you think about the layout and the information written there? Do you come across as a professional?

, What do they think could be added or taken out? Would they hire you if they were a company?

, Look to see if there are any other materials they would like you to send in along with your CV. Companies may ask for a cover letter or samples of your work (such as articles you may have written).

Call the recruiter and get some details about the position.
Once you have jotted down the skills and abilities that the job calls for, write your curriculum vitae with them in mind.
You can write down all the skills you have and then elaborate on the ones that you think the employer is specifically looking for in a candidate.
This can include your qualifications, work history, skills, etc.
Your knowledge about the company and its recent events will show the employer how committed you are to getting the job.
Tailoring your CV shows that you have a professional attitude and are not just jumping head first into something without thinking.

, These are the details that identify you, and are usually placed at the very top of your CV.


This section includes your complete name, address, email, mobile phone, and LinkedIn ID.
Depending upon the type of job or industry you are trying to get into, you might consider adding your photograph, and a link to your website or blog.

, This section illustrates the job roles you have had or currently have, including any projects or key assignments that you have worked on.


It may also list your volunteer work and your non-professional achievements as well.
It shouldn’t be a huge laundry list of information, but should be a concise description of facts, such as the start and end date of your job/projects, your job title, the company/organization you worked for, and a brief description of what your job's duties included.

, In this section, list your special skills and proficiencies .


You can also include the relevant courses you have completed, such as a course in MS Excel.
This section can make you stand out in terms of your specific technical skills.

, In this section, outline the educational institutions you attended, the years you were there, your majors, grades, special awards, and extracurricular activities.


Always start with your highest and most recent education and move in reverse order from there.
Keep the information restricted to the college or university name and avoid writing the address and other details.

, It's not necessary to include a section dedicated to individual references.


Rather, to save space, only include a statement that says “References shall be available upon request”.

, Your CV should follow a logical structure and should tell your professional history as a story.


The proverbial dots should connect, and if there is any gap, you should mention what you were doing during that time period.
If your presentation of the information and its appearance are inconsistent, then you lose your chances of grabbing the recruiter’s attention.

Tailor the resume to the job.,
Break the resume into subsections.,
Prioritize key information.",How to Make Your CV Sound More Impressive1," One big mistake that people make in resumes and CVs is in not tailoring it to the job.Employers looks for signs that you understand what the position requires in the formatting of the document itself. You should prepare a standard resume for most jobs in business, for example. Universities, labs, and other academic employers will look for a different format, the academic CV.


For example, a business resume is often about one page long. It is meant to summarize your skills and qualifications and to introduce you to an employer. An academic CV on the other hand is comprehensive. It is meant to provide all or most of your past education, experience, writing, and professional development.You should also tailor the resume to the job itself. You can do this, firstly, by carefully reading the ad. As you get ready to put together a resume, mark the skills that are mentioned with a pen. Note anything – your qualifications, personal talents, experience – that you can link directly to these needs. An employer should be able to see from the information you give and from your structure that you are a good “fit.”;
, Resumes and CVs have an expected order. Knowing this order, and following it, reassures an employer that you are competent and are aware of basic communication practices. Usually, the order of a resume is as follows: header and personal information, education and qualifications, work experience, interests and goals, other skills, and references.In the header, make your name slightly larger than the other information. Include below your name your current mailing address, telephone number, and the email address that you most frequently use.
Give education and work experience in a reverse chronological order. That is, start with the most recent positions and work backwards. For each job under work experience, employers will expect you to give the company’s name and location, your job title, dates (i.e. when you worked there), and three to four short lines describing your duties.The interests section is a chance for you to include extracurricular activities, volunteer work, or other community involvement. Use this strategically if you can, particularly if you have outside experience relevant to the job at hand. Skills can include things like languages, proficiency in computer programs, social media skills, or other training specific to the job.As always, an academic CV will be different. Along with the usual header and education, work history will usually focus on teaching, research, and/or editing experience. Depending on the job, employers may also want to see publications, a list of public lectures and presentations, and your grant history., How to prioritize depends in part on what sort of job you are applying for. Usually, you will give the most space to your related work experience, then to qualifications. Employers look very closely at these two categories.For example, if you are applying for a job as an accountant, you will want to highlight your education and bachelor’s degree in accountancy. In your experience and qualifications sections, focus on your year-long internship with a tax firm and the fact that you have passed the professional certification exam.


In an academic CV, the format will again depend on the type of job. If you are applying for a research-oriented position, for example, employers will want to know more about your publications, grant history, and research impact. For a teaching-oriented position, they will want to know about you previous experience – where, what, when, and how successfully you have taught before.

Follow the rules of formal English.,
Be clear and concise.,
Favor action words.,
Avoid clichés.",How to Make Your CV Sound More Impressive2," There is little that annoys a potential employer more than a resume with errors in spelling or grammar. To them, this says that the applicant is unqualified at a very basic level. Some resume readers reject your resume for even the smallest error.Make sure that your resume gets a proper read through at the least, and does not end up in the trash heap for this reason.Spell correctly, for one thing. Use capital letters appropriately. Do not rely entirely on spell-check to catch all of your mistakes, moreover. Use it, but then have a friend read through the resume to make sure that you haven’t missed anything.

, Your resume should be lean and give all the necessary information as clearly and concisely as possible. Don’t feel that you need to use full sentences. For example, use bullet points and “parallelism” rather than a series of paragraphs to describe job duties: e.g. “Handled purchasing, expediting, and returning – Processed change orders – Prepared weekly field payroll.”Try to avoid confusing language and jargon, as well. You might think that big words or complicated sentences make you seem more serious or smarter. You might actually end up seeming pompous, annoying an employer. It is better to choose simple, to-the-point words when you can., An easy way to make your writing clearer is by using an active voice, e.g. “I created a new website” instead of “The new website was created by me.” This makes you the active agent and gives your writing life. Verbs and action words like prepare, analyze, interpret, obtain, and others will infuse your resume with a sense of motivation., In the same vein, there are phrases in the business world that have become clichés. To employers these buzzwords are like white noise and make very little impact. Read through your resume with an eye toward things that seem clichéd, like “dynamic,” “proactive,” or “synergy.” Adopt fresh phrases in place of these in order to describe yourself and your experience."

Be honest!,
Make the most of your skills, interests, and experience.,
Seek out volunteer opportunities, internships, or work placements.,
Do a gap year.,
Highlight academic and work-related honors.,
Teach and publish early.",How to Make Your CV Sound More Impressive3," Lying on a resume or CV is never a good idea. You may feel as though you don’t have enough experience for the job, and be tempted to stretch the truth, to invent a position that never existed, or to exaggerate your education. This will almost certainly backfire.Don’t assume that companies “don’t check these things anyways.” If anything, employers are more careful than ever in looking into potential hires and their histories., Think hard about the skills that you have. You may be forgetting or undervaluing them. Even skills that we sometimes take for granted can be valuable in the workplace. Are you computer literate or proficient in certain programs like Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, or Excel, for example? Say so in your resume!There are many skills that you have picked up in your education or previous job experience that can be useful, even if they don’t seem immediately related to the job you’re applying for. Do you have past experience in public speaking? Can you read Spanish? Did your previous job in sales require you to work in a team? These can all be marketable skills.

, If you have the chance, do an unpaid or paid internship. This will show potential employers that you are actively looking for career opportunities. It also counts as on-the-job experience that you can mention in a resume.


To better highlight internships, you might try creating a subsection under your personal info or before your education called “Internships and Work Placements,” or something similar. This formatting will highlight your experience and show an employer that you have more than just a degree.Remember to note your relevant volunteer work, as well. In some sectors like non-profit organizations this kind of work is highly desirable. If you are applying for a job with a women’s advocacy charity, for example, include the fact that you volunteered at a local women’s shelter.

, For new graduates, a gap year can be a way to develop so-called “soft skills” that can also be valuable for employers. While a year working with a non-profit organization in South America or India might seem far removed from a job in business, it shows an employer that you are adaptable, flexible, resilient, and can work with diverse people. Maybe you also learned a new language. Do not underrate an experience like this. It may seem like a small thing, but actually it demonstrates that you have desirable character traits., Don’t forget to make the most out of any special recognitions that you’ve won, whether it was making the Dean’s List, winning first-in-class honors, or being named employee of the month for your sales. These honors can show your motivation, leadership, and how you can be an asset to a company in the future.For an academic CV, awards and honors are even more important, as they show that you have been recognized by peers in your field for excellence. Here you will want to provide the name of the award and granting institution. In some fields it is also usual to include the amount of money, if you received any., This advice applies specifically to academics. The best way to improve your academic CV is to have concrete experience – that means teaching courses and publishing articles. These are often what make or break candidates for university and research jobs. You’ll therefore want to get started as early as possible on them.Try to get inside the classroom. Some graduate schools give you experience as a teaching assistant or even in teaching your own course. Others do not. Make the most of your opportunities. Talk to your professors and mentors. See whether they will let you give a guest lecture in one of their courses.
Talk to your advisor. Advisors can be “gateways” to your first publications. They might be able to recommend you to a journal editor for a book review, or ask you to contribute to a volume that they are editing. Let them know about your desire to publish. At the very least, they can advise you on how to turn your research into your first published article.

Restate your enthusiasm for the job in the conclusion.,
Proofread your letter.,
Send your resume with your cover letter.",How to Write a Cover Letter for a Receptionist Job," When writing your cover letter, you should make reference to the original job posting. To prepare for this, make sure you know the job posting well.Look at the job description and pick out the duties that you have experience or skill with. Prepare to address these skills in your cover letter.
Do the same with the qualifications section of the posting. Pick out your qualifications that match those of the job, and make note of them so you can state them in your letter.

, Most job postings will include a name and address of the representative you should contact about the job. Be sure to copy this down correctly: one wrong number in an address will send your cover letter to the wrong place, and spelling the representative's name wrong will hurt your chances right from the start., In addition to reading the job posting carefully, you should do some research into the company at large. That way, you can use information about the company in your cover letter. This will demonstrate that you're a dedicated candidate and can increase your chances of getting the job., All cover letters should be considered formal business letters, including one for a receptionist position. This applies whether you're sending an email or a hard copy letter. Learn this format and use it for all your cover letters.Become familiar with the following format and be sure to use it when writing your letter.


Place your name, title, and address on the top left of the paper.
Place the date below this.
Put the person's name, title, and address below this.
Address the person appropriately. Start with ""Dear Mr."" or ""Dear Mrs.""
Have 1-inch margins around the paper and use single spacing. Don't indent, just use a double space in between paragraphs.
Use an easy-to-read font such as Times New Roman or Arial, in 12-point font.
End with ""Sincerely,"" then leave 4 lines so you can manually sign your name. Below this, type your name and title.

, Remember that this is a formal business letter. You should address the recipient as Mr. or Mrs. Also use ""Dear"" as a greeting; ""Hi"" or ""Hello"" are not appropriate for a business letter.If you're unaware of the recipient's gender, then use the person's full name after ""Dear.""

, Cover letters are very ""cut to the chase"" kinds of letters. A long greeting is unnecessary. The first paragraph is for announcing your purpose, so you should state right from the top why you're writing this letter.The opening sentence should read something like: ""I am writing with interest in the receptionist position at your company."" When actually writing the letter, make sure to name the company.
If someone at the company recommended that you apply for the position, mention him or her here. In this case, the opening sentence would read: ""I am writing with interest in the receptionist position at your company that John Smith recommended to me.""

, After the first sentence, within the first paragraph, you should give a very brief introduction of yourself. This shouldn't go longer than two sentences; just give the recipient an idea of who your are.A good introduction would be: ""I am a recent graduate of New York University, where I majored in business.""

, After you've introduced yourself, start the next paragraph. The first part of the body of your letter should be why the company interests you. This shows that you've done your homework in investigating the company and will show the potential employer that you're a dedicated candidate.Mention exactly what the company does, and why these activities interest you. Don't be afraid to compliment the company here -- a little flattery can help break the ice with a potential employer.

, The rest of the body section of your letter should present your qualifications to the company. Use this opportunity to spell out exactly why you're a perfect fit for this job.Address specific parts of the job posting. This shows that you've done your work, and will also display your qualifications in a nice, succinct way for the recipient.
Mention your past experience and how it will suit you for this job. Here is a good opportunity to elaborate on some points on your resume that don't get fully covered on the resume itself. For example, a past internship is only a quick entry on your resume, but perhaps you gained invaluable skills on it that will make you a perfect fit for this job. Mention that here.
Specifically, you should focus on customer service and computer experience. Receptionists work on the computer and interact with people every day, so this experience is crucial., After stating all of your relevant experience, start a concluding paragraph. In this paragraph, you should reiterate your enthusiasm for the job and that you are a qualified candidate. Also thank the recipient for his or her time in considering your application.Your closing should sound something like this: ""As you can see from my qualifications, I am an ideal candidate for this position. I greatly look forward to hearing from you and speaking further. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.""

, Never send in a cover letter without proofreading it first. Any spelling or grammar mistakes will hurt your application and make you look unprofessional. Always go through your letter at least 2 more times before sending it in. If possible, have someone else read it as well. A fresh set of eyes could catch mistakes that you missed., Don't forget to attach your resume when you send your cover letter. If you don't send your resume, it's almost certain that the potential employer won't answer your cover letter. For help with resumes, read Make a Resume.

, You might need to think carefully about all of your relevant achievements and tailor them to the specific job role on offer. Make your CV short, snappy and direct, as opposed to listing every single achievement, as this will only result in the employer looking elsewhere.

, You don’t need to do this in great depth, but where appropriate mention some of the transferable skills from other insurance jobs you have had in the past and how this could benefit the company if you were successful. This is a great way to gain the employer’s attention and keep them interested in what your CV has to say.

, It’s no good having a standard CV for the purpose of insurance vacancies as some points won’t be relevant. Instead, use the description as a guide and work out the key areas that will need to be included in each CV. Do you have training experience in certain areas or have you gained results in one of the other areas they are talking about? Only use the strongest points for each CV and again make sure you are direct rather than long-winded.

, If this is the first part of your CV then it’s an easy way to instantly stand out and make a difference.

Consider your reader.,
Get your story straight.,
It’s not about you.,
Do not ask for a job.,
Thank them and keep in touch.",How to Write a Cover Letter for a Graphic Design Job," Over worked, under appreciated, vain, fighting with their significant other about who was more put out by the last DMV appointment, desperately looking for some small evidence their work has meaning. You have two sentences, max, to cajole, seduce and entice. Lead with them.;
, Tell your reader how you know them, why you love their work and how their existence in the world has affected yours.

, Do not start sentences with “I…” The reader doesn’t care about you or your story. Sorry. The good news is that it’s not personal. The reader *might* hire you but only *if* they have more work than they can handle *and* some surplus cash that is worth less to them than getting some help. See, it’s not about you.

, Ask for an honest portfolio review. If you are serious about working for a particular firm, you need to be looking 3-5 years out. Go in as a disciple and get honest, brutal feedback about where your portfolio needs to be in order to come back a few years from now. Tell them up front this is what you are after! However, show up dressed to impress and ready to shine. If you’ve got the chops now, they will work you in or pass you onto a friend in need of help. If not, you know your work isn’t there yet… yet. Your foot is in the door and you have a clear idea of what you need to work on.All portfolio review interviews are good. If your idol turns out to be an ass you’ve saved yourself years of prepping for a job you wouldn’t want. If you find them a mensch, joy all around! They will remember you and reward your hard work. Anything in between is good interview experience and well worth your time.

, Jobs happen when you follow up. Send thank you cards, send emails, send postcards. Diligence counts. Be gracious and thankful, even to the asses. Why? At the end of the day it’s about the person you are, not the work you do.

, If you do not have letterhead, it is ok to skip this step. If you are currently employed as a consultant or if you are applying for a contract, you should have letterhead made.

,, This should follow the standard format of a formal letter.

, Before you start the letter with “Dear Hiring Manager:” look at the email, company website and job posting to see if they contain the name of the person in charge of hiring.


This attention to detail and personalization in your salutation can make a big difference next to hundreds of cover letters that say “To Whom it May Concern:”
If you cannot find the name of the person, address it “Dear Department Head” with the name of the department to which you are applying.”
If you cannot find the name of the department, try “Dear Director” or “Dear Hiring Manager.” Use LinkedIn to find the hiring manager’s name.

, This is the preferred opener for all cover letters, because it establishes a connection to the company.


For example, “John Smith recommended that I get in touch with you about the general manager position at EnviroRent.”
If you do not know anyone at the company, do some research to establish a distinctive first line. Your next choice can be admiring a recent lecture, job or initiative the company did that attracted you.

A generic, cookie-cutter cover letter is unlikely to make the cut. The more information you have, and the more specific you can be, the better.Study the company’s website closely. Look for anything that makes it distinctive in relation to its peers, or how it presents itself as being different.
Use a mission statement, for example, as a guide for how to present yourself. How do you “answer” it with your experience and skills?
Gather all the details you can about the nature of the position itself. Read the advertisement carefully. Reach out to the contact person on the job ad for more information. Think about how the specifics of this job meet the specific qualities you offer.;
, As the person in charge of reading through applications scans over your cover letter, he or she needs to see an immediate, clear explanation of why you are the right one for the job. Your letter essentially has to answer several key questions, including:“Who am I?” and “What have I done?”
“Why do I want this (specific) job?”
“Why should you want me for this (specific) job?”
“What do I have (attributes, skills, experiences, etc.) that you need?”
Space and word counts are at a premium in a cover letter, so make sure every part of it is addressing one of the key questions.

, Some studies indicate that the average cover letter is looked over for only about fifteen seconds. Therefore, you need to make an immediate, positive impression with both the look and content of your letter to stand a chance of avoiding the reject pile.Some job postings may list word or page limits for cover letters. You can also ask the contact person if there are any. Otherwise, cover letters should tend toward the shorter side of the following limits: 1-2 pages, 300-750 words, 3-5 paragraphs.
A single-page cover letter is usually ideal, but not if it is cramped and difficult to read or even scan over. You need to place things where they are typically located, and at the same time make your key points easily accessible. Make sure you get the maximum out of your fifteen seconds.
A cover letter is your opportunity to “personalize” your resume. They should complement each other to present a quick yet thorough portrait of you as a strong job candidate., It is tempting to try to stuff your cover letter with every positive achievement and quality you can think of about yourself. However, it is best to create a focal point — one primary factor (skill, experience, quality, etc.) that answers the key questions and makes you a necessary contender for the position.Mention several reasons why you are suited for the job, but hone in on one as the main reason to consider you. It may be your academic achievements in rigorous and relevant coursework; your prior successful experience in the industry; a successful internship with a glowing recommendation; or your experiences / skills in another field that have prepared you for the rigors of this position (for instance, problem-solving and quick decision-making in the military).
You want the person reading your letter to think “This person would meet our need for this position because she (has the most relevant and successful field experience, or whatever it may be in your case).”

, A simple search for “how to write a cover letter for a banking job” will produce not only this article, but countless websites offering free (or “free”) cover letter templates, or just plain copy-and-paste letters. In a competitive field like banking and the tight current job market, however, there is no such thing as one-size-fits-all cover letter.For example, you can easily find a solid template and sample cover letter for a loan officer position. You can observe its three paragraph format and use of bullet points in paragraph two to emphasize the most critical information.But this should provide only inspiration for a letter tailored to the precise job you are seeking.
If you are sending out several applications to different banks, you can use the same rough template and perhaps even the (generally) same introductory and concluding sections. But the heart of your letter, the central paragraph(s), should for the most part be specifically crafted with each particular position in mind.

, If you only get fifteen seconds to make an impression with your cover letter, you may think that bold fonts or colors, distinctive formatting, or creative language or imagery might make your work stand out. Instead, it will probably speed its rejection.


With many letters to read and quick decisions to make, the people assessing applications want to be able to find what they need quickly and without distracting changes or errors. Nothing but the content of the text should occupy their attention.
For instance, while a distinctively blunt and self-effacing cover letter might possibly make the corporate email rounds and even prompt an interview out of curiosity,your best bet is to stick to tried-and-true stylistic elements and let your assertion of your qualifications stand out.
Along with the tips provided here, How to Write a Cover Letter to Human Resources provides a wealth of guidance on writing cover letters in general. Refer to it specifically for tips on cover letter formatting not explicitly discussed here.

, With space constraints and a need to make an immediate impression, your cover letter cannot afford extraneous information. Every paragraph, every sentence, even every word should be there because it makes an impact.


The five paragraph format is a classic for short essays, and it can function well for cover letters as well. Consider the following paragraph layout if using it:The first paragraph briefly introduces who you are and the position you seek.
Paragraph two is where you “sell” yourself as an ideal candidate by expressing exactly why you should be chosen.
Paragraph three is where you explain why you want to work for this company. A slight hint of flattery and a lot of research will go a long way.
Paragraph four explains why you want this specific job, and what precisely you will bring to it.
Paragraph five is your brief “call to action,” where you reiterate your “why” answers and provide a request to be contacted and your thanks.


For even more efficient space utilization, especially if you have a tight word limit for the letter, consider a three paragraph format instead:Paragraph one is still your brief introduction, but with even greater emphasis on noting the scope of your skills or experience, and highlighting any contacts you may have within the company (such as the recruiter you met).
Paragraph two is now the singular heart of your letter, where you target in on one key reason (while mentioning a few others as support) why you can be the person who solves their problem / need. You want to compel them to look at your resume closely.
Paragraph three is still the “call to action.”



, It is essential that you let readers know who you are, what position you seek, and why in the first few lines of your letter. But you cannot afford to waste words or space that will be needed elsewhere.


You should aim for at most two to three sentences for your introduction; sticking to 35 total words, especially if you must stick with a one-page letter, will also leave ample space for the central paragraph(s).“Greetings. My name is X, and I am applying for position Y” is brief but dull and unimaginative. Allow your introduction to introduce not only you, but the central components of your case for being hired: “Greetings. My name is X, and with my fifteen successful years of serving client needs both inside and outside the financial sector, I am ready to bring my knowledge and experience to position Y.”

, Everybody wants to let it be known that they are “motivated,” “determined,” “trustworthy,” and so on, and that is the problem. You want your letter to be just different enough from all the rest, in part by cultivating a greater sense of urgency and excitement.Use active phrases that focus on results and outcomes. Make it clear that you have gotten things done in the past and will continue to do so in this new position.
For instance, consider the differing impact of the following two statements: “I’m a highly competent change management professional who has worked on a number of projects at major banks,” versus “I managed a team of eighteen technology and business analyst staff who successfully switched to a major new payments system six weeks ahead of time and 8% under budget.”The more specific you can be in a limited number of words, the better.

, Yes, substance is the key, but style means something as well when it comes to banking cover letters. As mentioned, you want a clean, uncluttered, easy to navigate look that is familiar to the eye of the reviewer.


Certain fields in academia, for instance, may frown upon the use of bullet points in cover letters, but in the banking field at least, they are a common way to draw the reader’s attention to the most essential information.
Your central paragraph could indeed be almost entirely bullet points, introduced by a brief sentence fragment that ends with a colon, so each bullet can start with an active verb. Examples might include “developing,” “utilizing,” and “adapting.”For maximum impact, tie your bullet points to similar (but not identical) sections of your resume. They want to appear as complementary components of a single entity, without being differently-formatted copies., It is uncanny how a fresh set of eyes can be immediately drawn to typographic errors. This can be your ally, if you let other people read over your cover letter, or your enemy, if the person deciding your fate catches it.No matter how many times you pore over the letter yourself — and you should look it over — always rely on a trusted person to read it over as well. Use someone knowledgeable in the banking field, if possible, so they can suggest industry-specific clarifications, additions, or excisions.
Always look for ways to cut words from your letter. A cover letter that references all the necessary information can never really be too short. The fewer words there are, the greater percentage will be scanned during the letter’s fifteen seconds or so of initial review.

Understand what a cover letter is.,
Use a cover letter if you are specifically instructed to do so by your potential employer.,
Send in a cover letter if the application asks you to reveal your personality.,
Use a cover letter if you think you might not be the best fit for the job, but you really want the job anyway.,
Include a cover letter when you want to include a referral.",How to Know Whether to Use a Cover Letter or a Value Proposition Letter1," A cover letter is a manuscript in which you describe your past accomplishments, and how those accomplishments make you the perfect candidate for the job you are applying for.


The cover letter allows your potential employer to draw his or her own conclusions about you based on the work you have already done.;
, When applying for a job, your potential employer may have a specific list of documents the company requires of an applicant. On that list may be a cover letter; if you see a request for a cover letter anywhere on an application, it is very important that you include this letter.


If you are looking at a company’s job listings and you see that they require a resume and a CV, know that this means you must include a cover letter (CV).

, Cover letters can be a great way for a potential employer to become familiar with your specific personality, which they take into account along with your work experience.


Use your cover letter as a way to address certain qualities that the application lists. For example, if the application or job listing states that the company is looking for someone who is enthusiastic and passionate, use your cover letter to demonstrate that you have these qualities.
Cover letters also allow you to convey your interests, which can help your potential employer decide if you are a good fit for the company.

, If you have only a little experience in the field you are applying to, or do not fit some of the other requirements in the job listing, you should send along a cover letter when you apply. This is because your resume, at face value, might not stand out from the other applicants, but your cover letter can attract the recruiter’s attention.


In this instance, use your cover letter to demonstrate closely related skills, experience, or similar responsibilities you have had in the past to those that you would have at the company you are applying to.
Your cover letter can also help your potential employer see your resume through your eyes; you can discuss why you should be considered for the job, despite your lack of experience or skill in a particular area.

, While you cannot mention a referral in your resume, you can mention one in a cover letter. A cover letter can be used to show your relationship to the person that gave you the referral, as well as why you feel this referral is important.

"
"
Understand what a value proposition letter is.,
Use a proposition letter when you are not instructed to include a cover letter.,
Include a proposition letter when you are conducting a targeted job search.,
Employ the use of a proposition letter if you want the employer to take action to hire you, even if there is no vacancy at the company.",How to Know Whether to Use a Cover Letter or a Value Proposition Letter2," A value proposition letter is more concerned with what value and benefits you can bring to the company, rather than your past accomplishments. It essentially allows you to sell yourself to the company by describing how you think your skills could benefit the company and make it profitable.


In a proposition letter, you essentially present yourself as a brand that will add value to the company you are applying to. This allows you to convey the fact that you understand the company’s problems, and are equipped to solve them.

, If your potential employer does not specifically request a cover letter, you can use this lack of a request to use a proposition letter instead.

, A targeted job search is when you are only applying to a specific company for a specific job because you know it is the job you want, and that you could be very successful at it.


Make sure to conduct thorough research of the company and the position, so that you can know exactly how to market yourself and show that you can fix the company’s problems, or pick up slack where necessary.

, Employers are usually interested to learn about what value you can bring to the company, regardless of your past work. Because your resume only discusses what you have done in the past, you need to use a proposition letter to discuss what you can do for the company in the future.


Through a proposition letter you can tactfully quantify your potential, and can demonstrate the benefits that you will bring to the company.

"
"
Understand that there is a middle ground between cover and proposition letter.,
Use this combination letter if you want to focus on the present instead of the past.,
Include a combination letter when you want to be concise.,
Consider using a combination letter when you can easily offer tangible results.",How to Know Whether to Use a Cover Letter or a Value Proposition Letter3," If you want to demonstrate your past work, and thus your abilities, while also proving how you can be beneficial to the company, you can create a hybrid of both the cover and proposition letter.


In essence, you would write a cover letter, with the details of a proposition letter included in the bulk of the letter.

, This combination letter can work well if you are currently employed and want to show how you can transfer your current skills to the company that you are applying to.


Build upon your current behavior and achieved goals to reinforce how you can benefit this new company.

, When you can easily describe the benefits you can bring the company in a few words or sentences, consider using a cover letter than resembles a proposition letter.


Consider adding bullet points emphasizing your accomplishments and unique qualifications that can set you apart from the other candidates.

, If you have numerical figures that can demonstrate your abilities, use them. Employers enjoy seeing the results you have gotten for your current company, so that they can hypothesize the results you could get for their own company.

Read the job advertisement.,
Search the company’s website.,
Use your network connections.,
Call the company.,
Look for titles.,
Use a formal salutation.,
Proofread your letter.,
Keep it short.,
Use the right format.",How to Address a Cover Letter," Most job ads will include direct instructions on how to apply. For example, near the bottom of some job postings, it will say ""Apply to the attention of...” and then give a name., If the hiring manager’s name is not available in the ad, check the company’s website. Tracking down a name will make your letter more personal, which stands out in the applicant pile. It also shows your willingness to do research, a good sign for a future employer.While the advertisement may not have a direct name, it will have some contact information, perhaps an email address or phone number. Use those when searching the company directory to see whose name comes up, and address your letter to that person. Many companies will list hiring managers and department heads on their website.
If you have a specific name to search for, but no contact information, examine the way the company lays out its email addresses. Most businesses will use a set convention, such as firstname.lastname@business.com. Searching for a specific address written in the company’s preferred style will likely turn up additional information you need. Finding addresses like this can also be a method for cold-contacting managers higher in the company. This can be a good way to build connections, but will be less helpful if you try asking directly for a job.
If searching for an email or phone number doesn’t turn up a specific name, look for the person you would be reporting to, a manager or department head.

, Chances are you won’t be approaching this company blindly. You will be able to get some information about the business and its employees through a variety of additional means beyond the business itself.If you are applying on the recommendation of someone else, ask that person who will be handling your letter.
Track down people in the business through a social site like LinkedIn. You can search the site for people with particular titles or positions within the company used its advanced search functions.
A site like LinkedIn also allows you to ask your connections to introduce you to their connections. This is helpful if they know people in the company you are applying to, especially if it is the hiring manager. Send the person a note asking for the introduction, making sure to include why you want the introduction.

, If the name is not available in the advertisement, and you cannot get anything from a company directory, call the company directly. When you talk to someone there, be sure to ask directly for the name of the person to whom you should be addressing your letter.Make sure you know the title of the position you are applying for, and any other information like a search number, to help the person on the other end get the right name.

, However you find the hiring manager’s name, make sure you also find out any titles he or she uses. You need this to address your letter properly, and you don’t want to refer to a “he” as a “she.”


Take note of special titles like “Dr.” or “Your Honor” (for a judge), or political titles like “Senator” or “Assemblymen.”

, This is your introduction to the company, so you should be as professional as possible. Use the hiring managers first and last name, and include the title “Mr.” or “Ms.” You can use additional titles such as “Dr.” if appropriate.If you cannot determine the appropriate gender, and don’t have a more neutral title like “Dr.” available, drop the title.
If you cannot find an individual name, you may address a group of people, such as “Hiring Professionals” or “Selection Committee.”There are an increasing number of companies that are more informal, and it might be more in keeping with their culture to use first name only. If you are familiar with the company’s practices, and know this would be acceptable, go ahead and use the first name only. Of course, if you aren’t sure, it is always best to stay professional.

, For the purposes of addressing the letter, pay special attention to spelling the hiring manager’s name properly. It will be one of the first things they notice, and misspelling the manager’s name will not help you stand out in a good way. It will appear careless and sloppy right away, not the image you want to project., Your cover letter is only meant to be an introduction, not a complete work history (that’s what your resume is for). Your cover letter shouldn’t be any longer than a page, and if you can make it even shorter, that’s a good idea., Check the job ad to see what format to use for your letter. If the ad asks for a PDF, you don’t want to submit a Word Document. If you are working in the incorrect format, make sure you convert the file before submitting your application."
"
Select the people you think would make good references.,
Ask the people you would like to use as references if it is ok to do so.,
List your references on a separate page from any other information you may be turning in with your application (such as a resume, cover letter, etc.),
Format your references in the same way as your resume.,
Create a heading at the top of the page.,
Create a title for your page.,
Create your list of references.,
Write down the rest of your references.,
Check the spelling for each listing.",How to List References in a Cover Letter," Generally companies will ask for two to three references, if they ask for any references at all. Just in case, make a list of four to five people you think would be good, on the off chance that one of the people you select does not want to be a reference. You should pick people who have worked closely with you in a school or work setting. Choose former supervisors, employers, coordinators, or teachers or faculty members who can share information about the positive abilities, skills and qualifications you have to offer.


You could also select colleagues, peers or co-workers who can provide insight to your work ethic, skill levels and abilities. People who can provide examples detailing your positive qualities because of your work relationships are effective references.
Consider people with whom you've volunteered or worked with through a non-profit organization. Despite not being paid for your work, you may have shown leadership or other skills that can be valuable as a candidate for a job or higher education. People with whom you've volunteered may be able to share details about your skills.;
, Some people would prefer not to be contacted by companies wanting to get an idea of your character. However, most people will say yes, particularly if they are close to you in some way. Do not give out their contact information to potential employers unless they give you their explicit permission. Find out how they would best like to be contacted (for example, cell phone, email, etc.)When asking someone to be your reference, make sure that they plan on giving you a positive recommendation. You should try to select people you know will give you an excellent recommendation.

, Only do this if the company you are applying to specifically asks that you provide references. If you are applying for housing (such as when you wish to rent an apartment), you will most likely have to provide references with your housing application.


You should not mention references unless you are asked to do so by the company or program you are applying to.

, Use the same fonts, sizes, dividers, graphics and phrasing methods. Your references sheet should be a complementary piece to your resume., Write your name out at the top of the page in a large, clear font in bold. Write your address, phone number, and email in a smaller font underneath your name.If you would like to make a clear break between your header and the content of your page, add a line below your contact information.

, The title should be about the same size as your name. Your title should be to the point--do not make it flowery in any way. Something like “References” or “Professional References for (Your Name)” would work.

, You do not need to list your references in a specific order. If you have a reference who is “best” (someone you know very well and will give you a stellar review) you could list this person first. Otherwise, you could organize your list so that it is alphabetical.


Write down your first reference. His or her name should be in bold. Underneath his/her name, write his/her relationship to you (ie. Professor, or Boss) and the company or program that you both worked for.
Write down the company’s address if your reference still works at that company. If he/she does not, do not list any address.
List your reference’s contact information a line below your relationship to your reference. This should be the contact information they provided you--either a telephone number, email, or both.

, Do so by following the format detailed above. If you are listing a lot of references, you could format your list so that your references are placed in categories (ie. References from School, References from Work, etc.) This is optional and only should be done if you must list many references.

, Spelling errors on your reference page can reflect poorly on you.

Send your cover letter in the manner requested.",How to End a Cover Letter," Think deeply about why you want this job. What true statement can you make about why you think this is the right place for you to work, and why the company should hire you? Authenticity is key when it comes to helping your cover letter stand out from everyone else's. There's no need to get too personal or emotional, but a heartfelt line about why you're right for the job is appropriate. Saying something like ""The chance to join your office would be a tremendous opportunity"" isn't going to hurt your chances.;
, What information from your cover letter most qualifies you for the job? The final paragraph is your last chance to proclaim how perfect your skills are for the company to which you're applying.Don't just repeat the same information, though. Be a bit more specific about the experience or qualifications that make you right for the role.


You might refer to the mission of the company. This is a good strategy because it demonstrates you understand what the company does and that you want to be a part of the organization. Referencing the company's outstanding reputation does not hurt your changes either.
Some people also take a risk and add some flair to their cover letter ending. If you're going to crack a joke or use colorful language, you stand the chance of turning off the potential employer. But on the other hand, being funny might be just the ticket.
No matter what, make sure your cover letter's ending matches the overall tone of your cover letter.

, The conclusion is your opportunity to repeat your excitement about the job and your ability to do the job well.For example, you might write: “I am very excited about the opportunity to make an immediate and valuable contribution to your company.”

, Remind the employer how your skillset will transfer to the company and be put to use. What will you bring to the company? Focus on how the company will improve by hiring you, rather than how you will benefit.For example, you might write: “My professional skills in marketing, coupled with my passion for your products, will enable me to help grow the business segment.”

, Your application may require that you send a resume, writing samples, or other materials with your cover letter. Mention that you are enclosing them in the envelope or attaching them to the email you're sending. ""My resume is enclosed"" or ""I am enclosing my resume"" are both fine ways of putting it.


If you are including recommendation letters that will be sent separately by your references, you might write: “Recommendation letters from Dr. Patricia Smith and Dr. Joseph Johnson will arrive under separate cover.”

, Most applicants don’t explicitly state that they would like an interview for a job. But some experts think that you’re more likely to get an interview if you ask for one.For example, you can write: “Please call me at (your phone number) to schedule an interview at your earliest convenience.”

, Depending upon the contact information you have for the company, write that you will follow up next week with a phone call or email to ensure your application was received. Tell the employer that you can also answer any preliminary questions at that time. Include this kind of action that you'll be taking in order to demonstrate initiative. This will also help move your application forward.For example, write: “I will follow up my application with a phone call next week.”
It is very important that you follow through on the promise you make in your cover letter. If you say you’re going to follow up on your application, do so.
It is also important to note if a company requests no phone call inquiries. If this is the case, email instead.

, Always thank the reader for her time and consideration. It shows that you are polite and respectful of her time, something of great value in a busy work environment.

, When you're writing a business letter, your closing word or term options are limited, but you should still choose carefully. Be sure the closing is in keeping with the tone of your letter and appropriate for the type of company to which you're applying.


""Sincerely,"" and “Regards,” are old standards that are fine to use for any employer.
""Best regards,"" or ""All the best,"" are commonly used in business situations these days, and both are safe bets.
""Warmly yours,"" or ""With gratitude,"" are less common, but if you know the person who is reading your letter, you might choose one of these options. Don't use them if you're writing to someone you've never met.
Capitalize only the first word in the phrase, and end the phrase with a comma., Leave four lines blank and then type your name. If it’s appropriate, include your title as well. Include your signature above your typed name. Sign with a good quality pen in blue or black ink.


If you are sending an electronic cover letter, it’s still a good idea to include your written signature. You can create a digital signature by signing a piece of paper, scanning it into the computer, and creating a digital image file. Paste this image into the signature area of your letter., Include your phone number and email address again underneath your name. While you have included your contact information in the header of your cover letter, you should repeat this information so the employer can find it easily.


It’s especially important to include a contact number or email address if you have written more than one page. Then, your number will be right next to your name and will be easily found.

, For a formal business letter, you need to tell the reader that the letter has enclosures. You should make mention of them within the body of the letter, but you should also make note by typing “Enclosure” or “Encl.” underneath the signature block.


Standard business letters typically describe each enclosure: “Enclosures (2): Resume, Writing Sample.”

, It is essential to ensure that your cover letter is free from errors. You will not convey that you have attention to detail and professionalism if your cover letter has spelling and/or grammatical errors. Carefully comb through the letter for mistakes.


Ask someone else to read through your letter as well. This person might catch an error that you didn’t see.

, Many job applications require that you send the letters via email or through a job application website. It’s a good idea to convert a word processing document to a PDF. This way, you will embed all formatting and your document won’t risk looking incorrect when it’s opened.

, The employer will specify how she wants to receive materials. This may be in hard copy through the mail, or through a job application website, or via email. Whatever the delivery method, be sure to follow the employer’s instructions closely.


If you are sending the job application via email, you can choose to either include your cover letter in the body of the email, or you can include it as an attachment. If you do attach it as a separate document, write a brief cover letter in the body of the email to explain yourself briefly."

Review your cover letter one last time.",How to Include a Referral in a Cover Letter," Referrals are one of the most effective hiring practices for employers. Company referrals account for a large percentage of hires in today's job market. This is because managers often feel more confident hiring someone who has a connection to a current employee. Having a valuable referral can be one of your greatest advantages when applying for jobs., In order to capitalize on the advantage of having a referral, you need to make sure that you are utilizing your current connections. Make sure that you are familiar with the people in both your professional and social networks. Obvious candidates for referrals are people that you have met through work, such as former bosses or co-workers. Stay current on where they work and what their role is.There are also other ways to find someone to serve as a referral for you. For example, utilize your contacts from alumni organizations, social networks, and professional organizations. Of course, it is also important to make sure that your Linked-In profile is current so that potential employees can find you that way.

, Once you have identified someone who might potentially serve as your referral, make sure to approach them confidently and respectfully. Be as specific as possible in stating what you need. Tell your contact which position you are applying for, the hiring manager to whom you will be sending your letter, and that you would like to list your contact's name as a referral in your cover letter. You can make this request in person, over the phone, or via e-mail.


Whichever contact method you choose, make sure it is both personal and professional. For example, if you choose to make the request via e-mail, you might say something like, ""Dear Jane, It was wonderful meeting you at the Annual Meeting of the People Who Have a Job Similar to Mine. I enjoyed our conversation! I'm currently looking for a new position, and I notice that your company has an opening for Manager of Important Things. I'm very interested in this job, and think I would be an excellent fit. Would you be willing to serve as a referral? I would like to use your name in my cover letter, if you are agreeable.""

, Once you have made the initial request, you will begin working on your cover letter. As you are working on the draft, follow up with the person serving as your referral. This will remind the contact that they have agreed to help you, and will ensure that he knows you were serious about your intention to apply for the position. Again, you can make this confirmation with either a quick phone call or an e-mail.


For example, if you choose to confirm with a phone call, you could say, ""Hello, Joe. I just wanted to let you know that I am in the process of finishing up my cover letter for the position at your company. I wanted to confirm that you're fine with me using your name as a referral. I really appreciate your help.""

, If the person who will be reading your cover letter won't recognize the name of your referral, your use of that referral will greatly decrease in value. Make sure that when you ask for a referral that you tell your reference who the hiring manager is and make sure that they know one another. It is also important to make sure the two are on good terms., Although these connections are valuable, they will not help you if you abuse the relationship or try to take advantage of a potential connection. Do not ask someone to be a referral if you are not truly qualified for the job. Referral programs work because there people typically only refer someone whom they truly believe would succeed in the position. Don't try to take advantage of someone by applying for a job if you are not really qualified. Also, if you don't actually know someone, don't ask for a referral. Instead, work on building your relationship until they can confidently recommend you., The first paragraph of your cover letter is extremely important because it sets the tone for the rest of your letter. By beginning with mentioning your referral, you are immediately setting yourself apart from other candidates. You are also making an impact on the hiring manager by making a connection--now the two of you have something in common (you know the same person) which will help the manager remember you as the hiring process goes along.

, Instead of just mentioning the person's name, make sure that you explain your relationship. Clearly state how long you have known them, how you know them, and that they recommend you apply for this job. This will emphasize to the hiring manager that this is a valuable reference.


For example, you could write, ""Mary Smith, your sales manager, recommended that I apply for this job. Mary and I have known each other through the executive board of the Association for Sales Managers, and over the past five years, we have worked together on many projects for that organization.""

, Your resume should be a fairly comprehensive account of your skills. Your cover letter is the place to elaborate on how your skills specifically relate to the job you want. Choose 2-3 of the most appropriate skills and elaborate on them in the body paragraphs of your cover letter.For example, you could write, ""I excel at interpersonal communication. In my current role, I am responsible for managing a team of seven other employees and providing them with verbal feedback.""

, The hiring manager wants to know that you are aware of what they expect from their new hire. Pay careful attention to the wording in the job advertisement. Companies will generally be somewhat specific in listing their requirements.


One effective way to convey your understanding is by writing, ""Your advertisement notes that you are looking to improve your employee training program. I have significant experience in this area, and in fact, have developed several onboarding methods that would benefit your organization."", Close with an emphatic statement about why you are right for the job. This is also a good time to explain why you are so interested in the position. Doing so will help demonstrate that you have done your research and are serious about being hired. Be clear about why both the position and the company appeal to you.An example of a strong statement is, ""I am excited about this opportunity because I am seeking a new professional challenge, and heading up your training program is something I can confidently handle. Additionally, your company has a reputation for a positive corporate culture that I think would be an ideal fit for my outgoing personality.""

, Your cover letter is your first impression, so you want to make sure it presents your skills and personality in the best possible way. First, edit for spelling and grammar errors. Make sure to conform to all standard language rules. Get rid of any spelling errors or sloppy sentences. Next, edit your cover letter for content. This is the time to make sure that you have clearly and concisely covered all of the points that you wanted to emphasize. Make sure you sound knowledgeable and confident when discussing your skills. , Carefully reread the job ad. Sometimes employers will specify additional materials that they would like you to send. For example, if you are applying for a graphic design job, the potential employer might request a portfolio of your work so that they can visually see examples of your work. Or, if you are seeking a job that requires a lot of writing, the prospective employer might ask for a writing sample. Make sure you include everything that is required.

, After you are ready to send in your application materials, follow up with the person serving as your referral. This serves two purposes. First, it reminds them that the hiring manager may call them to ask about you, and your reference will be ready. Second, it is a good opportunity to thank them for serving as a referral. You can touch base over the phone, in person, or via e-mail.If you choose to follow up with an e-mail, you could write, ""Dear Bob, Thank you again for agreeing to let me use you as a referral. I just wanted to let you know that I am sending my letter to Stan at your company. I'm attaching a copy, for your information.""

, Hopefully, you've had some time to clear your head and walk away from your cover letter for a short while. Now, come back and make your final revisions. You might try reading it out loud, printing it off and making changes with a pen, or having a friend read it for you. Make sure to avoid passive voice and any vague sentences.


Edit any sentences such as, ""The big project was completed by me."" Instead, try ""I successfully completed revising the training manual ahead of deadline.""

Approach any connections that you have in the field where the teenager is looking for work. Many people are more likely to take a chance on a teenager if he is referred to them by someone they know.






Tell your friends and associates that you are looking for a part-time job for a teenager, and mention the type of work she would like to do. You never know who might have someone in their network that can help.

, Many businesses routinely hire temporary summer and year-round teenage employees but don't need to advertise because the jobs fill easily. The following types of businesses are often good places to inquire:


Retail stores that sell everything from groceries to hardware to clothing hire teenage employees.






Fast food and restaurants. Although the work may not be what the teenager is looking for in the long-term, this can be a great place to gain work experience.
Hotels, resorts and tourist attractions frequently hire teenagers for part-time work during their busy season.
Tennis and golf clubs. Any business that is only open during the nice weather relies on a lot of part time help for their labor force.
Summer camps, both day and overnight. At most summer camps, the counselors are teenagers. Overnight camps typically require counselors to live on location.

,


City, state, and national parks and recreation departments often run programs that create job opportunities.






Summer job programs, sponsored by various government agencies, offer youth job opportunities in various fields. Information on summer job programs is usually available at your local high school or town hall.

, Parents can talk to experts in a field who can take her as an intern. For example, if a child is interested in cars, why not send him to a garage?

,,


Skillpages, Facebook, Linkedin are great websites to find jobs; like freelance writing.







, Often there is plenty of opportunities right in her neighborhood such as:


Babysitting, for a teen who likes children. Encourage her to team up with friends when offering the sitting service; this increases the chances of being able to say yes to a job when a call comes in. It is a good idea for teenagers who want to provide child care to take a Red Cross first aid class so they are prepared to handle emergencies.






Pet Care for busy pet owners who are willing to pay someone to walk their dog, clean the yard of dog waste, or feed their animals when they are away.
Lawn or yard care. Teens can offer outdoor home services year round. In the spring and summer, she can mow lawns, trim hedges and tend gardens; in the fall she can rake leaves and do yard cleanup; and in the winter she can shovel snow.
Clean houses. As long as she is good at it and doesn't mind the work, housecleaning for others every week or every other week can be lucrative part-time work for a teenager.
Errand running for busy people, including grocery shopping and picking up their dry cleaning. Depending on where the teen lives and the availability of public transportation, a car may be required for this type of work.
Home cooking and baking. People still want home cooking and baking but don't often have the time to do it, providing an opportunity for others who are good in the kitchen to cook and bake for cash.
Teach others something that she knows how to do. If she is good on the computer and has patience, she could teach elderly people. If she knows how to play the guitar, she could give lessons.

Include a salutation.,
Write the first paragraph of your letter.,
Write the body paragraphs of your letter.,
Write the final paragraph of your letter.,
End your cover letter with a respectful closing statement.",How to Write a Cover Letter2," There are a number of cover letters to choose from. And, the greeting you choose will depend on how much information you have about the company.


If you know the name of the hiring manager, your salutation should be something like ""Dear "" followed by either a comma or a colon. Make sure to address the manager formally using their proper title (Mr., Ms., Dr., etc.).
If you don't know the name of the hiring manager, consider addressing your letter ""Dear Hiring Manager,"" ""Dear Recruiting Team,"" or ""Dear Team.""
As a last resort, address the letter ""To whom it may concern,"" though we recommend avoiding this salutation, as it could come across as a template letter.

, This is where you will mention the job for which you're applying and how you found the job listing. It only needs to be 1 to 2 sentences in length.

, Most cover letters will only have 1 or 2 body paragraphs. You don't want to overwhelm the hiring manager or use up a great deal of their time. Try to answer the following questions in your body paragraphs:


Why am I a qualified candidate for this position?
What work experience do I have that fits the job requirements in the company's listing?
Why do I want to work for this company specifically?

, This will be where you wrap up and discuss how you will proceed with the application. Consider including the following:


Reiterate in one sentence why you feel you're a perfect fit for the position.
Discuss what you'll do next. If you plan on following up with the hiring manager in a week or two, include a specific date. Otherwise, just say that you look forward to interviewing for the position and discussing your qualifications further.
Provide your contact information. Include your email address and your phone number so the hiring manager can get in touch with you.
Mention that your resume or references are attached (if applicable).
Thank the person for their time.

, ""Best"" or ""Sincerely"" are both classic options. Also, since you won't be able to sign your email, finish the letter by typing your full name.

"
"
Add a letterhead at the top of the letter.,
Write the recipient’s name, address, and the date below the letterhead.,
Address the recipient.,
State your purpose in the first paragraph.,
Outline your qualifications in the middle paragraph(s).,
Include a positive statement or question in the final paragraph that will motivate the employer to contact you.,
Write an appropriate closing.,
Add your signature.,
Make a notation of the enclosures.",How to Write a Cover Letter3," Your letterhead should include your full name, address, telephone number, and email address. Some guidelines to follow when creating your letterhead:


Your name should be in bold 14- or 16-point font.
Your address and other contact information should be in normal 12-point font.
The font of your letterhead does not need to be Arial or Times New Roman, like the rest of your letter, but it should be professional looking and easy to read. The most important thing to remember is to include up-to-date information so that you make it easy for the employer to contact you.
You may want to include an extra line under the letterhead to create visual appeal and to separate the letterhead from the rest of the letter.

, It doesn't matter whether you put the date first or last, or how many blank lines you include between them, as long as it looks professional.


From here on out, use 12-point Arial or Times New Roman throughout the entire letter, set your margins to one inch, and use single spacing. Be sure your font is black, and if you're printing your letter out, use standard-sized paper (8 1/2” by 11”).

, Be sure to refer to the recipient by his or her proper title (Mrs., Mr., Dr., etc.). If you’re not sure who the recipient is, write, “To Whom It May Concern:” or “Dear Sir or Madam”; however, it is always best to address a cover letter to a real person to make it look like you’re not sending form letters.

, Tell the employer why you are writing to them in two or three sentences. State the position for which you are applying (or the one you would like to have should it become available).


You don't necessarily need to include how you became aware of the position unless it was through a mutual contact or recruiting program—in which case you should make the most of the connection.
If you are writing a letter of interest (also known as a prospecting or inquiry letter) in which you are asking about positions that might be available, specify why you are interested in working for the employer.

, Make sure to match them to the requirements of the position. If you are writing to inquire about open positions, tell the employer how you can contribute to their bottom line, not what you want to get out of the deal. To do this, use what you have researched about the employer's background and history.


Make your qualifications jump out at the reader by researching the company to which you are applying for a job and tailoring your letter accordingly. This will also be useful if you get an interview. Some questions to keep in mind as you write are

What is the employer's mission? What do they promote as the one thing that sets them apart from their competitors?
What kind of customer base does the employer have? Who is their target audience?
What is the company's history? Who founded it? How has the business evolved? What are the main highlights of the company's performance over the past few years?



, Make this closing paragraph between two to four sentences. Direct the employer to your enclosed resume and make sure you specify that you're available for an interview. Finish off by thanking the recruiter for their time and consideration, and welcome them to get in touch with you to continue the conversation.

, It’s a good idea to thank the reader for his or her time. After that, write “Sincerely,” “Respectfully,” or “Regards,” leave several spaces, and print your name.

, If you will be submitting your cover letter digitally, it’s a good idea to scan and add your signature, write it in with a digital writing pad, or make a digital signature stamp with appropriate software.

, If you enclose something, such as a resume, with a letter, you should indicate that the letter contains enclosures by making the notation “Enclosure” or “Enclosures” at the bottom of the letter.

"
"
Spell-check and proofread.,
Read your letter aloud to hear how it reads.",How to Write a Cover Letter4," If you have a spell-check feature, use it. Some programs, such as Microsoft Word, also include a grammar check that you should use. Proofread your letter yourself. Some things to avoid are



Common misspellings.
Writing in the passive voice. Own your accomplishments. Stay away from phrases like ""This experience gave me the opportunity to...,"" or worse, ""these goals were met by me."" You don't want to sound like everything happened to you or that it was done by some other entity. Make yourself the active subject of every sentence (e.g., ""In this role, I developed/reinforced/learned/etc.""). However, this does not imply that every sentence should start with ""I..."" so vary your syntax accordingly.

Colloquial (informal) writing. You want to sound professional and educated. Avoid all forms of slang, unnecessary abbreviations, and texting lingo.

Incorrect punctuation.

, Do not rely on the spelling and grammar checks to catch mistakes. Consider asking a friend, or even two, to proofread your letter as well. If no one is available to help, another good strategy is to spend some time away from your final draft (a few hours or even a whole day) so that you can return to it with a fresh perspective.

"
"
Double-check some of the most-overlooked basics before you do anything.,
Ask yourself what skills do you possess that you are not using enough in your current role.,
Hammer down your current job or educational position.,
Provide a general description of your accomplishments/experiences in the field to which you are applying.,
Identify the assets can you offer to the company to which you are applying.,
Specify the type of job or level of the position you are seeking.",How to Write a Cover Letter5," While misspelling or misidentifying the name of the company you're applying to isn't the end of the world, it's not exactly starting off on the right foot. Double-check the following:


The complete name of the company to which you are applying for a job
The name of the person to whom you are addressing the cover letter
The address of the person to whom you are sending the letter
The title of the job for which you are applying and/or its reference number, if it exists

, Would the ideal candidate for this new role be required to make more use of those types of skills? What opportunities are missing in your current role? Answering these questions will help you explain why you are interested in leaving current position. For example, are you looking for:


""room for advancement""
""an opportunity to learn new skills""

, This may seem like an obvious question, but knowing how to clearly define your current role is a tremendous asset. For example, you could be a:


""graduate student in environmental science""
""customer service professional specializing in the high-end retail market""

, For example, you could have:


""fifteen years of excellent customer service experience""
""an outstanding background in scientific research and discovery""
""a solid history of dependability in the automotive industry""

, List a few in your cover letter, such as:


""extensive experience with start-ups""
""demonstrated ability to solve problems""
""refined ability to manage teams""
What will you help the company accomplish, if given the job you desire?
""increase its bottom line""
""meet its goal of providing only the best in customer service""
""expand its customer base and increase its revenue""

, Is it:


""entry-level""
""management""
""senior level""

Assess your circumstances.,
Schedule an appointment with your school counselor.,
Spread the word.,
Inquire directly with organizations, companies and nonprofit groups that align with your internship goals.,
Search Internet sources.",How to Find a Paid Summer Internship," Use your interests, experience, education and goals to find an internship suited for you. In addition to knowing the type of internship you are looking for, you should also have some clear ideas about what you hope to get out of the internship. For example, you may want to find an internship in marketing, and your goals may be to gain experience, establish industry contacts and put yourself in line for future employment within the company you intern for.;
, Whether you are in high school or college, your school's guidance counselor should be able to point you in the right direction when it comes to finding paid internships over the summer. Employers often list their internship opportunities with schools; as well, many schools offer their own internship programs.

, The people you know can be a great source for internship opportunities. Tell your friends, family, coworkers, teachers and acquaintances about the type of internship you are looking for, and ask if they know of any such openings.

, For example, if you are interested in serving a summer internship training under an architectural engineer, you may search the phone book and the Internet for architects and architectural firms in your area and ask if they offer paid internships to qualified students.

,


Websites like InternshipPrograms.com and Internships.com allow you to plug in your specifics and conduct searches of available summer paid internships that might be right for you.
You may be able to find a summer internship in the free classifieds listings of sites like Craigslist.
Consider interning abroad. There are a multitude of summer internship opportunities available to those who are interested in going overseas, and websites like GoAbroad.com help you find them.

Do extra chores.,
Tutor.,
Sell something.,
Be a pet sitter.,
Be a photographer.,
Be a house sitter.,
Sell lemonade or baked goodies.,
Wash cars, motorcycles or bicycles.",How to Find a Job As a Preteen," This does depend on how cooperative your parents are, but if you are polite in asking and explain why you want the spending money, they're likely to listen. It's an easy way to make 10 or 20 bucks (or more, if your parents are generous). You could give the whole bathroom a good scrub down, or vacuum and mop the entire house.


You could ask your mom which chores she hates doing the most, and pick those up for her. Wash all the windows you can reach, or pull weeds in your backyard. Be imaginative!
Get creative. Ask your parents and family for ways you could earn a little extra money, and keep thinking of ways yourself! Before you know it, you'll have enough spending money for anything you've wanted, through a little hard work and determination.;
, Do you know a kid younger than you who seems to be struggling in school? Offer to help them with their homework and help them understand what's being taught in class. Be tactful and polite when asking their parents, and prove your worth by showing them a report card and explaining your proficiency in whatever subject(s) their child is struggling in.


If they say no, don't be discouraged! There are always many children who need a little extra help, so keep asking around. Once you find one child to tutor, if his or her grades improve, you may get more parents who want your help. Just make sure to keep doing a good job.

, Do you have a bunch of old CDs that you haven't listened to in years? Or maybe a lot of baby dolls you never play with anymore, or some really old PlayStation games that are gathering dust? Collect everything together in one place, and ask your parents if you can have a mini-yard sale! Let them know you'll be responsible and set up everything yourself. They might give you other stuff to sell, like old clothes you wore when you were a kid, or old toys. Put up a table, and post signs around the neighborhood saying where and when the sale is. Arrange all your objects on the table, and think of appropriate prices- remember, don't make them too high! You can also sell something else at the sale to encourage other customers- perhaps the old classic, lemonade. Whatever you don't sell, donate to charity.


Read Have a Yard Sale for more information.

, This is something very similar to baby sitting but instead of a baby you have a pet. This could be a cat, a parrot or a puppy that is not yet comfortable to be left alone at home. You may only have to feed it, bathe it or walk it, but be responsible to make sure that the owner doesn't come home to a sick dog or a deceased cat.


Walk dogs if you live in a place where there are many dogs. You could charge 5-10$ for half an hour depending on where you live and make some good money. And if you are willing, you can poop-scoop people's yards for an additional fee.

, You will need a digital camera for this purpose and you should also know a thing or two about computers for this job. You could offer to cover birthday parties and other celebrations in your neighborhood. You need to practice a lot to perfect your skills here; you can add the final touches on the computer.


As a preteen, this job could be hard to sell to people. Make sure you are really good at the job.

, There are many people who worry about their plants or aquarium fish when they leave for vacation in the summer. Offer to water and weed the plants or feed the fish or take care of their pet(s) for as long as they are gone.

, Learn to make lemonade or any such foods that you can handle and your parents permit you to do. These could be sandwiches, cookies, cupcakes, etc. Set up your 'shop' on your property or in front of it. If you are doing it anywhere else, be sure you ask permission of the people who own the place.

, You can offer to wash cars, provided you really know what you are doing. To learn the 'trade' you will need to assist your dad a couple of times and then try your hand first with your own car. If you receive recognition at home, you ready to offer this service.

Make sure you have what you need before leaving the store.,
Place hot items in a heat bag.,
Secure your heat-bag.,
Know where you’re going.,
Drive safely.,
Find the right address.,
Deliver the pizza.,
Keep a tally of your tips.",How to Deliver a Pizza1," Once you’re out on the road, you’re stuck with what you got, so be sure that have the essentials before heading out. Most importantly, check that each order matches its receipt so you don’t show up at the door with something missing or the wrong order. Also, make sure you have:Enough cash and coins to make proper change if the customer is paying with cash.
At least one pen for the customer to sign credit card receipts, but preferably two in case one dries up.
A cellphone to contact the store, customer, or emergency services if necessary.;
, Keep in mind that the customer probably doesn’t want to reheat their food in the oven once it gets there. Put all hot items in one or more heat bags so they retain their heat. Be sure to seal them tight so no heat escapes.Don’t rush it and shove everything into a heat bag. Take the time to separate hot and cold items. The customer doesn’t want to have to reheat their pizza, but they don’t want a melted cannoli, either.

, First, place it on a level surface. Expect melted cheese to slide over the pie if it isn’t set flat. Use seat belts, straps, or something similar to hold it in place during sharp turns, sudden brakes, bumpy driving, and anything else that might cause the bag to move.

, Even with a heat bag, expect hot items to start cooling off as soon as they leave the oven. Refer to a map or find directions on your smartphone before you get moving. Find the shortest and/or quickest route to the customer’s door so the food is still as hot as possible upon delivery.Keep a map on hand even if you have a smartphone, just in case your phone goes on the fritz for some reason.

, You may feel tempted to put the pedal to the metal in order to make your delivery quickly, but don’t drive recklessly. Keep in mind that getting pulled over will cause a major delay (plus ticket fines and other hassles). Also, remember that getting a high tip isn’t worth the risk of getting into an accident. Make haste, but play it safe and observe the rules of the road., This can be a challenge, especially in the dark. Remember that odd-numbered buildings are usually on one side of the street, and even-numbered houses on the other. If you don’t find the one you’re looking for right away, use the ones that are easily read as reference points. For example, if you’re looking for 407 but can only see 411, then 407 is probably two buildings down.Depending on the neighborhood (how far apart the buildings are, how much parking is available), it may be quicker to park right away and find the right address on foot, as long as you’re sure you’re on the right block.

, Hold the heat bag by its bottom and keep it level. Greet the customer with a smile when they answer the door. Be patient with them, even if they’re slow in paying, impatient with you, or otherwise less than ideal. Be sure to give them the correct change if needed so they don’t feel slighted.Always keep an upbeat attitude, even if you’re having a bad night. Remember that you’re the face of your store, and acting out of sorts or impatient will dissuade the customer from ordering again or giving you a big tip.Some delivery people adopt the practice of rounding the total charge up to the nearest dollar to avoid the need for coins. Some customers may be fine with this, but others may take offense. If that’s the case, treat it like you made an innocent mistake and give them a simple apology, like, “You’re right! My bad. The exact charge is $17.60.”

, When the customer is paying cash, make a note of how much covers the total charge and how much is meant for you as a personal tip. Keep in mind that if the charge was, say, $17.37, they may just hand you a single $20 bill to cover both. Keep a log of the night’s deliveries with the total charge paid for each one, plus the tip amount and the tender used.


The same holds true if they use a single check to cover both the charge and the tip. Note the difference when you reconcile your receipts and cash out for the night according to your store’s practices.

"
"
Look and smell presentable.,
Hustle to the door.,
Bring “extras” along with you.,
Provide extra services when appropriate.",How to Deliver a Pizza2," Remember that you’re representing your store as a whole. Even though you may have no direct contact with the food in the containers, expect customers to assume that you do. Maintain a clean appearance so they’re more likely to order (and tip) again and again. Be sure to:Wear clean clothes and keep a spare outfit to change into if necessary.
Wash your hands, face, and other visible skin before work and between deliveries when needed.
Refrain from smoking en route or doing anything else that may stink you up (and possibly the food too).

, Assume that the customer is watching you as soon as you pull up outside. Don’t dawdle. Show them that you’re trying to get their pizza to them while it’s hot by moving quickly. At the same time:Don’t rush so much that you can’t handle the load safely. Remember to keep the heat bags level at all times. Avoid dropping or tilting their food so it doesn’t slosh around and look like a mess when it finally gets there.

, Anticipate your customers’ needs. Before you leave the store, gear up with the same free items that are offered in-store, even if the customer didn’t ask for any. Then, when you deliver the food, ask if they’d like them. These could include:Paper plates
Napkins
Straws
Packets of crushed red pepper, parmesan, basil, etc.

, You may feel tempted to simply hand over the pizza and book back to the store to get your next order and tip. Before you do, realize that doing so may earn you a lower tip here and now with this customer. Be willing to make an extra effort when asked for something out of the ordinary by customers with special needs.For instance, you may have an elderly or frail customer who can’t manage carrying a single pie to their kitchen table. Or, you may have a fit and able customer who made a very large order and would like some help.
However, keep your own safety in mind. Follow your instincts and politely decline if you feel like you’d be putting yourself at risk by complying. Be aware that delivery people are often targets for crime."
"
Keep a spare cellphone with you.,
Refrain from entering dangerous buildings.,
Follow your gut.",How to Deliver a Pizza3," While it’s a good idea to have a cell phone on you in general, expect these to be stolen in the event that you’re mugged. Pick up a prepaid cellphone to act as a dummy. Hide your main phone somewhere where thieves aren’t likely to search for it.Hide it on your person, rather than in your car, since that may end up being stolen, too. You could sew a liner pocket in the back of your jacket, for instance, or hide it under a baseball cap.

, If you’re delivering to an apartment building and/or neighborhood with a high crime rate, stay outside. Make the customer come to the building’s main door rather than letting them buzz you and delivering to their apartment door. Remember that going inside will make you less visible to bystanders and also severely limit your escape options.Additionally, stay in front of the building if you feel at all at risk. Do not follow customers into backyards or anywhere else away from the street where you’ll be cut off from view or escape.

, Remember that appearances can be deceiving, which means a nice-looking house in a nice-looking neighborhood may be just as dangerous (or even more so) than a crime-ridden one. If anything feels off, don’t fight the feeling, even if you aren’t quite sure why you have it. Play it safe and refrain from doing anything that makes you feel uncomfortable.This could mean anything from refusing to step inside a home or even refusing to get out of the car and make the delivery.

Get fit.Being a good lifeguard is physically challenging.,
Practice swimming.,
Run to improve cardiovascular fitness.,
Strengthen your core and upper body.,
Practice holding your breath to build lung capacity.,
Eat healthy and remain hydrated.,
Protect your skin from the sun.,
Find a lifeguard class in your area.,
Study CPR and first aid.,
Learn to identify warning signs.,
Memorize common safety protocols.,
Practice using life-saving equipment.,
Learn about tides, water conditions, and wildlife.,
Pass certification tests.,
Find out who is hiring.,
Consult websites that advertise open lifeguarding jobs like: aquaticscareers.com and lifeguardingjobs.com.,
Prepare for the interview.",How to Become a Lifeguard," You will want to be in good shape. Lifeguards follow the 10/20 rule. Once a lifeguard notices a potential problem, they must respond in 10 seconds and be able to reach the person in 20 seconds, so it is absolutely necessary to be in shape and to be a strong swimmer., You must be a strong swimmer before becoming a lifeguard. Swim and use a kick board to build leg muscles. All certification programs will require that you pass a timed swim test before going forward.


Take a swimming class with a professional to make sure that your technique is right.
Practice different swimming techniques like freestyle, breaststroke, or backstroke. Swimming in different ways will work out different muscles and make you a stronger swimmer., This is necessary for long swims.


Jog on the beach if you can. Running on sand is more difficult than running on pavement or grass and therefore more productive. Some say that it is also good for your joints.Running on sand will further prepare you for a lifeguard position at the beach.
Run up stairs or stadiums to build your lower body strength. In order to swim as fast as you can, you must have strong legs to help propel yourself through the water.

, Sometimes, a couple of seconds can mean the difference between life and death. Have strong arms to save people faster.


Do pull-ups, dips, bench presses, and curls to build upper body and arm strength. Upper body strength is absolutely necessary in order to carry victims back to safety.
Try sit-ups to strengthen your abdominals. It is important for your entire body to be fit. A slimmer and stronger torso will help you go through the water faster.

, In some cases, the person you are trying to save might be deep below the surface, trapped by something, or difficult to bring to the surface. In this case, you will need to be able to hold your breath for long periods of time.

, This is important for your training, but is also needed as you enter into a profession spent in the sun. Sweating means that your body will lose vital nutrients quickly. Always keep a bottle of water nearby., Wear sunscreen with a higher SPF in order to protect from sunburn or skin cancer. It will be harder to perform your duties as a lifeguard if it hurts to move your limbs because of a burn or if you are in the hospital because of a serious skin disease., Some lifeguard training classes are offered through the YMCA or the local Red Cross district chapter. Other nationally recognized certifications come from Starfish Aquatics Institute, NASCO, and Ellis and Associates. If you are Canadian, check out the Lifesaving Society. Some high schools offer swimming programs in gym class with CPR certification included.


Choose training based on where you want to be a lifeguard. There are usually separate courses for lifeguarding at an indoor pool, lake, beach, and water park.
Classes are usually six weeks long. For Ellis and Associates, there is a crash course that only lasts 3 days.

, For most of these programs, you'll need to complete CPR and first aid training. It is good to study CPR procedures before you enroll in a program. Get experience ahead of time so that the program will be a review for you.

, In many cases, lifeguards recognize signs that someone will need their help long before an emergency occurs. Well-trained lifeguards can either choose to remain vigilant or take precautionary actions. Some of the most common warning signs are:


Clearly poor swimmers bob their head in and out of the water frequently, always have their hands on the edge of the pool and pull themselves around, or cling onto flotation devices and are scared to swim away from them.
The most obvious warning signs are from swimmers who constantly ask for help from others, who wave their arms around frantically, and are the quickest to show signs of panic.
Often times, drowning begins with absolutely no signs or struggle. Watch for people who slip under the water and do not come back up.

, Every pool, waterpark, or beach has its own safety procedures, but there are basic ones that apply in many places such as:


Only swim when a lifeguard is on duty.
No running or rough-housing near the water's edge.
Take hygienic precautions like using waterproof diapers on babies.
Do not go swimming with open wounds.
Do not drink from glass containers in or near the water.
Do not drink large quantities of alcohol or do drugs before swimming.
Get out of the water during thunderstorms., Lifeguards have a bevy of tools that they use other than their bodies to help save struggling swimmers.


Lifeguards use flotation devices like rescue tubes, rescue buoys, and ring buoys to help people stay afloat. Lifeguards also have access to medical equipment normally seen in ambulances and hospitals like resuscitation and defibrillator equipment. Lifeguards also have spinal boards to help move people that may have injured their spines, as well as basic first aid kits, capable of bandaging scrapes and cuts.Lifeguards use barrier devices called face shields or pocket masks. These are placed over the victim's mouth during CPR to prevent the transmission of communicable diseases via bodily fluids.

, This is only important if you plan on being a lifeguard at a beach.


Riptide is one of the most dangerous situations for inexperienced swimmers. Riptides, also known as rip currents, pull swimmers away from shore at speeds too high even for experienced Olympic swimmers. The trick is to swim parallel to the shore, until you escape the riptide.Shore breaks are a serious threat at the beach as well. When waves break too close to the shore, they can be unpredictable, can knock people down, and can cause serious neck and spinal injury. Even the most experienced beach-goers can still be caught off guard.Red tide can seriously effect the safety of swimming conditions too. Every year, certain colonies of algae, often referred to as blooms, produce too many toxins. These toxins accumulate and cause red tide. Red tide can kill marine life and cause serious illness in human beings.The ocean is home to millions of different life forms, but some visit shorelines and beaches more commonly than others. Be aware of threats presented by jelly-fish, sharks, crabs, and the myriad other swimming and crawling creatures that live along the coast., At the end of training, you will be given several exams that test both your written knowledge of the above topics, but also your physical ability to perform the job of a lifeguard.


You will be tested on patron surveillance, victim assessment, care for neck, spine, and head injuries, CPR techniques, and on general swimming safety protocol.Physical tests differ based on where you take the certification exams. Some require you to swim 300 yards, tread water in one place for 2 minutes without support, swim using various techniques, surface dive to a depth of 7 to 10 feet, and hold your breath for 1 to 2 minutes.
Make sure all of your certifications stay up to date. Most certifications only last one to five years. If your certification expires, it will be hard to find a job as a lifeguard.

, Lifeguards are usually in high demand. You can call your local pools, water parks, and county parks departments and ask if they are hiring. Most places will begin hiring lifeguards a month or so before summer in order to provide other, location-specific training.


On occasion, local pools will pay for your lifeguard certification. In most cases, they will want you to have your certification before they will hire you.

, These websites will have further information on the types of certifications needed for employment. They will also inform you as to whether they will pay for training or not.

, Lifeguarding is fun, but you must take it seriously if you want to get hired. Dress professionally when you go for the interview and then dress in swimwear that aids your performance as a lifeguard. People won't hire you unless you put your job first.


Be friendly. People are more likely to want to hire you, if you are nice to them. This tip is important for actually being a lifeguard too. The public is more likely to follow your rules, if you are nice to them. Some will purposefully not follow safety guidelines to spite you, if you were mean to them. Employers want pleasant lifeguards around that will make people feel safe.
Stress your vigilance, excellent swimming skills, knowledge acquired through your lifeguard training , along with your people skills. Employers want pleasant lifeguards around that will make people feel safe.

Many people choose to pursue paid internships abroad to offset the cost of interning in another country.Internships are great ways to gain experience and add to your resume before you are ready to enter your chosen career field.
An internship can also serve as a “dry run” of sorts to see if you really do want to work within your chosen career field.
You can usually earn credits toward your degree through working an internship, provided it meets your school’s criteria.;
, Most schools have someone appointed specifically to help students find and apply for internships. Your school’s internship coordinator will know your school’s specific rules about internships as well as how to determine which ones will be good for school credit.In order to gain credits through your internship, it likely will need to be tied directly to your major. For instance, if you are a business major you should pursue an internship that involves business operations.
If your school does not have an internship coordinator, it likely still has a list of rules that your internship should adhere to.

, You will need to choose a career field or industry to focus your search on. You should base your search on your current major as well as what you hope to do once you graduate. If you have a specific job in mind that you want to pursue, try to find an internship doing that job or working directly with someone who has it.


Think about what type of work you’d like to get into after you graduate. You’ll want to look for an internship that is close to the position.
If you don’t have a specific job in mind, think about the industry you want to work in. Do an internet search for jobs within that field and keep those careers in mind as you look for an internship.

, If you intend to work in an internship abroad, it will help to narrow down the area that you want to search in. There are internships available in countries all around the world. If you don’t have a particularly country in mind, narrow your search to a continent like Europe or Asia.


Depending on the field you want to work in, some continents may be better choices than others. For instance, you may want to work in France or Italy if you are majoring in fashion.
Some industries rely heavily on international trade and having experience in a large market like China could benefit your pursuit of work with a business degree.
Being able to speak the language can be valuable, but is not always necessary for internships.

, In order to apply for most internships, you will be required to submit a résumé that shows your previous education and any prior work history. A strong résumé can help you stand out against other applicants vying for the same internship.You will need to put together a professional looking résumé.
If you do not have work experience to pull from, you can still put together a college résumé.
Don’t worry if you are lacking work experience; internships are intended to help those with little experience to gain it.

, There are many internship search databases online that you can use to find internships to apply for. Many of them allow you to search by keyword, job title or description, country or continent.Websites like www.CulturalVistas.org offers lists of international internships by country.
United Planet provides a searchable list of internships at UnitedPlanet.org.
Websites like GoAbroad.com offer a database of internships as well as other resources that may be valuable to prospective international interns.

, Social media platforms like LinkedIn can not only help you find internship postings, but they can be great ways to connect with people already working for companies that you hope to intern for. You may also know someone that works for an international company. Reach out to friends and family to see if they can connect you with the human resources department of a company you’d like to intern for.Creating a LinkedIn profile can help companies get to know you when you apply for internships.
You may have a much stronger chance at getting chosen for a paid internship if someone within the company can vouch for you.

, Career fairs aren’t only for those looking for full time employment. Often, companies that send representatives to career fairs have a need to fill internship positions as well. Search the internet for international career fairs in your area and contact your school’s internship coordinator to see if there are any scheduled on campus.Make sure to dress professionally when attending a career fair to put your best foot forward.
Bring copies of your résumé and be prepared to discuss your qualifications with people at the career fair.

, Most colleges and universities maintain relationships with their alumni for fundraising and professional placements for graduates. You may be able to use the alumni office to help you make contact with people who graduated from your school and now work overseas.Much like using LinkedIn to network, you don’t have to know someone ahead of time to seek their help with finding an internship.
Be professional, courteous and grateful for any help you receive when dealing with school alumni.
Networking is never a waste of time, even if you don’t find an internship as a result.

, You will likely need to apply for more than one internship, as you may not be hired by your first choice. As you find internships you would like to pursue, apply to them based on the requirements listed on the internship posting.


Some internships may require that you only fill out an application, while others may require your résumé as well.
Some may require you to write an essay explaining your interest in the internship or talking about yourself. Make sure to proofread your essay well. You want to put your best foot forward in order to land the internship you really want.
Consider asking friends or one of your professors to look over your essay and résumé before submitting them.
Apply to as many internships as you like. It’s always better to have more options than fewer.

, You will need some forms of identification as well as proof of any certifications you may require for your internship. Depending on the country hosting you, you may want to pursue attaining a local driver’s license as well.


You will need a passport to travel outside of the country.
Ask the company you plan to intern for if you will need any type of Visa to come and intern in their nation.
You may be able to drive in some countries with a driver’s license from the United States.

, While paid internships will provide you with some money while you work, they often do not pay enough to support living in another nation for a short period of time. You will need money for housing, food, and entertainment while you live in your host country.You will be responsible for the cost of traveling to the nation you intern in as well as your living expenses while abroad.
You may be able to use financial aid or student loans to pay for a portion of your expenses.
Regulations as to how much you must be paid as an intern vary greatly between industries and within each nation, so your need for savings can vary.
If you are doing your internship for school credit, don’t forget to include the cost of tuition in your savings calculations.

, If you are doing your internship through a school program, they often have housing options available to you with fixed costs. If you are looking for housing outside of a school sanctioned program, you will need to find housing for the term you spend abroad.


Each country has different rules and common practices when it comes to housing. Renting and leasing options vary as well as pricing and what is commonly included in a rental.
Communication with the company you will be interning with to see if they have any recommendations about housing that is available to you.

, There are other options available to you as an international intern if you are concerned about reducing costs. You can find a roommate that will also be interning abroad to help distribute the cost or you can consider staying with a sponsor family that houses international interns.The Center for International Education Exchange is a non-profit organization (Ciee.org) that can help international interns find free or very low cost housing with families that agree to take them in.
If your school has an internship coordinator, ask them to help you find housing at your destination.
Inquire about other interns at the same company to see if they may be looking for roommates.

, Starting an internship is just like starting a new job, so it’s important that you make a good impression. If you are doing your internship for credit, your performance at your internship may count for a grade. If not, you are still working in exchange for pay, so you’ll be expected to perform the tasks assigned to you in a professional manner.


Make sure to dress appropriately for the job you are doing. If it is in an office, dress in business or business casual attire. If your internship is outdoors, make sure you are wearing the appropriate clothing to keep you safe from the elements.
Be on time and prepare yourself to work hard in order to make a good impression at work.

, While working at your internship, don’t forget to get out and experience the city you are working in. Every place has a unique and dynamic culture and few people get to experience the way people live in other places around the world.


Meet people and go sight-seeing during your off hours.
Take part in adventure programs that are sponsored by your school if there are any.
Some companies offer trips or events designed specifically for international interns.

, While living in another country can be an incredible experience, it’s important that you keep safety in mind while exploring. There are dangers inherent to any city in any nation around the world.Travel.State.Gov offers a list of travel warnings and alerts for any country you may be interning in.
Consider enrolling in the STEP program provided by the U.S. State Department. It will register you with the closest U.S. Consulate that can help you in the event of any kind of emergency.

This level of education is required for all entry-level positions.Under some circumstances, however, you might be able to find work within the field if you have a related degree, like one in child psychology.
Some social work programs at the bachelor's degree level allow you to select a specific concentration. Consider one in child welfare, youth work, or a similar area where available.
You can typically find work in direct-service positions with a bachelor's degree. If you want to be a case worker, for instance, some employers might hire you with only a bachelor's degree, especially if you can prove that you intend to continue your education.;
, If you want a higher level clinical position in youth work, you will probably need a master's degree in social work.The school and program you go through must be accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) in order to be considered valid.
In addition to having a master's degree, you may also need two years of post-master experience before landing a position in a clinic.
You do not necessarily need to have a bachelor's degree in social work to get into the right master's degree program, but it can help. Degrees in psychology, sociology, economics, and political science can be equally helpful.
The first year of graduate school will likely cover foundational social work material. Expect to cover area-specific information during your second year. That second year will be the time when you go through courses dealing specifically with child welfare and other youth work topics.

, Every state in the United States will require those involved in youth work or other fields of social work to obtain some type of license or certification before working within state lines.


The exact requirements vary by state, so you'll need to check with the state you plan to work in to determine what you need to do. Usually, though, licensing requires a master's degree in social work. You should also expect to take and pass an exam.
You can find out what the requirement are for your state by checking with the Association of Social Work Boards: https://www.aswb.org/


, You should begin doing volunteer work as early as possible. Starting while you're working on your bachelor's degree should be fine, but if you're still in high school, it's an even better idea to start now.Community service in any social work field should demonstrate your commitment and ability, but to make the biggest impact, look for opportunities specifically dealing with children and teenagers.
Consider volunteering through the Boys & Girls Club of America, local churches and community centers, the United Way, Americorps, or similar organizations. You may also ask social work instructors at your institution for volunteer opportunities they know about.

, When you embark on a master's degree in social work, you will automatically need to complete some type of supervised practicum or internship. This work experience program typically lasts for two years or 3,000 hours.


This work can be completed before or after you obtain your master's degree.
Your work experience should be directly related to the type of work you want to pursue in your career, so look for an opportunity in youth services. Note that your work will be supervised during this period, too.
Most programs at the undergraduate level will also require some supervised field work, but you'll usually only need about 400 hours.

, Leave a good impression with everyone you come into contact with through each educational and work experience you engage in. Stay in touch with these people even after you move on.


Professional and educational contacts that you have known for 6 to 12 months can often serve as references when you're trying to get into a good master's program.
After you finish your schooling, you can use these same professional contacts as references on your resume.

, Child welfare and youth-oriented social work are rapidly growing fields with steady pay.


As of May 2012, the median annual wage for social workers who deal with minors was $41,530.Within the youth worker field, employment is also expected to grow 15 percent between 2012 and 2022. This rate is faster than the overall average employment rate., State and local governments are the largest employers of child and family social workers, but there are a few private organizations that may also employ workers in this field.Schools and child welfare agencies are among the most common public institutions in need of youth workers.
Aside from these common institutions, look for work with social assistance organizations, educational services (both public and private), religious organizations, and civic organizations.

, You'll need to be able to identify children with special needs or behavioral problems. Oftentimes, you also need to watch for signs of poor living conditions (abuse or neglect).Signs of abuse and neglect can be the most difficult to spot. Among other things, look for children who are regularly dressed inappropriately for volatile weather, those who are frequently unbathed, those with an uncommon number of injuries (bruises, cuts, and broken bones), those who exhibit abnormal amounts of fear, those who are intelligent yet under the belief that they are stupid, and those who have sexual knowledge that is inappropriate for that age.

, After identifying children in need, you will need to monitor the situation and intervene in the most appropriate way.


You'll usually need to assess the child's home life through interviews and home visits.
Children at a high risk of being hurt may need to be removed. Those who are at a low risk are usually kept where they are, but you will need to work with the family and the child to fix the problems they face.
Prepare to follow up with later evaluations even after the problem has been addressed.

, Depending on the exact nature of your position, your daily tasks may include activities that go beyond home evaluations.


You might be involved in programs that provide forms of recreation, mentoring, education, and counseling to youth in need.
Other times, you will need to manage finances, write reports, respond to general or specific concerns by phone or e-mail, recruit volunteers or other workers, and work with police and other professionals to help address ongoing problems in the community., To benefit the youth you work with as much as possible, you will need to continually manage old skills and learn new skills related to the field. You may do this on your own or through formal classes.


In particular, you need to be able to empathize with kids from all backgrounds and encourage them to trust you. This requires you to be an excellent active listener and overall communicator.
You must also be able to deal with unexpected, serious problems in a calm, sensitive way. Fairness, respect, and compassion are all necessary attributes.
There are also several administrative skills you need to master, including organizational abilities and self-discipline. Be prepared to work as a team with other professionals and guardians, and remain knowledgeable about matters of confidentiality, child protection, and related laws.

, Even though most of the work you will do in this field deals is relatively hands-on and deals directly with the youth you're responsible for helping, your experiences and knowledge can be enhanced by further involvement within your professional community. Moreover, your current experiences can help others within that community, too.


Look for opportunities to meet other youth workers and family social workers. Such opportunities may arise in the form of conferences, professional interviews, and academic forums.
Discuss your experiences on the field with others who may have dealt with similar issues. Draw attention to major problems you have worked out and those you have yet to solve. You may answer someone else's question or find an answer to yours by doing so.
When appropriate, consider publishing an academic or professional essay containing information about various case studies that address a major theme or issue you've dealt with throughout your career.

, You can expect eating tables and food areas to have the most trash. Litter is also common at transition points, such as entrances to buildings where food or drink is prohibited

,, You were probably told at your training that you should always do this. You don't have to be wearing a grin the whole time, but just don't let your problems at home show on your face. As long as you are not interrupting them, ask guests they are doing and what their favorite rides are. If you are a more of a less talkative person, you don't have to do this. But do be ready to answer questions regarding the location of rides and bathrooms, and the time if you are wearing a watch.

, Guests will ask you questions, and you need to be ready to answer.

, During the breaks, you can make phone calls, use the restroom, wash your hands, eat, reapply sunblock, and all the other things.

,


Instead of just sweeping the concrete walkways, completely clean up the planters.
Find other areas, that are visible but not accessible to guests, and clean up there. These are often neglected by the maintenance because they are not the primary concern. You will notice a great buildup of trash and leaves there because of that. Guests really do notice those things, and they really do enjoy a clean and pretty park.

DON’T Stress!,
Think about your goals.,
Research.,
Contact Correctly.",How to Be a Successful Public Relations Intern1," If you put in the time and effort of finding an internship, everything will pay off. Finding an internship isn’t the easiest thing, but if you plan ahead (several months in advance) and talk to your professors, your chances of a smooth internship search won’t be so bad.

, What exactly is it that you want to do? Be an event planner? A writer? A little bit of everything? Take some time, or a lot of time, to really sit down and consider your interests and what you’re passionate about. So many people apply for any internship that they can possibly find, which isn’t necessarily a bad idea, but the point of an internship is to gain experience in your major. Settling for an internship that’s not at all related to your major most likely won’t bring you the experience that you’re looking for. Remember: your internship is the first step to starting your future in the real world.

, There are so many corporations, non-profits, smaller businesses, and a never ending list of companies out there that you don’t even realize it. All of these categories differ greatly in what type of work the company generates along with what their primary goal is. Make sure you know what you’re getting yourself into. OR, aim for experience in each field. You never know what you’re going to have an interest for until you try something first hand.

, What does this mean? It means to talk in a professional manor when you contact that President of that big company, or that director of that marketing department you would like to get into. Most people just assume that it’s OK to send an e-mail saying something along the lines of “I was wondering if you have any opportunities for a summer internship” or, “I was wondering if you’re looking for a spring intern.” Word to the wise: don’t say that. Try something like this: “I’m a junior public relations major at - - - and am looking to further my knowledge in the field. I’m highly interested in your company and was curious to know if you have any opportunities in which I could increase experience in public relations.” See the difference in those statements? Good.

Be ready for the worst.,
Understand that ON TIME means EARLY.,
Help as much as you can.,
Keep calm & carry on.",How to Be a Successful Public Relations Intern2," It’s not “prepare for the worst and hope for the best,” it’s just “prepare for the worst.” Be aware that something will ALWAYS go wrong. Your team of event planners can be 100% sure that they have everything perfected for the day of the event, but it never fails that it won’t go the way you planned. Have a back up plan, or 2, or 3, get it?;
, If your supervisor asks for you to arrive at 8am the day of an event, arrive closer to 7:50. The more time you spend at an event, the more experience you will gain, and the better impression you will make. Believe it or not, a lot can happen in a 10-minute span. Event set up is a crazy thing.

, The day of an event is absolutely exhausting. These might not be the words you want to hear, but when you hold the title of an intern, some people might view you as their slave. Don’t worry, not everyone will treat you this way, but the bottom line is that the more you show that you’re willing to bust your butt and break a sweat, the better impression you’re going to make.

, What do I mean by this? When that one thing goes wrong on the day of an event, or even in the planning process, the WORST thing you can do is panic and freak out. This will get you NOWHERE. Take a deep breath and really look into what can be done to fix the situation. Most importantly, never ever take your stress or frustration out on someone else.

LISTEN to the advice given.",How to Be a Successful Public Relations Intern3," This will ultimately be the best way for you to improve your writing skills. No one is going to know more about writing than your supervisor at your internship. They’re already professionals, you’re not.

, Before you begin, make sure that you know what you’re writing about. If there’s one thing that you’re unclear about, ask! The worst thing you can do is assume that what you wrote makes sense. The more questions you ask, the better results you’re going to get.

, One word change can make all the difference. Make the thesaurus your BFF.

, There’s no such thing as too much editing. You’ll be amazed how many little errors your eyes can skip right over.

,
Don’t over-promise and under-deliver.,
Put yourself out there.,
SMILE, have fun, and take full advantage of every opportunity.

",How to Be a Successful Public Relations Intern4," How? Meet as many people as possible. You never know what connections someone could have. One smile, handshake, and conversation with a certain person could be the start of your career. It’s all about how you deliver yourself.

, Just because you’re the guinea pig of the company, never let your chin down. Deliver yourself in a way that just screams, “Hire me! I want this!”

, Example: Don’t say you know how to create a spreadsheet if you really don’t.

, Even though the above statement says to always have confidence, don’t be overconfident. Once again, you’re not the professional just yet. Getting too involved and giving your opinion 24/7 can sometimes give you a bad reputation.

,, If there’s a deadline for a certain assignment, have it done on time. If you’re unsure about a specific task you’ve been assigned, don’t act like you know what you’re doing. You never want to promise someone high quality work if you’re just going to give them squat! Ask questions!

Being an intern with QoLx means not only will you be engaging in what you are good at, you will simultaneously be learning skills and tools to personally help you grow and succeed with abilities you want to learn!;
, All QoLx Interns should have a wikiHow account and userpage, with the opportunities to help edit and author all sorts of wikiHow articles. To get started:


Create your own user ID. It is recommended that you use a pen name you'd be happy to share, instead of your full real name.
Check out the wikiHow Community Dashboard and try out any of the activities. Ask yourself ""Which ones you enjoy doing most?"" and consider those as a good contribution.
Post a talk page message to Dr Mel and the rest of the QoLx team.
Set up your User Page. Get your user page set up referencing How to Make your wikiHow User Page.

, For example, do you want to experiment with gamifying the habits in your life? Check out HabitRPG . If you like the idea of being part of this project, then you can look at all the different options you have for contributing the HabitRPG at http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Contributing_to_HabitRPG. All of your efforts with HabitRPG will get you internship credits with QoLx.

, How genuinely interested are you in exploring the possibilities of your mind and others around you? This includes trying to help people develop skills for maximizing quality of life. Being an intern with QoLx means not only will you be engaging in what you are good at, but you will simultaneously be learning skills and tools to personally help you grow and succeed with abilities you want to learn.

, What interests or questions do you have about the way you learn or what you learn throughout your life? Formal and informal learning is a big topic among QoLx. Doing research on life, and the quality of living, as well as the positive aspects of what you can do for yourself and each other is a common likeness for all interns. Giving feedback to what you find in your search is huge.

, As a creative person, what are your passions? What mediums or platforms do you enjoy working with? Showing your creative expression in ways that feed back to helping your community broaden their knowledge is a rewarding feeling. Understanding the context of your research and relaying that to others in a visual and or auditory way that makes sense is what a vital part of what you'll do. This includes working with anything from illustrations, animations, graphics, digital photography, video, musical, or any other form of art imaginable.

, Experimenting to make sure all your work makes an impact or not is a process that everyone goes through. Learning about ideas such as being a ""productive failure"" is important in helping your projects and ideas get better and more precise as you learn. Testing out fun ways to see if your theories or concepts work in present day activities is much more beneficial than just simply reading them alone.

, After all the work you have done in growing your own quality of life, the best part is being able to put your findings out there for others to see and participate in. Spreading the word about what you know and being able to support your idea's with truthful research will make interning be an accomplishing aspect of your life.


Sharing is one of the most important foundations of the QoLx team. Teaching this to others such as children, adolescents, adults in transition, parents, friends and family and anyone alike is what being a QoLx intern is all about!

, Think about the questions in the internship application, then submit your answers in this questionnaire: QoLx.

, One of the most valuable habits to develop is metacognitive review, thinking about your thinking and submitting a few notes. In this internship, you want to submit reviews at least daily, and even more often when you are completing assignments. Your internship record will be the collection of reviews you submit, along with links to whatever else you create. Reviews will be visible to others, so avoid sharing anything confidential unless you select the ""anonymous"" option.


Review videos or playlist. One of the easiest and most fun internship tasks is to watch a video or short playlist, reflect on it and submitting a Video Review each time. You can start with this playlist of trailers for the new Pixar movie about emotions Inside Out, one of the Phil Zimbardo talks, or simply review something else you've watched recently that you want to remember and share.
Review your day. Each day of the summer, you are doing things, experiencing things, and learning. At some point before you fall asleep, complete an Activity Review about your day and what you most want to remember.
Review the work you've just done. Any time you are working on something specifically for this internship, when you get to a good break point (whether you have finished the task or not), you can reflect and submit an Activity Review. For example, after you try out microvolunteering, submit an Activity Review before you do something else.

, You can find lots of places to help out virtually when you have a few minutes to spare. All of that counts as community service learning, so keep track of what you do! Start micro-volunteering for QoL-X by checking out the current challenges at Skills For Change-QoL-X. You can also micro-volunteer for Zimbardo's Everyday Heroes.

, Create your own account here on wikiHow and post something to this article's Talk page. Write something about yourself on your Userpage, and tell us more about why you are wanting to be part of these experiments. Check out all the various volunteer tasks you can help with all over wikiHow by checking out the Community Dashboard.

, The team wants all incoming interns to be adequately prepared for times of crisis, so we want you to be able to answer these questions well:


If you were found unconscious, would someone looking in your wallet know who to call? Make a card or note to keep in your wallet with the names and phone numbers of your emergency contacts. Then talk to your emergency contacts about what you would want them to do if you were seriously injured. Make sure they have each others' contact info.
If someone you cared about needed first aid, would you know what to do? Simply learning how to analyze a situation when you see someone who might need help is the first step. Learn basic first aid. You can start with a short video for Hands Only CPR. Then keep going with this Free First Aid certification course or ProFirstAid. First Aid training can help you overcome the Bystander Effect and give you far more confidence and readiness for handling sudden crises.
If you have a car, do you have an emergency supply kit in it? Put together an emergency kit for your car. If you drive often, that will mean the kit is most likely to be near you if a sudden emergency occurred. Make a checklist of what you personally need in an emergency kit, then start pulling it all together so it's easy to keep in car. Find ways to add to the kit until you are confident it has what you need.
If a natural disaster forced you to evacuate your home suddenly, do you have a pack of supplies ready to go? What else would you need beyond what you have in your car's emergency kit?
If a massive power outage meant that you had to ""shelter in place"" at home, do you have enough of what you need to survive for two weeks? Look online for what your checklist of supplies should include. And post tips here!

, When you are ready to get more involved, come up with your answers to any of these questions, and either post them to Dr Mel's Talk Page or email them to drmel@qol-x.org, then schedule a time to talk with Dr. Mel.


What questions or challenges are you most interested in working on?
What goals do you want to set for yourself for this summer?
What would the the deliverables look like?
How do you plan to make those happen?
What mediums or platforms will you use to research and to share your experiments?

, The QoL-X project is in a startup phase, getting ready for the Summer of 2015, welcoming all interested volunteers and interns, and trying to be timely in responding to inquiries. Systems are not solidly in place, though, so if you don't hear from someone, please try again!

Follow up as promised.",How to Write an Email Asking for an Internship," When sending business correspondence, use a professional, clear email address. Avoid nicknames or unnecessary symbols and numbers. A variation of your name can work well. For example: Smit.smith@company.com would be fine.


If your current email address is connected with a social media profile that contains any unprofessional content, create and use a different address. Also, adjust your privacy settings on social media.

, Before you ask for an internship, research the company at which you would like to work. Visit their website. Read any news articles about them. If the company has an accessible product, like social media, use the product for a week to test it. Use your insights to craft your letter. Prospective employers appreciate candidates who know something about the company and can demonstrate this knowledge coherently.

, It is beneficial to have a connection at a company. Use social networks like LinkedIn and Facebook to conduct keyword searches for the company. If contacts come up, check their positions. Politely request a phone or in-person interview. Ask for tips regarding your internship application.


With LinkedIn you can see which of your contacts’ contacts work at a firm. Do not hesitate to ask your contact to connect you with one of their contacts. Do be tactful, though, and do not ask the same person for assistance repeatedly.
Many universities provide online alumni databases. You can search for people with certain jobs or workplaces through these sites. Alumni who provide their contact information often are open to receiving emails or phone calls from students.
When discussing the company with your contact, mention that you are interested in an internship. Ask about the company’s organizational structure, work environment, goals, etc.

, Does the internship posting include the name of the contact person? If so, use that person's name and email address. If there is not a listed contact person, call the company to ask who is in charge of internship recruitment. If no one is in charge, address your email to a senior person in human resources at the company. If you speak to any person at the firm, you can mention this in the beginning of your email.


When you cannot find the name of any employee, address your email to ""Dear Sir or Madam.""

, You want your email to be noticed in a high-volume inbox. For example, you could write, “Company X Internship Application: Joanna Smith.” If applicable, use the specific subject line requested by the employer.

, In the first line, begin your email with ""Dear Dr./Mr./Ms./Mrs. Smith"" depending on the contact person's name, title, and gender. Do not write ""Hey Mary"" or ""Hello."" Use the same formality you would use when writing a professional letter.


If you cannot determine the person's gender, address the person with his/her full name. For example, write ""Dear Bobbi Reynolds.""

, Tell the recipient your name and your status (e.g. Third year biology major at University X). State how you found out about the internship, whether online, in the newspaper, or through a contact. If you have a mutual contact, state this as soon as possible. For example, you could write: , , suggested that I contact you.

, State your potential starting and end dates and whether these are flexible. If you would be available, for example, for a spring semester internship plus a full-time summer internship, share this as well. Specify the number of hours per week you can work.

, Do you need an internship for course credit? If applicable, indicate you are pursuing an internship primarily for experience and are flexible with job responsibilities and compensation. Write what skills you hope to gain from the internship.

, Bring up something that you know or think the organization values about itself. Avoid mentioning any negative news stories. Keep your letter positive. For example, you could state: has a reputation for excellence, and I value your commitment to .

, Through several sentences, share information about coursework, previous work experience, and any applicable skills. Demonstrate how your knowledge can benefit the organization. Include information about work and volunteer positions and how these experiences have prepared you for this role. Emphasize how you can contribute to the organization. Your potential employer needs to believe you can handle assigned tasks.Describe work experience with strong verbs. Rather than writing: ""I was a marketing intern for two years,"" declare ""As a marketing intern, I created fresh content, designed digital and print brochures, and managed social media outlets for a business with fifty employees.""
Skills can include social media, event organization, or myriad other things.

, Write about your academic qualifications. If you have had leadership roles, describe your duties and/or accomplishments. Have you lead a committee? Have you coached a team? Keep these explanations brief so that you do not lose your reader’s attention.


Instead of using adjectives to describe yourself, use concrete examples that show your qualities. For instance, rather than saying ""I am an ambitious student,"" write ""I have consistently remained in the top 10 percent of my class.""

, Discuss when and how you will contact the employer to follow up on the status of your application. Give your contact information, i.e., name, email address, phone number, and availability as well. You could write: I am reachable by phone or email. If you cannot get back to me, I will call you .

, It is polite to thank the reader for taking the time to review your materials. End with a cordial closing, such as “sincerely.” If you have spoken to the person via phone or in person previously, you might use a greeting like “best regards.” Do not use “Thanks” or simply “Best” as closings in formal correspondence. Sign your full name, e.g. Joanna Smith rather than just Joanna.

, Do not attach your resume to an unsolicited internship email. Unless the company is actively seeking interns, they may not want to open your attached copy, especially if they have a workplace policy about attachments. If the posting asked for a resume, attach your document as a PDF (as opposed to a Word document, where the formatting may be lost/altered when opened on a different system).


Some employers may specify that they do not open email attachments. If so, include your cover letter and resume in the body of the email. Make sure to space them apart to make it easier for the employer to distinguish each document.

, If you have not heard back from the organization, email them again – or, preferably, call them. You could write: Dear Dr. Hansen, my name is and I am following up on an email I sent you last week about a internship. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the position. Thank you. Sincerely, Joanna Smith.

Get the position.,
Interview, if need be.,
Get close to those around you in the office.,
Work to establish yourself as an individual willing to take on all tasks.,
Be curious within reason, but remember that listening is much more useful than talking as an intern.,
Get to local events, if you can.,
Make connections.",How to Be a Political Intern," Write to local politicians that you admire and see if they have any internships or volunteer positions available. Even if you're only in high school, prepare a simple résumé with your extracurricular activities, any prior work or volunteer experiences, etc. Keep it simple to avoid looking pompous or overzealous, unless you feel the situation calls for something more thorough and formal.


If you have a connection of any sort, this is a great time to make use of it! If your uncle was a major booster to this politician during his or her last campaign, have him send the official a call or email about how great of an addition you'd be. It can really work wonders.
Ensure that you clearly lay out the amount of work you'd be able to put in. If volunteers are sparse at the office, they'd likely appreciate any efforts you can put in, even if they're only after school, during days off, and during breaks. If there is actually competitive selection of interns, though, then you don't wish to surprise your boss by announcing you'd only be able to work a quarter of the time that they expected.;
, Lower-level offices (say, for state representatives in the United States) will often be chomping at the bit for volunteers and interns and thus will schedule an interview to check that you're all there and that you're committed to the cause (if they schedule one at all). Higher-level offices, though, may have more stringent and difficult interviews that you'd have to sit through before joining the team.


If you don't succeed at this step, don't worry. Brush up on your interviewing skills, and contact another local government official. If you do succeed, though, carry on with the following steps.

, You may be dismayed to learn that in many larger political offices, you're not likely to see the person you're working for very much at all- as they'll typically be tending to various tasks. If you can manage to meet them enough to establish a rapport with them, that's superb. Otherwise, befriend the other individuals in your office, interns or otherwise. Not only will this make your time more bearable, but it will also help you to make meaningful connections that will help you if you pursue a career in politics.


You'll need to ensure you gain trust early on. This means no jokes about writing tell-all memoirs about your time at the office or quips about leaking a story to the press.

, Never say no to a reasonable job given to you, whether it be filing, computer work, answering phones, or anything else.

, Unless the individuals who you work with are particularly stern, don't be afraid to ask a clarifying question or two when sensitive political information is being discussed. Remember, though, to be careful with the information you find out- to ensure trust is maintained it should never leave the office.

, Interns will often have the opportunity to march in parades and participate in similar events on weekends and holidays. Though you're likely to be holding a sign or banner with your boss's name on it, gatherings like these can serve as exciting opportunities to rub elbows with community leaders.

, Though being haughty is not a quality of a good political intern, don't be afraid to tell people you meet (even important politicians) your name and who you intern for. A well-made connection can turn out to be an endorsement in a campaign of yours ten or twenty years down the line.

Show your child the power of volunteering.,
Expose your child to people of all walks of life.,
Travel with your child as much as you can.,
Make your child grateful for all that he has.,
Make your child aware of current events.,
Make your child aware of other countries.,
Read non-fiction to your child.",How to Best Educate the Children to Change a Corrupt Society1," Your child is never too young to start volunteering in your community, even if all he can do is give a toothy smile to a person in need of care. Don't let your children think that volunteering is just something they should do in high school to pad their college application; teach them that it's important to give back to the community as often as you can.


There are an infinite number of ways to give your time, whether it's by working at a local canned food drive, putting in a few hours a week at a nursing home, or volunteering at a soup kitchen. Volunteer as often as you can and bring your child along so he can help out.;
, If your child is only used to being around white upper middle class people, or Chinese middle class people, or whatever types of people you surround yourself with, then he won't develop an awareness of the existence of a variety of cultures, socioeconomic statuses, and races that contribute to making the world work. Make sure to take your child outside his comfort zone until he feels like he can make conversation or be around any type of person.


Many people aren't exposed to people of different races or classes until they go to college; don't make your child wait that long.

, This doesn't mean you should take your child to a fancy vacation in France every summer; it does mean that you should travel as much as you can to a variety of cities, states, or even countries, if your budget will allow it. Let your child see that there are many different types of people in the world; they may look different and speak a different language, but at heart, all people are not so different.


If your child is aware of many different lifestyles and cultures early on, he won't grow up to separate different cultures of the world into ""us"" and ""them.""

, Thanksgiving shouldn't be the only time your child stops and thinks about what he is really thankful for. Your child should compile a ""gratitude list"" at least once a week, maybe before bed, so he or she is always thinking about all of the things there are to be grateful for -- a loving family, good food on the table, a roof over his or her head -- and all of the things that many people in the world don't have.


If your child gets into the habit of reciting this list like a mantra, then gratitude will become second nature to him.

, Though it may not serve your best interests to make your child watch a news story about homicide or genocide at the tender young age of three, you should make a habit of watching relevant news stories, or reading the paper, with your child early on so that he or she develops an awareness of the domestic and international issues that are prevalent in the world.


Make the news digestible. Talk to your child about what you read or saw and discuss how what so-so did was wrong, and why.
Let your child see that the world isn't black or white. Like the decision of whether or not the United States should invade Syria, current affairs always run in shades of gray.

, Even if you don't have the budget to travel to other countries, your child should have a globe and a few books about other countries as early as possible. At first, you can just play a game with your child, helping him or her memorize the capitals and flags of each country. As your child gets older, you can talk about the relationship between different countries and the importance of mutual respect between nations.


Helping your child develop awareness about the existence of other countries will help him not think that his own country is the center of the universe. This will influence your child to make more just and fair decisions in the future.

, Though reading any book to your child is essential to developing his or her reading, writing, and critical thinking skills, you don't have to only read fictional tales to your child once he reaches a certain age. Though there are many great lessons to be learned from The Berenstain Bears or fairy tales, you can also pick some light non-fiction to read to your child, whether it's to educate him or her about different animals, or about different country.


Teaching your child more and more about the real world can help develop his sense of awareness.

Make your child responsible for his or her bad behavior.,
Have a proper system of punishments and rewards.,
Make your child responsible for household chores.,
Teach your child responsibility for his younger siblings and friends.,
Teach your child to be a responsible citizen.",How to Best Educate the Children to Change a Corrupt Society2," If your child has made a mistake, no matter how inconsequential it may seem, he or she needs to learn to admit that he did something wrong, and to apologize for it, as early as possible. Don't let your child get away with doing whatever he wants until he's four or five years old because it's easier than reasoning with him; start letting your child know that he's done something wrong as soon as he's old enough to feel shame.


Don't let your child blame his bad behavior on other children, on the weather, on an imaginary friend, or whatever it may be -- get your child into the habit of admitting that he did something wrong and that he has no one to blame but himself.
Teaching your child accountability for his bad actions will make him more likely to recognize when he or she has done something wrong as an adult.
Remember to be loving and accepting when your child admits he has made a mistake. Teaching accountability doesn't mean that you have to make the kid feel terrible.

, You don't have to physically hurt your child to show him that there are consequences for his bad behavior; in fact, you shouldn't. Form a system of punishments for your child's bad behavior, from making him standing in the corner to taking away his favorite toy, and make sure to complement it with a system of rewards for good behavior so that your child knows that his good deeds get recognized too.


Be consistent. Dole out the same sort of reward and punishment every time. You don't want your child to think that he can get away with bad behavior just because Mommy is tired; you also don't want him to think that being a good boy doesn't always matter, either.
Don't underestimate the power of telling your child that he's a good boy; this will help develop your child's self-worth and will help him recognize the value in others in the future.






Making your child see that there are consequences for bad behavior will make him less likely to contribute to a corrupt society, where bad behavior goes unchecked.

, Don't offer your child a reward or monetary incentive for doing the dishes, cleaning up his toys, or wiping up his spilled milk. Your child should understand that, as a member of your family, it is his duty to take on certain tasks. Tell him you're proud of him for contributing, but make this seem like a given, not like he's doing you a favor.


This will help develop his sense of innate responsibility, which will transfer into his sense that he will have to contribute positively to society, whether he will be rewarded for his contributions or not.
Show your child that you complete many household tasks, too. For a household to run smoothly, everyone has to help out; the same goes for a just society.

, If your child is the oldest in the family or the oldest kid on the block, teach him to be accountable for his younger friends or siblings, and to take an active roll in protecting them, teaching them the difference between right and wrong, and steering them out of trouble. Teach him that he is older, wiser, and more powerful, and that he should use his powers wisely, to teach younger people how to properly behave, instead of being a bully or taking advantage of their weakness.


Teaching your child to be responsible for younger people will make him a more conscientious adult, who will look out for the less fortunate or weaker members of society.

, Good citizenship is a must in any flourishing society. If you want your child to change a corrupt society, then he has to learn that he isn't just responsible for his own little plot of land; he has to look past his own property to help contribute to positive change. Teach your child not to litter, to clean up after himself in a public place, to smile at people on the street, and to be respectful of the needs of others.


Take your child to a local volunteering event for cleaning up your community. Having your child help his fellow citizens clean up a local park can make him appreciate the town where he lives.

Help your child recognize the difference between right and wrong.,
Teach your child that cheating is wrong.,
Make sure your child develops an internal moral code.,
Help your child develop empathy for others.,
Teach your child that stealing is wrong.,
Teach your child that lying is wrong.",How to Best Educate the Children to Change a Corrupt Society3," It's one thing to tell your child that one thing is good while another is bad; it's another thing to explain to your child why some behavior is good and why another way of acting is bad. Your child should not only know what to do and what not to do, but he should have a firm understanding of the moral code and reasoning behind it.

Don't just tell your child not to steal another child's toys; tell him that this is bad because he's messing with another person's property and showing a lack of respect.
Don't just tell your child that he has to say hello to your neighbor every morning; tell him that it's important to be polite to people.







, Show your child that cheating in any shape or form, from bribery to not paying all of your taxes, is inexcusable under any circumstances. Tell your child that cheating on a test is the behavior of a coward and a person who doesn't have the confidence that he can succeed without taking a short cut; being honest is the only way to really succeed and to move forward in life.


Tell your child that anyone who cheats thinks that he is above the system; it is important to bring about change within the system, not outside of it.

, Don't just make your child follow the rules at home and the rules at school because that's the best way to avoid trouble. Though that's a great reason for following the rules, your child should have a sense that the rules are fair and just, and that he would be doing himself and everyone around him a disservice if he didn't follow them.


When your child breaks the rules or makes a point of following the rules, ask him why he did it; he shouldn't say he did what he was supposed to do just to make Mommy and Daddy or his teacher happy. He should follow the rules because he understands the impact of his positive and negative behavior.
Not all rules will seem fair to your child. If his school, or your church, or your friend's household has rules that don't make sense to your child, talk to him about why this is the case.

, Your child doesn't have to feel sorry for every single person who is less privileged than he is. This can be exhausting, and may even lead to some condescension. But your child should develop empathy, the ability to understand what another person is feeling and to look at a situation through that person's eyes. This will help your child see the world outside of his own perspective, and will help him improve his behavior toward others.


For example, let's say your child comes home feeling upset because his teacher yelled at him. Instead of saying that the teacher is a bad person, try to talk about why the teacher acted this way; maybe your child disregarded the teacher's rules several times, or maybe everyone was disregarding the teacher's rules. Talk about how frustrating this might have been for her.

, While your six-year-old may not understand that embezzling large amounts of money is wrong, he can understand that it's wrong to steal a cookie from the school cafeteria without paying or stealing a friend's toy is wrong. Teaching your child this stuff on a small scale first will help him understand that it's wrong, and in many cases even illegal, to take something that isn't yours. Teaching this lesson early on will keep your child from feeling entitled, or like stealing is no big deal as long as he's not caught.

If your child does steal something, make him give it back and explain what he did. Though this will make him ashamed, it will teach him a lesson.







, Lying is another symptom of a corrupt society, and your child should learn the importance of telling the truth as early as possible. Teach him that even a small fib can turn into a big lie that can hurt a lot of people. Say that's it's more important to tell the truth and suffer the consequences than live with a lie and to fool the people around you. Your child should see that lying is not something people can do with a clear conscience and that telling the truth is far more important than protecting yourself.


As your child gets older, you can teach him that there's a difference between telling the truth and being brutally honest.






If your child understands the negative impact of lying early on, then he'll be much less likely to lie during his professional life, and will be much more likely to stop vicious lies when he sees them.

Vet the position before you accept it.",How to Become an English Teacher in Italy," Before you apply for teaching positions in Italy, it would be beneficial to have basic Italian skills, including the ability to have conversations in Italian and to write in Italian. You should take Italian language classes in your home country before you embark on a career as an English teacher in Italy, as you will be expected to be able to converse with potential employers and your students in Italian.You should submit your resume and cover letter in Italian and be prepared to possibly respond to interview questions in Italian.;
, You can also obtain your Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults (CELTA). If you have already received a degree in Education in your country, you may still need to earn a certificate; however, you may also have advantages in the Italian public school system or at International schools because of your advanced teaching qualifications.TEFL and CELTA certificates are usually obtained after a month of intensive classes that are centered around teaching grammar, speaking, customs and language awareness. Programs are available in most major cities in the United States and in Europe and they can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars.

, You will need to allow at least three months to apply and receive this document, provided you submit the proper forms, fees and passport photos.


Keep in mind having citizenship to the European Union will make it easier for you to live and work in an EU country, such as Italy. If you think you may qualify for an EU passport, you should apply for the passport through your EU country of birth. There are currently 28 countries that make up the EU and all EU nationals are permitted to stay in any EU country and can visit any EU country for as long as they desire., Where you are from will have an impact on how you get a teaching job in Italy. Research the work and tourist visa regulations in Italy before applying for jobs.If you belong to a country that is part of the European Union (EU), you will have an easier time living and working in an EU country, such as Italy. If this is the case, you will have an advantage over other non-EU teachers as you can travel to Italy and stay as long as you need to in order to find a job. You will not be weighed down by extra work visa requirements and you are likely to receive a similar exchange rate to your home currency.
If you are a citizen of the USA, Canada, Australia or New Zealand you can visit Italy for three months or 90 days before obtaining a long-stay or work visa, also known as a type D visa. You need to submit documentation in person at the Italian consulate, including a completed visa application form, a passport that is valid at least three months after the visa expiration date, a passport-sized photo, a proof of residency in the area of the consulate, and the necessary visa application fees.
You will also need to apply for a residence permit if you are staying in Italy longer than 90 days. You will need to report to the local police station in your town of residence within eight days of your arrival, and apply for the necessary permit.
It is difficult for non-EU citizens to apply for a work permit in Italy and some schools may be hesitant to hire non-EU citizens as teachers. Many employers also do not want to have to complete all the necessary paperwork to sponsor a non-EU citizen for a work permit, as they will need to prove you are highly qualified and are not taking a position away from an EU citizen. Often, non-EU teachers in Italy will overstay their work visas and work for cash or they may obtain a student visa, which allows them to stay in Italy for six months., Make versions in both Italian and English that highlight your credentials, experience working with children, adaptability and responsible nature.


You should also get business cards made in Italian to hand out to potential employers. Many employers will expect you to provide a CV, a cover letter, business cards and a sample lesson plan during an interview.

, Italy operates on the Euro, which means it can be fairly expensive for a Canadian, American or Australian to live on the exchange rate. It is recommended that you have at least $2,500-$3,000USD in your bank account before going to Italy on a tourist visa.It may take you four to six weeks to find a job teaching English and during this time you will need to be able to support yourself on no income. Ensure you can afford to live in Italy by bringing enough for accommodations, food, and other expenses like new clothing for job interviews. You should also purchase all your necessary visas before you arrive in Italy and allot funds for a residency permit when you arrive in Italy.

, The Italian school system is a mix of public and private schools, and has a school year that runs from September to June. Students who attend public schools are divided into three age groups: primary school (scuola primaria or elementare), lower secondary school (scuola secondaria di primo grado or scuola media), and upper secondary school (scuola secondaria di secondo grado or scuola superiore). Most Italian youths attend school until the age of 16, at which point they can decide to continue their studies or enter the workforce.The classroom lessons and materials in Italian public schools are delivered in Italian, so you will need to have a good grasp of the language to land a position in a public school. Most English teachers are more likely to find a job at a private school, such as an international school.
If you have had previous experience teaching English in Italy, even if it was a temporary position, you will likely have a better chance of landing another position. Don't be afraid to use any existing contacts you may have in Italy, especially in the teaching sector, to help you secure a more permanent position.

, Organizations such as The English Camp Company, Lingue Senza Frontiere, Scotia Personnel, Ltd, Canadian Island Florence and A.C.L.E. employ native English speakers for approximately three months out of the year to teach students aged 7 to 14. You may also be asked to be a camp counselor.Remember that a summer camp position is a temporary position and will only last three months. Many camps may only be able to hire English speaking EU citizens. However, some employers will provide transportation, accommodation, and meals to their employees.

, Most teaching jobs in Italy can be found through private language institutes or schools. These schools begin in September or October and finish up in June. The average teaching contract usually lasts nine to ten months. Start looking for these positions in February and March, as many schools will start to advertise for open positions for the following school year.As most public schools tend to hire EU citizens and fluent Italian speakers, private institutes may be your best bet if you are not an EU citizen or a fluent speaker.
You can also search online for English teaching contracts in public schools, private institutes, and summer camps. Visit Transitions Abroad and Teaching English in Italy online for a list of job opportunities.

, If you have an Education degree or extensive teaching experience, a year-round job teaching English in an international school may be the best option. Look at the Italy section of the Worldwide Schools website to see a list of Italy's international schools and consider attending a Council of International Schools recruitment fair., If you like having a flexible schedule, then tutoring English may be the best way to teach in Italy. However, it can be challenging to find employment as a freelance tutor in Italy. Often, you will need to work at a school or institute in Italy first to establish your connections and then branch out into freelance tutoring.You will need to have strong conversational English to be an effective freelance tutor, and be able to create an individualized curriculum and lesson plans according to your student’s needs. You should set your rates according to other local tutors, post your number or email on community boards and encourage referrals once you grow your client base.
Some Italian companies may also advertise for a tutor for in-office English training. In these positions, you will need to assist your students with conversational English and proper pronunciation. You will also be expected to create lesson plans based on the company’s language needs.

, If you are interested in apply to work at an Italian public school, then you will have a better chance if you can interview for the job. You will need to invest money in your plane ticket and accommodations while you look for a job.Don’t be shy when applying for jobs in person. One option is to submit your resume and cover letter to the Head of English at local schools directly. Getting to know other English teachers who live and work in the area may also help you to be hired in the department. As well, if you have friends or contacts who live in the area, ask them to keep an eye out for open teaching positions.
Consider volunteering for the school if you aren't hired during the year. If you work in a language school or you are supporting yourself with tutoring, you can also volunteer to help with a school play or after school lessons. This effort may put you forward for the next available position.

, Italians are particularly sensitive to good hygiene and being well dressed, so do not show up to your interview appearing sloppy or unkempt.For men, this may mean an ironed collared shirt with a tie and slacks, as well as dress shoes and for women this may mean an ironed collared shirt with a long skirt and dress shoes.

, Many employers will ask you to provide a CV and a cover letter in Italian, as well as a sample lesson plan in English and Italian. In your position, you may need to create lesson plans based on the individual needs of your students. Your employer will want to confirm you can do this successfully during the interview.When you arrive in Italy, try to get a cellphone as soon as possible. You should then put this local number on your resume so employers can contact you.

, Some employers may ask you to demonstrate your teaching ability by giving them a mock in class lesson in Italian. You should be able to speak in conversational Italian and present language concepts with confidence and expertise., It can be risky to accept a teaching position abroad, especially if you are not there in person to meet your employer or you have just received a job offer and are not sure how to confirm the position is all it promises. You should ask several questions of the employer to ensure the position is valid and will be beneficial to your teaching career in Italy. If the employer cannot provide the majority of these specifications, they may not be an employer you want to work for.Confirm if your work visa will be sponsored by the employer or if they will help you obtain one. If you are going to be working illegally for the employer, this means you will likely have lower pay, no health coverage, no holiday pay, and no legal protection. If the school cannot help you with your visa, they should try to offer guidance and cover the fee of obtaining the visa.
Ask what types of benefits you will receive, such as health insurance. Confirm if the insurance policy is global or national to get a sense of how much coverage you are receiving.
Check if your housing will be paid for or if you are expected to find housing on your own. Some schools may offer shared accommodations or have contacts for single housing. If possible, ask for pictures of typical employee housing and ask for contact information for any roommates or persons that will be living with you in a shared space. You can also ask to speak to the current staff at the school to confirm the logistics of working for the employer and the state of the provided housing.
Confirm if the school or placement organization is a member of a language association. Belonging to an association means the school has to follow certain quality assurance guidelines and maintain good standing as an employer.
Ask if you will be expected to provide teaching materials and if there is a curriculum you must follow. You should also check how much freedom you will be given in terms of deciding what to teach and how to teach your students.
Check if you will be given a welcome orientation, be given guidance from more experienced teachers, and consistent feedback. Some schools may offer additional training and evaluate your performance.

Develop your own love for astronomy.,
Decide in what capacity you wish to teach astronomy.,
Get a foundation in math and science.,
Go to college.,
Intern.,
Get your teaching license.",How to Become an Astronomy Teacher1," Although astronomy, by its nature, is a fascinating science, you need to discover and develop this fascination for yourself before you can teach it to others. It is helpful to develop a love for astronomy as early in your life as you can, although it can also be a love you discover in early adulthood or later in life. There are several ways you can nurture this fascination for yourself at any age.


Studying the night sky for yourself is the surest way to discover the wonders of the universe. You can start by looking at the sky in your neighborhood, although you will be able to see more stars and other objects by going away from city lights. Many local astronomy groups schedule regular viewing parties with telescopes and binoculars at out-of-town locations, as well as special events coinciding with astronomical phenomena such as meteor showers or the appearance of a comet.
You can supplement your observation by reading about astronomy, both from books and online. Your school or public librarian can help you select appropriate astronomy books, and you can find answers to your questions online at such sites as the University of Virginia.
You can further your knowledge with astronomy software. Various planetarium software applications are available for personal computers, and there is a smart phone application that uses global positioning satellite (GPS) technology to identify the constellation the phone is pointed at.;
, You can become an astronomy teacher in one of several venues: in the classroom, in a planetarium or science museum, or online. Each venue has its own teaching methods, and thus, its own separate requirements. Common to each is a love for and knowledge of astronomy, but the specific skills and range of knowledge varies.


Teaching astronomy in the classroom depends on the age and grade level of the students being taught. College astronomy classes are often lecture-based, but those for elementary, middle, and high school students involve more interactive lessons, which may include using astronomy software applications, field trips to planetariums, or outings viewing the night sky, often in conjunction with local astronomy clubs. While astronomy is taught in elementary and middle schools as part of the regular science curriculum, some high schools may offer separate elective astronomy classes along with including astronomy as part of a physics class.
Teaching astronomy in a planetarium setting may involve working with college astronomy professors to provide support for their lectures, particularly if the planetarium is part of a college. However, most planetarium-based astronomy lessons are presented in the form of multimedia shows involving optomechanical or digital projectors, with the display often coordinated with music and dialogue. Such shows may be geared to audiences of a specific age or to the general public and may either be scheduled for certain times or, in some cases, designed so visitors can build their own experience by selecting from several available shows.
Teaching astronomy online replaces the classroom setting with an interactive environment where instructors and students communicate through discussion forums. Lectures may be pre-recorded in either audio or video form and transmitted in real time or podcasted for download at the recipients' convenience and supplemented with Web-based astronomy software or online catalogs of astronomical images. Some online instructors organize their classes into smaller discussion groups led by teaching assistants. Online astronomy classes require discipline on the part of students in participating regularly and fully in discussions and completing assignments in a timely fashion and on the part of instructors in monitoring the discussions and grading assignments in a timely fashion.

, In high school, take all the math and science classes you can. This will familiarize you with the areas of science that relate to astronomy and help give you an understanding of how the universe works.

, To teach astronomy at any level, you will need a college degree. You'll also need to further your education in math and science in general, as well as your computer skills. The exact nature of your course of study will depend on the institution where you study and where you plan to teach.


To be an astronomy teacher in elementary, middle, or high school, you'll need at least a bachelor's degree, usually with a major in education. (If possible, you should have either a minor or academic concentration in science, although some districts do draft science teachers from the ranks of those teaching other subjects in crunch situations.) If your undergraduate degree was in another area, you'll most likely want to get a master's in education before you can teach astronomy.
To teach astronomy at the college level, you'll need at least a master's degree or a PhD, depending on whether you plan to teach astronomy at a community college, a small, private college, or a major university. As most online astronomy classes are taught through a college, the educational requirements for teaching astronomy online are generally the same as for teaching it in the classroom.
To teach astronomy at a planetarium or an instructional media center, the degree requirements depend to some extent on where the planetarium is located. Instructional media centers associated with a school district will require either a bachelor's or master's degree, depending on the district, while planetariums associated with a college or university may treat the planetarium as part of the physics department and require the same degree as for a physics professor. Because of the ""show"" nature of planetarium lessons, classes in script or playwriting, public speaking, and communications can be as helpful as science classes, as can business classes if you intend to become the planetarium's curator.
At any teaching level, classes in mythology and folklore can also serve you well. Constellations such as Andromeda, Hercules, Orion, Pegasus, and Perseus are named for characters in Greek mythology, and most of the other constellations in the night sky have stories connected with them in at least one culture's folklore. Knowing and sharing these stories can be a means to develop others' interest in astronomy.

, For teaching astronomy in a public or private school setting, this means becoming a student teacher, which usually happens during your senior year of earning your undergraduate degree. For teaching astronomy in a planetarium setting, this means working as an intern, either as an undergraduate or graduate student or both, depending on the planetarium. For teaching in a college or online, this would mean working as a graduate assistant and organizing face-to-face or online discussion groups to supplement the main lectures or presentations.

, If you plan to teach astronomy in a public school, you'll need to get a teaching license and conform to any other requirements of the board of education you're subject to. If you teach at a private school, you may or may not need to get a teaching license, depending on the laws where the school is located. Teaching at a college does not require having a license, although you may be required to earn tenure to continue teaching at that institution.

Develop your own love for astronomy.,
Look for suitable teaching materials.,
Reinforce the lessons with hands-on activities.",How to Become an Astronomy Teacher2," Developing your own love of astronomy is as important when teaching it in a homeschool environment as in a professional environment, if not more so. As a parent or guardian, you are closer to your children than any schoolteacher would be and will spend more time around them.

, A number of educational companies provide packages for teaching astronomy in homeschool settings. You can search for these companies online, then review their websites to decide which company's materials are suitable for teaching astronomy to your children.


Educational programs for teaching astronomy can be organized in one of two ways, either starting from a local perspective (Earth, moon, solar system) and working outward to larger entities (constellations, galaxies, and the universe) or starting with the ""big picture"" and working toward the nearby objects. You'll have to decide which approach you're more comfortable with.
Consider the age of your child when selecting astronomy materials. Astronomy education materials for young children should focus on the basics of what stars, planets, and moons are and how the solar system is arranged, while older children can deal with more complicated matters, such as how to calculate orbital periods and planetary diameters and masses.
Because many people choose to homeschool their children for religious reasons, a number of the available astronomy homeschool packages approach the subject from a religious perspective. In addition to reviewing these packages for content and scientific accuracy, you must also evaluate these packages as to whether any doctrines incorporated within the materials are compatible with your own religious beliefs.

, Take your children skywatching with you, with either a telescope or binoculars. Take them to planetarium shows and provide them with astronomy-related books and toys to further their interest. You can also tour such websites as those for the Hubble and Spitzer telescopes, at http://hubblesite.org/gallery/ and http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/, respectively, or the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day archives, at http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html.

Additional jobs are advertised in the Spring of each year.,
If you interviewed well, you will get invited for a campus visit.",How to Become an Academic Philosopher," Because academic philosophers are very cliquish and trust only the judgment of their ""old boys network"" friends, it is important to have good connections. Sadly, few go far in philosophy unless they got an undergraduate degree at a large, prestigious state university or a very selective private university or college.;
, Go to every class, do all the reading, go to all department events. Take good notes. Most of what you learn will be relevant far into your future. Take challenging classes from well-known senior faculty, so that you can get good letters of recommendation. (You might also want to get a second major in some related but more useful subject: economics, computer science, biology, chemistry, physics.)

, You will need three letters of recommendation, all from philosophers, a 1 page statement of purpose, and a 15-page writing sample. Write your writing sample on a philosophical topic that is timely and small enough to manage. Depending on your situation, it might be best to go to a terminal master's program first. This might take 2-3 years. After that, you will need to get a PhD. This will probably take an additional 3-5 years. PhD programs presuppose a lot of knowledge and motivation. The professors are active researchers, first and foremost, and teachers, second.

, Present them at conferences. Publish them in good academic journals (the top ones are Mind, Nous, Philosophical Review, The Journal of Philosophy, and Philosophical Studies). Try to teach some classes.

, There seem to be lots of jobs in ethics, applied ethics, philosophy of science, and philosophy of education. There are relatively few jobs in philosophy of language, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind.

, Try to make it so that there are at least three articles out of the dissertation that you can give as talks or use as writing samples.

, Connections are very important in academia. No one will know how good your work is if no one reads it. Most academic jobs are gotten through the ""old boys network,"" even though there is an expensive and elaborate charade of a job convention (see below).

, Typically, there are around 300 jobs per year. If a school is interested in you, they will probably set up an interview at the annual East Coast meeting of the American Philosophical Association (APA). The meeting rotates between Boston, New York, Philly, DC, and Atlanta. Go to your interview, and try to make a good impression!

, Some of these require interviews at the Central Division Meeting of the APA in Chicago.

Additionally, some schools require a teaching license from your country, while language institutes often accept TEFL or CELTA certification.


TEFL, TESOL, or CELTA certification courses exist worldwide and online. Note that some programs prefer CELTA over TEFL/TESOL because CELTA has a standardized curriculum set by Cambridge University.Obtain a teaching license in a relevant area such as English or linguistics if you wish to teach in a grade school. Many schools require that you have this type of credential when you apply.;
, Decide on when you would like to teach in Germany and think about how long it will take you to obtain the right credential for the position you are looking for.

Contracts can last from a couple of months to a couple of years.There are many agencies that can put you in contact with German schools or language institutes. These organizations require that you apply to the program as opposed to contacting schools or institutes directly.
Alternatively, you can try applying to schools, institutes, or individual contractors directly. This may be challenging especially if you do not have contacts in Germany or German language fluency. This is, however, another way to secure work in Germany.
Application requirements vary. Some organizations ask that you have a valid teaching license in your country or that you have some kind of English language teaching certificate.

, If you have contacts in Germany, they may help able to arrange private lessons with potential students of all ages. These students may need help with school work, or they may work for international companies and need help with conversational English. If you establish yourself well, this can become a permanent gig. Private lessons require constant attention and focus on one person. Most private language lessons last from one to two hours. Decide if this is the right teaching arrangement for you.
Cancellations and no-shows are more common with private lessons. It’s possible that you won’t have a steady income.
Prepare to do the necessary paperwork as a freelancer in Germany. You will need to register with tax authorities and the relevant professional authority. You may also need to set up your own health insurance and pension plan. , Rather than relying on degrees alone, show your potential employer that you have the skills it takes to keep students engaged and learning.


If you don't have much experience, provide information on how you would handle English-language curriculum.

, No matter where or how you choose to work, teachers are in high demand around August, right before the school year begins. Jobs tend to open up again in December. Keep these months in mind and apply in advance. , Your expenses may be higher at the beginning of your stay. Some teaching jobs in schools provide accommodations, but most do not. Apartments in metropolitan areas can be quite expensive.Bring about two to three months of savings for your first few months. You may need extra money as you set up bank accounts and get settled.

Having a high grade point average and graduating from a highly ranked school will help your chances of getting into a PhD program, and thus getting a lecturer position.If you want to go on to a graduate program after your undergrad, you should focus on being a good student and getting good grades while you are completing your bachelor's degree.;
, In order to become a university lecturer in the UK, you first need to get into a PhD program. Most lecturing posts in good universities in academic subjects (including the arts, humanities, and sciences) require a PhD as a minimum requirement. To get into most PhD programs, you will need to fill out an application, write a cover letter, and supply a sample of your writing or research. In some cases you will also need to complete some sort of graduate school entrance testing, although this varies.Go to the most highly rated PhD program that you can. This will vastly improve the likelihood that you get a lecturer position after graduate school.
Two of the key entrance exams used for PhD admission are the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). The Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) is used for a wide variety of graduate programs. The Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) is used for Phd programs in business and management.
Taking graduate school entrance exams is much more common in the United States, but it may be required for specific schools or specific programs elsewhere. Check with the school you are applying to to see if it is required for admission.

, You will likely need to dedicate at least ten years of your life to academic study. Part of your time in a PhD program is used to complete coursework, meaning classes you take with professors.The number of classes of coursework you need to take for your PhD program will be determined by your specific program.

, A PhD program typically includes the completion of a dissertation, especially if you are working in the Humanities or Social Sciences. This project will need to demonstrate not only that you are familiar with the entire field associated with your project, but must also make a new contribution to existing knowledge in the area.


You do not have to develop a new drug or make a new discovery about Shakespeare, but you do have to research an original topic, come up with a new framework for thinking about your chosen area, or put together existing materials in fresh and exciting ways.

, Throughout your PhD program you should try to do some teaching in addition to your course work and your own research. This could include giving guest lectures for classes in your department or getting a position as a teaching fellow or fixed-term faculty. The more of this experience you can get, the better.Teaching during your graduate work will allow you to develop that skill, in addition to your skills as a researcher and a thinker.
If you have not gotten any teaching experience in your graduate program thus far, talk to your advisor about your desire to get that kind of experience. It may take you being proactive in order to get teaching experience, especially in graduate programs that do not emphasize teaching.

, In order to build your name and credentials in your field, it is important to start going to conferences and presenting at them. These meetings will help you build contacts and find out about new and interesting aspects of your field. Important opportunities do come out of these meetings.


Your academic advisor should encourage you to attend academic conferences and give papers at these conferences. In some cases, you may even be able to work with your advisor and present that work at a conference with your advisor. However, if your advisor is well-known or a big name in their field, they are less likely to have the time to do this type of collaborative work., It is becoming increasingly necessary that a PhD student applying for a job already have publications accepted or published. In most cases, this will be an article or a review in an academic journal. Having publications before you complete your PhD makes you more competitive for the limited number of lecturer positions available.Having publications before you finish graduate school can be difficult, but it does show potential employers that you are serious about your academic research. It also shows them that you are likely to keep up with the demands of the tenure deadline.

, In addition to teaching and scholarship, you should work on getting experience with university service while in graduate school. This will show that you will be an attribute to a university department and you understand that service to the institution is a key component of the job of a lecturer.


Service to the university can come in a wide variety of forms. A few examples include serving as the graduate student representative on hiring committees and helping organize conferences or speaking engagements at your university.

, In order to consolidate your teaching experience, conference experience, and to add to your publications, many PhD's take on temporary contracts as a post-doctoral researchers or teachers. Many use this time to convert their PhD dissertation into a book or publications. Also, if you did not get teaching experience during your graduate program, you may need to consider a Post-Doc position to get that experience.Once you have publications and teaching experience, it is much more likely that you will be able to get a job as a university lecturer.

, As with most jobs these days, academic lecturer positions are posted online on university or college websites and the websites of higher education organizations. Search specific university websites, as well as the websites of organizations focusing on higher education jobs in the UK.There are also specialty websites that post jobs in specific academic disciplines.
It may be that you will hear about jobs from colleagues and supervisors as well. For instance, if you are in a PhD program you may hear about an upcoming job from a professor in your department or from other students in your program.
You should be willing to go to a variety of locations if you want to be a university lecturer. Limiting your job search by location is not a good idea. With the limited job openings there are, going where the jobs are is important.

, A CV, which is short for ""curriculum vitae,"" is basically an academic resume. It lists all of your experiences in academia and the skills you have developed there. It should be done in a clear and concise format that highlights your experience and unique attributes.One of the benefits of using a CV is that is doesn't need to be changed for each position you are applying for, since it is a thorough list of all of your work and education.
At minimum, your CV should include sections for education, teaching experience, publications, and university service, as well as references.

, You should find out as much as you can about the school you are hoping to teach at. This includes their overall philosophy, their financial situation, and their plans for the future.


This information is usually available online.
Look for general university or college information, information about the specific department you are hoping to join, and about the faculty already in that department.

, An academic job application will usually include a cover letter, statement of teaching philosophy, one of your publications, and other documents, in addition to your CV. When completing a job application for a lecturer position, you need to make sure to do some research about the university and its courses before you apply. You also need to read the job ad very carefully so you know exactly what they want. With the information you get in your research you can tailor your application to the needs of the institution.


Most job applications are done online these days. There is usually a link connected to the job posting where you will turn in all of your application components.
When turning in electronic documents for a job application, make sure the documents are in a format that will not allow them to be changed depending on what application is used to view them.For instance, a PDF document is in a permanent form that will not be altered by the PDF viewer that is used to view it.

, For most lecturer positions you will need to go through several rounds of interviews before you are chosen. These may include an initial phone or video interview and then an in-person interview if you are a finalist for the job. Some things you should do while preparing for your interviews include:Review what is unique about you. While doing an interview it is important to highlight what it unique and important about you. If you can get these points across, the people interviewing you are likely to understand how you could improve the program you are hoping to join.
Practice likely questions. While you won't be able to know exactly what your interviewers will ask, there are some common questions you can practice. These include questions about your research, your teaching experience, and your experience with academic service.

, Once you have been chosen for a lecturer position, you will need to negotiate your contract. This is the first time in the process that you have some power to control the situation, but you shouldn't get too greedy. Once the college or university gives you an initial offer, you can choose to negotiate about any part of their offer, asking for more salary, startup money, resources, or other forms of support.


Do some research about salaries at the university or college you are hoping to work at and keep your requests in keeping with existing salaries. In many cases, if it is a public institution, this information is public and can be found online.When you go into negotiations you need to remember that the university or college is likely going to begin with a low offer with the expectation that you will try to negotiate for more. However, with the sheer number of qualified people applying for every lecturer position, remember that you can't ask for too much or they might move on to someone else.

, Once you have a lecturer position, you will need to work hard to keep that position and advance in your university. Most lecturer positions are permanent, however beginning lecturers are in a probationary position until they pass an evaluation after three years. There is room for advancement from lecturer to senior lecturer to full professor for lecturers, but this career advancement requires excellence in teaching, service, and research.Not all lecturers will advance all the way to full professors during their careers. The position of full professor is reserved for those that have shown particularly excellent work in their scholarship, teaching, and service.
Advancements are usually attained when an existing position opens, when department heads nominate a lecturer for advancement, or when a lecturer applies for advancement.

Fill out an application to become a teacher's aid.",How to Become a Teacher's Aid," Being a teacher's aid is about being a great assistant. You'll need to be a team player and devote yourself to making the teacher's job easier.


A good master teacher is likely to take input from you in lesson-planning, rule-setting, and other classroom activities. Keep all of this in mind, but also remember that ultimately the buck stops with the master teacher, not with you, so be prepared to do what they ask and follow their rules!;
, If you don't like working with kids, this might not be a good position for you. Depending on the age level of your students, you may need to get down on the floor and spend long hours of the day playing, teaching, singing, and more. Spending a little time with kids of various ages can help you figure out whether the job is a good fit for you.


You can start by spending some time with the children of friends or relatives, or if you feel equipped, you can try nannying or babysitting. These roles are pretty different from being a teacher's aid in a full classroom, but they can still give you an idea (with potentially less commitment) about how you'd do interacting with kids on a daily basis.
Many teacher's aids work with students with special needs or students with behavior problems.Make sure you are comfortable working closely with a wide variety of kids before attempting to become a teacher's aid.

, Being a teacher's aid requires you to be proactive and wear a lot of different hats on the job. You might be helping with reading in small groups at one point and soon after you might be preparing photocopies for the teacher. You could even be required to be a crossing guard!Whatever is asked of you, within reason of course, is an important part of your job that needs to be done well.


Resourcefulness is an important quality to have when you are a teacher's aid. For instance, you will need to be able to help explain material creatively to students who are having difficulty grasping information as it is presented in class.

, Being a teacher's aid will require you to be on your feet for many hours.In addition, you will need to have the ability to lift around 50 pounds and to stoop and squat on the floor with students.

, Not all teacher's aid positions require a specific academic background, such as an Associate's degree for teacher's assistants. However, knowing a little bit about child psychology and best practices in teaching can go a long way towards both getting a teacher's aid job and succeeding in it.

, This can be really helpful in preparing you for the type of work you will do as a teacher's aid. These classes will teach about developing educational materials, how to observe students, and understanding the role of teacher's aids in the classroom, among other things.Many community colleges provide classes specifically aimed at helping you gain the skills you will need to be successful as a teacher's aid., While educational requirements vary, with some teacher's aid jobs only requiring that you have a high school diploma, most will require you to have some sort of additional education.If you are planning on completing more education specifically to become eligible for a teacher's assistant job, you might want to consider an Associate's degree specifically for teacher's assistants.
In addition, some teacher's aid jobs require previous experience working with children, for instance with a youth group or in a daycare., Depending on the state and local school districts, the certifications you will need to become a teacher's assistant will vary. In California, for example, you need to pass the No Child Left Behind Exam or the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST) in order to work as a Teacher's Aid.Getting CPR certifications or certified by the Red Cross to babysit can be good certifications to have.
Most school districts require you to pass a background check as well before you can be hired.

, Most teacher's aid positions will require references with your application. If you have someone who can vouch for your character, patience, and reliability, it'll go a long way towards making your application more appealing. Bonus points if they know about how good you are with kids!

, It's possible that after some time as a volunteer, you could transition into a paid position, if a position becomes available. However, even if no paid position comes about, you can add the experience to your resume

, If you're already spending time with children to gain experience, look for opportunities to talk to the teachers. Get to know them, establish rapport over time, and tell them about your interest in teaching. An established teacher may know of openings at their school or other schools in the area and may be willing to put a good word in for you.

, They should be available on your local school district's website and on general classified-ad websites as well. Wherever you find the ad, make sure you fit the minimum requirements of the job and that the job is a good fit for you as well.


Job prospects for teacher's assistants vary significantly by region.Areas with growing populations, thus increasing enrollment, are likely to have the most opportunity.

, Be sure to follow all directions on the job posting, for instance follow the stipulations of how many references to include with your application and who to address your application to.


Be sure to include a convincing cover letter with your application. You will want to be concise but also express your interest in the job and why you are the perfect fit for it.
Most job applications are now submitted online. If that is the case, be sure to follow the directions for online submission and make sure you have successfully submitted the application before closing your web browser.

In addition, your degree must be from an accredited institution.In September 2016, the Department of Education withdrew recognition of the agency accrediting many for-profit schools, the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools. If you received you bachelor’s degree from a for-profit institution, it may be a barrier to obtaining a teacher’s license in Colorado.Colorado does not recognize accreditation from the following: the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement, the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Inc., Commission on Technical and Career Institutions, and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges.;
, If you received a Bachelor’s in Education from a state college or university in Colorado, you probably already completed the teacher preparation program as a part of your course of study. However, if you do not fall into that category, you will have to enroll in and complete a course at one of the many institutions of higher learning in Colorado.Find a searchable list of approved programs at http://www.cde.state.co.us/cdeprof/educator-preparation-institution-search.
Once completed, be sure to obtain a completed program verification form from http://cde.state.co.us/cdeprof/approved_program_verification_form and have an administrator from the preparation program fill it out.

, A teacher who wishes to teach a certain subject must show an appropriate level of knowledge about that subject. This can be done in one of two ways:You can submit transcript records showing you completed at least twenty four credit hours of study in the given subject.
Take a state examination in the subject area. Colorado has approved a number of tests for the testing of subject matter knowledge, including PLACE, Praxis, and NES. See which ones are approved for which subjects at http://cde.state.co.us/cdeprof/content_tests.htm


, A criminal background check will be conducted on all applicants for an Initial Teacher’s License. In order for the background check to be completed, you must submit a copy of your fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The process for doing so is simple, but very specific.First, create an online account with the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) at https://apps.colorado.gov/cde/licensing/Account/AcctMatching.aspx

Next, you will need to get your fingerprints taken by a law enforcement agency, like a constable, marshal, sheriff, or police department. Your fingerprints must be stamped on an official Applicant Fingerprint Card. Most law enforcement agencies will provide you with the Applicant Fingerprint Card (#FD-258), but if yours won’t, you can get one on Amazon. Fill the top portion of the card out completely and take the card to a law enforcement agency to add your fingerprint.
Mail the completed card and your $39.50 application fee to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, 690 Kipling St., Suite 3000, Lakewood, CO 80215. The CBI only accepts money orders, cashier’s checks, and credit card authorizations, which can be printed out at https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/Credit%20Card%20Form.pdf.
It can take up to eight weeks for the results to come back, and you will be notified via your online account.

, In order to apply for a teacher's license in Colorado, you will need to submit the official copies of your college transcripts for all colleges you attended along with your application. Official transcripts usually come through the mail, so you’ll need to request these before you actually fill out the application.Once you receive your transcripts, you will need to scan them, save them as a PDF, and upload them during the application process. Do not mail them.

, Take a high quality scan of your program verification form and your test results (if you had to take a test). Save them as a PDF and upload them along with your application., You will need to submit your employment record for the past five years. You will be required to submit the name and address of the employer, the dates of employment, the reason you left, and the names of your supervisor.If you have prior teaching experience, even if it is longer than five years ago, submit that information as well.

, Simply go to the login page at https://apps.colorado.gov/cde/licensing/Login.aspx, log in, and then select the application for “teacher.”, Once you’re licensed, you need to create a portfolio highlighting your biggest strengths. Your portfolio shows you’re serious and professional. Pay attention to detail when you create it, because it will make a lasting impression. Include things like:Letters of recommendation from professors, teachers you've interned with, and other education professionals.
Sample lesson plans in your subject area.
Test scores from your licensing exams.
An updated resume.
A statement of your teaching philosophy, taking note of your approach and theoretical background.

, Establishing your qualifications in more than one subject area makes you eligible for more job openings, plain and simple.It makes sense to pursue certifications in subject areas which are similar to your primary area of expertise. For instance, if your main subject area is math, get another certification in science. If your primary subject of expertise is English, pursue another certification in drama or social studies.

, Although you won’t make very much money at it, substitute teaching is a good way to make professional connections with other educators while you’re looking for permanent employment. , If you’re not having much luck looking at the same online classified listings, get creative. Look at state government and school district websites to see any positions advertised there, look at school websites (especially private schools), and cast a wide net geographically., Like you would with any job, you'll need to complete an interview in order to get hired. In addition to dressing smartly and showing up on time, keep these tips in mind:


Research the school and its history. A new institution will have a vision for the future and an older institution will have years of traditions to be proud of. Do your best to make yourself familiar with them.
Think of questions you have for the interviewer.
A lot of your selling points will be encapsulated in your portfolio. Nonetheless, make sure you practice them enough to succinctly summarize them in an interview situation.

Most schools, both small and large, house English, education, or teacher training programs. To make your future job applications as strong as possible, it is wise to select a school that has a strong reputation in the field you are entering., Earn a bachelor's degree in education, teaching or English. The degree takes 4 to 5 years to complete, depending on the program and college you choose. Which major you choose will necessarily impact how you choose to package yourself as a job candidate.Many colleges and universities have joint-degree programs that allow you to focus on specific aspects of two majors while earning one bachelor’s degree. These types of degree granting programs are ideal for ESL teachers., If you're pursuing a 4-year degree in teaching or education, then you will likely take core courses related to pedagogy, syllabus development, how to devise testing and assessment techniques, etc. You also must complete general education classes, such as math and political science and elective classes.It may be wise to take some general history courses. Knowing the history of the countries of ESL learners may make teaching them English a little easier., While learning a foreign language is not required to become an ESL teacher, it is strongly recommended. Which language you choose to take is up to you. However, you should be aware that you will have an easier time finding a job if you learn languages that are in demand.For example, many European nations, especially in northern and western Europe, maintain a strong knowledge of the English language among their general populations. This will make learning a language like German, Dutch, or Norwegian less marketable than learning a language like Chinese, Spanish, or French.
Also, keep in mind that many developing nations that house multiple language groups utilize European languages as official languages in the country. So, it will do you little good to learn an obscure language from Senegal or Haiti, when you can just as easily provide instruction in French to people from these countries.

, Most education or teaching-based majors require you to complete an internship to graduate with a bachelor's degree. The internship is usually at a school or learning center and will be arranged by your department. Typically, internships are offered for 1 or 2 semesters and are carried out in the student’s junior or senior year.Internships often do not pay regular wages, but they may offer college credit. They may also offer a small stipend.

, A graduate degree takes 2 to 3 years to complete. Although the minimum requirement to work is 4-year degree, some employers may prefer hiring an ESL teacher with a graduate degree. Having this degree will not only increase your chances of being hired, but may also bump you up into a higher pay grade once employed., Select a program that is well-respected in the field of education or teacher training. As is the case with most graduate programs, the strength of a department lies in the teaching and research strengths of its faculty members. So, be sure to research departmental webpages to know who you will be working with.Most graduate programs require students to select a faculty adviser. If this is the case with the program you select, it is wise to contact those faculty members directly to see if they will work with you and support your candidacy. You will also want to mention which faculty members you would like to work with in your application essay.

, Certain courses, like basic methodology and literature review courses will be required. You should select the remaining courses that fulfill your degree requirements based on the faculty member overseeing the course and the topic of the course, as they pertain to your specialty., Graduate schools are great places to engage with other respected-faculty members and other students, which can help you find a job later on. While completing your coursework, take every opportunity to attend conferences, workshops and seminars.Depending on the size of and available funding in your department, you may be able to get money to attend conferences, workshops and seminars.

, A major component of completing your graduate degree is researching and writing your master’s thesis. This document represents your contribution to ongoing scholarly debates in your area of expertise. Your adviser in the department should be able to help you identify a topic and find resources for writing your thesis., As you are nearing the end of your degree program, you will want to ask three faculty members, who know you and your work well, for letters of recommendation. These letters will be essential parts of your application for jobs down the line.

, These organizations allow you to network with other ESL professionals and learn more about the career. More importantly, they will allow you to meet people who may be able to provide you with job opportunities, references, or advice on finding a job. Some of these groups are:TESOL (Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages) is a global organization that holds annual conventions, maintains online forums and blogs, and provides access to TESOL resource centers.
AAAL (The American Association for Applied Linguistics) is the American branch of IAAL and offers access to peer-reviewed journals, holds annual conferences, and grants student travel awards.
IAWE (The International Association of Worldwide Englishes) is another global group that brings ESL teachers together, runs a journal, and hold various conferences throughout the year.
ILTA (The International Language Testing Association) is an organization that runs newsletters, holds online discussions, and hosts annual conferences for people interested in developing testing to gauge how individuals learn languages.

, You will need a Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) certificate to work as an ESL teacher. The certificate provides you with additional ESL training and is offered online or through community colleges and language institutes., States require all teachers to obtain a license to teach at public schools and adult education programs run by the government. Qualifying to take the exam for the license usually requires obtaining a bachelor's degree and finishing a teaching training program., You are now ready to get your career as an ESL teacher started. You can obtain employment through networking, help from college advisers or online employment websites.


You may find that work for ESL teachers is more readily available outside of the United States. If you plan to work abroad, you will want to apply for or renew your passport and look into getting a visa, if one is needed for where you are going.
There are a number of websites and online resources for ESL teachers looking to work abroad. Some of those sites are:
Dave's ESL Cafe provides a list of jobs available around the globe for people looking to teach ESL abroad.
Teacher Port gives a listing of ESL opportunities across Asia and the Middle East.
Go Abroad is a website that provides a number of suggestions for finding employment abroad to fund traveling abroad. There are many ESL opportunities on this site as well.
There are also plenty of opportunities to work as an ESL teacher domestically as well. Some websites that provide opportunities to to teach ESL in the United States are:
ESL 101 is a searchable database of ESL teaching jobs that allows the user to look for opportunities by country or region.
The TESOL website maintains a job listing database that can help you find an ESL job in the U.S.
Remember, ESL goes by a number of different acronyms (EFL, TEFL, ESOL, EAL), so be sure to search for all the associated acronyms when looking for employment. This will expand your job pool quite a bit.
University and college departmental webpages often maintain links to relevant job search sites. So be sure to scour English, teacher-training, and education departmental websites.
Many of the teaching opportunities for ESL teachers are found in public schools across the U.S. As such, you will want to look at state government and local school district webpages as well to see if there are any ESL job openings in your area.

"
Inquire whether local school districts have openings and may need to hire teachers in an alternative certification plan for teaching full-time, in an emergency teaching position in a high need teaching field such as math, science, bilingual education  and possibly special education, etc.

,
Seek information at school districts, at state education agencies, at teacher education colleges: find out about being eligible, even if you may not have finished a degree or have not taken ""teacher-education"" courses and training -- or maybe you have a degree but not enough credit to be traditionally certified in the course work in the ""needed"" teacher fields, but have shown good progress in past coursework in the field in question.,
Apply seeking an appropriate teacher position vacancy (sometimes the class is taught by a substitute teacher for several weeks or months until a more qualified teacher is hired): get references and official college transcripts mailed to the school administration offices where you have already turned in the application.,
Expect to be interviewed both at the district office and at each school where you are considered for hiring.,
Get hired to a teaching position, and then you will be required to file a plan and make adequate progress toward becoming fully certified within the time allowed.

,
Begin teaching as a non-degreed, or non-certified teacher: hired under some form of legal regulation of your training and your progress in academic course work supervised and counseled by a college or university Department of Teacher Education or State Education Agency (or Education Services Center), under the laws of your state.

,
Finish the required alternative plan or deficiency plan while teaching: similar to a college degree plan as an alternative teacher certificate candidate by going to teacher training at your school district, the state education agency (local-region) service center, college evenings and/or on Saturdays, or summer sessions at college.

,
Pass the required standardized subject matter test in the subject teaching field as required in your state.

,
Pass another test in general knowledge/academic skills to finally be certified -- to have the certification become complete and valid.,
Find out what is the minimum number of credit hours: for subject areas and teaching fields in matters of classification as ""qualified"" to teach under provisions of the alternative certification laws and rules to seek an alternative teacher certificate in your state.,
Research in your state the number of college hours and subject areas: and, find the level of courses required for ""alternative certification"" or some similar name (this certificate has been called ""emergency certification"" and may be called other names).",How to Become a Teacher Without a Degree by Alternative Certification,",


The school districts collaborate with the colleges but do not set the requirements. They are decided by the state education agency in coordination with the state teacher colleges.
During the usual alternative certification, you will not do practice teaching because you will already be working as a full-time teacher (you will avoid the traditional, college undergraduate teacher training program that would have been required while the student was a junior and senior in the traditional collegiate training).
In some states, for example in Texas, there are state credentialed teacher training companies that are setup under state law as organizations to recruit and prepare already degreed persons to receive alternative certification, without going back to college. The candidate must pass state required general and subject-area (content) teacher tests. Every time you pass a content test it makes you Highly Qualified (HQ) in that subject-area. This is an important step in qualifications for getting hired and certified. There are options, for the candidate, for the required training from the company ""online"" or a combination of ""face to face and online"". The initial cost in the program is a small down payment to the training company, then after being hired by a school district and working as a teacher you must pay the balance on an installment plan.One option is for one year training while teaching full-time. Then the candidate receives a state probationary certificate in that program, and the company will provide training for additional cost after being hired by a school district and working as a teacher. You may pay the balance on an installment plan.
A second option is ""Clinical Training"", where the candidate can get certified in one semester by doing student teaching in the program.


Vocational education teachers do not need much or perhaps need no college coursework or only a state certificate in the craft or skill for teaching technical crafts and trade class subjects in general -- but they would be licensed and certified in their field of crafts and skills such as in the building trades and automobile mechanics and other similar areas and courses of training, work and study.

, When there is a vacancy for availability to be hired -- then you would be asked to schedule for an interview to be hired.

, There may be several candidates, and the interviews may be crucial in your being the one chosen/accepted by the principal of the school and hired.


Dress and behave professionally; be pleasant and calm.
You will be asked on the application and during interviews:

Why do you want to be a teacher.
What are your long term career goals.
How will you handle classroom discipline, and similar questions.


Be ready to explain your system of classroom management with consistent teaching practices, ""firm but fair discipline (treating everyone as equals, but as individuals where applicable)"", such as: a ""progressive discipline"" process -- first post and explain 5 or 6 rules; then for instance speak to an offender (and make a record ), next-time schedule a before or after school detention for 5 or 10 minutes in your room , next make a phone call home. Only plan to send a student to the principal/or assistant principal, if you can not reasonably handle the difficulty, but never letting it get out of hand (very rarely a student might need to be escorted from your room by office personnel, or a hall monitor).

,,,,,


You might in some cases be allowed to try again on a probationary basis to pass the test by a certain date while teaching, or reassigned until your pass the test, if the local district needs or wants to keep you.

,


To be eligible for consideration for such teaching you would be required at least the minimum grade average and number of college credit hours, for example: some states require at least being classified as a senior in good standing with a GPA (grade point average) on a 4 point scale ""C+"" (2.5), or ""B-"" (between 2.5 and 3.0) average in college, and possibly require a ""B"" (3.0) average in your teaching field subject such as math or science.;
,


A teaching field may be similar to taking a minor in a subject: some states require 18 or 24 approved college hours including 12 advanced level credit hours to be completed to become ""permanently/or provisionally"" certified.
While your degree may be earned in any valid degree subject, and most degree subjects are potentially teaching fields, yet some may not be taught in the schools, yet you may still be hired for teaching a needed subject, if you possess the minimum qualifications.
Teaching fields become classified as ""needed"" teaching fields as determined by the school district -- depending on their needs and state law.

Understand the role of a mentor.,
Consider an academic mentor.,
Consider sports and recreational mentoring.,
Consider a business mentor.,
Consider a personal mentor.,
Think about different ways to communicate.,
Decide what specific role you'd like your mentor to provide.,
Make a list of possibilities.,
Think about what you'll say.,
Start approaching your potential mentors.,
Make plans to meet.,
Keep a schedule and stick to it.,
Make the relationship mutually beneficial.,
Show your appreciation.,
Keep a strictly professional relationship between you and your mentor.",How to Find a Mentor," A good mentor will help you learn to do things, but not do them for you. A mentor leads by example. For example, an academic mentor may offer efficiency tricks, advice, and examples to show you smart alternatives for success, but not help you copy edit your history essay in the waning moments before it is due. This is the difference between a tutor and a mentor. A good mentor will:


Assess your strengths and weaknesses
Help you understand the structure and organization of the topic
Introduce new perspectives and correct any wrong thinking
Boost your ability to make decisions
Familiarize you with the tricks of the trade
Introduce you to important resources and useful references;
, This type of mentoring usually consists of face-to-face sessions with someone who excels in the subject matter you're studying, has the time to offer you a mentorship, and an interest in your academic achievement. Consider:


Professors, instructors, and other faculty
Older or more experienced students
Siblings or other family members

, Think about mentors who excel at the sport you're interested in developing. While athletic ability is an important part of a sporting mentor, also consider the human side of the relationship when considering an athletic mentor. A good soccer mentor will be a good sport, an intelligent athlete, and an all-around person as well as being a phenomenal soccer player. Consider:


Coaches and assistants
Experienced players on your team or other teams
Professional athletes or retired athletes
Trainers

, Business and other professional mentors are usually successful workers in the field you hope to crack into, who will be able to offer you some tricks of the trade. This could be anything from stock trading to blues guitar. Think about who does what you want to do better than you do it. Consider:


Colleagues and business acquaintances
An old boss, though not a current supervisor
Workers with a great reputation

, Develop a relationship with someone you admire personally, not because of what they do, but who they are and how they do it. Think of people who you'd like to be like, for no particularly reason. A personal mentor might be:


A neighbor
Your favorite bartender or barista
Your personal style icon
Someone you go to church with
Your record store guy or girl
A member of a social club you're a part of

, A mentor might be a neighbor or a classmate you admire, but it might also be someone you've never met. Rainer Maria Rilke's famous book Letters to a Young Poet chronicles the correspondence between the famous poet (Rilke) and a young student writer who sent him some poems and asked for advice. Consider:


Successful people you may have read about and felt some connection to
People with considerable and approachable Internet presence
Anyone who fits any of the criteria for a mentor, but you don't know personally yet

, Write down any problems or specific requirements you might have regarding the field and subject matter. It would be helpful to answer the following questions:


What would you like to learn?
What are you looking for from your mentor?
How will the mentorship ""look""?
How often would you like to meet? Where?

, Create a list of potential mentors according to your personal criteria and desires for the relationship. Order the list, starting with your top choices.


Look for the ""total package."" If you really admire someone's business acumen but can't stand them as a person, they won't make a good mentor.
Aim high. The rich and famous have personal assistants who learn from them and make connections based on that relationship. Why not you? If Donald Trump would be your ideal business mentor, put him at the top of the list. Write his office a letter, try to schedule a meeting, or apply to be on The Apprentice.

Check if your company or school has a formal mentoring program that would line up a mentor for you. If so, see if it fulfills your goals and enroll in the program.

, Going up to a professor after class and asking, ""I've been thinking: Will you be my mentor?"" might scare them off if you don't explain what you mean. It's a big role and a big commitment to ask of someone, if all you're really looking for is, ""Can we meet for coffee and talk about physics sometimes?"" Be specific and explain what you're looking for.


Use ""mentor"" as a verb more than a noun. Saying ""I could use some mentoring in figuring out how to get my sales up next quarter. You seem to really have it together, Bob. You mind getting some drinks about talking about it every now and then?"" is more attractive for your potential mentor than, ""I need you as a mentor. I have to improve my sales. Help.""
Make sure you don't give someone the wrong impression. If the salesperson you really admire is of the opposite sex, this could sound a lot like asking for a date. Keep it at the office or on campus if you're concerned about making it sound that way.

, Work your way down the list until someone agrees to fulfill the relationship as you've outlined it.


If you don't get anyone the first go-around, don't worry. It may have nothing to do with you personally and more to do with the person's schedule or other issues. Start again and consider possible mentors who've got more time on their hands, or who may be more willing to work with you.

, Don't leave the relationship hanging once you've gotten someone to agree. Make concrete plans to get together and hit a bucket of golf balls to improve your swing or go over your calculus homework on a specific day at a specific time.


If the first meeting goes well, plan subsequent meetings. You might consider asking at that point, ""Mind if we make this a regular thing?""

, Even if the mentorship exists largely over email or online, don't start bombarding your mentor with questions for advice at the last minute if it doesn't fit into the pre-outlined relationship you'd established.


If the relationship reaches a natural conclusion, it's ok to end it. If you feel confident that you've improved enough in whatever skill you were hoping to learn from your mentor that you feel confident to go forth without weekly coffee meetings, say so.

, Think about what you might be able to offer your mentor in return. If you're getting loads of free advice about your short stories from a professor, ask if there's any research or tech help they might be able to use around the office. Setting up the new wireless router would be a great way to earn favor.


As you improve in your career, remember who and what got you there. As opportunities arise, don't forget about your mentors that helped you along the way.

, Write to your mentor to keep them updated on your progress and remember to thank them for their specific contributions. This will give the mentor a feeling of being useful, needed, and also skillful at their craft.


Be specific. Just saying, ""Thanks, you're being so helpful!"" isn't as reassuring as, ""I totally nailed that last sale thanks to your opening line tips. Thanks!""
Gratitude could include a small gift as a ""thank you"" token. Small things like a book, a bottle of wine, or the occasional meal may be appropriate.

, Emotional involvement with your mentor will usually not be in the best interest of the mentoring process, especially if it's someone you work with.

Determine which level you’d like to teach.,
Decide which subject you’d like to teach.,
Get an appropriate teaching degree.,
Decide between private and public education.,
Pass a qualifying exam.,
Look for teach abroad programs.",How to Become a Teacher in India1," Primary schools cover the 1st through 8th grades (ages 6-14). Secondary schools teach students in the 9th and 10th grades (ages 14-16), and senior secondary schools teach students in the 11th and 12th grades (ages 16-18).You should opt for the age group that you find most appealing. However, keep in mind that the higher the age level, the more stringent the qualifications since you’ll be teaching more advanced and specialized courses.;
, Early primary school teachers do not need to specialize. If you would prefer to instruct in a specific field, you’ll need a Bachelor’s Degree in a relevant subject.Primary school subjects include reading, writing, arithmetic, social science, science, and English.
Secondary school subjects include Hindi, English, foreign languages, math, science and technology, history, geography, civics, art, physical education, and health. They also offer elective vocational training and music.

, There are three levels of teaching degrees: a Diploma, Bachelor’s, and Master’s in Education. If you would like teach primary school, you will need a minimum of a Diploma (D.Ted.). If you would like to teach secondary school, you’ll need a minimum of a Bachelor’s (B.Ed.). A Master’s (M.Ed.) is usually only required for specialized subjects or promotions.The D.Ted. and B.Ed. programs are generally two years. M.Ed. programs are usually one year.
Keep in mind that each degree program has different qualifications. To enter a D.Ted., you’ll need to have passed the 12th standard (graduated from senior secondary school) with the minimum qualification. You’re required to have a Bachelor’s of Arts or Sciences (B.A. or B.S.) to enroll in a B.Ed. course. Having a B.Ed. is a prerequisite for getting an M.Ed.

, Becoming a teacher at a private school is generally easier because there are many openings and fewer necessary qualifications. Government-run schools are much more closely regulated and require specific eligibility testing and teacher education. However, public schools generally come with better pay and benefits and have more opportunities for career advancement.The types of students are also generally different between public and private schools. Since students must pay to go to private schools, they generally come from more educated households with higher incomes and are therefore better prepared for scholastic achievement.

, Teacher recruitment in India at the primary and secondary levels is tied to state and national eligibility testing. You must pass the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET) to qualify to teach in a government-owned school and some private institutions.The National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) offers preparatory curriculums for the exam and determines the minimum eligibility requirements for each year.

, If you’re a foreign national, there are international organizations that facilitate temporary teaching assignments in Indian schools. Most often, this work is voluntary, minimally paid, or remunerated only in terms of covering travel and living expenses.Many governmental organizations, like the British Council, have teach abroad programs.

Search for faculty positions.",How to Become a Teacher in India2," India’s University Grants Commission sets regulations for higher education, including essential qualifications for university professors. Incoming assistant professors will need at least a Master’s Degree or equivalent in a relevant subject from an accredited Indian or foreign university. Your application will be stronger if you have a Doctoral Degree.Keep in mind that you will not be able to advance through promotion from an assistant to an associate professor without getting a PhD.

, Besides having a degree, you will need to submit transcripts that prove your marks or grades are above average. Indian universities will judge your record according to the evaluation standards set by your degree-granting university., While assistant professor positions usually do not require a minimum number of publications, your application will be stronger if you have a record of original research in your field. Submit articles to peer-reviewed journals and book proposals to academic publishers in order to show that your work has been vetted by fellow scholars.In order to secure promotions, you will need to hit a minimum number of qualifying academic publications (5 for associates, 10 for full professors), so you might as well start early!

, If you only have a Master’s Degree, you will need to pass a qualifying exam in order to teach at an Indian university. You can either take the University Grants Commission’s National Eligibility Test (NET) or one of the UGC’s approved equivalent exams, such as the SLET/SET (the State Eligibility Test for the appropriate region in which the university is located).If you have a qualifying PhD, you are exempt from having to take an eligibility test.

, You can look for job openings through specific university websites or search for comprehensive listings at dedicated academic job sites, like IndianFaculty.com. Each opening will include information about the associated duties, necessary requirements, and application process for the job.

Pick a teaching level.,
Decide if you’re looking for a volunteer or paid gig.,
Determine your eligibility.,
Consider getting a TESOL certification.",How to Become a Teacher in India3," India’s economy is growing, and the demand for English teachers is growing with it. There are ESL positions available to foreign nationals in nonprofits, primary schools, language schools, international schools, and companies. The advantage of finding a position through an established program is that they’ll help arrange visas, housing, travel, and other logistics for you.Be sure to read reviews of programs so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not they’re right for you and so that you don’t have any unpleasant surprises. If no reviews are available online, ask the program for contact information for current or past participants.
If you’d like to stay in India, remember that you can always find another ESL gig while you’re completing your first temporary assignment through a program.

, India’s a big country. You may want to search for programs in a specific city or region based on its culture, geography, and/or climate. At the very least, you should decide whether you’d prefer a rural or urban teaching situation.Nearly 70% of Indians still live in rural villages, where the need for education is greatest.
In general, rural communities have less developed infrastructures for transportation, communication, utilities, and sanitation. Therefore, the overall standards of living are lower.
Literacy rates tend to be lower and poverty rates higher in rural locales.
You should also look into the accommodations offered by each program. Check to see if room and board are included and what sorts of living conditions you can expect.

, Each program will have a different duration, ranging from weeks to a year or more. Figuring out how long you’d like to commit to ESL teaching in India can help you select an appropriate program.


If you have a finite amount of time or are worried about whether or not you’ll like it, go for a short-term program. You can also sign on for another program once you’ve given it a trial run.

, Would you like to teach kids or adults, students or professionals? Think about which age groups and experience levels that you would like to be instructing.


Remember, if you would like to teach at higher levels or in more professional contexts, it’s likely that you’ll need specific credentials first. Be sure to check if your program has any prerequisites in terms of education or certifications.
Also, look into the teaching resources and support offered by each program.

, Most teach abroad programs in India are voluntary. If you’re looking for a short-term, enriching experience, then doing a volunteer teaching program might be right for you. If you’re looking for a longer term assignment that will provide you with a basic income, focus on paid opportunities.Popular volunteer programs include Teaching Volunteer Project India, Global Citizen Year, Semester Abroad, WorldTeach India, and Asian College of Teachers.
If you’d like to find a paid position, you can find current listings at job sites like Craigslist India, Monster India, or Dave ESL Cafe.Because English is an official language in India, most paid ESL positions do not come with large salaries. The average pay is 10,000-15,000 rupees per month plus accommodation. This is enough to live off of comfortably and go on occasional holidays., At a minimum, most ESL teaching positions and programs require a Bachelor’s Degree in any subject from an accredited university and a valid passport. You may also need to get a teaching certification and/or a visa. Be sure that you can fulfill the basic qualifications before you apply.ESL teaching certifications are generally short, post-baccalaureate programs. They are available in most countries and online and qualify you to teach English as a foreign language around the world.

, Not all programs require you to take a qualifying Teaching-English-to-Speakers-of-Other-Languages course and exam. However, doing so will make you a more attractive applicant and qualify you for a wider range of teaching gigs.Most countries have TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages), TESL (Teaching English as a Second Language), and/or TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) programs available. You can take courses online or in-person in as little as four weeks.Many teach abroad programs in India offer TESOL/TEFL courses and certification as part of the program.

Advance through the system.",How to Become a Teaching Assistant," You'll need a high school diploma or equivalent before you can qualify for any job as a teaching assistant, including those at the entry level.During your high school years, you should aim to obtain a well-rounded education in all areas of study since many teaching assistants help students across multiple subjects. Focused courses on English, communication, or computers may provide you with the communication and technological skills you'll need to excel in the field, however.;
, There are no broad federal guidelines determining the minimum amount of post-secondary education required for teaching assistants. These regulations are usually left to state and local governments.


Contact the Board of Education in your state to learn more about state-specific qualifications. For local regulations, contact the educational board within your municipality or county.
Note, however, that teaching assistants working in schools with Title 1 programs must either have two years of college, an associate's degree, or state/local certification. Title 1 is a federal program that assists schools heavily involved with students from low-income families., While it's possible to obtain work as a teaching assistant without any college education, getting your associate’s degree in a related field will open you to greater opportunities.


The exact degree title can vary by school, but typically, it'll be an associate's degree program for teacher associates.You may also run across degrees for specific career fields—for instance, an early childhood associate degree would make you qualified to work in elementary school settings.
Before you can complete an associate's degree, you may need to gain fieldwork experience. This can be highly beneficial. In addition to giving you practical experience, completing fieldwork will also give you the chance to connect with potential employers or network contacts.
Additionally, some colleges offering this degree may even offer job placement assistance upon graduation from the program.

, Before you can work with certain student categories, like special needs students, you may need to pass certain skill-based exams to demonstrate your ability.


This principle may apply to most or all specialties within a given state or municipality. For instance, you may need to pass a comprehensive language exam when seeking to specialize in bilingual education.

, In many states, you can continue pursuing more advanced levels of certification while working. These levels will make you eligible for more varied opportunities.


For example, in New York City, there are four levels of certification for teaching assistants: Level I, Level II, Level III, and Pre-Professional.Advancing through the levels requires the completion of various workshops and college coursework, and you must also have a minimal year of experience as a licensed New York state teaching assistant before advancing beyond Level I certification.While all levels permit you to work with students under the supervision of a licensed teacher, only the Pre-Professional certificate is designed to assist those looking to become licensed teachers.



, If you're still in high school or college, consider working as a student tutor. Some skill sets used by tutors overlap with those used by teaching assistants, so this can be a good job to include on your resume.


Even if you've already graduated both high school and college, you may still be able to find tutoring opportunities at local schools or learning centers. You may also find work as a private tutor if you can demonstrate adequate skill level with the subject you'd be tutoring.
If you have kids of your own, consider volunteering to assist their teachers on a semi-regular basis. You could offer to help during field trips, special classroom activities, or other events to gain related experience.

, Most teaching assistants are employed by private and public schools, but some also find work in preschools, childcare centers, community centers, and religious centers.


It's usually easiest to find work at the elementary school level since students need more focused attention during these formative years, but you can apply for work elsewhere, as well. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2012, approximately 76 percent of teaching assistants worked in elementary or secondary schools. Only 9 percent worked for childcare centers, and the remaining percentages were dispersed across other fields.The BLS also expects employment for teaching assistants to grow roughly 9 percent between 2012 and 2022, due primarily to an increase in student enrollment. This is true for public and private schools alike, as well as childcare service providers., It isn't absolutely necessary for you to join a labor union, but many teaching assistants choose to do so.


Union membership has its pros and cons, but joining a union may make it easier to gain access to various job openings and opportunities for advanced training.
Common labor unions for teaching assistants include the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. Note that these unions are primarily for teachers, but teaching assistants are often eligible to join. You may also wish to join a smaller union specific to teaching assistants that exists at a state or local level.

, Common specialties include special education, bilingual education, and multicultural education. By choosing a specialty, you gain access to job opportunities many other prospective candidates aren't eligible for.


Teaching assistants who work with special education students may work within regular classrooms or separate classes. If you pursue this type of specialty, you should be prepared to adapt learning material to meet your students' needs while also assisting severely disabled students with their basic needs.
If you're fluent in a second language, you might be eligible to become a bilingual or multicultural education assistant. Either specialization will require you to communicate with students who do not speak English fluently or whose parents are unable to do so. Your unique skill set will enable you to assist an instructor who would otherwise be unable to effectively communicate in these circumstances.
For those with higher education in a particular learning field—e.g., English, mathematics, biology, history—you might qualify to work as a teaching assistant in secondary school settings for related course topics.
You can specialize your work based on location. For instance, some teaching assistants may only work with students in shared computer labs, lunchrooms, or playgrounds.

, Understand what skill sets prospective employers likely hope to see. Highlight these skill sets on your resume and during your job interviews.


In particular, teaching assistants need to have excellent communication skills and interpersonal skills. Since most classrooms that utilize teaching assistants contain many students with varied abilities, prospective candidates should also be patient and resourceful.

, It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the kind of work you'll be doing on the job before you choose this career path.


Teaching assistants provide students with additional instruction both inside and outside the classroom. You may need to review material with small groups or individual students after the teacher concludes a period of active instruction.
You'll also need to help the teacher with organizational and disciplinary tasks. You may track attendance, calculate grades, set up classroom equipment, or supervise students during recesses and field trips., According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median pay for teaching assistants in 2012 was $23,640. This amount may vary depending on experience, employer, and other factors.Note that nearly half of all teaching assistants only work part-time, and most do not work during the summer. It is possible, however, for you to find work with a year-round employer or summer school.
Within 2012, the lowest 10 percent earned less than $17,180, but the top 10 percent earned more than $36,680.

, While working as a teaching assistant, you need to remain open to every new on-the-job learning opportunity you run across. Some of these opportunities will be formal, but many more will be informal.


Attend workshops created by the state Department of Education, conferences provided by professional teaching unions, and other formal learning opportunities.
Interact with other professionals on the job to learn new skills. This can be especially helpful when you interact with experienced professionals or those coming from different backgrounds. Similarly, your students can teach you a lot, as well, since you can learn directly from them about which methods of instruction and/or discipline are more helpful than others.

, As you gain experience, you will likely become qualified to work a greater variety of teaching assistant jobs or under better conditions.


Many teaching assistants actually start as substitute instructors for larger school systems. As they prove themselves through these temporary positions and network with other teaching professionals, they improve their odds of securing a full-time position within the same or nearby districts once one arises.Furthermore, many teaching assistants also progress into full-time careers as qualified teachers. Additional education and certification will be required, but your professional experience as a teaching assistant should help you secure work more readily within the field.

Make employees feel like they are contributing to the mission of the company.",How to Empower Employees," To empower your employees, you have to be a role model. If they don’t respect you or think you’re hypocritical or lazy, it’ll be hard for them to feel empowered by you. Here’s how to be a good role model for your employees:


Be accountable for what you say and do and expect the same from your employees.
Listen to what your employees say.
Show sincerity when dealing with employees.
Be a good example of discipline.
Avoid taking credit for team accomplishments.
Communicate regularly and effectively.
Focus on positive, winning attitudes.
Keep asking ""What are the key traits of highly effective leaders?"" Make a list, build and develop those skills.;
, Make sure there are no gray areas when assigning specific duties to specific employees. That way, employees will know exactly what is expected and there will be no room for passing the buck. Also, entrusting employees to responsibly complete a task improves their confidence and pride in their work.


If you tend to be a micromanager, you want to empower your employees by trusting them enough to let them work on their own.
Give employees more responsibilities so they will feel motivated to succeed. If they feel like they’ve been working at the same company for a long time without being given additional tasks or duties to perform, they will feel like they are not progressing.
When delegating tasks, make sure each employee knows exactly what is expected of him to avoid any future miscommunication.

, When you feel more certain that your employees are skilled and dedicated enough to take responsibility for their own tasks, allow them more freedom in defining the methods by which they will accomplish those tasks. This makes their work feel more exciting and rewarding since they’ll feel like they have more of a say in the work they do.


For example, if your ace marketing exec insists that telecommuting part-time would aid creativity and productivity, provide for that flexibility.
You can set routine meetings with your employees and check in with them about their progress without making them feel stifled.

, Though you should avoid being that “cool boss” who is too friendly with all of his employees, it doesn’t hurt to smile at your employees, make small talk to show you care about them on an individual basis. Don’t be that boss who is too busy to say hi to his employees, and who storms by looking busy and frazzled all the time; take the time to make your employees feel cared for, no matter how busy you are.


If you want to empower your employees, you have to make them feel like you actually know each of them a bit. They’ll have a hard time wanting to do a good job if they feel like you don’t know who they are.
Get to know a little bit about each employee, such as the names and ages of their kids, their favorite things to do outside of work, or where they’re from. Asking about these small details will make them feel like you care.
If you are too busy to say hello to your employees, get to your office 15 minutes early every day. This will give you time to feel less frazzled when you walk into the office each morning, and to make more time for your employees.

, To motivate employees, you have to respect them as human beings and employees. Give instructions in a respectful manner, don’t be rude and take the time to acknowledge their questions or concerns before embarking on a new project. Also, be respectful of their time and don’t ask them to stay late last minute every evening or act like they don’t have a life outside of work.f


Don’t make employees feel unworthy of your time. If they want to meet you, don’t say, “I have 7 minutes to meet!” or, “I am swamped with meetings this week.” Sure, you’re the boss, and they know you’re busy, but you don’t want to make them feel like they are wasting your time every time they want to meet.

, To be a good leader, motivate your employees with a positive attitude and environment. If you always look stressed out or are obviously in a bad mood or if it just always feels like doom and gloom in your office, then employees won’t feel empowered to do their best. You should smile, talk about positive developments at your company, give lots of reinforcement, and make your company a great place to work.


Of course, if things are going poorly for your company, then it may be difficult to have a smile on your face. Be honest with employees about the struggles your company is facing while focusing on the positive developments in your workplace.
Make sure employees hear laughter. Seriously, don’t be the boss who is so serious and stressed out that his employees haven’t heard him crack a joke or laugh. Another way to empower your employees is to make sure they know exactly what it takes to succeed. You don’t want them to feel like they are getting mixed signals or that things at your company are changing so fast that they have no idea what it actually takes to do a good job. Your expectations should be crystal clear if you want employees to feel empowered and motivated to do their best.






Sometimes expectations do change. If this is the case, make sure you let your employees know about the changes and explain your reasoning so they don’t feel like they are in the dark about company policy.

, Make it a point to cite successes at board meetings and to verbally congratulate employees on a job well done. It is a great way to create an office atmosphere focused on success and to empower employees to keep up the good work. When you feel that it is earned, acknowledge hard work with bonuses or other types of rewards so your employees feel that you really see that they are making a difference.


Sometimes, your employees will make a big effort without getting the results they hoped for. Even if they don’t succeed, you should acknowledge them for trying and giving it their all.
Know that monetary rewards help empower employees, but that money can’t be the only thing that gets them going.

, An important part of empowering employees is letting them know their opinions are valuable. Adopting an open door policy lets employees know you care about what they say and enables them to give their input and play an active role in the well-being of the business. Employees who feel involved are empowered employees.


When employees talk to you, make sure you give them your full attention. Don’t listen to their complaints while checking your phone or munching lunch; even if you can only give them a few minutes of your time, make sure they have your full attention.

, Though criticism is helpful if given correctly, you should focus on all of the good things that your employees are doing instead of nitpicking them and making them feel like “no news is good news.” Compliment them and let them know they’ve done a good job and do so as often as you can.


This policy can help establish a positive environment, instead of making employees feel like they’ll only hear from you if they’ve made a mistake.

, You can’t succeed in your job if you never criticize your employees, but when you explain something they’ve done incorrectly, make sure you do so in a respectful manner. Instead of making it sound like they have completely messed up, yelling, or threatening to fire them, have a civil conversation. Discuss how they can improve.


Employees don’t work well when they feel discouraged or like they can’t succeed, no matter what they do. Giving them a goal to reach and making them feel like they are capable of success is a much better strategy than making them feel like they are constantly failing.
When criticizing, make sure you are also pointing out things the employee is doing well. For example, say something like, “You’re such a hard worker and I know how much you want to succeed. However, if you let others take on more responsibility during team work, I think the results would be more balanced, and you would feel less pressure to do everything yourself.”

, To empower employees, know what makes them tick. They won’t all be motivated by the same thing, so if you want them to succeed, you have to know their strengths and weaknesses to make the most of their abilities. Pay attention to their skills and what they say in meetings and find a way to help each employee reach his or her fullest potential.


For example, if one of your employees loves working with others, make sure he or she has plenty of opportunities for teamwork.
If one of your employees has an analytical mind, ask him to help you analyze the latest company report. Make the most of each employee’s strengths.

, To empower employees, you have to make them feel like what they do for the company really does matter and impacts its success. Whether you give them statistics, charts, data, or testimonials, make an effort to make them see the bigger picture.


Keep employees up-to-date on company developments. If you’re hiring more employees, starting a new branch of the company, working on a new project, or making other big changes, let employees know as much as they can about what’s going on. You don’t want them to feel they’re the last to hear about big changes because this will make them feel like they don’t really have a stake in the company.

, To empower employees, you can’t make them feel like there’s no room for them to move forward. If they feel like they will just do the same old job year after year without any additional responsibilities, opportunities, or promotions, then it’ll be hard for them to feel truly empowered. Make sure they have a clear path to success and that they feel recognized as they get better and better at their jobs.


Additional bonuses or raises can really help your employees feel like their job has a future. If they’ve been working the same job for over two years without a single raise, for example, then they can start to feel like they’ve reached a dead end.
Talk to your employees about where they want to be in the future. Help them get there. They should feel that there are opportunities to grow, to learn skills and to take on more responsibilities the longer they stay at the job.

, Provide a means for employees to get whatever training is necessary to their optimal performance so that they can truly master their job responsibilities. Also, show that you are invested in their professional success by arranging for them to attend career development seminars and courses. Not only does this provide for employee empowerment, but it is also a great way to gain employee loyalty and improve employee performance.


Helping your employees gain knowledge and skills not only makes them better at their jobs, but it will excite them about their work.

, You can go a long way in empowering employees by asking them how you could best aid their empowerment. Put out a suggestions box and ask for opinions at meetings and one to one. Consider well-intentioned suggestions and let your employees see that they really do have a role in the overall success of the business. Then acknowledge their ideas have been looked at and or implemented.


The worst thing you can do is to ask for feedback, receive a lot of negative feedback, point it out, and then do absolutely nothing about it. If you ask for feedback, then make sure you’re willing to take steps to address it. If certain complaints simply cannot be addressed, make sure you explain why instead of just ignoring it. Transparency is important during this process.
If you make a habit of asking for feedback and receive a lot of negative feedback, then you shouldn’t just stop asking for it. This shows that you really don’t care what the employees think or want.

, Then stand “shoulder to shoulder” with them assisting them with the task; this helps to build your respect as a leader. At times, you might need to “take the lead” and take over the task for a while as you coach them along the way. This will also make them see that they have a competent boss. You don’t want them to feel like you’re asking them to do work that you have no idea how to do yourself.

, Another way to empower your employees is to make your workplace a fun and friendly place to work. You don’t want them to feel like they’re entering a prison cell every time they walk into the office. Even the little things you do to make the environment more friendly can make a big difference. Here are some things you can do:


Have fresh flowers around the office; they can spruce up any workplace.
Have some holiday decorations up around Halloween, Thanksgiving, or other holiday seasons, so the work environment feels more festive.
Have some fresh pastries, candy, fruit, or other treats in the office kitchen for your employees to enjoy from time to time. You don’t have to spend a lot of money to make the office feel more like home.
Have warm, friendly lighting in the office. Fluorescent lights can be too bright and oppressive. However, a dimly lit room with poor lighting and covered windows can make the office feel like a cave.

, If you want your employees to feel empowered, then you have to make them care about work outside the workplace. While you don’t have to put pressure on them to go to every single event after work, you should present a variety of options for the employees so they can have a variety of ways to feel more included in the workplace; you can have weekly happy hours, volunteering sessions, work bocce, softball, or soccer leagues, or other team building activities that help empower your employees.


If your employees spend more time outside the office with one another, then they’ll build deeper bonds with each other and will care about their work more.
Make sure you also have at least a holiday party every year; this will help your employees feel like they work for a welcoming, warm place.

, Another way to make your employees feel empowered is to make them feel like they are really contributing to the mission of the company and making the world a better place. Whether the mission of the company is to encourage people to learn to read on their own or to improve the environment, you should make each and every employee feel like their hard work is contributing to that mission.


Sometimes, it can be hard for employees to feel like they are really impacting the world or helping further the company’s mission when all they do is sit in front of a computer. It’s your job to remind them that their work does have a big impact outside of the office.

Do ice breaker activities.,
Use team building exercises.,
Encourage good communication in the group.,
Allow time for group members to mingle and chat.",How to Effectively Lead Groups1," One way you can be a good group leader is to break the ice with activities when the group first gets together. Do ice breaker activities with the group so everyone can introduce themselves. Make sure all the group members get a chance to speak to one another on the first day so they feel less like strangers.For example, as an ice breaker, you may do a simple go around in the group where everyone says their name and a personal detail about themselves.
If the group is made up of students, you may have them state their majors and the most interesting thing they did during the school break. If the group is made up of professionals, you may have them state their profession and their favorite hobby outside of work.;
, Team building exercises are great for helping people get used to working together and to create trust in the group. Try to schedule team building exercises during the first few group meetings. Use them throughout the group’s time together, especially if you notice issues cropping up in the group.For example, you may use a team building exercise like having everyone sit and make eye contact with one another to build comfort and trust.
You can find a list of team building exercises on huddle.com.

, The key to trust and goodwill in a group is good communication. As a leader, you should encourage everyone in the group to be honest and open with one another. Let everyone know that the group is a place of trust and communication. Make it clear that you value honesty as a leader and expect everyone to communicate well with each other.For example, you may say to the group, “I value good communication as a leader and I hope everyone in the group will communicate effectively with one another.”

, To keep the vibe in the group relaxed and open, make sure you allow time for group members to socialize. Set aside time before the official group meetings for group members to chat, have some refreshments, and hang out. Allow for time after the group meetings for members to spend time with one another. This can foster a more welcoming and trusting environment in the group.As the leader of the group, you may plan social outings for the group where everyone can relax and spend time together in a less formal environment. This can help members to socialize and build trust by seeing each other as people as well as peers.

Arrange the room to make discussion easier.,
Set ground rules for the discussion.,
Ask open ended questions.,
Encourage group members who do not speak often.",How to Effectively Lead Groups2," Before the group arrives in the meeting spot, arrange the chairs and tables so discussion is easier in the group. Put the chairs in a circle or around one table, with just enough chairs for everyone in the group. This will encourage eye contact and make talking in the group easier.You can also put any materials for the group meeting on the table or by the door within reach. This way, the material is available for the group and the meeting can begin smoothly.

, To ensure the group discussion goes smoothly, establish ground rules at the outset. Make it clear that the group discussion is a place where everyone has the space to speak. Note that interrupting someone or talking over someone is not okay in group discussions. Encourage everyone in the group to respond in kind to one another, with respect.


You may create ground rules for the discussion and print them out as a hand out for the group members at the first group meeting. Or you may state them at the first meeting so everyone is aware of the rules for discussion.

, To facilitate discussion in a group, it is always best to ask open ended questions. Pose questions to the group that are thoughtful and open. Prompt the group with questions that can have more than a yes or no answer. Keep the questions short and clear so they are easy to understand.For example, rather than ask someone, “Is that how you felt about the presentation?” you may ask, “How did you feel about the presentation?”

, As the facilitator, it is your job to pay attention to who talks a lot in the group and who talks occasionally or not at all. Encourage group members who do not talk often to speak up when they want to. Make sure there is space in the discussion for them.For example, you may try asking someone who does not talk often a prompting question to encourage them to contribute to the discussion. Or you may say, “Let’s hear from individuals who have not spoken yet. Thoughts?” to encourage others to speak.

Encourage active listening in the group.,
Work with group members if there are issues.,
Speak to group members privately, if needed.",How to Effectively Lead Groups3," If you notice there is tension in the group, try to get all group members to do active listening. This may be useful if you notice conflict between two members in the group. Active listening will ensure that everyone listens to each other and responds thoughtfully to each other.As the leader of the group, model active listening for the group members. Start a discussion with a group member and listen intently to what they have to say. Make eye contact and maintain a relaxed body posture, with your body positioned towards them. Nod and smile to show you are listening.
Once the person is finished talking, rephrase their thoughts back to them and confirm you heard them correctly. You may say, “What I am hearing you say is…” or “I believe what you are saying is…”. Once they confirm you heard them correctly, you can respond to them.

, If you notice issues between group members, be direct and work with the group to resolve the issue. State that you are concerned about a conflict in the group. Use “I” statements. Ask open ended questions to get the group members to discuss the issue.For example, you may say, “I am feeling like there is tension between group members. How do you all feel about this?” or “I am feeling tension in the group. Can we talk about the issue as a group?”

, Sometimes issues in a group are best resolved privately, especially if it is between two individuals in a large group. If you notice conflict, pull the individuals aside. Ask them if you can all speak privately about the issue. Set up a meeting with you and the individuals to discuss the issue in a private setting.


Doing this can put the individuals at ease and make it easier for them to talk one on one, rather than in the big group.

Prepare agendas and to-do lists.,
Delegate tasks to specific group members.,
Support group members when they need it.,
Reward the group when tasks are completed.",How to Effectively Lead Groups4," As the leader of the group, you will be need to manage tasks and goals in the group. Prepare agendas for each group meeting so the discussion stays on track. Make to-do lists for any tasks or goals that need to be achieved by the group. Hand out the to-do list to the group or write it down on a whiteboard so everyone can see it during group meetings.If the group tends to meet online, email out to-do lists to the group.
Once a task or goal is achieved, cross it off the list so everyone in the group can feel accomplished.

, Do not be afraid to delegate tasks to specific group members, especially if the task is large or demanding. Divide a large task among several people in the group. Check that each person knows their role and their responsibilities as a group member. Write down each task and who is responsible for it so everyone is aware in the group.For example, if the group is trying to raise money for a charity event, you may delegate the task of advertising the event among one to two people in the group and delegate the task of getting supplies for the event among two other people in the group.

, As a leader, it is important that you support any group members who look like they need help. Do not micromanage everyone in the group. Rather, pay attention to how group members are working together. Take notice if one person seems to be struggling or needs assistance. Offer them help and encourage other group members to support the person.For example, you may notice a group member falling behind on their work for the group. Pull them aside. Let them know you there for any help or support they may need. Arrange for them to work with another group member so they can complete their work.

, Make sure you acknowledge the hard work of the group by rewarding them. Recognize the group’s accomplishments by using verbal praise as well as by doing kind actions. Doing this will show the group that you support them as a leader and want them to succeed.For example, you may tell the group, “You all did a great job on the charity event. Thank you for all your help. I couldn’t have done it without you.”
You may also treat the group to dinner or drinks as a way of showing your appreciation for their hard work.

Explore the foundations of mindfulness.,
Start by finding the present moment.,
Be present as often as possible.",How to Develop Mindful Leadership1," Mindfulness in essence is not just being aware, but more importantly being engaged and dynamic with yourself and your surroundings. This allows you to be more creative, realistic and pragmatic with every situation. In a business context, or any leadership role, the art of being more aware as well as more creative significantly enhances opportunities, addresses potential challenges and creates a more fulfilling personal life.;
, A simple method is to close your office door, sit in a comfortable chair and close your eyes. Be aware of your breath, your sensations in the chair, or just background noises. Mindfulness should ultimately be effortless, but at the beginning, many of the subtle aspects may not be apparent to you, but will with time become more and more evident exposing things that you may not have been aware of.


The purpose of this exercise is simply to draw you into the present moment. This means that you aren't being tied down to the past experiences, future deadlines or other distractions that get in the way of being able to process information to make an informed decision. Ultimately everything is in the present moment, even though the past, present and future condition the way people think and act. Critically, this method is not just a relaxation method in which you can refresh your mind, but it allows things to settle which often allows a creative solution to become evident.

, Mindful leadership is not just awareness, but being able to see and listen to what is happening all around you. Interestingly, mindfulness is also critically linked with memory, so it enhances dynamic memory, but also allows memory to be more versatile.


One of the major challenges in a busy environment is being aware of what's going on - often there is simply too much happening at once. Mindfulness allows you to accept your situation, delegate and prioritise your workload as well as the people and projects around you so it prevents a blockage in the flow, and allows solutions to be implemented in the most efficient and effective way.

"
"
Consider the dynamics in your environment.,
Be daily aware of your own emotions and personal health.,
Be aware of your thoughts, intentions and plans.,
Find your inner ""cool"".,
Start to develop a deductive and productive frame of mind.",How to Develop Mindful Leadership2," Specifically this is the quality of your interactions with coworkers, various levels of management, the customer and supplier dynamic in the market and your own relationship with your own role.


The principle purpose of this exposes all the underlying relationships that you may or may not be aware of, and because of the fascinating relationship mindfulness shares with memory, the relationships that have simply faded away from our awareness. Reflecting on these often expose potential benefits as well as conflicts that should be explored. Often leaders can be rather laissez faire, or depending too much on simple improvisation - these in themselves can be exceptionally useful in various contexts, but not all. Mindfulness can allow you to pick and choose a more relevant management style that suits the situation.

, By recognising your state of mind in the moment is of enormous potential benefit. The reasons for this is if you are tired and overworked, or controlled by desire or anger to win or control, then you are sewing failure or - at best - a compromised result into any project you undertake.


A major one to keep an eye out is the inner ""control freak"" or ""too busy"" mind-state both in yourself and in others, as well as the state of mind that consistently looks for the faults in things. These are in themselves amazingly effective obstacles to creativity and narrowing the depth you can see into things. By letting go and stepping back to allow others to progress, or by developing means of cooperation can create a more harmonious, effective and value based solution to most parts of life.
Likewise, reflect on your own energy. None can be 100% perfect all of the time so occasionally your own wellbeing and energy levels will be affected. This allows you to recognise and act to unwind and relax, which also can inspire your colleagues to look after their own personal wellbeing and development.

, Often people tend to ignore the thought process unless it says what they want to hear and this reveals a critical divorce from the present moment - as we simply don't want to engage the situation fully, so we cannot create a holistic or complete solution. Additionally, this is robbing you of much in the way of developing new skills and can dramatically pull down your motivation and well being. By changing our perception subtly, or taking a fresh look after a break, this gives new energy to resolve old problems.


Ideas can often be practical, but very often, can be misguided and unhelpful if you aren't fully aware of the context. By being aware of them, you can dissect the thoughts and abandon those that are impractical or unbeneficial, but at the same time developing the practical and beneficial ones, thus training the mind to incline towards being more confident, calm, creative and practical. It is amazing to discover for yourself exactly when you are being led around by your internal deeper intentions that may be against your personal direct goals.
Gut feeling can often be something that is misused. Gut instinct to an experienced person is often surprisingly accurate in negotiations when determining when the person at the other end of the table is being honest. But often stronger desires can certainly shape the perception into being inaccurate. The desire to sign a deal can set you up for a very compromised result.

, This helps you be more calm generally in crisis management, but also helps you see beyond the ""poker face"" of many negotiators and their goals. There is a subtle difference between cool and aloof, so it is useful to distinguish the two.


In relationship to this method, stepping back for a little quiet time, observing more closely, or by varying team leaders if necessary so that a stale environment can be revived, will often allow many issues to resolve themselves.

, By practicing awareness, it becomes clear when you are falling away into fantasy plans and dream goals, or stewing away making plans to beat a rival, climb the corporate ladder or control others around you.


Being able to distinguish between useful ideas and unskillful ideas both in yourself and from others is a very valuable skill.

Be aware or corporate systems from the ground up.,
Expand your range.,
Reflect often on your own and others actions.,
Consider how the environment affects you and others.,
Practice mindfulness as often as possible.",How to Develop Mindful Leadership3," So far this tutorial has mostly explored the personal relationships, but just as important is the very structure of the organisation. Being aware of them as they are well expose just how smooth they are. Many systems and methods may be out of date, not followed or sabotaged within an organisation, where many not only work very well but are an opportunity to expand, as well as recognising and rewarding the people who run them.

, Look outside your own office to explore other companies with their own teams and methods, this can help you explore ways to develop your own company's strengths.

, This practice has nothing to do with being judgmental, but has a lot to do with being able to understand the intentions people have that guide their actions. By understanding and recognising them as they happen gives a wide scope for problem solving and creating beneficial results.

, In many cases, renovating the workspace is money well spent when it makes it safer, easier to navigate and more inspiring an environment to work in.

, To begin with, you may find it's easy to lose track of time and your awareness falls and that's fine, however that in itself is key to the benefits mindfulness can offer - when people lose track of what's going on, they can too easily make flawed decisions when they simply aren't aware.


This can expose large weaknesses in your own leadership skills and the structure within the world you operate, but also exposes all the areas that you an develop yourself and to train others.

Understand the organizational culture.,
Be transparent.,
Ensure accountability of mentors and reward through remuneration.,
Develop mentoring teams.,
Form a Board of Advisory.,
Ensure confidentiality.",How to Develop a Mentoring Culture in an Organisation," Senior executives need to know about the organization's mission and goals. This understanding has to be clear because mentoring will be more effective when the mentor is well-versed with the direction of the organization. Mentoring can be viewed as guiding an employee within the boundaries of the organizational culture.;
, The CEO has to start the ball-rolling by declaring who is part of his internal circle and if he is also getting advice from a mentor who has no vested interest in the organization. This is a signal to the rest of the organization that their leader is open-minded and has a sense of flexibility that can weather any business dynamics. No employee likes to be in an organization that may go under because of the authoritarian leadership of the top management.

, Business mentoring accountability and remuneration is an area of discussion that has yet to be fully developed in current business literature. This must change because ineffective mentors can chart the organization into rough waters rather than out! This is hardly surprising if mentoring is done in an ad hoc manner because the choice of mentor is not structured and at the same time, the mentor is not motivated to give his best advice.

, Every worker should be a member of a mentoring team. In the case of middle management, they should also help be mentors as well as be mentored, especially when the mentoring system has just been set in place.

, Many organizations create a board of advisory that consists of various industry experts who also play the role of mentors. This is a good starting point but the organization must also ensure that there is no ""kingdom-building"" and regularly change the board of advisory to suit the dynamic economic environment.

, The mentor-protégé relationship is not only based on trust and respect; there must be confidentiality. This has to be taken in the light of current wave of social networking sites (Facebook, Myspace) and blogs (LiveJournal, Blogger) where organizational secrets can be easily shared with a large online community.

Organize a community service project in your community.",How to Develop Leadership Qualities," Think of any and all leaders you admire. They can be current leaders or those of the past. Do an internet search to learn everything you can about their leadership style.


See if you can find interviews with the leader, which address the topic of their leadership style. For example, if there's a particular president you feel is or was a strong leader, simply do a search for, ""President Obama interview about leadership style.""
Write down some of the characteristics, which make them a strong leader. The author of the article may have also outlined specific characteristics, so use this for inspiration when thinking of the leadership traits you'd like to develop. ;
, These days, it’s easier than ever to find inspiration on how to be a good leader. Doing a few, simple Google searches on “leadership videos,” will yield amazing results.


Find speeches given by the leaders you admire. Listen to, not only their words but how they delivered the speech, as communication is one of the most important qualities of a good leader.
For past leaders, try doing a search for a written copy of their speeches. You may not be able to see how they delivered it, but you can glean a great deal from their words. Were they trying to inspire others? Were their words hopeful?
Try to find a montage of great leader’s speeches. Observe how they hold themselves, where they place their hands and how they deliver their message.
TED Talks are a good place to find inspiration as well. One great aspect of TED Talks is that they’re often fairly short, but provide a lot of excellent information in a creative way., An important step in developing leadership qualities is first determining the qualities you already possess. It’s important to analyze both your strengths and weaknesses, so you know what to work on.


There are free, online tests available for you to take.Many tests will focus on qualities such as your character and likeability as well as your ability to make decisions.Look at the areas where you scored low and use that as a plan for developing your leadership qualities. For example, if you scored low on decision-making skills, practice making decisions quickly and thoughtfully. If your likeability score was low, seek to engage others by smiling more and paying attention when they speak.
Don’t view low scores as an obstacle, but rather a learning experience. After you’ve worked on each of the low scoring areas, go back and take the test again. See if your score has improved.
If you’re unsure how to improve in a certain area, either ask friends and family for help or do searches online.

, In order to develop leadership qualities, it is often helpful to start by emulating qualities of great leaders, such as being a good role model. People look up to leaders, which is why being a good role model is so important.


A good rule of thumb is to act the same whether others are watching you or not.Ask yourself if you’re still the same, respectful, kind and honest person in private, that you are when others are around.
Watch what you say and how you say it, as a leader’s words have a great impact on those around them.
Part of being a good role model is the act of inspiring others. Through your words and actions, you are either an inspiration or a discouragement. Keep that in mind as you go about your day.

, Although not every great leader is likable, most people tend to relate to and follow a leader who is. While you may not think of yourself as likable, you can actually learn to be through the way you converse with others and how you carry yourself.Being respectful and polite during conversations is one way to improve likeability.
Your body language also contributes to likability. Remember to smile and make eye contact. Others will instantly warm to you if you greet them with both a smile and look into their eyes when they are speaking.

, Something that goes hand in hand with likeability, is listening when others talk. Some of the best leaders recognize that they can gain even more knowledge by listening to those around them.Feel free to ask a lot of questions, but genuinely listen to the person’s response. Acknowledge that you’re listening by smiling encouragingly and asking follow-up questions.
Refrain from using technology during a conversation. If you’re on your phone during a conversation, it’s easy to tell you’re not paying attention.
Remember that if you’re doing all of the talking, you’ve missed out on the opportunity to really listen and understand where others are coming from.

, One of the best ways to feel like a leader and to be viewed as one, is through your appearance. Whether you like it or not, people will immediately judge you based on your outward appearance before getting to know you and what you stand for.


Start dressing like a leader by making sure you have good grooming habits. Keep your hair combed, make sure facial hair, for men, is trimmed or shaved and that your fingernails are well maintained.
Try wearing a suit and tie to work every day, instead of your typical dress pants and shirt. Suits are often associated with a position of power, so you will both look and feel like a leader when wearing a suit.Women shouldn’t feel the need to dress in something that is overly masculine. Aim for polished and tailored as opposed to baggy and sloppy. Keep accessories to a minimum.

, Your attire in one way in which you can exude confidence, but confidence extends well beyond the way you look. In fact, many feel that confidence is the foundation upon, which leadership is built.Confidence is a part of nearly everything that a leader does. Whether it’s confidence in making decisions or in public speaking; confidence is at the core of every leader.
Even if you’re not an overly confident person, practice acting confident by smiling and asking lots of questions.
Refrain from using filler words like, “umm…” and “like.” This will help you to speak more confidently.
If you’re still struggling with exuding confidence, try learning more about How to Be Confident.

, Remember, as a leader others are looking to you to set the tone. Being enthusiastic and positive not only creates a better environment for those around you, but makes people more willing to trust you.


People are attracted to positivity and enthusiasm and they will be more willing to follow you if you exhibit both.
Even on off days, try to put a positive spin on things. For example, instead of saying “we weren’t profitable last month,” try saying, “It may not have been our best month, but let’s continue to work hard together to turn things around.” The way you deliver bad news can make a huge difference, if it’s done positively.

, Making decisions quickly and decisively doesn't mean you should be rash when acting on something. In fact, there are times when leaders do need more information before making a decision. This simply means that great leaders don't overthink or procrastinate when a big decision needs to be made.When making decisions, try to be as unemotional as possible. Look at the problem rationally and proceed from there.
Limiting your options may help in the decision making process. For example, if you're responsible for choosing a vendor for the company lunch, simply find three good options and make your decision from there.
Trust your gut. Great leaders rely on their instinct to make wise decisions. Once you have the relevant and necessary information, go with your gut!

, A great way to further develop your leadership skills, is to take on more advanced roles at work. Whether you're a part-time or full-time employee, there are always ways in which you can take on more responsibility.


Speak with your manager about opportunities for taking on more of a leadership role. You may be able to be involved with training others or planning events within the organization.
In the corporate world there are often set tracks to becoming a manager. Be honest with your supervisor and let them know your intentions. Ask them for advice and the steps you need to take in order to move up to a more senior position.

, Outside of work, there are many opportunities to lead through the organizations you're involved in.


Perhaps you're involved in a Home Owners Association. Volunteer to be president or, if it's election based, run for president and get others to vote for you.
Schools are often looking for PTA presidents, so even if you're not involved in an organization, inquire at your child's school to see if you can be on the board.
Being the president of an organization will help to improve upon your communication likability and listening skills.

, Even if there isn't a specific organization dedicated to community service projects, find a cause that you're passionate about and rally others to support you.


It could be something as simple as creating a trash day where you recruit neighbors to help you pick up trash in the neighborhood. Lead the efforts by recruiting volunteers, organizing who should purchase what and designating specific cleaning areas. This will help you to improve upon decision making skills and leading with confidence.

Rather direct their focus to how their work directly impacts the bottom line of the company and how they can work to achieve their goals and fulfill obligations.;
, Don’t be transparent be candid about the state of the company, even if the news is grim. Employees have a right to know and should be kept abreast of circumstances that directly affect them. However, instead of fixating on the fact that business isn’t so great, direct focus on the integrity of the company and how company procedures and processes can be improved and made more efficient during lean times.

, Promote job responsibility and encourage employees to be vocal regarding how their job description can evolve. Let them be a part of setting job goals and implementing ways in which procedures can be enhanced.

, Support social clubs, intramural sports teams, car pooling, and other activities employees can participate in order to strengthen relationships and encourage them to support and trust one another.

, If the company seems to be headed in the direction of layoffs, discuss with various departments and employees ways they could be avoided. Given the opportunity, employees can be quite ingenious if it means everyone can keep their job.

, Utilize survey software so employees can anonymously fill out surveys regarding their work and company. Aside from monetary gains, ask them what would make their job better or what the dislike the most about the office. Anonymity will allow them to be completely frank and the fact that you are seeking out their feedback to improve the company can boost their spirits.

, Be a good listener when it comes to the complaints, questions, and concerns of employees. No one wants to work for someone they feel like doesn’t understand them or worse, doesn’t care.

, Often the first thing a company will cut in order to cut costs is the Christmas party. Doing so sends a dismal and bleak message to employees in terms of where the company’s headed. There are ways to save money without canceling; for example, hold the party at your home or a recreational center, serve subs, or have a potluck, in which employees bring their favorite dishes.

, Though you may not be able to give employees the raises and bonuses they deserve, give them extra time off without deducting their vacation or personal time-off. Throw in a few extra vacation days or allow them to take off early after a stressful situation. It’s not directly cash out of your pocket and it’s bound to significantly boost staff morale.

, Consider establishing free lunch once a week for the entire team. It can be as simple (and cheap) as pizza and soda and can really enhance the importance of teamwork. You can even do training for those who come, so the company can directly benefit as well.

, Do you want to live in a certain way? Achieve something in particular? Become a certain kind of person? Make a list of the things you want to achieve, both as a person and in your life.

, As you start to consider how you can choose a role model, try to develop faith in yourself as a person. The goal of choosing a role model is to motivate you to become a better person. You must have confidence in yourself and your abilities to become whoever you wish to be.

, If you want to be an inspirational person, think about the people who inspire you. Do a little brainstorming. Why do you admire them so much? What is the message they send through their actions?


Great role models may exist all around you. These people may have a more profound impact on you and might even be able to mentor you, making them great potential choices as your role model.

, A good role model would be someone who knows who they are. You don't want someone who seems perfect but doesn't have a sense of purpose. You want someone who won't pretend to be someone they are not.

, Your role model should be someone who thinks it is all right to be unique, even if that means accepting some ridicule. They should always make you feel positive and good about being yourself.


The purpose of having a role model is to encourage and inspire you to improve yourself. If your choice of role model does not make you feel this way then it is best to choose another.

, This person should be kind and can communicate well with people. People are easy to understand and emulate when they communicate well.

, It is better to choose a role model who exhibits reliable competence and who has gained their position through dedication and hard work. Often the flashy people who have succeeded spectacularly are those who took big risks and got lucky, rather than those who are the most skilled. It is better to choose a role model who works hard and consistently for their success.Choosing a top performing role model can actually discourage and demotivate you because it is hard to emulate their spectacular performance unless you also get lucky., We are all tempted to choose a certain role model because we see something of ourselves in them. These role models will only hold you back because you are not really changing any characteristics of yourself, you are simply perfecting characteristics that are already there. Choose a role model because you see something in them that you are ‘’not’’ but definitely need to be.


Emulating a role model who is not like you will not feel comfortable or natural but it will stretch you and motivate you to levels of yourself you thought you never knew.
Choose a role model you would not normally consider emulating.
For example if you are bold and spontaneous choose someone who is steady and known for thorough analysis., It is important to learn about both the successes and failures of your role model. Sometimes learning about the failures of your role model can actually encourage and motivate you more than learning about their successes. By learning about their failures you realize that they, like you, are only human and will make mistakes. The important thing is to learn from them and keep working to improve yourself.


For example, even famous scientists such as Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein struggled and failed many times in their lives but they kept working hard to achieve and eventually they were successful. By learning about their struggles you can motivate yourself to keep working hard even when nothing seems to be working., A role model should be someone that you admire in all aspects of their life and leads a healthy lifestyle.


Look for qualities such as passion and the ability to inspire, a clear set of values, a commitment to community, selflessness and acceptance of others and the ability to overcome obstacles.

, Everyone makes mistakes, including those you have chosen as your role models. Your role models are simply there as a guide for you and not someone to imitate exactly. Do not follow them blindly.

, While it is good to emulate a role model, it is also important to retain your individuality. Do not lose yourself in the attempt to follow the example of your role model. Adopt the characteristics you would like most to improve about yourself while keeping the rest of you as you are.


Be yourself and feel confident in what you do. Don't copy what others are doing, stand out. If people copy it just proves that they're insecure and not original unlike you!

Familiarize yourself with leaderships styles.,
Assess the circumstances around your leadership role.,
Use your analysis of the circumstances involved around your leadership task in order to choose the most appropriate of the leadership styles.",How to Choose a Leadership Pattern,"


Authoritarian/Autocratic. This approach to leadership puts the bulk of decision-making and executive functions on you, the leader, and lessens the autonomy of those you are leading. This leadership pattern is useful in situations with heavy time restraints, in which you know the most about what needs to be done and how to do it. Otherwise, in more long-term situations that require greater employee input and responsibility, this dominating style of leadership should be avoided.
Participative/Democratic. This managerial style promotes the involvement of those you are leading. You are responsible for overseeing the task, delegating responsibilities and making final decisions, but your employees are responsible for giving input in regards to getting their tasks done most efficiently. This will generally yield better results than an authoritarian style, as it encourages everyone to be accountable and it promotes positive morale.
Delegative/Free reign. Use a delegative leadership pattern when you trust the competency, efficiency and dedication of those you are leading. Allowing this type of autonomy amongst the members of your task force allows you to focus on other, more pressing matters, but it does not negate your responsibility in ensuring the quality of the finished product.;
, Take the following things into consideration before choosing a managerial style:


Those you will be leading. Take note of how long they have been in their positions so you know if they need to be taught, guided or delegated responsibilities.
Critique the relationship between yourself and those you are responsible for leading. Gauging levels of familiarity and respect is important to choosing a leadership pattern.
The task at hand. Consider the many variables involved in completing the task, including time to complete, training necessary to complete, stressors involved with such a task, amount of structure required by the task and the need for individual versus teamwork-type participation.

, Ideally, your role as a leader should utilize not just 1 style, but aspects from each of the leadership patterns, as they apply to the specifics of your task.

It’s better to be respected than loved.,
Keep Your Word.",How to Become a Better Leader," Clear communication is an important part of any successful relationship, and the relationship between leader and team member is no different. Express your ideas clearly, making sure employees understand what you’re asking of them. Create a conversation-friendly environment, and give employees the freedom to express their thoughts and concerns. Team members are more willing to trust a leader with whom they are able to openly communicate.;
, Express your exceptional and positive vision for the future. A leader with a plan is the easiest leader to follow. Once aware of the team’s goal, each member will strive to do his/her part to aid in the completion of the objective, thus ensuring not only the motivation of each individual, but the unification of your team as well.

, Would you look to someone for guidance and leadership if they did not truly care about the goals of the group? Of course not! Great leaders are not just focused on getting group members to finish tasks; they have a genuine passion and enthusiasm for the projects they work on. Start by thinking of different ways that you can express your passion. Let people know that you care about their progress. When one person shares something with the rest of the group, be sure to tell them how much you appreciate such contributions.

, To be an effective leader, one must listen to what those around you are saying, and then make a decision on what you have heard. To listen is very difficult, but one must, because the lowest of the low person in your business may say something that is effective and very important, something that you would never have thought of. So... learn to listen carefully, and when everyone has had their say, only then make a decision.

, You want to be a leader at work, learn to take responsibility for anything that has your fingerprint on it. That means, as long as you participate in the project, you have a hand at the failure of the project. Learn to take responsibility for not just the good things, but even bad ones.

, Gaining respect from those who regularly encounter your brand is best done through exemplifying ideal behaviors and characteristics. Some of the most influential leaders guide their businesses, teams, and customers by modeling qualities they wish to see in others.

, The best leaders understand the importance of not only recognizing others, but also providing them with a reward. This technique will positively affect your personal brand through the engagement and happiness of others. Your ability to see and thank individuals for their hard work will gain brand loyalty.

, Transformational leaders also provide inspirational motivation to encourage their followers to get into action. Of course, being inspirational isn't always easy. Fortunately, you don't need motivational speeches to rouse your group members. Being genuinely passionate about ideas or goals, helping followers feel included in the process and offering recognition, praise and rewards for people's accomplishments works good for motivation.

, As human beings, we have a natural tendency to want to be loved. But what happens when your desire to be loved interferes with your ability to lead? Effective leaders recognize it is more important to be respected by their people than adored. They make the tough decisions that are needed to secure the future of those around them, including their direct reports., Don't make promises you can't keep. By keeping your promises, you and others will take you seriously.

Evaluate your habits.,
Be encouraging.,
Practice gratitude.,
Make new contacts.,
Remove bad influences.",How to Be Your Own Mentor1," Your first step to being your own mentor is to take a self-inventory. In order to put yourself in the right frame of mind for mentoring, you need to take an honest look at yourself. Take some time to reflect on your habits. Track the ways you spend your days.Take notes. Jot down how much time you spend each day on work, socializing, exercise, etc.
Keep track of your activities for a week or two. At the end of that period, evaluate how you spend your time
Consider which habits are good, and which you should get rid of. For example, if you see that you are spending hours each day on social media, consider making a change to that part of your routine.
You can also make a list of what your perceive to be your strengths and your weaknesses.;
, When you mentor yourself, you need to be a major part of your own support system. Try to speak positively towards yourself. Build your self-esteem from within.Try a daily affirmation. Each morning, you could say something like, ""Today, you will find a new way to be successful.""
Leave yourself notes. Place encouraging sentiments posted around your home and inside your desk at work. You could also try sending yourself a positive e-mail.
Avoid negativity. When you have a set-back, don't berate yourself.

, A good mentor often chooses to focus on the positive. As your own mentor, you can adopt this mental habit, too. Take time to be grateful for the good things in your life. They can be personal or professional.Try keeping a gratitude journal. Each day, write down things that you are grateful for. Study the patterns of how you express gratitude.

, Mentoring yourself is all about finding ways to make positive changes in your life. Whether you are looking for personal or professional growth, expanding your network can help. Meeting new people is a great way to learn new skills and find out about new opportunities.Go to a networking event. If you are trying to enhance your career or break into a new field, this is a great way to go about it.
Before you go, remember to give yourself a pep talk. Tell yourself that you will act confident and outgoing.

, A good mentor will encourage you to avoid being around people who have a negative impact on you. As your own mentor, it is up to you to figure out if you need to limit contact with certain people. Take some time to evaluate those relationships that might not be positive.For example, maybe you have a co-worker who constantly complains about the corporate culture. That's probably not a good person to spend a lot of time with if you are working on advancing your career at that company.
Find someone new to sit with at lunch. That negativity is not what you need to help motivate you to make positive changes.

Ask someone to mentor you.,
Brainstorm potential activities or discussions.,
Create a structure for your mentoring relationship.,
Commit to the mentoring relationship.",How to Develop a Mentoring Plan," You may want to teach specific information or develop a particular skill. Having a clear purpose in mind will help you develop a specific mentoring plan that meets your needs and expectations.


Academic mentoring relationships help students learn skills for studying, writing, and math that will help them succeed in the classroom.
Personal development mentoring focuses on growing in social or leadership skills, or in developing one's character.
Workplace mentoring often partners new employees with current ones in order to help them learn specific tasks or jobs. They may also be training opportunities designed to help an employee earn a promotion or transition into a different job.;
, Each person prefers a certain environment in which they can connect with their mentor. Decide what works best for you.


Traditional mentoring consists of a one-on-one, face-to-face relationship.
Group mentoring includes one mentor but several mentees.
Team mentoring involves several mentors with several mentees.
Peer mentoring consists of a more mutual relationship, where each person mentors the other.
E-mentoring tends to be one-on-one, but takes place via email and the Internet. However, the individuals involved in e-mentoring often start their relationship with a face-to-face meeting.

, Mentors should be knowledgeable in the area you want to learn about. You should also have a good connection with them. If you cannot think of anyone, ask a friend or supervisor for suggestions.

, It is important that you are clear and upfront about your initial expectations for this mentoring relationship so the potential mentor can decide if they are a good fit. If the person declines, do not take it to heart. Simply ask someone else.


If you are pairing others together in mentoring relationships, it is important that you consider your matches carefully. Take interests, personalities, and skills into consideration.

, You have a particular purpose for this mentoring relationship. Explore different things you may learn throughout it.


Make a list of specific things you want to learn. For example, if the purpose for mentoring is to learn more about classic literature, identify authors like Shakespeare and Milton in whose work you have a particular interest in learning.
Write a tentative agenda for mentoring sessions. Do this with your mentor. Allow them to add things to the list. For example, they may want to introduce you to a classic author you have never read.

, This helps both mentors and mentees have appropriate expectations and enables them to decide if the commitment is one they can realistically manage.


Determine when and how often you will meet. Figure out which days and times work best for you. Then, based on your goals for this mentoring relationship, decide how often you will need to meet with your mentor.
Decide where you will meet. Some mentors prefer to have their mentee tag along with them during daily routines. Others may want to meet in a more casual setting such as a coffee shop, a restaurant, or the park.
Lay down relationship guidelines. Together, decide when it is appropriate to call each other, what information will be kept confidential, if it is okay to visit one another at home, and so forth.
Set a tentative time frame for your mentoring relationship. Mentoring often takes place for 6 months to 1 year. At the end of that time, revisit your purpose for meeting and decide if you want to renew your commitment for another set period of time.

, Trust and reliability are two factors that are essential in strengthening the mentoring relationship. Each person needs to agree to show up regularly and on time. They also need to fulfill any personal obligations they agreed to throughout the mentoring. For example, if you are reading through a book together, each person needs to finish the reading for each session.

,  Do research on the Internet to better understand your mentee’s racial, ethnic, and cultural background.

, Focus on things such as family history, beliefs, traditions, food, holidays, and living customs. Share the same information about your family.

,  For example, both your cultures/families may like similar sports, foods, and television shows and may have similar ways of celebrating holidays.

, Try eating new foods, listening to different music, or adopting new words.


If invited, participate in cultural events, celebrations, or meals with your mentee and her family.

,  Become a sounding board to help her understand the source of those prejudices, and expose her to experiences that may help her overcome those prejudices.

,  They could have a cultural basis. For example, your mentee may be disinterested in school and even want to drop out despite all your efforts to help her academically. You could conclude that she just doesn’t care when, in reality, she simply does not see college as a real-life option because no one in her family or neighborhood has ever gone to college. Or perhaps her family expects her to get a job to help economically.


Socioeconomic differences can be especially challenging because they often are attended by assumptions and expectations that might be less transparent than those associated with race, ethnicity, and culture. Furthermore, poverty is so often intertwined with race and ethnicity that it may be difficult to distinguish what is at the heart of issues you are experiencing. It is best to approach socioeconomic differences with the same sensitivity and respect for your mentee’s family as you have for the other types of differences.

,  Your mentee may find it harder to trust you, especially initially, if he thinks you are judgmental about his life circumstances.

,  You may find that things you take for granted, such as access to books, writing materials, a phone, a computer, or transportation, are things that your mentee doesn’t have and can’t easily get.

,  If you bring your mentee to your house, he may become envious of your possessions or even critical of his own family.

Figure out your priorities.,
Set short term goals.,
List long term goals.,
Create a personal mission statement.,
Include physical health.",How to Be Your Own Mentor2," When you act as your own mentor, your main job is to help yourself make improvements. In order to do that effectively, you should take some time to think about what is most important to you. Are you trying to advance your career? Or build more solid personal relationships? List your priorities. You can start by simply writing down all of the important things in your life.
Once you have a list, you can go through and rank them in order of importance. Did you put ""Finish my MBA"" at the top of your list? Then consider that your number one priority.

, After you have figured out your priorities, it is time to create goals. You want your goals to be realistic and attainable. Don't set yourself up for failure.List some goals that you can achieve in a reasonably short amount of time. For example, you can say, ""Within one month I would like to have applied for 6 new jobs.""
You can also set some personal short term goals. For example, you can write, ""I am going to make it home in time for dinner with my family four days a week.""

, It is also a good idea to create some goals that will take longer to accomplish. When listing your long-term goals, remember to keep your priorities in mind. Also remember to list things that are reasonable and attainable.A long-term goal could be, ""I will be promoted to Senior Analyst within the next year.""
An example of a personal long-term goal might be, ""I will travel to visit my extended family for a week each summer.""

, In addition to listing goals, you should consider writing a personal mission statement. This is a document that outlines your values, goals, and skills. It can serve as the framework for future goal setting.To start, list your core values. These might be something like: family, career, education, spiritual health, etc.
Identify what you want to accomplish. For example, you might write, ""I wish to make the world a better place by being a great dad and an excellent attorney.
Then include the ways that you will make those things happen. For example, ""I will spend time with my son every day and offer him encouragement.""

, When you are creating your goal-related documents, don't forget to include some physical goals. Your physical health is important. The mind-body connection means that the health of your body will impact your moods. If you don't feel well, it can be hard to make positive life changes.Get plenty of rest. Most adults need about 7-9 hours of sleep per night.
Eat a healthy diet. Choose meals with a combination of fresh fruits and veggies, whole grains, and lean proteins.
Exercise. Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity most days of the week. Try a yoga class or an outdoor hike to add some variety to your workouts.

"
"
Measure your outcomes.,
Give yourself a break.,
Reevaluate your strategy.,
Get some advice.",How to Be Your Own Mentor3," A mentor checks in regularly with their mentee. That means that you need to give yourself regular progress reports. Set aside time to think about what progress you have made in reaching your goals.Choose a time to check in. It can be once a week or once a month. Just make sure to put it on your calendar so that you don't forget.
Look at your short term goals. Have you been actively applying for jobs? You can consider that as making progress.
Reflect on your long-term goals. Ask yourself, ""Am I making progress?""

, Remember, it is a mentor's job to be encouraging. Maybe at times you will feel like you won't have made much progress. That's completely normal. Try giving yourself some positive reinforcement.Take time to relax. If you're working too hard, you might need a break. Schedule a day off for yourself.
Do something you enjoy, such as reading a good book or playing a game of tennis with a friend.

, As you measure your progress, you should take some time to evaluate what's working. If you are not making progress as rapidly as you would like, you may need to make some changes.

For example, maybe you are meeting your goal of applying for 6 jobs a month. If you haven't landed a new position yet, consider raising that number to 10.

, When you act as your own mentor, you are likely your own best adviser. However, that does not mean that you shouldn't listen to anyone else. You should still seek advice and guidance from others that you trust. For example, you could ask your boss, ""Could you let me know if there are areas where I could improve? I'd love to be considered for a promotion in the next year.""

Realize that the strongest choices often come from an individual charged with a responsibility—in this case, the decider.",How to Supercharge Business Meetings," Management reviews the technique and structures its use. The process is probably best left open for the members of your team to shape and use as they see fit.;
, This person will notify the participants, prepare materials, and set the agenda.

, The organizer/facilitator should secure a meeting place and set a time that is suitable for all those participating. They should notify everyone and may state the general purpose of the meeting and the expected length of the meeting—approximately thirty minutes, including refreshments.

, The organizer/facilitator will gather all the ""Things You'll Need"" and prepare notes to be referred to when explaining the procedures simply. He or she will guide the group and facilitate the meeting. This preparation should be completed earlier in the day or the previous afternoon.

, This done during the meeting either by:


A blind draw of toothpicks (or marbles). The individual who draws the short toothpick (specially colored marble) becomes the decider.
Pulling a name from a hat.

, Give each participant two pieces of paper for ""noting,"" along with a writing implement.

, The plan is to unleash a free association of unfettered thinking and capture all the ideas in personal notes. No one has to worry about sharing dumb ideas.—Write down everything that comes to mind. The goal is to free each participant from normal constraints and worries.


Stack the deck to avoid pre-emptive idea rejection and to throw away concerns about non-adherence to current policy. After all, policy is in place to get things done in the best possible way and, at times, policy may stand in the way of efficacy.

, The primary goal could be to identify opportunities for new ventures, to plan an optimal transition to a new product line, or something else.

, Allow seven to ten minutes. This is enough time to calmly note thoughts and ideas in short bullet points. There is no need to rush.

, Set the timer for two minutes and have everyone narrow his or her thoughts to the two best. Each person should cross off all ideas except their two stellar insights—either whole solutions or critical components.


Again, the thinking should be by individuals and be uninfluenced, insofar as is possible, by those in the meeting or elsewhere within the company. Each person should do his or her best to avoid filtering ideas based on what others might judge or say.
The goal is to extend the horizon of possibility by abolishing previous constraints that have arisen during corporate evolution.

, Each person, in turn, reads one idea while someone lists the ideas on the whiteboard. There will be two rounds of ""reveals"" and there should be no explicit pitching or characterizing of ideas at this time.


However, it is fun for the thinker to use voice inflection while revealing personal choices. Everyone should, of course, be pretty hyped about the suggestions they offer up and a bit of drama and excitement is encouraged.
It is also best to refrain from forming or voicing any judgment at this time—no pros and cons, no discussions, no wise comments. Strive to make the process unbiased and work to facilitate free thinking and innovation.


, This way they may be easily referred to during the voting which follows.

, The time limit for this section of the process is three to five minutes (time set by facilitator). Set the timer for the appropriate length of time and have everyone select their favorite from the list on the whiteboard and record it on a piece of paper. There is to be no discussion during this process. When each person has made their selection, they should turn their piece of paper face down and wait quietly for the others to finish.

, Each person, in turn, says aloud his or her vote while someone marks the votes by putting a dot next to that idea on the whiteboard. No one should interrupt the process by offering resistance or verbal praise.


Pitching your vote is permitted, but only while you have the floor for your vote. The pitch must be short (one minute or less).
It is best to keep open minds; avoid prejudgment and prejudice; and remain open to exploring new possibilities.
Remember to respect others thoughts and honor them properly. Work hard to see the merit in each suggestion and viewpoint, then fold that into the overall solution.

, The decider makes the final call for the group and can choose to honor the result of the voting or not. He or she picks the one solution that he or she considers to be the best. The decider cuts through any potential politicking and streamlines the process.

, Make sure to tailor the process to your group needs: to individual team members, to the department, and to what is being considered—what is ""Noted and Voted"" upon.


For example, you might ask for a one word attribute relating to a product or process; a longer phrase pitching the same; an item attribute (color, weight, or size); a catch phrase; a new motto,...

, Consider allowing each participant two votes which may be used on separate items or as two votes for the same item.

, Allowing alone-time to consider and sift through viable options helps circumvent ""groupthink."" This results in a richer and more diverse pool of options.

, Normal meetings are linear: One person speaks and the rest listen, waiting a turn to articulate their thoughts after hearing the other(s). The thinking is normally a thought chain with one thought loosely linked to the previous speaker's ideas, and the next thought to that later set of ideas, and so forth.
By interjecting ideas, the participants often fork an idea repeatedly so that it diverges from any reasonable solution path. Often it is found that individuals seek aggrandization by imposing their visions. Thus, in a traditional meeting process, it is highly likely that the thought train gets misdirected or redirected after a good start.
Instead, ""Note and vote"" isolates each person's thought processes and, to a great extent, gets around misdirected final outcomes.

, ""Note and Vote"" invokes the processing power of each mind simultaneously and taps the power of parallel processing: Many independent ideas are generated rather than a single watered-down compromise of an argument.

, By noting independently, each choice reflects a unique perspective and no voice is amplified.

, In other processes, votes often echo the opinion of someone who is considered wise or the ""voice of reason.""

, Varied perspectives, properly recognized, often provide the valuable insight that supercharges ideas.

, Traditional meetings give little time for focused, individual thinking. Normally, there is little engaged, creative thinking and sorting. However, the ""Note and Vote"" format kick-starts the creative sorting process.

, The decider will likely select an outcome that is superior to one arrived at in a traditional meeting, and in one-quarter of the time.

, Do you have an opinion? Participation can demonstrate your value to the team. It can also take the meeting in a different direction that's more relevant to you and help to get things done.

, This helps you remember the content and makes it much easier to stay engaged with the meeting.

, Warm, stuffy rooms promote brain fog. Fresh air and street noise will help keep you alert even when the subject matter doesn't.

, Tap your fingers on your forehead, massage the muscles between your thumb and index finger, rub the base of your skull, or knead the spot below your knee.

, Be creative. For extra fun, pass the drawing around the table.

, Do you have papers to sort, notes to review, plans to make? Make use of meeting time by multitasking some of this low-level work.


Use a laptop or handheld device if you have one. Otherwise, keep it inside one folder, binder, or notebook.

, Fidgeting under the table, even a little bit, can help to keep the blood flowing. Turn in your chair, swing your legs, or excuse yourself for a few minutes. This is especially helpful if the meeting is turning into a three-hour marathon.

Make every meeting matter - or don't meet at all.,
Define goals and distribute agenda in advance.,
Own your meeting, take charge and keep your meeting moving forward.,
Get the constructive input you need from everyone present.,
Close with an Action plan, try to make sure that everyone leaves knowing the next step.,
Keep track of progress of things decided during the meeting.,
Make sure that your meeting didn't happen in isolation by letting the right people know what was decided and what will happen next.",How to Run an Effective Meeting," Decide if a meeting is needed and invite only the necessary people. Massive amounts of valuable time are wasted simply because managers think that face-time is important, or because they've become accustomed to a particular routine. E-mails are usually sufficient to give your team an update or a status report. But if you need instant feedback from all participants, then e-mail will not be as efficient as a face-to-face meeting.;
, Create a structure for your meeting. Just stating the ideal result often inspires participants and makes meetings more productive. At the very least, it underscores a feature that every meeting needs: a goal. Before the meeting even begins, make sure everyone understands the objectives by writing an agenda.

, Good meetings are products of good leadership. Take charge and make it clear that you intend to keep the discussion timely, useful, and relevant. Show your colleagues that you respect their time by making sure a clock or timer is visible to all. Staying on topic is also key to maintaining a schedule. If the conversation runs off the rails, refocus the group by saying something like: ""Interesting, but I don't think we're advancing our goals here. If I could, I'd like to return to the agenda.""

, Since the point of a meeting is two-way communication, it's crucial to get honest input from everyone. It's the meeting leader's responsibility to make sure everyone is heard. To build consensus or come to a group decision, avoid wearing your opinion on your sleeve; it's easy for a leader to stifle a discussion if everyone assumes the outcome is already determined. Avoid the temptation to dismiss ideas immediately — even when they're terrible.

, Also end the meeting by asking everyone whether they thought the meeting was useful and, if not, what could be done better next time. Do a followup debriefing on your own to improve your meeting techniques.

, Also keep the group updated about the developments. This will help you in organizing the next meeting more effectively.

, It's easy to walk out of a meeting room, go back to your desk, and immediately forget every change, decision, and new idea that your group came up with. Make sure you have a system to keep track of what was decided and what assignments everyone agreed to take on so you can follow up and keep things moving, even if you don't send out complete meeting minutes.

You should review these rules thoroughly before starting out. If you can't find them on your organization's website, ask someone in authority where the rules can be found., If the committee is brand new (and even if it's not), you need to ensure that it is focused properly. The best way to focus your committee is to have a specific goal in mind for it. For instance, maybe you are forming a committee to assess how a product is doing. That is the primary goal of the committee.Think about whether the committee will primarily be advising or will actually be implementing solutions.You also need to be clear about how much authority the committee will have. Of course, the main organization should make this decision, but you should present your opinion before the committee meets.Work in tandem with the organization or the boss who wants the committee formed to make these decisions.

, It's likely you were chosen as committee chair because you are already knowledgeable in the area. However, make sure to continue doing your homework. To be a leader, you need to be able to see the whole picture, which means that you need to study each piece your committee is focusing on. That way, when solutions are brought to the table, you can decide if they will be effective or not., The old chair should provide you with information on the committee and what your role should play as the committee chair. He or she can also provide you with information about individual members of the committee.The old chair should also provide you with documents about the committee, such as what the main policies are, what meetings are scheduled, and what the committee has been doing in the past year., Look at your goals and tasks from above. Write out a list of skills that are needed to help fulfill those goals. For instance, if your primary goal is to fundraise, you'll need people who are good at organizing, who can connect with other people, and who are creative., If the committee is already established, it will already have members.That doesn't mean that every person on the committee should stay on it. Consider how the committee will move forward and which members best fit that goal.


With that in mind, you may need to ask members to step down if you feel they are not contributing to the main goal. However, you must do so carefully, especially if you are running a volunteer committee. You need to maintain goodwill with your volunteers.

, If it's your responsibility to recruit or appoint members, you need to make sure you are appointing people for the right reasons. Once you've established the main goals and tasks of the committee above, that can help you establish who would be good members. That is, consider the skills of the employee or volunteer before asking them to join the committee. The person's skills should contribute in some way to your goals.If you don't know who would have particular skills in your organization, ask around. You may find recommendations land you many new members.

, If there is a head seat in the room you are using, it's appropriate for you to take it. You are the leader, and you are visually establishing that by taking the head seat.On the other hand, if you want to establish a more informal setting, you might sit in the middle of the group. It will make you more approachable, though it may cut down a bit on your authority., If the committee is new, explain how it will be run. That is, if you have specific rules about how an idea will be brought up, now is the time to lay those rules out. You should also have a handout of the rules so that your members can refer back to them later.For very formal committees, some people turn to Robert's Rules of Orders Newly Revised. It provides rules for how committees are run.You can also establish any rules for any misconduct, include people coming late to the meetings, not being prepared, or taking over a meeting completely., You've already established the purpose of the committee for yourself. However, your members need to be clear on what the purpose is as well. Go over the purpose in the first meeting. In addition, you should be clear about what each member should contribute in terms of time and ideas.You should also have the purpose in writing to help guide your members throughout the time they are on the committee., Once rules and consequences are in place, you have to be the one who makes sure they are followed. That means following through with any consequences in a fair and just manner. It always pays to be diplomatic, even when someone is breaking the rules.As an example, if you have all agreed that no one can talk for more than 10 minutes with the exception of special presentations, when someone is going over, you need to step in. However, instead of saying, ""John, you need to be quiet now. You're way over time."" you could say, ""Thanks, John, for that valuable information. I know you have more to say, but maybe you can put it in a short email to all our committee members so we can be sure to cover all the items on our agenda today.""

, Agendas guide meetings because they help the group focus on a few main ideas. You must make sure that the agenda is appropriate. That is, you must make sure that you have enough time to give each item on the agenda the attention it needs. If you have too much on it, you'll be forced to skip over some items.Hand the agenda out a day or two before the meeting so members can be prepared.
Make sure each person knows what she or he is responsible for on the agenda beforehand.

, If the committee doesn't have an established secretary, make sure someone takes minutes at every meeting. That way, you can have something to refer back to when you want to know what happened at each meeting.

, Once you've had your first meeting, make sure to maintain regular communication with your members. Offer regular updates on meeting times, as well as synopses of the meetings. You'll also need to provide updates as new information becomes available., It's important that your personal agenda (such as advancing in the company) doesn't come before the committee. That means that you place more importance on the committee succeeding in its goals than on you succeeding in your own goals., One of the key points of encouraging creativity is that you build up members rather than tear them down. If you are constantly berating members in front of the group for their ideas, they will soon stop volunteering ideas. Therefore, it's important to make the committee a place where you are accepting of new thoughts and ideas, even if they seem strange at first., As old members go off the committee, you'll need to recruit more members. As you do, make sure you provide them with an appropriate orientation that covers the rules and focus of the group, just as you did when you started with the committee. Help the new person to figure out how she or he can engage with the committee., Many times, members do not need to be on a committee, and they are volunteering to do so. Keep that in mind as you run your committee, and offer your thanks in writing and in person for what they do to make your committee a success."

While most organizations adhere to the same general structure, some details can vary.Details you may need to pay special attention to include the sort of notice you must provide members with regarding the meeting, the procedure for electing new board members, and the type of information that must be reviewed at each AGM.
You should also check on how many people must be present for the meeting to be considered official and the manner in which new amendments to the organization's constitution should be presented and voted on.;
, Set the date and time of the AGM as early as possible. Notify key members immediately.


Non-essential members should be informed once the details are finalized.
Once everyone has been informed of the date, you should send out regular reminders to prevent anyone from forgetting.

, If you do not have your own venue, you will need to pick a venue that can hold your AGM and secure it as soon as possible.


Even if you have your own facilities, holding the AGM at a separate venue may make the occasion seem more significant and, as such, may attract more attendees.
Pick a venue that can accommodate everyone involved. Make sure that the room is large enough to hold everyone comfortably. If you have members or other attendees who need special accommodations (like wide doorways and ramps for wheelchair-bound members), verify that the venue can match these needs before you book it.Once you decide on the right venue, book it as soon as you have the date and time set.

, The agenda is essentially a list or outline of the information that will be covered at the AGM.


Prepare this agenda in advance. You may need to send it out to attendees with the notice of meeting, but even if you don't, you will need to have it ready to pass out at the actual meeting.
List the topics of discussion in the order you expect to address them.
Usually, listing the title of each topic is enough on an agenda. You probably don't need to provide any detail about each topic.
A sample agenda might look something like:

AGENDA
1) Welcome
2) Apologies for absence
3) Previous AGM minutes
4) Matters arising from minutes
5) Chair-person's annual report
6) Secretary's annual report
7) Treasurer's annual report
8) Election of officers
9) General business
10) Date of next meeting
11) Close of meeting



, It takes time to prepare all of the various statements, reports, and documents you will need for the AGM, so start early.


Take care of all documents and reports you're in charge of as early as possible.
Remind other committee members to prepare the information they're in charge of, as well.
Documents you may need to prepare can include monthly financial reports and other financial statements, the previous AGM minutes, the president's report, the secretary's report, and the treasurer's report.

, If board elections will be discussed at the AGM, you should look for members who may fit the necessary roles before the meeting itself.


Talk to the members you have your eye on and ask if they would be willing to take on the role.
If extra training will be required, provide those members with the training they'll need.

, You need to send a formal ""Notice of Meeting"" to all members. Follow the regulations set down in your organization's rules when determining when and how to do this.


You may also need to invite sponsors, lifetime members and alumni, and other stakeholders or related parties.
Typically, a notice of meeting must include the date, time, duration, and venue of the AGM. You will need to state that elections are being held when applicable.
You may include the entire agenda of the meeting, or you may opt to mention one or two key items. Check the organization's constitution to determine the correct procedure.

, On the day of the AGM, arrive several hours early so that you can set up the room.


Keep in mind that some attendees may arrive 30 minutes early or so. Try to have the all of the seats and refreshments set up before that happens.

, The secretary is usually responsible for taking meeting minutes, but if this is not the case for your organization, you will need to appoint someone to record the contents of the AGM.


Keep a record of any decisions made at the AGM, especially those regarding elections and changes to the organization's constitution.
It can also be a wise idea to record the names and contact information of the attendees. You can do this by instructing the attendees to sign in as they arrive.

, Open the AGM with a formal greeting. During this greeting, make sure that the meeting agenda and annual reports are being distributed to the attendees.Declare the meeting to be open. As you do so, state the organization's full name and the current AGM number (the twenty-second Annual General Meeting, the thirty-nine Annual General Meeting, etc.).
Welcome all members and name any special visitors.

, If any officer or significant member is absent, you may want to briefly state the names of those absent after your welcome message.


You may invite other present members to make apologies on behalf of additional absent attendees, as well.
Make a formal motion to accept the apologies.

, Verify that everyone has received a copy of the meetings from last year's AGM. Review these minutes and, when all issues are addressed, move to formally accept the minutes.


If there are any amendments or corrections that need to be made, they must be made before the minutes are accepted.
After voting to accept the minutes, the chairperson will need to sign off on them.

, Topics that are related to the minutes from your previous AGM should be addressed immediately after those minutes are accepted.


Discuss the matters as needed. This is usually a time to present concerns and observations, so formal motions may not be necessary.

, You will need to discuss the president's or chair-person's report, the secretary's report, and the treasurer's report.


Read and discuss each report one by one. After each report has been reviewed thoroughly, you should make a formal motion to adopt that report.
During the treasurer's report, you will need to present the attendees with a record of the previous year's finances. The treasurer can usually perform the task, but some organizations may require the use of an independent party.

, If new board members need to be elected at this year's AGM, you should hold those elections after the reports are delivered but before any general business has been addressed.


Prepare the necessary materials in advance.
Decide on the voting system before the meeting. Explain the system clearly before the votes are cast.
A neutral party should count the votes.
The minutes will need to show who was nominated, who proposed the nomination, and who seconded it. It should also list the number of votes each candidate had and who was elected for each position.

, General business is usually the last matter discussed at an AGM. This is a time for attendees to bring up issues and concerns not otherwise covered.


Since this part of the meeting is somewhat informal, you probably won't take any motions or votes during this time.

, If you know the date and location of the next AGM, state it at the end of this meeting.


Skip this step if no formal plans have been made yet.

, When everything has been covered, declare the AGM closed.

, Appoint a member or two to stand at the door and greet people as they arrive.


The use of greeters can make the atmosphere seem friendlier and more welcoming.

, At minimum, try to provide water for the attendees, especially if the meeting will be a lengthy one.


Offering a variety of refreshments is a better option. Consider providing both cold drinks (water, iced tea, and lemonade/punch) and hot drinks (coffee and hot tea).
Depending on the time of day, it may also be appropriate to offer light snacks like cheese and crackers.

, The guest speaker should talk on an unofficial issue of great importance to the members of your organization.


Typically, the speaker will follow the presentation of general business but will come before the close of the actual meeting. If desired, though, you may ask the speaker to present after the official meeting closes.

, A door prize can encourage attendance. Raffles can encourage both attendance and financial support.


Consider hosting a 50/50 raffle in which half the proceeds go to the winner and half go to the organization.
Gift basket raffles are another option.
Consider making attendance a requirement for claiming prizes.

, Encourage attendance by keeping the formal business part of the AGM as brief as possible. Follow it with a social where attendees can interact and enjoy themselves.If you have the budget, consider hosting a luncheon after the meeting ends. You can cut costs by making the luncheon a potluck.
For organizations with lower budgets, an informal cocktail hour might be more realistic. Instead of providing refreshments during the meeting, wait until afterward and serve the snack food with a variety of non-alcoholic drinks and wine.

Confirm the meeting’s time, place, and duration with a manager.,
Prepare an agenda for the meeting.,
Gather minutes from previous meetings.,
Distribute all documents.,
Gather the necessary equipment.,
Assemble the room.",How to Prepare for a Meeting1," Before distributing information about the meeting to all relevant personnel, you should make sure all of the logistical details you have are correct. Failing to do so can mean that you’ll have to publicize corrections later, something which makes both you and your office look disorganized and unprofessional.


You might want to work up a draft of the meeting announcement memo or email and show this to your manager. This way the manager can review not only the logistical information within, but also the format and wording.
Also be sure to confirm who should receive the announcement. You might already know who will be attending, but your manager might want other, non-attending workers or clients to know about the meeting as well.;
, The agenda is an important document for any meeting, as it notifies attendees of the objectives and purview of the gathering, as well as keeping the meeting itself focused, efficient, and on track. In order to draft an agenda, have your manager provide you with a short list of objectives and planned topics for the meeting. From this list, you can create an agenda which you’ll send out along with the notification of the meeting’s time, date, and place.


A good agenda should include topics to be addressed and their purposes, as well as speakers or members of personnel responsible for presenting on each topic. All topics and presentations should be placed in a logical sequence, as well as segmented according to the time your manager wants to spend on each step.If you’ve never crafted an agenda before, or if you’re still feeling unsure about your chosen format, check templates provided by word processing programs such as Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.

, In addition to a short notification of the upcoming meeting and an agenda, you should attach any minutes from previous meetings which are relevant to the topics planned. If your company or group doesn’t take minutes, double check with your manager to find out if there is any additional data or background information they would like sent out with the notification.


If it’s not company or group policy to take minutes—perhaps there’s no one available to take the minutes, for example—consider changing this policy for the future, or at least having the meeting audio recorded for the future. This documentation will help personnel refer back to ideas and agreements discussed, as well as catch up on what happened at the meeting If they were unable to attend., At least a week before the meeting in question is scheduled, send out the necessary documents to all attendees and other relevant personnel. Do this according to company protocol: for more formal meetings or larger companies, you might need to send out hard copies, whereas smaller companies or more informal, team meetings can often be arranged via email.


Some software and email platforms such as Outlook can help facilitate meeting scheduling, so check out these options if you’re looking for a way to streamline and modernize your office’s meeting calendar.This time frame accords with general office etiquette, but you should be aware that some organizations and professional protocols stipulate specific deadlines and terms. For example, some countries and states require meeting notices for Housing Association board meetings to be mailed at least a month before the scheduled meeting., Many meetings will require little more equipment and materials than a table, chairs, and some loose paper and pens for note-taking. Some meetings—especially those at larger companies or which include data- and multimedia-heavy presentations—will need special equipment, such as projectors, screens, laser pointers, microphones, cable hook-ups, or audio speakers.You should collect and assemble all of these materials well before the meeting in order to make sure everything functions and is ready on time.


If one or more employees or team members is planning on presenting at the meeting, contact them ahead of time to ask if they need any specific technology or devices for their presentation.

, In addition to setting up all of the necessary equipment for the meeting ahead of time, you should also make sure the room is well-appointed for everyone’s comfort and attention. For example, make sure there are enough chairs in the room, that water bottles are stocked and visible, and that the temperature and air circulation in the room are acceptable. Such considerations may seem like details, but studies have shown that little things like room temperature can make a big impact on peoples' moods and attentiveness.Depending on your company’s usual protocol, you might also want to provide some kind of snack or hot beverage for attendees. Always verify with your manager ahead of time to make sure you’re supplying everything they’d like.

Research your position.,
Create simple, visually interesting slides or materials.,
Consider your audience.,
Write a loose script for your presentation.,
Rehearse your presentation.,
Select a simple and sophisticated outfit from your wardrobe.,
Wake up early.,
Eat a protein-rich breakfast.,
Get in a positive frame of mind.",How to Prepare for a Meeting2," If you’ve been assigned a particular project, or if you’ve called a meeting in order to pitch an idea or request funding, you should make sure that you “do your homework” before entering the meeting. For example, if you’re pitching a product idea or marketing strategy, you should research and compile data on audience demographics, current and projected spending patterns, and focus groups or surveys which speak to the demand or relevancy of your product or idea.


If you’ve been assigned a task from a higher-up at your company and you’re unsure what is expected, check with other, senior employees to find out what information you should have and how you should present it.
It can help to imagine you’re in the shoes of someone listening to your pitch. Ask yourself, if someone was asking you for money or for the approval of a particular strategy, what kind of information would you want to hear? In other words, what kind of data would help persuade you of the cogency of the idea or demand of the product in front of you?, While you should be able to talk through any of the data you’re presenting and using as evidence of your argument, you should also provide visual representations—for example, pie graphs, bar charts, or decision trees—of the most important figures. Not only do such visual representations convey complex information in a tight, efficient manner, but they also tend to be remembered more clearly than data communicated verbally.There are many software programs designed to assist you in business presentations, so check out options like PowerPoint and SlideDog when putting together your presentation.
Be sure to use large—24 point at the minimum—font on your slides and posters, as well as clear, streamlined graphics which don’t clutter the page. The last thing you want is for your audience to be unclear or confused about the information you’re presenting and how it’s relevant., When planning your presentation, you should always keep in mind what kind of people will be attending the meeting and listening to your talk. Are they fellow team members with whom you work closely? If so, chances are that you won’t have to adjust your diction or tone at all in order to communicate effectively. In contrast, if clients you don’t know well will be at the meeting, or people from other departments and other areas of expertise, you should strive to make your language and materials as accessible as possible., You don’t want to read off a document or cue cards throughout a meeting, as there’s perhaps no faster way to lose your audience’s attention.That being said, you should organize your thoughts and arguments in written form beforehand. Even if you don’t take the document with you to the meeting, you’ll benefit from the process of writing out and reviewing your points before you need to communicate them to others.


If you plan on using the script in your meeting, write down only the skeleton of your argument so that you won’t be tempted to read from the document rather than speaking off the cuff.
It can also help to jot down intervals in the presentation when you want to take a sip of water, make an anecdotal aside, pause meaningfully, or switch slides or visual graphics.

, Once you’ve assembled all of the information and presentation materials you plan to use, you should do a dry-run at least once before taking your show on the road. This will allow you to time your speech, practice tricky wording or segues, and smooth out your demeanor and public speaking persona.It’s particularly helpful to do this mock presentation in front of other people. Ask friends, family, or friendly coworkers to observe your dry-run and give you feedback. They can let you know if you’re speaking too rapidly, what points seem unclear, and even advise you as to gestures and voice volume.

, Even if your company or the clients you’re pitching to are consistently informal and relaxed, you should attend the meeting in smart attire. It will show that you care and that you take the meeting seriously, whereas a slapdash outfit can make it look like you didn’t prepare your presentation at all, even if you spent all night or week doing so. Fashion and business experts agree that the most tried-and-true sartorial selection for a meeting—regardless of one’s gender—is a suit.A dark color such as navy or black is best. If the meeting is more informal, you can skip on the tie or dress the suit down with more casual accessories.
If you’ve ransacked your closet and can’t find anything suitable, ask friends or family for advice. They might have an idea as to how to improvise an ensemble or be able to lend you an item from their own wardrobes. Worse comes to worse, you can visit your local shopping center to look for an affordable pair of slacks and a blazer.

, Pressing snooze on your alarm and then rushing to work will leave your nerves frazzled and your thoughts disorganized. Avoid this fragmenting factor by waking and rising well before your meeting is scheduled. Taking your time getting dressed, drinking coffee, and completing your morning routine in a leisurely fashion will allow you to focus your thoughts and get into a positive mindset.Some experts contend that ritualistic practices—even superstitious ones that make little rational sense—can have a positive impact on performance. So, even if it seems silly, feel free to don your lucky socks, listen to your favorite song, or kiss your lucky memento before setting off!, Studies have shown that eating a healthy breakfast full of protein has a big impact on the rest of your day. In addition to keeping you full for a longer period of time, it also revs up your metabolism and promotes healthy muscle maintenance.Additionally, foods rich in flax and folic acid have been shown to help stimulate brain function, so loading up on cereals and breakfast bars can help you speak more fluently and creatively during your meeting., Once you’ve done all the legwork for your presentation, you should get yourself in the right headspace. You can run through your presentation quickly but, more importantly, you should bolster your mood and confidence. Do this by talking to yourself in an encouraging, positive manner; for example, remind yourself how much work you’ve done and how proud you are of the effort in spite of what happens at the meeting.


Additionally, try to picture yourself smiling and feeling relieved and happy after the presentation. Positive imagery like this can make a big impact on your performance."

Consider asking a professional contact for an informational meeting.,
Request a meeting.,
Pick a setting and time that is convenient for your contact.,
Do your homework.,
Create a list of questions for your meeting.,
Compose a personal statement.,
Bring a pen, notepad, and updated resume to your meeting.,
Dress professionally.",How to Prepare for a Meeting3," If you meet someone with a good job in the industry you’re interested in, or you have an acquaintance or manager at the firm where you’re interning, you might want to conduct an informational meeting with them. An informational meeting—also known as an informational interview—is a conversation with a reference or acquaintance who can serve as a professional resource for you. You get to ask the person about their experience, their field, and any advice they might have for candidates trying to get into the field.When considering who to ask for an interview or whether or not to ask a specific person, try jotting down what you want to accomplish and what kind of information you’re looking for. For example, are you interested mainly in strategic advice for application materials, or do you just want some general information about the field in order to determine your interest in a career in the industry? Answering these kinds of questions will help you determine who will be a good interviewee and whether or not a specific candidate will be useful to you.

, When asking a contact or acquaintance for an informational interview, you should mention the phrase ‘informational meeting’ or ‘informational interview’ explicitly. If you don’t request this specifically, the person might show up expecting informal drinks or a friendly chat and then feel miffed or caught off-guard when you start asking serious questions.


For example, if you’ve met someone at a party or networking event and chatted for a bit, say something like, “I have a lot of questions about the field and your experience in it—would you mind getting coffee some time and having an informational meeting with me?”
If you don’t have the chance to ask them in person, you can make contact via email or telephone. Just make sure to be concise and polite so that they don’t feel burdened by the request., Though the person giving you an informational meeting might be glad to help you, they’re still doing you a favor by giving you some time out of their work day. This means that you should make the meeting as convenient for them as possible, taking up no more of their time than 15-30 minutes.Check with your interviewee as to what time of day—for example, during lunch break or after work—and what kind of venue—for example, a coffee shop or their office—they prefer.
You should also let them know that, while an in-person meeting would be great, a telephone or online conversation is also perfectly fine.This consideration shows that you’re respectful of their time and happy to accept any modicum of help they’re willing to dole out.

, Once you’ve set up a meeting with your contact, research their background as best you can. This will help you figure out how to approach them, as well as what information they can give you. For example, find out what career path they’ve followed and what their main projects and roles are currently.Asking specific questions will also show your interest and enthusiasm. Over-the-top flattery should be avoided, but something like, “My old manager said she learned so much about turning your passion project into a viable company—how did you get started in the first place?” can grease the wheels and make your interviewee more likely to go the extra mile to help you out.

, Once you’ve identified your goals, draft a plan for the meeting that will accomplish these goals. Write down the questions you want to ask and put them in a strategic order. Warm up with general questions that show your curiosity, such as, “How did you get started in this field?” and “What kind of projects are you working on at the moment?” From there, move on to more specific questions, such as, “What qualifications or skills should I highlight in my application?” or “How should I prepare for an upcoming interview I have scheduled?”You don’t have to read off of this agenda in the meeting if it makes you feel awkward, but you should bring it with you to check periodically and make sure that you don’t skip anything you’d wanted to ask.

, Perhaps even more than seeking to glean information and advice from an informational meeting, you’re trying to make a positive impression on your interviewee. You want to give your contact a brief summary of who you are, what makes you unique, and what you’re interested in. This will make it more likely that they’ll remember you later on if a relevant vacancy at their firm opens up or they meet someone who could be useful to you.In order to do this effectively, jot down a paragraph or a list of points about yourself that you can mention at an appropriate time during the meeting. This will help make your impression more memorable, as well as prepare you with answers to any questions your interviewee poses to you.

, One of the most important things you should do at an informational meeting is express interest in the person’s advice and expertise. You can do this by coming prepared with pen and paper and taking notes during the meeting, as well as having an updated resume handy in case the person asks for it. These preparatory measures indicate that you’re serious about the meeting at hand, respectful of the other’s expertise, and professional about handling and processing new information., You probably don’t need to wear a business suit—unless you’re meeting the contact at their formal, corporate office—to an informational interview, but you should wear something smart and put-together in any case. A sleek day-dress or well-pressed button-up and trousers will signal to your interviewee that you’ve got your life together and that you care about making a good impression.Avoid jeans, t-shirts, and scuffed sneakers in particular, as these garments can make it seem like you didn’t even bother to interrupt your normal routine when getting ready to meet the contact.

In anticipation of a membership meeting, check your association's By-Laws, review the state statutes concerning membership meetings.,
Any committee which will be participating and or helping to run the meeting should be formed and or informed of their specific duties.,
Begin your preparation now in order to insure for a well run annual members meeting.

",How to Prepare for a Members Meeting in a Community Association," The following are generally the reasons for member's meetings: annual member's meetings, election meetings, amendment meetings, meetings to waive reserves, meetings to waive audit requirements, some special assessment meetings, recall of directors, some meetings which require special expenditures and for any other purpose whereby the membership is required to vote or ratify an action taken by the Board of Directors. In many instances, many of the above mentioned purposes of a members meeting may be incorporated into one single meeting. The requirement for separate meetings is unnecessary.;
, In a homeowners association, the quorum requirement was lowered by statute to 30% of the total voting interests, unless the By-Laws allow for a lesser amount. This was instituted in order to increase the possibility of achieving a quorum at a members meeting. In condominium and cooperative associations a majority of the total voting interests is required to have a quorum.

, This meeting is usually the Annual Meeting for the association. The membership will elect the Directors for the coming year and address any other business that may be considered at this meeting. The annual meeting is usually a meeting at which the members will hear of the association's accomplishments for the past year and the anticipated challenges and projects for the coming year through officers and committee reports. It is a time and place whereby the members will be able to ask questions and participate in the meeting. In addition to the election of officers, the membership may also be considering amendments to the documents and other matters that require membership approval.

, These are usually quarterly or semi annual meetings, which are generally used to keep the membership apprised of the operations and management of the association. Other member's meetings that may be called from to time would be: a special member's meeting to consider a special assessment, an amendment to the documents, to expend funds over a certain amount as required by the documents, or as prescribed by the documents and by the state statues. The By-Laws will indicate who may call the special meeting. In some cases, the membership may be able to call a special meeting of the membership by petitioning the membership and then presenting the petition to the Board of Directors, The Board of Directors will then be required to hold the meeting. The special members meeting may be for the purpose of reconsidering a budget, an amendment to the documents, a recall of a Board Member or for any other matter that may addressed in the documents. The documents may contain special procedures for the special meeting. The condominium and cooperative statutes provides for certain procedures to be followed, in order for the special meeting to be valid. In all cases, the special members meeting allows for the membership to be involved in the discussions and decision (voting) making process.

, Also, the meeting notice, agenda and proxy form will all be for the same purpose. Any other purpose, business or motion that come before the membership would not be valid, as they were not for the stated purpose of that special meeting. The following is a suggested list of materials and supplies that would be required for an annual members meeting:

Meet with committees.,
Follow-up on any assigned tasks.,
Prepare remarks on items you wish to present to the board.,
Set an agenda.,
Review the minutes from the previous meeting.,
Ensure that any equipment needed is present and in working order.",How to Prepare for a Board Meeting," Every corporation, whether for-profit or not-for-profit, has a set of bylaws. The bylaws set forth how the corporation will run, how voting is conducted, who the officers are, along with other important information. Every board member should have a copy of the bylaws and bring it to each board meeting for reference.;
, If contracts or other documents will be discussed at a board meeting, even if the discussion will be brief, each person attending the board meeting should receive copies of the documents and review them before attending the meeting. Otherwise, time is wasted when board members are forced to review the document and attempt to engage in discussion of them on the spot. Giving board members the documents ahead of time allows them to carefully review the documents, make notes of issues they see with them, and come to the meeting prepared to discuss them. If, for example, the company is considering leasing a building, each board member should receive a copy of the proposed lease to review before the meeting at which the lease will be discussed.

, Board meetings are an excellent opportunity to share with the entire board the work that has been done by committees. If board meetings happen infrequently, the committee should meet soon before the board meeting to review work done and prepare remarks to report to the board.

, If you were assigned a task at a previous board meeting, make sure you follow up on that task before the next board meeting.

, If you have something to report on to the board, such as a potential contract with a vendor that you solicited, or feedback received from a customer, make a note of it to report to the board. Writing out remarks, or at least making note of the things you wish to discuss will make the meeting run smoothly and ensure that all the items you wish to discuss are discussed.

, Whoever is in charge of running the board meeting, usually but not necessarily the President, should circulate a proposed agenda to all board members approximately 1 week before the board meeting. The President may enlist the assistance of the Secretary or another board member for the circulating of the agenda. Email is especially useful for this task. In the email, ask the board members for any additional items they wish to discuss, and set an agenda that is manageable.


Set time-sensitive or most-pressing matters early in the agenda and, those items that can wait for the next meeting -- should this meeting run long -- toward the bottom of the agenda. Set forth the topics in a logical order so that you are not jumping around to different items on the agenda. If your meetings are generally an hour or two in length, try to plan the agenda accordingly. If there are a number of pressing matters that must be discussed, communicate to the board early on that this meeting will take longer than other meetings so that they can plan to stay longer.
Once the agenda is set, send it to the board members via email so that they have a finalized copy. Additionally, the Secretary should print copies to distribute at the meeting, and to file in the corporate book.

, This typically occurs at the beginning of the board meeting, where the Secretary will read the minutes aloud to the board. It also is part of your preparation for the meeting. Recalling what was discussed at the previous meeting helps give context to the new items on the meeting agenda. It can also help you remember any tasks that were assigned to you at the previous meeting.

, If your board allows members that cannot attend the meeting in person to be present via conference call, be sure that you have the proper equipment in place so that everyone can hear each other. Make test calls before the meeting to ensure that your equipment works. Make sure any other equipment to be used, such as a projector or computer, is at the meeting and is set up in advance.

Keep up the good habits.",How to Prepare for a Board of Directors Meeting," There is a tremendous amount of preparation needed to run a productive and informative meeting. Unfortunately, most Board Members have limited time in which to prepare for the task of preparing for a Board of Directors Meeting. This article will provide an outline and checklist for Boards, Committees and Managers to follow in order to prepare and hold informative and productive Board Meetings.;
, In most cases, there are at least three (3) key people involved with the preparation of the Board Meeting: the President, the Secretary and the Property Manager, if any. A week prior to the meeting, the participants should confirm the Agenda items with all Directors and Committee persons. The designated person should confirm the location and time of the meeting. The Meeting Notice and Agenda should be printed and distributed to all of the participants.

, Three to four days before the meeting, the designated person should post the Meeting Notice and Agenda at the designated area on site for the Association's Notices. The person in charge should then collect and distribute the Board Member's Meeting packets which will include, but not be limited to, the following:


Meeting Agenda
Notice of Meeting
Minutes of Previous Meeting
President's Report
Treasurer's Report
Manager's Report
Committee Reports
Information Related to Old Business

, On the day of the meeting, the person in charge should print additional Meeting Agendas and Manager's Reports for any Members who may attend. In addition, have extra Board Member packets available in case there are Directors who do not bring theirs to the Meeting. Check to see if the tape recorder is working. Have extra batteries, pens, paper and miscellaneous supplies on hand. Bring the Official Minutes Book, recorded Governing Documents and copies of all of the prior month's correspondence to the meeting.

, Someone should be designated (usually the Chairperson of the Meeting) to give reports for absent Officers and Committees. In addition, it would be wise to have a current financial statement, delinquent owner list and a copy of the current State Statutes, governing your type of association on hand, in case there are any questions of this nature.

, The day after the meeting, the person in charge should remove the Meeting Notices and Agendas from the bulletin Boards. Make all changes, additions and deletions to the previous month's approved Minutes. Make a draft of the current meeting Minutes while they are fresh in your mind. Distribute this to key people on the Board for their changes and additions. Then, these changes should be ready for the next meeting. At this time, arrange for the next month's meeting location and time.

, With this outline and schedule, each Board of Directors Meeting should be easy to prepare and schedule for and the end result should be productive meetings for the Board Members and be an informative meetings for the Owner Members who attend. Depending on the association, this outline can be reduced or expanded for size and complexity of the actual meetings. Always, allow for or make a part of the Agenda which encourages owner participation. Limit the time for any questions or comments. The Board does not have to make any decisions at that time (as that particular question or comment was not specifically on the Agenda) and it can then be made a part of the next scheduled meeting, if important or not. In all cases, use an outline and schedule from month to month in order to insure well run meetings. After awhile, you should begin to see more owners attending and participating.

If you're certain that you want to become an illustrator, you may want to look into going to an art school. Learning from professional artists is an invaluable experience. Your work will be critiqued, which will give you a chance to hone your skills and develop as an artist.


Take courses in drawing, painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, and art history, as well as any specialized courses that interest you. Learn as much as you can about as many mediums as possible before you settle on a favorite to focus on.
You'll learn more if you're open to feedback. Take critiques with a grain of salt, but don't entirely dismiss them over hurt pride. The point of critiques is to help you improve as an artist, and without them you wouldn't be getting your tuition money's worth.
If art school or college isn't an option, find other ways to gain an art education. Take art courses at your local community college, seek out an apprenticeship with a local artist, or try to land an internship at a museum or studio. You may also take instruction from books, online tutorials and other resources.;
, Most modern illustrators have a strong background in graphic design. Even if you don't create your art online, you'll still need to know how to use software to format it according to the specifications required by the client. Get familiar with the following graphic design software:


Adobe Photoshop. This is considered the industry standard for photo manipulation, which is often a part of illustration projects.
Adobe InDesign and Illustrator. These programs are used for manipulating images and laying them out with text.
Corel Painter. This is the industry standard for digital painting and drawing.

, While many illustrators today work with computer programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator or Freehand, there is still a market for more traditional media such as pen, pencil, watercolor, oil paint, chalk, wood and linoleum cuts and other non-computer methods, depending on the subject matter you choose to illustrate.


While you won't be equally good in everything, it helps to have some sketching skill with pen and pencil as well as more labor-intensive media so you can communicate your ideas of the finished artwork to others.
Illustrating books, magazines, and other media is often a collaborative effort. You'll need to be able to factor in outside opinions and have the ability to use a broad range of techniques to achieve the effect that a client desires.

, Technical illustrators tend to work with graphs and charts, illustrators for children's books are more likely to draw people and animals, and commercial illustrators may be called upon to draw a number of different things. What you most like to draw will determine your career path as an illustrator.

, Many illustrators are capable of drawing a beautiful, life-like portrait or image based on a text. What makes your illustration different? The world of illustration is quite competitive, so it's important to have a signature style that stands out from the rest. Eventually you'll develop a reputation for making illustrations of a certain type, and clients who want that style will commission work from you.


A personal style can convey a certain mood. The work of Jordin Isip, for example, portrays expressionless figures often standing alone or apart from other figures. Publishers and companies seeking to illustrate text that is similar in tone know what to expect when they contact Isip.
Your presentation of ideas can factor into your personal style. Glenn Jones is known for making simple concepts seem unique and catchy.
You may want to specialize in a certain type of content. Jessica Hische works with text to create book covers, fonts and websites.

, When you're just starting out, any experience provides a welcome addition to your portfolio, even if you don't get paid for it. Find creative ways to collaborate with people so you can start getting your work out there.


If you have a friend who is a writer, illustrate her story and create a cover.
Work with musicians on album cover materials.
Design flyers and postcards for art galleries, book stores, coffee shops, and other local businesses.

, It's important to have a professional-looking website to showcase your work. It's easier to send people a link to a website than it is to mail them printed copies of your work. Clients will expect to be able to quickly access your work online, and with so many other illustrators competing for jobs, you don't want to keep them waiting.


The look of the website should match your signature style. Take as much care with the banner, font, background, and other website components as you would with any other work of art.
Your portfolio should include examples of each medium in which you work and may also show some of your illustrations progressing from individual to final form.
Your URL should be either your name or the name of your business, with separate URLs for each page, and ideally separate URLs for each piece so that an art director can forward it on to the editor of the publication for which you may be working.
Be sure to include your contact information and a short biography of your life as an artist.

, You can find this information by looking for art directors' names on the mastheads of magazines available at either your local library or bookstore, consulting reference books such as The Artist's and Graphic Designer's Market or the Thomas Register, or through web sites such as the Graphic Artist's Guild. You should also develop the habit of looking at such things as posters, murals, restaurant menus, comic books and other items that you work might be suitable for, depending on the kind of illustration work you do.

, Your list should focus on primarily on the subjects you most like to draw. For example, if you prefer to draw animals, your list should include magazines about animals and magazines for children, and other publications likely to use such drawings. If you have a large list, break your list down into groups of 5 or 10.

, Target your samples to the publications or employers you've identified as the most likely to need your kind of work. Choose one particular style of rendering your subject matter and stick to that; don't send both a cartoonish lion and a realistic lion to the same publication. (You can of course send one style to one publication and the other to another, provided you send each publication a style appropriate to its needs.)

, A conference committee makes all the decisions for the conference, and having more than one person ensures that you have enough perspectives to make decisions on important issues and that you have enough people to actually pull off the details.


You will need a conference coordinator, who is the point person for all the major decisions and who will end up giving the most time to pulling everything together.You can also hire an event planner if you have a big enough budget, and spare yourself the headache.
If this conference is repeat of one that has been held before, try to get the previous year's coordinator on the committee. If he or she cannot participate, at least ask for any materials from the previous year to help streamline planning.

, You will need to clearly define what you hope to accomplish with this conference because this will shape the rest of your decisions. Knowing what you want to convey and to who before you begin any other conference organizing eases the stress of moving forward.


If you have never planned a conference, it is wise to stick to a small and relatively straightforward plan the first time you attempt it. Practically speaking, that means a conference of one or two days at the most, with no more than 250 to 300 people., Although you may not be able to choose the specific date and location without more planning, it's important that you have a good idea of how much time you have to plan.


There are likely a lot of constraints on the date that you choose owing to your particular situation, but in general, conferences are usually held during particular times of the year and particular days of the week. In Europe, for example, conferences are usually held between March and June or between September and November; any other time and people are less likely to show up. Similarly, conferences tend to be held from Thursday to Friday or Monday to Tuesday.Find out what the industry norms are in your area before choosing the month and days.
The length of a conference depends on how many people you think will be participating, and what all needs to be accomplished at a conference. For a conference of 250-300 people, plan for about two full days.In general, you should only attempt to organize a conference in your own city, and the city needs to have access to a nearby airport, hotels, and an acceptable choice of venues. It's best, too, if the city is a large metropolitan area that people would want to visit anyhow; people on the fence about attending a conference are more likely to go if it is in a tourist destination., This will help when you begin publicizing, but also helps in planning since you can keep your materials consistent and start building a social media presence for the conference.


Choose a name that hints at the goal and/or audience of the conference itself. Look up names of similar conferences to get ideas, but be sure yours is original., There is no way that you can do anything else without knowing how much money you have to spend overall, and then breaking that down into allocations such as conference venue, materials and speakers' fees. Stick to your budget, and if you delegate responsibilities, make sure your assistants are adhering to their monetary limits as well.


The budget might be influenced by whether or not you want to try to recruit sponsors for your event. Sponsors pay a fee to support the conference, but also get a say in the content of the conference itself, typically including hosting presentations or panels with their own speakers and branding conference materials with their logos. On the plus side, a sponsor pays you up front, which gives you more money to work with as you plan. Sponsors might include local industry leaders or philanthropists, depending on your topic., Some conferences are free to participants, and others charge exorbitant fees. There are several factors to consider when setting the ticket price and determining how to begin selling tickets:


What are the fees associated with conference planning? If it is a small, local conference with little or no fees, it might make sense to not charge people for attending. Another option is to allow people who present to attend free, while others pay a small fee to cover conference costs.
Multi-day conferences or those that serve meals typically charge registration fees, which can vary from $30 to several hundred in the United States.Many conferences use a sliding pay scale for people in different stages of their careers. For example, academic conferences typically charge a lower fee for students than for faculty, and also charge a lower fee for members of the sponsoring association than for the general public.

, When scouting locations, keep in mind the number of participants, the convenience of the location, parking and proximity to public transportation, airports and hotels. Your goal in finding a place to hold the conference should be making it as easy as possible for participants to attend.


Check out whether your city has a convention center or hotel with convention rooms. For small conferences, you can often rent a local church or community center.

, If you have chosen a venue that is known for holding conferences, then tap into this invaluable resource. This is what the staff does every day and should be able to answer any questions or concern and provide advice when needed.


Some venues even have an event planner on staff who can handle many of the remaining details of your conference. Even if the planner charges a fee, it may be worth it to prevent this from becoming your own full time job for the next few weeks.

, When you organize a conference, you need to remember that participants will not want to sit all day without eating a decent meal, and many won't know what is available in the area. Figure out if you will be hiring a catering service to bring in breakfast, lunch and snacks or if the conference venue you have chosen will provide food service.


Keep in mind that many people have dietary restrictions, allergies, and preferences that can make planning meals rather difficult. If you choose an experienced caterer, they can create options for vegetarian, nut-free, gluten free, kosher, or other meal preferences.

, After you have gotten through the bulk of your conference organizing, don't leave anything to chance by walking in with the rest of the participants when the conference is set to begin.


Go to the conference venue and meet with the staff the day before to be certain that everything is in place and to take care of any last minute details.

, You already know the title of the conference and have a general idea of the topics. But now you have to decide how it will actually play out. Conferences come in many types, and different industries take different approaches. If you are unsure how to proceed, consider going with a common conference format:


Begin with a keynote or opening address. This is usually a speech or presentation given by a huge name in the industry or field -- whoever happens to be the most well-known speaker you can convince to come. The keynote can take place in the evening, and then end with a dinner, or it can take place first thing in the morning on the first day of the conference.
The remaining day or days of the conference should be divided into shorter sessions. The actual content of sessions is usually determined by who is planning to attend (participants will submit proposals), but you can also plan for workshops, film screenings, or other formats that you know you want to include. Depending on how many people are attending, you can one session happening at one time (which is called ""plenary"") or you can have several sessions running concurrently (called ""breakout groups"") so that participants have a choice of what to attend.End the conference on a high note, with a motivational speaker or a challenge to the audience.

, These will vary depending on industry standards, but you might consider lectures, works-in-progress presentations, workshops, policy updates or state-of-the-field addresses, interactive sessions, or open-floor poster presentations.


The type of sessions you expect to have will influence how you publicize the conference, so decide early what type of content will be most meaningful to your target audience.
Sessions can range from 45 minutes to three hours each, depending on the number of presentations and the content., Figuring out how to fit other important events into your conference schedule is vital for a successful event.


You can also schedule time for organizational business such as business meetings or awards.
You can include catered meals or ask attendees to bring a brown-bag meal (generally, only choose the last option if you are not charging a fee for attendance; otherwise, people will expect their registration fees to cover at least one meal). You can also take a break and let attendees get lunch at nearby establishments, if your venue is in town.
Decide if your attendees are likely to want any type of entertainment, such as tours of the local area, a night at a comedy club, or a film or theater performance. In some cities and some industries, these are expected, but in others they might seem out of place.

, There are many kinds of conferences, including academic, religious, and industry, and each of these types differs in types of participants. You need to be sure there is enough interest in the segment you are targeting before proceeding with planning.


If you are only targeting a small group, such as employees of your company or members of your church, you do not have to take as many steps to publicize the conference. A simple email or two, along with a mention in the newsletter and/or at administrative meetings should be enough to publicize the conference.

, You need a big headliner or keynote speaker to help convince other people in the industry.


Once you have confirmation that big names in the field will participate, you can include this information in your conference materials, such as your calls for participants.

, These days it is almost mandatory to have a digital presence for a successful conference. Find an available URL that includes the conference name or a logical derivative of it, so that it will be easy to find. Include all the important information about the conference at the website, and be sure to list the URL on all print materials and advertisements related to the conference.


On the website, be sure to include the date, time, and address of the conference venue, and names of any prominent speakers. You can also include information about transportation, lodging, area attractions, and you can attach the conference schedule when it is available, if desired.
You can also update the website with a link to register when you are ready to open up registration.

, Start early (up to a year in advance) so that presenters can begin submitting proposals for session ideas. Depending on the size of your conference and your target audience, your approach will differ. Keep in mind where members of your target audience get their information about this industry or group. These might include:Social media, such as the sponsoring organization's Facebook page and Twitter feed
Listservs and e-mail contact lists
Trade blogs, magazines, newsletters, or journals
Posters, flyers, or other announcements sent to relevant groups, organizations, or businesses

, In your advertising materials, you should also include a ""Call for Participants"" or a ""Call for Proposals"" asking for individuals or groups to submit paper, panel, or workshop proposals.


Depending on your industry, you can ask for a specific length of the proposal. In academia, smaller conferences usually ask for an abstract of a few hundred words; larger conferences ask for entire manuscripts.

, It’s a good idea to have a way for participants to register before the conference, even months in advance, to give you an idea of how many people will show up.


Set up a registration website that is linked to the conference website. There are several ways to do this using existing services if you do not have the technical skills to create your own. For example, you can pay a fee to use the services of RegOnline, a company that hosts online registrations for events, compiles them, and sends them to you in a user-friendly way.
You can also allow participants to call or fax in their registrations if you have a way to process payment by credit card.
If you do not want to do an online or telephone method, create a registration form and upload it to your website as a PDF, then have participants print it and fill it out and mail it, along with a check, to your business address.
To encourage early registration, offer a discounted rate for those who register a month or more in advance, a slightly higher fee for waiting to register in the month prior to the conference, and a slightly higher fee for at-the-door registrations.
