Make sure that you have all the papers needed.,
Form your own view of the possible directions of the meeting.,
Remain calm.,
Know the rules governing the meeting.,
Take a deep breath before you enter the room.,
Be honest.,
Trust in your abilities.",How to Overcome Nerves As a First Time Chairperson," Ask the secretary and any other relevant members to provide you with the right papers. It is also prudent to read the principle materials that will be discussed at the meeting to avoid any feelings of ambush or uncertainty as to what is being discussed.;
, In the main, a chairperson is viewed as a neutral party who is expected to steer the meeting and take account of all viewpoints there. This doesn't necessarily mean that you cannot show your colors (that depends on the constitution or nature of the group being chaired) but it does place an onus on you to show respect for all viewpoints and to expect that from all participants. If you have worked out in advance what possible issues and concerns might be, along with any potential for volatile situations, you will be well-prepared for whatever may arise. Plan in advance how you will deal with each possible scenario.

, All eyes are generally not on you for content - eyes will be on you for leadership and summarizing of viewpoints. This means you need to note the views, directions and options that arise during the meeting so that you can reflect the discussion back to the group and present decisions to be voted on as needed. If you are a chairperson in the position of being able to influence a meeting's outcome through direct voting or taking the final decision on meeting items, then your having noted everyone's views and summarization becomes even more important as a means by which you justify your decisions.

, You should read through the rules relating to the meeting. Ask questions of office-bearers before attending the meeting so that you are not uncertain about things. Remember this if you remember nothing else - ""the rules are your friends"". They are the tools by which you can keep order in the meeting, direct members back to the relevant points of discussion and support your casting vote. The rules will help you to be a more effective chairperson.

, It helps to arrive a few minutes early to set up your papers and to greet meeting participants. If you don't know their names, have a visual diagram of who is sitting where by name that you can refer to. Keep a small notepad and favorite pen or pencil to write down salient points, questions and summarizations. Make sure that your papers are all in order before commencing the meeting.

, People are generally forgiving if you make it clear you are a novice. If you don't know something, you can say that you will take it on notice and get back, or you can open the question to the meeting group. Or, you can admit that you don't know as you are still learning and that you place yourself at the grace of those around you to assist in responding. This last action will, of course, depend on the context of the meeting and may not be appropriate in some environments where it is important to convey a sense of control. But in the main, it is better to be open and transparent about your limitations than to perform an action that causes difficulties for the project, group or process in the long-run.

, As stated at the outset, it is important to trust yourself. You are in this role because others believe that you can perform it. Everyone expects a learning curve and provided you accept that your meeting members have faith in you, it is likely you will quickly grow to love the role.

Apply for an opening at a school district.,
Master your training.,
Dress appropriately.,
Learn to use proper personal protective equipment (PPE).,
Practice good hygiene.,
Know your keys.,
Become a purveyor of district knowledge.,
Portray a positive image.",How to Be a School Custodian," Some school districts may always be accepting applications, some may begin accepting them as soon as a position becomes available.

Visit the central office location of the district to obtain an application if an online application is not available.
Generally speaking, no special qualifications other than a high school diploma are required. However, previous commercial cleaning or maintenance experience may make you a more competitive candidate if jobs are scarce.
You may be required to pay and obtain clearances and medical evaluations as well as vaccination history in order to work for a school district. This information should be included with the application. Plan on not being reimbursed for these expenses.
In some districts, only substitute custodians will be considered for a full-time or part-time position, so you may need to apply as a substitute custodian first. A substitute custodian only fulfills the role of an absent custodian and does not get guaranteed hours and may be dismissed at any time for any reason even if the full-time custodians are unionized and covered under a bargaining agreement.;
, Fortunately, many good districts will train their new custodial staff to inform them of their standards, equipment, and other essential information, but not all are so generous. You may be forced to learn on the job by asking for help from other custodians.

Ask as many questions as you need. It's better to get things right from the start than having to correct them later when you find out you were doing something wrong.
Learn where supplies are kept, where to get your keys, the layout of the school building and grounds, and the office of your immediate supervisor.
Get to know the other custodial staff as they'll be your allies as you learn the ropes in your new job. Custodial work is not just picking up a spray cleaner and wiping stuff down: there is specialized equipment to use and procedures to follow. There is a right way to do just about everything, although as you gain more experience you will be able to use your own discretion about what to do and when.

, Your district may prescribe a specific uniform for you to wear, but if they don't, you'll have to find your own professional attire that suits the demands of the job.

Generally speaking, long jeans or slacks are required. Shorts might not be permitted during the school year.
Your clothing should be clean and regularly laundered. You don't want to spread dirt and contamination around when you're supposed to be the one preventing that from happening.
Wear a work shirt or T-shirt, depending on your style, the expectations of the district, and your personal comfort.
Affix your ID badge to clothing in a manner that is prominently visible to students and staff in the building.
Affix your keys on a keychain to your belt or belt loops. You will be opening doors a lot. A retractable key holder will be immensely helpful so you do not have to constantly remove your keys from your belt. As a bonus, you won't easily lose your keys.
Wear non-slip work footwear or work boots and heavy duty insoles. Your feet will thank you for it since you will be using them so much.

, Although some schools might be lax on safety standards for custodial staff, this does not mean you shouldn't be practicing it. Even if other custodians aren't using it, doesn't mean you shouldn't!. Commercial cleaning chemicals are not friendly to your eyes and skin so you need to protect them appropriately. PPE should be supplied by your district, so ask your supervisor where it is.

Wear appropriately sized gloves when working with any chemicals that may touch your hands, such as when wiping surfaces or using a sponge.
Wear goggles when working with chemicals and the risk of splashing occurs, such as when mopping, cleaning sinks and urinals, and using mist spraying.
Wear a mouth mask when toxic vapors or dust is present, such as when stripping, finishing, or burnishing a floor, or using chemicals in a room with little ventilation.

, You should be cleaner than the building itself so that you avoid bringing more germs and dirt into it than you take out. Take it upon yourself to avoid creating more mess than you clean up.

Wash your hands every time you take a break or meal.
Shower daily to remove dust, chemical residue, and germs.
Keep your shoes clean so you don't track mud into the school. You'll just be creating more work for yourself or coworkers.
Use a clean rag every time you switch activities and change mop water after every room you mop.
At the end of your shift, put your tools and chemicals in storage. Don't leave dirty rags or buckets of water sitting around, deal with them before you go home. No one wants a bad whiff of something coming from the custodial closet.
Keep your own work area clean, whether this is your closet where you keep supplies and carts or your cart itself. Don't leave trash sitting, take it to the dumpster.

, You'll be using them a lot, and not having to shuffle through all of them to find the one you're looking for will save you a lot of time. Memorize them by reading the code on the back (if present) to identify what doors they open. You probably have a master key for the building you work in, so find a way to distinguish that one from all of the others (like light switches, paper product dispensers, chemical dispensers, electrical panels, and padlocks), Know what's going on in your building and who's supposed to be where. Not only does your awareness help the district with preventing unauthorized individuals in the building, your vast knowledge can help students, staff, and parents who need help getting to where they need to be. Learn as many people's names as you can - this will make the school environment feel like your home and you will instinctively know when something is not right. If you are able, consider attending your school board's meetings as a member of the public to be informed of changes that may impact you, the people you work with, or activities in your building, especially as it pertains to buildings and grounds., Custodians move around the building a lot. This means your face may be seen by more people than any other individuals. As a result, your mood is contagious. A happy custodian makes others happy. When you cheerfully perform your duties, others feel the building and its users are in good hands."

Find a local taxidermist and ask questions.,
Learn more about your chosen field.,
Complete a taxidermy program.,
Get a state license and/or federal permit.,
Take a course on tanning.,
Contact a wildlife professionals.,
Develop a specialization.,
Join a professional organization.,
Look for business opportunities.,
Promote your work.",How to Be a Taxidermist," The oldest and in some ways most straight forward way to learn the trade is to study with a practiced hand. Seek out a local taxidermist. You will need to acquire a lot of artistic and technical skill – as a taxidermist you must know how to properly prepare an animal carcass, including tanning the skin, but you must also have an eye for anatomy and movement in order to make life-like mounts.


Watch, ask questions, and learn. If he is open to the idea, try to join the taxidermist as an apprentice. If he specializes in certain types of mounts – fish, for example – ask him for referrals to specialists in other areas and begin to network while learning how to craft a variety of mounts.;
, You will quickly find that taxidermy can be hard, dirty, and squeamish work. Read up about the field and observe your mentor. Use this early time to decide whether, with your insider’s knowledge, you still want to commit yourself to the profession. As a taxidermist you will first have to make precise measurements of the animal carcass. This way you will be able to recreate an accurate and realistic mount for the specimen. The carcass must then be preserved until you are ready to prepare it, usually in a freezer.


Making the mount comes next. Depending on the animal, you will have to prepare a plaster cast or perhaps buy a premade form. The mount serves as the new “body” for the specimen’s skin and must be the right size.
Next skin the carcass, cutting away the hide. Usually this is done without opening the body cavity and without seeing internal organs. However, you must then scrape away all of the excess flesh and fat from the hide.Once you have skinned the carcass, you have to tan the skin. There are several methods. Some use chemicals like salt and alkaline solutions (at one time, urine was the preferred choice), while others use the animal’s cooked brain, which contains oils that will naturally tan the skin. The latter is called “braining” or “brain tanning.” All methods are labor-intensive.After tanning, you can finally “dress” the mount by stuffing your form into the skin. Be careful to smooth out any irregularities before sewing it up. Put final touches on the mount by recreating things like habitat and flora.

, You won’t need a college degree to become a taxidermist. However, you will still need to have many hours of training and on-the-job experience. Some trade schools and colleges offer intensive two-year programs in taxidermy, which can be an alternative to a long apprenticeship. The typical trade program will train you how to use tools and chemicals to treat carcasses, make mounts, construct artificial habitat, and restore color, among other things.Some professionals recommend taking an art class or two. A course in anatomy may also prove useful. After all, you will need to work on physiology and your artistic skills as a taxidermist.Weigh the benefits before you enroll. Graduates of taxidermy programs can begin working professionally and build a substantial portfolio while still in training. However, the cost can be more than $20,000 per year, too much according to some. An apprenticeship offers many of the same advantages but for much less., Be aware that most states and countries require you to hold a license in order to mount dead game animals like birds, rodents, fish, and deer. Some jurisdictions also require different licenses for specific animals, and even your clients may need permits to possess the animal carcass. Read up on local laws.


For example, to practice taxidermy in the state of Michigan, you need a state permit that allows you to possess animal carcasses, buy specific parts like antlers, skulls, and horns, and sell mounted specimens. The permit costs $100 and is valid for three years.In addition, you need a federal taxidermy permit to work with migratory bird specimens.Because it varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, taxidermy law is complicated. Consult a lawyer if you are unsure. You will need to be in full compliance to avoid fines.

, Tanning is an essential part of taxidermy. Tanning the animal skin turns it into leather, preserving it from deterioration and rot.Not all taxidermists do their own tanning. Some choose to outsource this work to commercial tanneries. However, there are good reasons to learn how to self-tan skins. For example, the number of taxidermists has risen in recent years while the number of commercial tanneries has not, creating, at times, backlogs and delays.Self-tanning will also reduce your overhead costs if you own your own business, and allow you to handle tanning emergencies in-shop.


Some institutions offer specialized courses in tanning.You can also find comprehensive taxidermy courses that offer tanning in the general curriculum. Keep this in mind if you want to attend a program., Reach out to wildlife professionals and learn about the types of animals that will generate the most demand in your area. Do you live in the north woods of Minnesota? Chances are that you could find business mounting large game animals like deer, elk, or bear.In the southwest United States you might find interest in species like pronghorn antelope, cougar, or bighorn sheep.There are also opportunities in all areas for game fish and fowl.


Once you’ve identified animals, you will need a thorough understanding of their habitat and vegetation to effectively produce artistic dioramas. You may even want to take a habitat course for taxidermists, which includes instruction on how to make artificial rock molds and install large dioramas.

, Finding a niche market is a way to establish a clientele as a taxidermist. You may find that you favor certain mounts over others. Perhaps you especially enjoy recreating the dynamism and movement of stream fish like trout, or game birds like ducks. There is also a specialized market for pets: bereaved owners who want to have their late pet cats, dogs, or birds preserved for all time.As odd as it may seem, a niche like pet taxidermy could prove to be lucrative for your taxidermy business., Joining a regional or national body like the National Taxidermists’ Association (NTA) is a good way to network with taxidermists and hunters of every stripe, and can give you a feel for what skills will best serve clients in your area. Such groups offer benefits, too. For example, NTA members are eligible for scholarships, get free access to the group’s annual conferences, and can earn the group’s voluntary certification.


Professional certification is not mandatory but can improve your credentials and business opportunities. Think of it as a perk of membership.Professional groups also lobby governments and help to shape hunting and taxidermy law. A membership will keep you apprised of any changes in local regulations.

, Taxidermy is a competitive job. Keep your options open! You may want above all to have your own shop and small business. There are other ways to make a living in the field, however. Some private institutions and museums employ in-house taxidermists to make or repair animal mounts in dioramas, like the Smithsonian or the Natural History Museum in London, for example, though such jobs are few and far between.There are jobs to be found with larger, high-volume firms or in taxidermy instruction programs., Many taxidermists do end up on their own. In that case, you will have to be resourceful and work extra hard to promote and run your business. As a small business owner, you will need financial and marketing knowhow in addition to your skills in taxidermy. Try taking a course in business management, if you can, to learn more about bookkeeping, basic business law, sales, and advertising. Computer literacy will come in handy for communication with clients, creating a business website, and advertising.


Try old fashioned door-to-door self-promotion, as well. Look for locations nearby where you can display your work, like tackle shops, fishing stores, sporting goods stores, Kmart, Walmart – any place that will accept them. Make sure to have tags identifying the mounts as yours, with your business telephone, address, and website clearly visible. Even if they decline, ask to leave business cards and price lists for prospective clients."

Wedding Planning Courses: By far the easiest and most popular way to become a wedding planner is to undertake a decent wedding planning course and set up in business on your own.,
That is not to say vacancies do not arise within wedding planning companies.,
Take heed-as in any industry, the route of self-employment is not for the faint hearted and a diverse set of skills are required in order to succeed in running your own business.,
A selection of additional useful attributes is below, in no particular order.",How to Be a Wedding Planner (Without Having to Find a Job)1," This is because more than 90% of wedding consultancies in the UK are small 1 or 2 man bands who have little need for an extra pair of hands.;
, Only that competition is fierce for the positions that do crop up and as we have seen, wedding experience is practically a prerequisite if you are to land such a coveted job.

, As a wedding planner you must possess first rate administrative, organisational and planning skills, alongside the ability to multi-task effectively. Exceptional research and sourcing skills are also essential.

, You will see that many of them are skills that are transferable from other careers and most people possess the majority of them, to varying degrees.

"
"
Research is key.,
Business skills - setting up and managing a business on a daily basis; dealing with accounts, the bank and HMRC for instance.

,

Keep to the dress code.,
Be hygienic.,
Know your products.,
Know how to handle deli equipment.,
Be friendly.,
Engage the customer.,
Maintain a clean work space.",How to Be a Great Deli Clerk," Before even setting foot behind the deli counter, you have to look the part of a deli clerk. Depending on your place of employment, you may have a dress code. For most delis you must wear the following:


Safety shoes- these shoes are designed to follow health codes and prevent slipping in the work place.
Smock- The smock is worn to avoid the products from touching your clothes. This prevents contamination of the products.
Hair net- Unless you are bald, you should always wear a hair net while working. This prevents hair from coming into contact with products.;
, Hygiene is very important in the food industry. You must maintain a tidy appearance. Make sure that you and your clothes are clean before arriving to work. Once your entire uniform on, wash your hands. Always wash your hands before and after wearing latex gloves. You must wear latex gloves at all times when handling your products.

, To be a successful deli clerk you must know what you are selling. Customers will ask questions about products. You need to be familiar with the items so that you can give your customers accurate information on the food you are trying to sell. There are many ways to gain information on products.


Read labels. Try to remember which products have low salt, are gluten free, and have the least amount of preservatives. Customers tend to ask these questions, so be prepared.
Try the products yourself. The best way to gain knowledge on a product is for you to try it yourself. Always ask a manager before taking a sample of anything.
Ask co-workers/managers about different products. Having different opinions on products can take away your bias on something.
Talk to your customers about their opinion. By asking customers their reaction to different products, you can share their opinions with other customers.

, Do not use the equipment until you are taught how to use it safely. Slicers are dangerous machines. If you do not know how to properly use the machine do not touch it. Have a manager or experienced co-worker show you how to safely use a slicer. Even after having experience with a slicer always be careful.

, Once you are familiar with products and equipment it is time to serve your customers. Always be friendly with your customers. Smile and greet your customer before asking what they would like. Occasionally you will encounter a rude customer. You must make sure to maintain a friendly demeanor.

,


When taking care of a customer, always ask how they prefer their product sliced. Most customers will tell you thin, thick, or in the middle. Occasionally you will be asked to chip (shred into a fine dust-like form) meat. This involves opening the slicer to its smallest opening and shredding the meat.
Ask the customer if the first slice looks good. By showing your customer the first slice they will be able to judge if you are preparing their food correctly.
Offer the customer the first slice as a sample. This way the customer can make sure they definitely like the product before buying it.
Ask what else you can get for them. Never assume that the customer is done with ordering. After slicing each product, ask what else you can get for them. Once they tell you they are done, make sure to thank them for shopping and ask them to come again.

, Whenever you have a chance, make sure that your workplace is clean.


Between customers, make sure that your slicers are clean. To clean a slicer, use a clean cloth and a Food and Drug Administration approved disinfectant.
You also need to make sure that your gloves are clean. If you handle a messy meat (such as roast beef or Virginia ham) make sure to change your gloves. Remember to wash your hands in between changing gloves.
When you have a break between customers, sweep the floor, disinfect counter tops, and straighten up so that your workplace is appealing to the eye and follows all health codes.

To connect with teens it's critical to know what they think about and, more importantly, what they care about.;
, Your best source for material is your own life. While times have changed, there are still themes that are universal and timeless. Teenagers worry about social acceptance, love and dating, avoiding embarrassment, relating to authority and making the transition from childhood to adulthood. Pull them into your presentation by sharing your experiences with these themes.

, They're scolded and lectured at all day long. You'll win more credibility through vulnerability and humility.

, Share messages you truly believe and avoid cliches. You're not one of them, so avoid talking or dressing like them unless that is a true expression of your sensibility.

, If there's an upcoming prom, a recent championship or anything else that's on the students' minds, knowing this in advance will allow you to connect your material to their lives.

, These are the adults who plan assemblies and bring in speakers.

, Schools have smaller budgets than companies. You're going to have to work a lot harder and a lot more to make a living at schools. If you're only in it for the money, the education market is not for you.

, Once a motivational speaker has spoken at a school, he can't come back for several years. But he can suggest another speaker. Or if a school calls a speaker and she's already booked, she can suggest someone else. You want these speakers to suggest you. The best way to cultivate these relationships is to find speaking opportunities for them. They'll want to return the favor.

, A good combination is a high school and feeder middle school. Offer both schools a discount if they share you on the same day. Offer additional discounts if they help you find other schools the days before and after.

, These can include local businesses and vendors who do business with the school. Also contact local service organizations such as Rotary and Kiwanis. These organizations already sponsor school-based clubs who may assist you in planning your event. Offer to do a free program at their breakfast meeting the day of the assembly.

, This is a great way to reinforce your message and get some exposure to working professionals. Try to schedule these for the evenings after you've done the assembly so students will tell their parents.

, If your presentation goes well, the principal and activities director should be able to connect you with their colleagues at other schools. Also ask them to write you a testimonial letter. This will be a great marketing tool.

, If you speak at a large conference, you'll be exposed to students and advisors from multiple schools.

Look for job listings.",How to Be a Chemist," There are many different fields of chemistry, and while they are all related to studying and performing experiments with chemical compounds, they are all unique. Some of the more common fields include the following:Materials chemists are responsible for researching and developing materials to create new products or improve existing ones.
Analytical chemists examine and classify various chemical compounds that can be used in new drugs. Also, they study the ways different chemicals react to each other.
Inorganic chemists investigate non-carbon compounds, such as electronic components, to develop new products.
Theoretical and physical chemists study things such as molecules, atoms and chemical reactions to develop different energy sources.
Medicinal chemists research chemicals and compounds used to create medications for people.
Organic chemists investigate the makeup of different carbon compounds. They then combine those different compounds to create new ones.
Macromolecular chemists study how molecules and atoms behave. Unlike physical and theoretical chemists, macromolecular chemists' work doesn't lead to new or improved energy sources.;
, With so many diverse career opportunities available in the field of chemistry, it is important to choose a specialty that appeals to your interests. The American Chemical Society provides lots of helpful information on the wide variety of careers that are available in chemistry.For all careers in chemistry, you should be highly organized and analytical, and you should love performing research and experiments.
You might be surprised by how many different fields of chemistry exist. If, for example, you have an interest in environmental conservation, you may consider looking into the field of green chemistry.. If you have an interest in helping to ensure that the world has clean drinking water, you may look into the field of water chemistry..

, Chemists work in many different kinds of environments, depending on the specifics of their jobs. Think about whether you would like to work in a laboratory, in an office, in a factory, in a classroom, or in the field.This may help you narrow your choices.


If possible, talk to people who currently hold a position that you think you might be interested in to learn more about the working conditions.

, Salaries also vary greatly for different careers within the field of chemistry. Once you have identified careers that might interest you, do some research into the average salaries and projected job growth for those specific fields. Comparing this information may help you decide between a few different career interests.The United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics provides salary information for a variety of different industries and geographic locations.
Checking job listings in your area might also give you some good insight into the types of chemist jobs available and how much they pay.

, Take as many science and math classes as you can in high school, including AP classes. This will help prepare you for more advanced studies in chemistry.


Maintain high grades in all your classes to gain a competitive edge for admissions to undergraduate and graduate programs.
Look for elective science classes that interest you, such as forensic science.

, The degree takes four years to complete and includes core courses such as organic chemistry and physical chemistry, as well as elective classes related to your interests and general education classes. You should be prepared to spend a lot of time in the laboratory learning about how to handle chemicals, conduct experiments, and interpret data.The American Chemical Society maintains a list of approved undergraduate programs that adhere to their strict educational requirements.
For most future chemists, a bachelor's degree in chemistry is the best first step. However, there are some career paths that require a slightly different degree. If, for example, you wish to teach chemistry to elementary, middle school, or high school students, you will need to obtain the proper credentials required by your state for a teaching license. If you wish to Become a Chemical Engineer, you may need a degree specifically in chemical engineering.
Some universities also offer undergraduate degrees in specific fields of chemistry, such as environmental chemistry.These more specialized degrees might not be necessary for your career, but they can certainly be helpful if you know what kind of chemist you want to be.
An undergraduate degree in chemistry will prepare you for an entry-level position in chemistry, as a research assistant or technician, for example. It can also prepare you for many other careers. Many chemistry students choose to attend medical, dental, veterinary, or law school after completing their undergraduate degrees. Careers in business are also popular., There is a lot of competition for well-paying chemist jobs, so a graduate degree will be very important if you want to advance in your field.The specific type of degree you need will depend on your precise career aspirations.


A master's degree in chemistry typically takes two or three years to complete, and may or may not require a thesis.
A doctorate degree in chemistry requires five or more years of study, and will require you to write a dissertation.
Graduate degrees typically give you the opportunity to focus on a sub-specialty, such as analytical chemistry or biochemistry.

, Make yourself more marketable to potential employers by getting as much experience as you can in your field of interest.


Complete a fellowship, work-study or internship during college.Look for volunteer opportunities that will give you unique experiences in your field of interest or a closely related field.

Obtain your high school diploma.,
Practice operating various pieces of electronic equipment.,
Volunteer at your local radio station.,
Attend broadcasting school.,
Understand that a board operator job is not glamorous.",How to Be a Radio Board Operator," You can learn many things during your high school years that will be beneficial to you as a radio board operator. Math classes help you calculate time measurements. Computer classes help you become skilled with new computer programs and software. Speech classes prepare you to speak on air, if given the opportunity.;
, A radio board has many buttons, switches and slides that control different functions, such as volume, playback, microphones and other aspects of radio. By learning to efficiently operate buttons on stereos, mp3 players, digital recording devices and other electronic equipment, you can become proficient in managing several devices at once. That will be part of your job while you are operating the board.

, Speak to the general manager or the program director and offer your services. Many small radio stations are looking for volunteers to help out with odd shifts. Even if the station isn't looking for a volunteer, you may choose to ask for a tour and a demonstration. This will help you learn about that particular station's board and what happens behind the scenes.

, Most broadcasting education programs take between 18 months and 2 years to complete. You learn to run a board, speak on air, create logs and master other duties related to radio broadcasting. A diploma from a broadcasting school shows a future employer that you are dedicated and have some radio board knowledge.

, Often, board operators perform mundane tasks, such as preparing logs for the next day, tracking transmitter readings and taking out the garbage. Board operators rarely get to hear their own voices on the air, nor do they participate in programming choices or ad spot creation. They may take phone calls and perform secretarial duties when needed.

Embody strategy.",How to Be a CEO," If you want to be a CEO, you need to perform well in school. Ideally, you should complete both an undergraduate and a graduate degree. Focus your studies in an area that will be relevant to the industry you hope to enter, but keep things general enough that you can be flexible if you don't snag your dream job right out of college.


Many CEOs complete an undergraduate degree first, work for several years as an employee, rise through the ranks, and then return to an MBA program to earn a graduate degree. You don't need to put off joining the workforce just because you don't have all the education you want yet.
The larger the company you're hoping to one day rise to the top of, the more important it is that you attend (and graduate from) a school that has some cachet attached to its name. Obviously, some CEOs never even graduated college, but by the numbers, your best chance is to have a prestigious name on your degree. Consider Ivy League schools, of course, but don't forget smaller liberal arts colleges with respected business programs, either.;
, Nothing helps a CEO make wise decisions for the company quite like a strong base of financial knowledge. While you can study and learn about finance and economics at any stage of your life, your college years are probably the best opportunity you'll ever get. If you aren't majoring in accounting, economics, or finance, take plenty of elective courses in those areas – even consider a minor.


Once you're a part of the workforce, take advantage of any and every opportunity your company offers to increase your financial knowledge with seminars, special classes, and other events. A great CEO never stops increasing, refreshing, or honing his or her knowledge.

, During college, attend business seminars and networking events whenever you can. Apply to internships anywhere that you can show off your leadership skills and willingness to work hard; keep applying until you snag one (or more). Volunteer your time to help with charitable and other events that will allow you to rub shoulders with other future business people. In short, act as though you're already climbing the corporate ladder before you even start.


Don't hesitate. It's never too early to start making the right impression on local business and civic leaders. You never know who might notice you and help smooth the way to your first real career job with a good reference or a kind word about you, when the time comes.

, As soon as you get a job based on your college qualifications (even if you're still in college at the time), treat it like you want to own the whole company. Employees who bring a sense of vitality and seriousness to their jobs are few and far between; be a company booster and a team player, and rest assured, you will be noticed. Accept extra tasks with zeal, and seek them out yourself whenever possible. Do everything you can to show your bosses that you're serious about advancing your professional life.


Do your utmost to get in touch with, and on friendly terms with, high-level executives in your business and wherever else you meet them during the course of your career. Observe the way they act and speak. You might even ask one to become a mentor for you. The worst that they can say is “no,” and executives tend to appreciate brashness over propriety anyway. An executive mentorship, if you can get it, is a powerful tool for fast-tracking your career.

, It's not talked about too often these days, but raw ambition is a very useful (some might even say vital) trait for a business leader to possess. A part of being ambitious and aggressive about advancing your career is being open to taking paths you weren't expecting to take. At the very least, stay open to the possibility of switching shifts or locations in order to secure an advancement. If you jump at the chance to be a manager in a branch office somewhere far away, you'll probably get the promotion over others who have reservations about it.


Once you've been with a company for a year or two, if you feel you're being passed over for advancement, scan job listings regularly and apply to any position that seems like a serious step up. A lot of CEOs started their careers as managers and junior vice presidents for two or three related businesses before becoming the head of their own company.
Don't be afraid to get entrepreneurial. CEOs and entrepreneurs share many traits, and a person planning to become one can get a great start by becoming the other. If you see an opportunity to go into business for yourself, and it seems like a better path to the executive level than your current one, don't hesitate to make the change. Cultivating a successful company from the ground up is an impressive distinction on any corporate resume.

, If you can, elect to become a member of the board of directors at a respectable company. This gives you valuable experience you can use to interact with the board at your own company once you become a CEO. It's also an excellent feather in your cap, as nearly half of all CEOs in the United States served as board members at some point previous to becoming CEOs.

, The CEO of a company isn't necessarily the founder or even the owner; a CEO isn't quite the same thing as an entrepreneur. A CEO isn't a mere bookkeeper or office monkey, though, either. Rather, the CEO's job is to run the company: oversee financial decisions, resolve imbalances, and keep things on track for more profitability each and every year. This means a great CEO is a combination of an ideas person (like an entrepreneur), willing to take risks and think big; and a hands-on person, eagle-eyed in matters of money and human resources, always willing to dig into the details until everything is perfect.

, Most CEOs attain their position after many years – sometimes decades – in the same industry, or even at the same company. Once you reach the top, don't forget your roots. Use all that you know about your business (or area of business) to run it as efficiently as possible: differences between written policy and practical “ground rules;” connections who can give you insight into places you're no longer closely connected to; attitudes and beliefs among low-level employees about the business.

, To be a truly great CEO, you must exercise control over your company by shaping the workplace environment to be one that has a distinct and palpable culture. In other words, a great leader creates a sense among his or her employees that they are a part of something truly special, something bigger and more significant than any one part of the whole. Your attitude and actions towards your workforce very clearly set the tempo at every level of the company.


Demand the world of your workers, but allow them to make mistakes. Show them that the company believes in them enough to let them keep trying until they make it – as long as they are good enough at their jobs to make it in a big way when they do. Encourage productivity by encouraging risk-taking and personal judgment calls. You always have the last word if something is a poor fit for the business.

, As a CEO, it's your job to run the entire business. Though you delegate many of the daily tasks to your subordinates, you're the one with the bird's-eye view who can see the whole pattern of the company as it breathes and changes over time. Bearing that in mind, use what you see and know to communicate your plans and explain your decisions to your workers clearly, plainly, and openly. If they know what your vision for the company is, they'll have a much easier time helping you to realize that vision.

, Never succumb to the illusion that the CEO lives and works in an ivory tower while the rest of the business goes on below, guided by distant edicts from on high. An effective CEO is always in the thick of things: visiting every department, assisting with any task they are qualified to assist with, speaking to employees and listening to their feedback. A part of your time is necessarily spent at the top, planning ahead and thinking in broad terms, but the rest of your time should be spent in the thick of the action.


Feel free to micromanage if you need to show someone the way you'd prefer them to do something. Don't simply berate them or tell them what you're doing wrong; instead, clear them out of the driver's seat and do it yourself, explaining the reasoning of every step and action along the way. A great CEO leads by example, not insult.

, Above all else, once you become a CEO, your business is the future of the company. You must be adept at thinking six moves ahead, seeing around the next corner, and guessing what the future will hold. Stay abreast of trends and always think about your company's place in the business world at large. How can you stay king of the hill? If you're not, how can you knock the other schmoe out of the top spot? If these are the questions that help guide your business strategy, you'll be the most effective CEO you can be.

Federal employees. Federal employees are not covered by state workers’ compensation systems. Instead, they are covered by the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act, which outlines its own method of processing and adjudicating workers’ compensation claims that is unique to federal workers.Maritime workers (e.g., longshore workers) who are injured or killed on the job may be protected by the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act as opposed to state workers’ compensation laws.
Native American organizations are typically not considered “employers” for workers’ compensation claims.;
, You can only draw workers’ compensation benefits if you sustained a qualifying injury. A qualifying injury is one that was “work related.”Generally speaking, a “work related” injury is one sustained in the course and scope of employment.For example, if a delivery driver strains his back while picking up a heavy box during a delivery, then the injury arose out of employment because picking up heavy boxes was a contributing cause of the injury.
However, if a delivery driver strains her back while moving her child into a dorm room, then that injury falls outside the scope of employment.
Workers’ compensation rules will vary by state. Some states preclude workers from claiming work-related stress injuries. Some states, however, permit recovery for psychiatric stress injuries. You will need to talk to an attorney to find out precisely what rules apply to your situation.

, You should hold onto copies of all medical reports and notes related to your injury. Create a binder and keep it in a secure location. These documents will be necessary later.

, Depending on your injury, there are a variety of benefits that workers may be eligible to receive. The following is only a partial list:medical care for injury or illness
temporary disability benefits to replace wages while you recover
permanent disability benefits intended to compensate individuals with a reduced working capacity
job displacement benefits to pay for job training
death or burial benefits

, Generally, states use a formula to determine benefit amounts. There is usually a cap on the amount of benefits you may receive. Also the amount you’ll receive may depend on when you were injured and whether you are temporarily or permanently disabled.


Some states provide online calculators you can use to get a rough estimate of what your benefits might be. Colorado, for example, has a calculator available here.
Some states will reduce the benefit amount if the disability can be attributed to other, non-work factors that contributed to the worker’s permanent disability.

, When you become injured, let your employer know as soon as possible that you have been hurt. Your employer should give you the forms that you need to fill out.


You have a limited amount of time to inform your employer of the injury. If you miss the deadline, then you may lose your eligibility. The amount of time differs by state. Oklahoma workers, for example, have 30 days to report the injury.New Hampshire workers, by contrast, have 2 years.To be safe, you should report as soon as possible—preferably within a week, unless you know for certain what your state deadline is.
If you are the member of a union, then you should tell your union representative of the injury as soon as possible. In many states, employers and unions have created labor-management “carve-outs” which are alternative systems for adjudicating workers’ compensation claims and processing benefits., You want to guarantee that your employer has filed the necessary claims and paperwork on your behalf. After you have completed the required formalities, check in with your employer to make certain they have indeed filed the claim.

, A medical professional will likely have to verify your claims of injury, and he or she will also be required to fill out some standard paperwork. Double check these documents to make sure they specify that you were indeed hurt on the job and the injury occurred in the workplace.


Your employer may provide workers’ compensation medical care through a workers’ compensation health network. If so, you must visit a doctor in the network.If so, ask your employer for a list of providers.
Some states have a list of doctors who are prohibited from treating people seeking workers’ compensation benefits.Your employer should also have a list; if not, check with your state’s Department of Labor.

, It will be most prudent to follow the doctor’s advice, so that no questions can be raised that your injury has been aggravated by your own conduct.Be sure to attend all appointments and reschedule ones that you can’t make. Also take prescribed medicines and attend physical therapy., After your employer files the paperwork with its insurer, you must wait to find out whether your employer’s insurance carrier has accepted or denied your claim.If you have been denied benefits, then you will receive a denial letter. If you are awarded benefits, then the letter should specify what next steps you must follow to set up payments.

, The letter will have at least 3 pieces of critical information: why you were denied, a description of the appeals process, and deadlines for bringing an appeal. You must identify these pieces of information and underline them.


Workers’ compensation claims are denied for a variety of reason. The most common are: you did not report the injury within the required time, the injury is not severe enough, or the injury was not sustained on the job.Pay particular attention to deadlines. You often will be given only a month to bring the appeal, if not less. If you want to appeal, you should begin immediately.

, Being denied workers’ compensation benefits when you are injured is a stressful experience, and bringing an appeal only adds to the stress. The appeals process is complicated, varies by state, and requires that you learn confusing rules of evidence,which could take months. Hiring an experienced workers’ compensation lawyer can streamline the process and bolster your appeal.


Bring a copy of your denial letter as well as all of your medical information to the lawyer, who will need copies of this information for your appeal. And promptly gather any other information your attorney needs. Delays will only delay the appeal process.
Private attorneys will work on a contingency basis. This means they are paid only if they win your case. Generally, the attorney will take around 20% of your benefit amount.The amount is often capped by state law.Under a contingency arrangement, you will still have to pay for costs. Typical costs include filing fees, expert witness fees, and money spent on photocopying and mailing. Try to get an estimate of these costs upfront.

, This goes by various names, depending on the state. In Michigan, it is called an “Application for Hearing.”In Arizona, you must file a “Hearing Request form.”Your denial letter should tell you where to locate this form.


Federal workers may appeal in three ways: by requesting a hearing, by appealing to the Appeals Board, or by applying for reconsideration.
Each federal appeal requires different things from the employee. In a hearing, you simply request that the hearing representative review the claim. The hearing representative may agree to give you benefits or confirm the initial decision. When appealing to the Employee’s Compensation Appeals Board, you may not provide new evidence; rather, the Appeals Board makes a determination based on the claim’s record. With a Request of Reconsideration, you and your attorney submit either new evidence or new legal arguments., You should always send by certified mail.In this way you will have a receipt for your records.

, Your employer and its insurance company will probably respond to your appeal and explain why your claim should be denied.The answer provides a sneak peek as to what their argument will be on appeal.


Although an insurance company may the party that ultimately pays out any compensation benefits, your employer always retains a stake in the outcome of your case because it will incur higher insurance premiums if you win. Therefore, your employer will likely be involved at all stages: it will answer your complaint, attend the trial, and have a representative testify.
Understand the terminology. In other areas of law, a “trial” and an “appeal” are distinct events. For example, in the criminal arena, no witnesses appear at the appeal. Instead, an attorney writes a legal brief and no new evidence is admitted. However, in the workers’ compensation arena, the “appeal” is like a trial: witnesses are questioned and evidence is presented to an administrative law judge (ALJ) or to an appeals board.

, You may be required to undergo an independent medical examination (IME). Your employer or its insurance carrier may request it. The purpose is for an independent physician to identify the cause of the injury as well as the extent of the disability.In some states, the workers’ compensation claims board can request an IME. If you have an attorney, then the IME is scheduled per agreement between the insurance company and your attorney.Though you and your lawyer can object to the IME, an objection will often be interpreted as a concession that the injury isn’t as severe as you are claiming.
Try to have a friend or family member go with you.By having someone go with you, you will have a witness in case the doctor testifies that you said or did something that you didn’t do.

, Some states publish written appellate decisions involving workers’ compensation claims. Kansas, for example, has a database.You should look to see if your state has a database of decisions.


Read up on other cases similar to yours. For example, if you were denied workers’ compensation benefits because your condition was “preexisting,” then you could research any prior appellate decisions that discussed preexisting conditions.
A case where an appeal was granted in a factually-similar case is strong evidence in your favor that your claim is valid.
Your attorney will be skilled in researching prior decisions. Ask her for copies of any decisions so you can read them.

, At the trial, you will need to present evidence that supports your claim to have been injured on the job.Typically, the most effective witnesses will be medical professionals who can testify to your injuries and co-workers who may have seen the injury occur.


Your state law may or may not provide for subpoena power. If it does, then you can get a blank subpoena form from your workers’ compensation board. Serving a subpoena is a way to assure a witness’s attendance.
Fill in the subpoena form with the witness’s name and address. Then fill in where the witness is commanded to appear (i.e., where the hearing will be held) as well as the date and time of the hearing.Mail the subpoena using certified mail. Give the witness plenty of time (at least several weeks) to rearrange her schedule in order to attend.

, You will be called to testify about the injury: how it happened and the extent of your disability. To make sure you are an effective witness, you should:


Ask your attorney to do a practice run. Have your attorney pepper you with hard questions to familiarize you with the process.
Review your summary of the event. Shortly after being injured, you should have jotted down what happened and how. Review this information to refresh your memory.

, Generally, the first appeal is held before an administrative law judge (ALJ) or a state appeals board.The ALJ may call you in for a pre-trial hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to make sure the parties are prepared for trial.


If you have any questions, you should ask them at that time. For example, you should ask if the other side has turned over copies of their witness list or the medical reports they intend to use.

, You do not want to be late. If you are unfamiliar with where the trial is being held, then give yourself an extra hour to find parking and go through any security.


Trials are rarely held at court houses. Rather, they are usually held at the offices of the workers’ compensation board.
Dress neatly. Look professional but comfortable. You do not have to wear a suit if it makes you feel awkward., The opening statement will be less formal than in a trial before a jury. Here, the attorneys will clarify for the judge what issues the parties have agreed on (such as your date of employment) and what issues are in dispute (such as whether you were injured on the job)., You undoubtedly will be called to testify. After you swear an oath, your lawyer will ask you questions about how the injury happened. Speak loudly and to the judge.You should have practiced your trial testimony with your attorney. She cannot ask you leading questions (i.e., questions that contain the answer).But she can ask more general questions: “Where were you on the morning of…?” “Did you hurt yourself?”
You will also be cross-examined. If you read you’re the answer, then you should have a good idea of what questions the other side will ask. For example, if your employer or the insurance company claims you were injured while on vacation, you should anticipate detailed questions about where you went and what you did.

, Your lawyer should briefly explain how the evidence presented supports your legal right to workers’ compensation benefits. He will also rebut the other side’s arguments.

, The ALJ or appeals board will typically draft a written decision. You will receive it by mail.


Sometimes an appeals board will review the ALJ’s written order and either adopt its finding or send it back for reconsideration.

, If your claim is denied at the hearing, then an appeal of the denial is possible. Discuss whether or not another appeal is worthwhile and whether your attorney will handle it.


Appeals can also be handled on contingency. However, you may have to sign a new client agreement, which redefines the scope of the representation.

Relay your other strengths which would be beneficial in a call center.Call centers look for employees who are good at multi-tasking, working in a fast-paced environment, learning quickly, and meeting goals.
For example, you can explain how you met a measurable goal through a previous job, volunteer work, or a challenge at school.
The typical education requirement for an entry-level call center agent is a high school diploma (or equivalent).;
, Show up early and dress appropriately. Show a willingness to be flexible with your role and schedule.Be enthusiastic to learn about the company and its policies/procedures.For example, your potential employer may ask if you’re willing to take on different roles, such as inbound sales, outbound sales, or customer service. Explain how your specific experience has prepared you for meeting various responsibilities.
Try asking a question about something you found on the company’s website or social media page(s). This will show that you’ve done your research and are interested in the potential employer., Expect that your new position will require a period of training. You may be trained in language, products and services, and software. Make sure that you attend all of your training without missing a day.Training typically lasts between one and four weeks.
After training, a supervisor will likely be assigned to a group of employees including you.

, Take a class, if needed. Look for online or in-person classes. Practice your typing and computer navigation skills. Also practice talking while you type.


Call center agents need to be able to react and locate information quickly.Familiarizing yourself with computer navigation can help you learn new software as needed.
Free online programs and video tutorials are available to help you improve your computer skills.

, Plan to arrive to work early every day. Give yourself to time to commute and get settled in. Take breaks when your schedule allows you to.


Most call centers will require you to log in to your system before you can take calls.
It’s a good idea to check the traffic report in the morning significantly ahead of leaving for work. That way if there’s a traffic problem, you can leave even earlier.

, Ask for advice on specific situations or how to improve at your job in general. Try to talk to them during breaks if they are very busy with multiple agents while on the job. Alternately, you may be able to speak to them before or after work.


Supervisors usually started out with your same job. They’ll know the in’s and out’s of the position, and appreciate how hard it can get.

, Memorize as much information about your employer as you can. Check your company's internet and intranet frequently. Don’t neglect your email, as important internal memos may await you.You should know the details of the products and services your company offers.
Call center agents who are confident in their abilities are more effective at their jobs., Approach the job with enthusiasm. Arrive every day with a sense of optimism, and remind yourself to maintain it. Keep at least one yellow-colored item on your desk, if you’re allowed to. Keep positive affirmations with you – either memorize some or keep them in your purse, pocket, or cubicle.


The color yellow has an optimistic psychological effect.For example, use yellow sticky notes, pens, or paper clips.
An example of a positive affirmation is, “I am in charge of how I feel and I choose to remain positive.”

, Speak slowly and clearly. Don’t mumble. Think (quickly) about what you’re going to say before you say it. Remember that calls may be monitored and recorded.


If English is your second language and you find customers have difficulty understanding you, consider taking English as a Second Language classes. You can find in-person and online classes. Some online resources are free to use.

, Stay friendly at all times. Don’t be negative, condescending or confrontational, regardless of what the customer says. Use formalities and an upbeat tone of voice.Try saying, “Please,” “Thank you,” “You’re welcome,” and “I’m sorry to hear that.”

, Don't take anything customers tell you personally, and don’t tell customers to “calm down.”Provide such customers with empathy and a solution. After the call, take a few seconds to breathe if you can, smile and move on to the next call.One of the most important traits of a good call center agent is the ability to stay calm under pressure.Try saying, “We truly appreciate your feedback,” “I’ll do my best to assist you,” and other pleasantries, using the customer’s name often.To the customer, you are a representative of the company who’s speaking on the phone. They won’t always be respectful and may even seem to blame you for their issue with the company.

, Ask questions that have “yes” or “no” answers. Steer the conversation back to its focus as needed. Avoid personal topics or comments about the weather unless you need to kill time while something loads on your end.If you need to leave work and the call isn’t resolved, try saying, “This sounds like this is something my colleague can help you with.”, Pay attention to detail. Don’t assume you know what customers need before they finish explaining the issue. Make sure that customers are satisfied as best you can before you terminate the call.Customers report that only half of call center agents address their concerns with an appropriate answer.
Repeating the customer’s problem back to them can help convey to them that you understand their concerns., Find out when a call should be transferred, for instance, to a supervisor or manager. Ask your supervisor under what circumstances should you transfer a call elsewhere. Recognize if the caller has an issue you are unable to resolve yourself. Then advise the customer in a positive way that you’re going to transfer the call.For example, if the customer is specifically requesting a rebate, and you are unable to issue one, you may need to transfer the call.
Instead of saying “I don’t handle that,” try saying, “can help you with that.”"

Pick a route.,
Be selective.,
Apply for the scouted-out job with the same professionalism you'd use for an advertised job.,
Interview.,
Provide yourself with job security.",How to Find Work in the Neighborhood," Choosing a direction, neighborhood, or block to search is the first step of the process. Generally, to save on gas and to locate neighbors who are most likely to recognize and trust you, it's best to search areas closest to your house. Gradually expand your search radius until opportunities present themselves.;
, Generally it's best to hit every house, but by paying attention to the state of the yard and looking for things needing doing, you should be able to tell if that person is the type you'd like to work with or not and if there are likely opportunities for work. Just be aware that people with well tended yards generally already have someone working for them, be it a kid, husband, or another neighbor. While it's a good idea to check anyway, don't get your hopes up too much. However, do think laterally – perhaps the yard is tidied regularly but the pool needs cleaning, the dog needs walking or a child inside needs tutoring or babysitting.


Don't endanger yourself. If something about the place makes you uncomfortable, then you might just want to go to the next house. That includes intimidating dogs.

, Your first meeting with a person is like an application. It presents the basic information that will either get you work or not. People look for and respond to certain obvious qualities like friendliness, an outgoing attitude, and work readiness. To meet these qualifications, present an enthusiastic, firm, and open attitude and carry references with you.


Language is another important factor. Not everybody can speak English, or they might prefer a bilingual person. Think about how you might make an approach where you can't get across everything easily in English; perhaps a visual flier explaining your skills, or perhaps a demonstration of what you can do.

, Generally the interview comes next and is given just after the ""application."" While it's likely to be fairly informal compared with a typical job interview, still treat it with the same professionalism. People check for attitude, schedule, expected pay, and skills. The more open your schedule is, the more likely you will receive work. The more willing and ready you seem to work, the more likely you will be hired. The expected pay is important because not all people can afford to pay a very high salary, especially not in the context of neighborhood jobs; you should be aware of going rates and seek to either undercut or over-deliver to ward off competition.


People also want to know what you can and want to do. Most people are willing to teach, so present yourself as a learning-ready person that will do anything. People love that attitude.

, It's best to search for more than one person to employ you. You never know how things will work out with that particular client. Sometimes, you won't get much work from a person, so having multiple clients will provide you with the option to earn more money than you'll get with one client. Also, some clients pay more than others. Whatever the case, it's also an excellent way to build more skills and experience to go on an actual résumé or for work performance.


Stay professional in all that you do and word of mouth will help you to gain more clients within the neighborhood. Be timely, courteous and respectful of other people's property at all times and they'll grow to ask you back and will be happy to recommend you to others too. (And even it they feel territorial about you, that's good because you can ask for more money!)

Contact the employer to ask about the application process.,
Write a cover letter, if necessary.,
Get a second (or third) opinion.,
Locate references.,
Apply.,
Follow up.",How to Apply for a Job1," In order to streamline the job application process, examine what your needs and desires are for employment. You can narrow down your options by taking a few things into consideration:









Consider the career field. Whether you are transitioning from another field or are looking to make a lateral move, it is important to find work that is both challenging and rewarding for you. Knowing what you don’t want to do is just as important and knowing what you do want to do.
Consider the skills required for a particular position. Feeling like your skills are being well utilized and acknowledged is key to feeling satisfaction at a job. Having an idea about which of your skills will be tapped, and which you will be able to develop, is key to deciding on a worthwhile job.
Consider your salary and benefit requirements. Be honest and realistic about your bottom line. If you need health coverage and require a certain amount of income per month, it is best to home in on jobs that fulfill those requirements.;
, Before you begin sending out resumes and cover letters en masse, look into the companies you are applying for.









Get a sense of the company’s personality and values by reading its mission statement. This information can come in handy when writing your cover letter and in an interview situation.
Read up on new products or services the company is providing. This information is often located in the company’s “news” section. This section can also be a source of information on community activities the company is involved in.
Review the jobs or careers section of the company website for insight into job openings. You may find more options for employment in other departments or locations., Even if the job you want doesn’t require the submission of a traditional resume, having an up-to-date resume is highly recommended. Resumes not only outline your education and work history, but they can also point to specific projects you’ve worked on or awards you’ve won. Information to include on your resume should entail:









Your current contact information, including your full name, phone number, mailing address, and email address.
Your educational background. List the colleges you have attended (beginning with your most recent), the year you attended, and any degrees or certificates earned. You may opt to include your course of study.
Your work history for the past few years. The unofficial rule is one resume page per ten years of experience. Be aware that large gaps in employment, or multiple jobs within a short amount of time, will be something you may be asked about in an interview. Be sure to include dates of employment, the company name, your title, and a brief description of your activities.
Your relevant skills. This is your opportunity to list all the skills you have acquired through the years. Knowledge of office equipment, familiarity with computer operating systems, software programs (such as Microsoft Office Suite or Adobe Creative Suite), typing speed, database experience, and other relevant information should be included in your resume.

, You will likely have your call routed to the hiring or human resources manager. If they have openings, they may ask you to either come in to fill out an application or that you send them your resume and cover letter by mail or e-mail. Be sure to note this contact's name, and address all future communication to this person, by name.








, Make sure it is specific to both the company and the job. If possible, address the contact letter to a specific contact person. This demonstrates that you took the time to research the information and are not simply mass-emailing every employer you can find. Consider discussing the following topics in your cover letter:









How the company’s personality and mission align with your own values.
How your background makes you a valuable asset to the role and to the company.
What it is you hope to gain from working in this role.
What unique talents would you bring to this position?
What specifically interests you about this position.

, Ask friends or family members to review your resume and cover letter for typos. They may be able to point out things that are missing, or items that could be rephrased.









If possible, get advice from someone working in the field you are applying for. Speaking to recruiters or hiring managers may be beneficial as well, as they are familiar with the qualities and qualifications employers are looking for.

, Though you may not have to provide a list of references right away, it is wise to tap people early to ask whether they would consider being a professional reference for you.









It is recommended that you secure at least three references. At least two of these references should be people whom you have worked with and who can speak to your job performance.
Be sure you have your references' updated contact information, including mailing and email addresses, phone number, current title, and current company., Once you have fine-tuned your resume and cover letter, it is time to begin the application process. Applications are typically submitted in one of three ways:









In person. Bring a packet containing all your materials to the prospective employer's workplace. It is recommended that you ask ahead of time for the best time to deliver your materials. When you arrive, ask to speak to the hiring manager and try to hand your materials to them personally. This allows the hiring manager to put a face to the name. It is recommended that you dress professionally and present yourself well.
Online. Online applications vary--some may ask you to fill in fields, while others may require that you attach PDFs of your cover letter and resume. Some companies request that you email your materials to their Human Resources department. It is important to follow directions--if they ask that you send your resume in the body of the email, do not send an attachment!
By mail. If requested, be sure to include the name of the hiring or HR manager on all of the correspondence. Ensure that you have the proper postage for the weight of your application packet.

, Checking on the status of your application shows your interest in the position and ensures that your application materials have made it to the appropriate person. Calling right away can seem demanding and off-putting. Follow these suggestions for reaching out:









Pay attention to job ""close date."" Most jobs posted online will have a posted closing date. Calling the hiring manager before this date can make you seem overly eager and desperate.
If there is no close date, a good rule of thumb is to make contact one week after application submission.
When you do call or email the hiring or HR manager, try to make the tone of you communication friendly. Avoid demanding comments like, ""I haven't been contacted yet."" Instead, ask questions such as ""Have any decisions been made yet?"" or ""Can you tell me a little more about the hiring time frame?"" Asking if you might contact them again in one week if no word has been given is a polite way to be proactive."
"
Make sure your online presence is squeaky clean.,
When you do finally get an interview, be sure to dress for the job you want.,
Be prompt.,
Show interest and enthusiasm at your job interview.,
Refer to your notes.,
Employ proper etiquette.",How to Apply for a Job2," Employers and recruiters often scour the internet looking for you, and any negativity they see can push you to the back of the pack.








, Clothes that make you feel good and confident can influence the way you carry yourself in an interview.








, Plan to arrive at interviews 10-15 minutes ahead of time to allow for any traffic or public transportation issues. This will also give you a few minutes to compose yourself and review any notes you have brought with you.








, Being positive and speaking about the job in a knowledgeable way shows you did your research, and that can win you big points.








, Ask you interviewer if it's ok that you take notes. Your notebook can double as a cheat-sheet where you list accomplishments and highlight stories that demonstrate your abilities.








, Following up with a thank you note after an interview demonstrates good manners, and leaves a lasting impression. Try to make the note substantive and mention what you were able to take away from the interview.

Ace your interview.",How to Find Your Dream Career," The respected philosopher Alan Watts said that the best way to find what you should be doing with your life was to ask yourself this important question: ""What would you do if money were no object?"" What if you won the lottery and you could do whatever you wanted to do with your life? Sure, you'd want to relax for a while, but eventually you're going to get bored. So what would you do to make yourself really, truly happy?;
, Take whatever activity or job you discovered in the previous step and break it down into its most basic parts. If you were explaining the job to a 3-year-old, how would you describe it? If that child asked you what was fun about it or how it made someone feel when they did it, what would you say? These basic components make up what you should be looking for in a career.

, Think about the basic components of that career experience and decide which are the aspects that pull you.Realize what attracts you to that career. Do you find happiness in making other people happy? Are you more attracted to the art of acting and the process of creating the work of art that is a film?


You can do this for your current job as well, not just a theoretical dream job. If there's something about your job that you do now, factor that in as well.

, Look for jobs that mimic the feelings that you're looking for from that career. For example, if you were a millionaire and would rather travel, jobs which mirror the experience you have would be a tour guide, a teacher abroad, or a flight attendant position. If you would rather spend all day outdoors in nature, you could consider a job as a geologist, lumberjack, wilderness guide, or park ranger.

, When you consider these more-attainable careers, make sure to do your research. Be well acquainted with what life looks like in that career path. You will need to know what the downsides of those jobs are if you want to make an informed decision.

, If you're really in a job that fulfills you and makes you happy, getting rich off of it really won't matter to you. However, life is full of obligations that go beyond your happiness. If your dream career can't help feed your family or pay your student loans, you might need to look into other options. However, you should always keep your focus on jobs that provide similar feelings to what makes you happy.

, Do you have an area where you really excel? Not just something that you do okay but something where you do it better than most people that you meet? This is something that you should factor in when looking for a career. You may not think that you enjoy it too much, but the fact of the matter is that you often won't get good at something unless you enjoy it on at least a certain level. You may be able to monetize your skill, or even home in on the aspect of it that you enjoy so much (for guidance).

, Many hobbies can be monetized. This often means starting a small business and the headaches that come with it, but you may end up with a career that you really enjoy. Before you dismiss your hobby as being something that you could never make money off of, do some searching on the internet. You may be surprised.

, If you feel really lost and none of these tricks help you, consider taking an online job test or going in to a local career center to get some advice from professionals. Good online tests can be found easily, but many of the best require a small fee.

, Before seriously looking for that job, do a basic search for open positions. It doesn't matter what city they're in (so long as they're in your country or open to members of your citizenship level). Look at what the requirements are. What do the basic requirements seem to be? You want to make it your goal to meet and possibly exceed those requirements.

, Locate some people that do what you want to be doing. You should also get in touch with the people who would be in charge of hiring for that position. Talk to both and ask them for details that aren't in the jobs listings. What skills and qualities are most important? You want to put these on your checklist too.

, Go down your list and figure out if it's feasible to meet these requirements. You'll probably need some more education (this is to be expected), but don't feel like this limits you. There are many government programs available to help people get the education they need for a job, especially if that job is in demand. You can also find scholarships, internships, and apprenticeships to get the skills you need.

, In the mean time, do some volunteer work and other jobs which show you building the skills you need for your dream job. Look for positions in the same industry, or even volunteer positions that get you working in that position directly. Even if the experience is more abstract (working at a store to build customer service experience), this can help in the long run and help you get funds to get a better education.

, You don't need to go to some Ivy League or join a secret organization. Just meet people connected to that field and get to know them (and let them get to know you). You can volunteer with their organizations, go to conferences in that field, and even just go to a job fair to meet people. Just make sure that you're making a good impression and that they're definitely going to recognize your name., Do an internship, a job shadow, or volunteer in order to see what that career path really looks like on a day-to-day basis. This will help you make sure that you're not romanticizing the job and that you will actually like it. It will also help you meet people who can help you and help you gain vital skills in the field.

, Of course, everything that you've been doing if you follow the previous steps is technically taking initiative. Just make sure that you never stop. You need to pursue your dreams and you need to take an active role in making them come true. If things don't go your way, pick yourself up and try again. Find new routes. Do whatever you have to do to make it work.

, You don't go from below the food chain to the top in one or two years. Realize that getting your dream job might take a while and a couple of intermediate steps. It's worth it though: you'll get there eventually and you'll have earned it.

, Going to job fairs or searching the internet and papers are the basic routes to finding a job. But don't forget that you can also go to companies directly. Figure out who you want to work for and keep an eye on their ""jobs"" portion of their website. You can even contact the company directly and ask if they take resumes.

, Your resume should be looking great if you followed the earlier advice, but don't forget about building good references. Don't list jobs that had very little to do with what you're trying to do now. Definitely avoid listing people who had problems with you. Always make sure that you call and ask people not just if they can be listed as a reference, but if they feel that they can give you a good reference.

, Once you land an interview, you want to be sure that you show them just how incredible you're going to be once they hire you. Dress for success and go in prepared. Look at common interview questions and think about what you would say. You should also think of some questions which show them that you're going to take this job seriously.

"
"
Ask yourself some very basic questions.,
Define ""success."",
Determine your unique strengths - First find out what you are good at, and also what you do best!,
Check the path of your passion - Once you have an idea of what you would love to do, it's best to check your target, because sometimes it's hard to see the forest through the trees.,
Try everything.,
Research what you're getting into.,
Surround yourself with passionate people.,
Be a ""wide achiever."",
Have a branch project.,
Keep honing your strengths and talents.,
Prove yourself wrong.,
Pour yourself into it.,
Let the adversity brush off you.,
Try to try again.",How to Find the Work You Love," In order to get on the right track for a fruitful career, you've got to know yourself at your core. Sit down with no distractions and devote a few hours (or days) in truly nailing down about what your passion is. Here are some questions one should ask:What gets me up in the morning?
What would I be doing if money wasn't a factor?
What do I do best?
What fascinates me and makes me curious?
What do I enjoy most?
What do I envy in other people's careers?;
, For some people, success means a big paycheck. For others, it means a family. For others still, it means peace of mind. What's your definition of success? What would you need to do career-wise to feel successful? Whatever your definition is, make sure your definition of success and the work you're considering line up.Let's say a major part of your definition of success is having a fair amount of time to spend with family and getting days off for vacations and gatherings. One of the paths you're considering is starting your own business. You may have to reevaluate this thought as starting your own business may require long, exhausting work weeks (at least in the beginning). Is that a sacrifice you're willing to make?

, If you dream of being a cat groomer but you're terribly, terribly allergic to cats, you may have to kiss your cat grooming dreams goodbye. Sometimes, things just aren't meant to be. It's not only about what you want to do, but it's also about what you're good at. What's more, it's about what you're uniquely good at. What combination of talents do you have that you don't see in other people?


Let's say you're really good at baking. Great! But there are a lot of good bakers out there. What could you combine with this passion of yours to set yourself apart from the crowd? Do you have tons of crazy ideas and are constantly trying crazy flavors and combinations? Do you like working with kids? Is charity work a passion? How could you conflate multiple interests?

, Maybe you think you want to be a great marathon runner, but it's not because you love running – it's because you love studying how the human body moves and you'd be better off as a coach or a researcher. Maybe you think you want to be the world's best baker, but what you really love is feeding people – and you should actually open a cafe. Check that your passion is right on target before you assume anything.


Hundreds of years ago, there were a dozen jobs to choose from. Now that's a practically infinite number. In analyzing your passion, make sure to think outside of the box. Just because you love running doesn't mean you should be a runner. Just because you love baking doesn't mean you should be a baker. You could be a coach, a shoe designer, a dietitian, a teacher, anything.

, If you have no idea what your passion truly is, start by just trying everything.


Living in a larger urban area there will be temp agencies that can get you a toehold into different work environments that you may otherwise not think of, and because you would only be a temporary employee you may still be able to afford to do some job hopping at first. As a temp, you can be easily be fired by clients of an agency, but most agencies themselves will keep sending you out as long as there is demand and employees are not tied down to one agency if they choose which helps with their money when demand slackens. When something interests you and your gut tells you to pursue it, do so. You could find skills or interests you didn't even know you had, completely changing your course.
Take a yoga class. Teach yourself code. Start painting. Ride a horse. Plant a garden. Volunteer. Pick up a guitar. Brew your own beer. Take skydiving lessons. Sail a boat. When opportunity comes, take it. After all, it's not a lengthy visitor.

, So many of us say we want to be something, when really we want the glorified, idyllic version of it. We want to be a famous author, but we don't want to deal with rejection after rejection. We want to be a blogger, but we don't want to spend hours and hours pushing content and doing virtual schmoozing. We want to be a musician, but we don't want to be flat broke. Whatever it is, make sure you're going into it knowing the downside of it, too. If you see the downside and you still want it, that's what you should be doing.


If you can, do a job shadow with an acquaintance where you can get in on a piece of the action. If that's not doable, find a few people in this position that you can shoot an email to or ask some questions. Do research online, too, getting a feel for the field. With a good head on your shoulders, you'll be more likely to succeed.

, Have you ever heard the phrase, ""You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with?"" Whether you have or haven't, know that there's truth behind that statement. We tend to blend in with those around us – if they're negative, we become negative. If they're happy, we become happy. And if they're not passionate, we risk losing our passion.In short, your environment is huge. If the people around you hate their jobs, you're more likely to hate your job – and be totally complacent about it, because they are, too. Instead, try to surround yourself with people who are equally driven and who will support you (instead of thinking you're crazy for pursuing your dreams). They're just the type of people you need to get started., When starting out on a new life path, don't devote all your time and energy to one ""seed,"" or one idea you're starting to cultivate and grow. It's not about being an over achiever, it's about being a wide achiever. That is, someone with a lot of fingers in a lot of pies, cultivating multiple interests. Some call this a ""portfolio worker."" Not only are you fulfilling multiple sides of your personality (many of us have many interests, and this is why we're torn), but you're also shirking the risk of losing your income, too.A good question to ask yourself is, ""If I were a wide achiever, what would I be doing with all my time?"" Instead of having work be one thing and one thing alone, it could be several different projects, all fulfilling a different aspect of your passion.

, Alright, for the vast majority of us, it's not easy to just pick up and start over, hoping that this thing we love takes root. Instead, something more feasible is to have a branch, or side project. You have your main gig during the day that isn't so great, but you have the thing you live for on the side. And it'll grow and grow until you don't need that main gig anymore.


It doesn't matter if it's 1 hour a week or 15 hours a week – just start somewhere. It'll also fuel you to feel better about your life. You won't be defined anymore by work you loathe and you'll be putting effort into something meaningful. It'll feel good.

, You probably haven't spent years and years cultivating this passion – otherwise you'd probably already be doing it. And even though it's a strength of yours, keep honing until. We all have room to improve, even at the things we're great at. In order to turn it into a money-making venture, you've got to be the cream of the crop.


If you're a great baker, take a new class on a technique you've never tried. Start experimenting with flavors you once thought were too wacky. If you're a writer, submit your work to different websites, take a class on a different style of writing, and push yourself to write about new things. And above all, don't give up.

, Before Roger Bannister broke the 4-minute mile, people said it couldn't be done. Then he did it – and guess what? Others started breaking it all over the place.Sometimes, obstacles are only in our minds. If you think you can't do it, you may not be able to. So prove yourself wrong and go for it anyway.


This is a large part of why it matters who's around you. If you're with a bunch of naysayers who say ""just build your resume"" or ""stick to something that offers security,"" you may never go for it. In the end, you'll probably end up agreeing with them. The last thing you want to do!

, Just because you love something doesn't not mean it's going to be easy, unfortunately. Your business may takes years to start making money. You may not feel like an expert until you're practically retired. There may be weeks where you're burning the midnight oil to get your efforts off the ground. It likely won't be pretty, but it'll be worth it.


In order to make it happen, you may have to exhaust all your resources, hit up friends of friends of friends of friends, spend your last nickel, lose sleep, and contemplate shutting down. Sometimes you have to hit bottom before you skyrocket up. And this is a chance you'll have to take – and hopefully it'll pay off.

, There is nothing easy about following your passion. People will try to be logical and tell you not to do it. People will be jealous and tell you not to do it. People will be negative and tell you not to do it. You can't listen to them. They'll be there regardless of what it is you're trying to do. It has to do with their way of thinking and has nothing to do with you.


That being said, you can't be too hard on yourself either. If you don't believe in you, why should anyone else? If you're the source of your own adversity, nothing will come of your dreams because you're standing in the way. Get out of the way and your dreams could start flowing freely.

, Life can be looked at as a series of small failures. Not in a pessimistic way, but as a life-lesson type of way. One relationship fails, so we find another. One job isn't great, so we move on. This is normal. This is what life is about. This is how we learn and grow. This is how we become the best person we can be. And this is what the path to doing something you love is going to be like, too. It's not going to be any different. There will be times when you feel like you failed. And then you pick up and improve and move on.You cannot be let down by setbacks. Use them as a ""now I know what not to do"" kind of mindset. You're only getting closer to your goals by failing. You've got to keep trying for the jackpot to strike. And when it does, you won't work another day in your life.

Say only what you need to.,
Don’t admit anything relevant.,
Answer questions firmly, seriously, and without hesitation.,
Breathe normally.,
Alter breathing rate with control questions.,
Answer control questions strangely.,
Think of something mentally stressful when answering a control question.,
Handle the post-test interview.",How to Cheat a Polygraph Test (Lie Detector)1," “Yes” or “No” answers should be all you need for most of the test. Resist the temptation to explain your answers or to go into details, although the polygrapher may try to get you to do so. Be courteous and cooperative, but do not offer any more information than is absolutely necessary.;
, No matter what the lines on the chart look like, nothing is more certain or damaging than your confession. The polygrapher will most likely try to convince you that he or she can “see” a lie in your polygraph, even if there’s nothing abnormal there. Don’t fall for it. However, you want to appear honest, so don’t be afraid to make minor admissions to control questions. Just make sure you don’t admit anything in these that can invite further questioning or that may be construed as relevant.


Remember that the job of polygraphers is to extract confessions. In many ways, the whole examination is a complex ruse to trick you into confessing something.

, This is no time to joke around or try to be crafty. You want to appear earnest, cooperative and resolute.

, Except during control questions, you should try to maintain a breathing rate of 15-30 breaths per minute. Do not breathe too deeply.

, The polygrapher will compare your physiological responses to control questions to your responses to relevant questions. If the deviation from normal during control questions exceeds the deviation from normal during relevant questions, you will pass. If you react more to a relevant question than to control questions, the polygrapher will perceive (rightly or wrongly) that you are lying in response to something relevant and you will likely fail the polygraph.


Change your breathing pattern when a control question is asked. You can make it faster or slower, hold your breath for a couple seconds after an exhalation, or breathe more shallowly. Do this for 5-15 seconds and return to your normal breathing pattern before the next question.

, When you are asked a question that is obviously a control question, answer in a vague or odd fashion. For instance, if you're asked what year it is, you might respond with, ""the year of the snake"" or such an answer. Your goal is to make it difficult for the tester to get a bead on what a ""normal"" response is for you.

, If you can artificially worry yourself when answering a control question, you can modify the results of your test so that your ""normal"" responses appear the same as the responses that actually worry you. For instance, you might try doing mental arithmetic when a control question is asked. Count backwards by 7s in your head as quickly as possible or do some quick long division. This will help change your blood pressure and heart rate to a level that's similar to that which occurs during actual stressful situations - like answering a revealing question. Alternatively, you can mentally picture a frightening scenario, like, for instance, drowning, as this typically will also increase your heart rate and breathing.

, After you’re disconnected from the machine, the polygrapher may leave you in the room for a while and come back. The polygrapher may then claim to “know” that you are lying about something. This is a trick. Remain calm and firmly but politely repeat your denial. Don’t change or augment your answers and decline extended post-test interviewing if possible.

"
"
Remember that the polygrapher is not your friend.,
Beware of pretest tricks.",How to Cheat a Polygraph Test (Lie Detector)2," The polygrapher may try to convince you that he or she is on your side and will help you out if you’ll just be truthful. This is deception; don’t buy it.

, Polygraphers will frequently attempt to instill fear in the subject or convince the subject of the accuracy of the polygraph machine. The theory is that the more you fear that you may be caught, the greater your physiological reactions will be. Don’t believe the hype. The polygrapher may also try to elicit reactions from you based on fear. For example, he or she may say that you need to wash your hands so the machine can accurately read your sweat output. A hidden camera in the bathroom may then catch the subject going into the bathroom as directed, but not washing his or her hands.

"
"
Identify the types of questions you are being asked.,
Conceal your knowledge of polygraphy.",How to Cheat a Polygraph Test (Lie Detector)3," There are three basic types of questions you will be asked: relevant, irrelevant and control. Irrelevant questions are those that are obvious, such as “What is your name?” or “Are the lights on in this room?” Relevant questions are the important ones, such as “Did you leak that memo to the media,” “Have you ever stolen money from an employer?” or “Have you ever sold drugs?” Control questions are those against which your reactions to relevant questions will be compared. These are usually questions to which (just about) everybody can answer “yes,” but which everybody is uncomfortable honestly answering. Examples might include, “Have you ever lied to get out of trouble?” or “Have you ever taken anything of value from an employer?”

, The polygrapher may ask you, before the test if you’ve done any research on polygraph tests or what you know about them. Do not disclose that you’ve done extensive research. Act as though you don’t know much about polygraph examinations, but that you do believe polygraphy to be a science and polygraphs to be reliable (or at least do not exhibit any doubt as to their reliability). The polygrapher may try to trick you by mentioning certain technical terms and acronyms such as, “Your test came back NDI.” While you will know that “NDI” means “no deception indicated,” you need to act as though you have no idea what it means. Too much knowledge of the process may make the polygrapher think you’ve got something to hide, even if you don’t.

Learn about polygraphs.,
Find out what the tester is looking for.,
Practice countermeasures in advance.,
Approach your whole “polygraph day” as a test.",How to Cheat a Polygraph Test (Lie Detector)4," If your career or court case depends on it, wouldn’t you do as much research as you can? Read about what they are and how the process generally works. The most important thing to know is that polygraphy is not an exact science. In fact, it is not a science at all. It was created by interrogators, not scientists, and frequently produces incorrect results.

, A polygraph examination is administered to help find out specific information, such as whether you’re a spy or whether you’ve used drugs. If your test is prompted by a specific incident, you probably know what the examiner is looking for. For pre-employment screening tests and the like, research the company or agency’s policies to determine what you can and cannot admit.

, Practicing these beforehand can greatly increase the likelihood that you will “pass” the polygraph examination, but only if you do them right. Once you read about the measures, be sure to practice them well before the test so that you’re thoroughly prepared.

, Treat the polygraph examination as an extreme job interview. Dress conservatively and appropriately, and try to make a good impression before the test. Be sure to arrive on time and, unless it's the direst of circumstances, do not reschedule or attempt to postpone the exam.


Be aware that your every move is very likely being observed from the moment you arrive at the testing location. There may be hidden cameras in the waiting room and the restrooms, and there is almost certainly a camera or two-way mirror in the polygraph room. Your polygraph examination begins long before you are hooked up to the machine and ends only when you’ve left the testing location.

Be balanced.,
Present well from the moment you enter the interview room.,
Never make excuses for any inadequacies.,
Never point fingers.,
Be calm and confident during your discussion.,
Avoid using “desperate” language during the interview.,
Be careful with throwaway comments.,
Watch your body language and tone.,
Don’t act too available.,
Follow up with your interviewer, but within reason.",How to Avoid Acting Desperate During a Job Interview," When summing up your work experience for the interviewer and your skills, take an approach that shows you have learned from your experience and still retain optimism for the future. Avoid using terms that describe current and previous experiences as totally dire or terrifically amazing, because both extremes will be discounted by an interviewer as unrealistic and unbalanced. Find the middle way to describe your experience and you won't sound desperate to convey exaggerated viewpoints.;
, Dress well, even if the potential workplace consists of people who don jeans every day. Contrary to a desire to ""be yourself"" through appearing ""casual as"" or devil-may-care, you can't afford to give any impression of sloppiness, as it imprints ""desperate"" across your forehead. Be sure that your clothing is neat, ironed if appropriate for the fabric, adjusted to the standard of the workplace you're hoping to join, tucked in where needed (and nothing hanging out that shouldn't be) and that your hair is one hundred percent dry (wet hair suggests you only just made it out the door).


Have a firm handshake. Not too strong, not too weak––a handshake speaks volumes about your self confidence. In particular, a floppy handshake will cause the interviewer to feel that you aren't really into this interview from the start.

, If you have a few hiccups in your resume, a long stretch of time out of work, or questionable happenings that may not be in writing but are likely to be known in the industry, don’t excuse them with self-effacing excuses. Interviews are a moment of self sales pitching, and making comments about your lack of skills, lack of confidence and not feeling worthy will scare the employer off––remember that they have a wide choice of people and understanding your personal issues isn't their top priority.


See a recruitment counselor, coach or therapist if the job seeking is bringing you down. It is important to get your anger, frustration, shyness, etc. dealt with away from the interview situation and the professionals in these fields are there to do just that. They can make a difference, especially if you start ruminating too much and begin to see the whole search as hopeless.

, Things go wrong at work for everyone at times. Sometimes, they are wrong enough to cause you to want to leave a job or to end up in being fired. Yet, a potential employer isn't going to feel reassured if you explain that the reason for no longer being in your old job is because ""X did such and such to me"". Once you start placing blame or making excuses, you're going to look weak, lacking in the ability to be either a team player or to lead/manage, and you'll most likely come across as desperate. Avoid placing blame on someone else. Regardless of the situation, never tell your interviewer that you lost your job or a project fell apart due to the incompetence of another person. Instead, be confident when you state the facts and explain what it would take to create a successful situation (if you were able to do it over again).


Don’t just blame the economy or the job market. Once again, blame is typically frowned upon during an interview as it's an indicator of a wider tendency to place blame rather than accept responsibility––something few employers want to see in their employees. Your interviewer knows that the economy is down in the dumps and that jobs in various industries are scarce, so pointing out this obvious fact, or making it the reason you're unemployed, will only have a negative effect on your interview.
Never badmouth another person or previous employer in order to lay blame for a mistake. Employ the cardinal rule of “never burning your bridges”, no matter how much another person tormented you or perhaps even sabotaged your life. If you badmouth another, you may end up looking like a whiner, bad guy or worse... a victim.

, The best way to approach feeling nervous, being asked challenging questions and worrying about your general prospects, is to remain calm and cool during your interview. Don’t dwell on problems in the past. Instead, punctuate your strengths and play up what you can bring to the potential employer’s company now and for the future.


In preparation for an interview, write out your strengths on paper. This will help you to identify them, as well as giving you the chance to focus on those that truly stand out for you in relation to the particular job you're interviewing for. Read through these strengths many times and elaborate on them out loud, as if talking to the interviewer. The more that you know this aspect of yourself inside out, the easier it will flow for you during the interview.
Do the same preparation for common interview questions. Write them down and write down answers. Then role play scenarios in the lead-up to the interview so that when you're actually asked the questions, they are already familiar to you and you feel calm in answering them. There will always be questions that differ from those you've prepared for, but you will have enough basic material well ordered in your head to work from that these shouldn't throw you.
Do plenty of background research into the company you're applying for. If they ask you what their last year's sales figures were, what their corporate logo means, who started the company and why, what the corporate philosophy is, etc., you'll know if you've read their website and annual report or equivalent, inside out. While researching, never hesitate to call the company with factual questions that need clarification. It is better to have shown the initiative to find out than to panic and go blank.

, There are certain phrases and language that are definitely off limits if you don’t want to look desperate. These include:


Stop yourself from saying that you’ll “do anything” to land the job. As opposed to having the right experience or education to handle the job, telling the employer you’ll literally do anything to land it may turn him or her off. It suggests that you no longer have credible skills or value yourself enough.
On the other hand, don't oversell yourself. Identify your strengths, but be humble when talking about your accomplishments. If you come on too strong you’ll look desperately aggressive––and possibly a little scary. Nobody wants to hear a narcissistic rant about how brilliant you are or how you single-handedly saved the company; keep it realistic and always remember that it takes a village as far as the interviewer is concerned.
Monitor how many times you communicate that you are the right person for the job. It’s okay to let the prospective employer know that you're the ideal fit for the job (after you’ve discussed the dimensions of the job as compared to your qualifications), but it will look like you are laying it on too thick if you keep telling him or her that you're the best person for the job after each statement or comment. Spread it thinly––they hear you.

, Sometimes desperation shows in the little things you after a perfectly well presented answer––things best left unsaid. For example, you might have just explained why you want the job to the interviewers and really impressed them. And then, you add a final comment like ""because my current job is just crazy and I don't really know why I'm still doing it."" You've just undone all the good that came from what you said! Throwaway comments, even if a poor attempt at humor, are nervousness creeping in. Consciously avoid this nervous tic, as it's what the interviewer will remember.


Don't try to turn the interviewer into your co-conspirator. It may feel tempting to try to get the interviewer ""on side"" but the fact you've got an interview should already reassure you that they're interested enough. By saying things like ""you know what I mean"", or ""I'm sure you know the kind of thing I'm talking about"" or ""I bet you've had a similar experience"", etc., you cross a line from formal discussion into informal and rather invasive presumptions about the interviewer. You're not there to know their mind; rather, they're there to get to know yours. Doing this won't win you a friend and it may lose you the job.

, Body language (demeanor) and the manner in which you speak can be a dead giveaway that you're feeling “desperate.” Practice a role play interview in front of the mirror, seated. Notice how you're coming across when you say certain things, such as describing why you want the job, talking about the company's background and answering standard (or not-so-standard) interview questions. You might even video yourself using your computer. Whatever method you use, look for body and demeanor tell-tale signs of confidence or desperation. For example, a confident interviewee will sit tall but not rigidly, will lean slightly in toward the interviewers and will smile more often than not. A desperate interviewee might fidget, look down, push the chair back a little and make poor eye contact.


Breathe regularly and slow down while you're talking. One of the telltale signs of desperation and anxiety is talking too fast and/or sounding like you're trying to get as much information out as fast as possible (so that you don’t forget what you wanted to say). Without being overly obvious, take a breath before you speak and consciously try to control the speed in which the words leave your mouth. It is okay to ask for a moment to restore your composure if you feel blank or overly nervous.
Never interrupt and never talk over the interviewer or answer questions too quickly. You may be overly enthusiastic about making sure the interviewer knows you're qualified, which may prompt you to talk over what he or she is saying. Or, your might try to jump in and answer questions before the interviewer finishes asking them. This will worry the interviewer that you're impatient, incapable of listening or just plain rude. Slow down, you will still get across everything in the time given.
Gently place your hands in your lap and relax. The idea is that if you appear relaxed but confident, your interviewer will see you as a viable candidate that could be an asset to the company. Relaxed people reassure others, so above all, work on looking confidently relaxed.
Sit tall, but avoid looking too stiff. Posture is an important subconscious indicator of a person's sense of self worth. Don’t lean too far forward or slouch––either position will give off the wrong signal that you're desperate or have simply given up.

, Once again, the rules of dating apply. Without stating that you're interviewing with other firms, give your prospective employer the impression that other companies––possibly competitors, are pursuing you (even if they aren’t).


Bring your planner to the interview (that should be filled with “appointments”) to make sure your interviewer doesn’t think your dance card isn’t filled.
If the interviewer calls you back, don’t jump to answer the phone on the first ring. In fact, let the first call go to voicemail, listen to what the interviewer has to say and then call back within a few hours. If you do answer the phone, always ask for time to consider their offer.
Give the impression that you're fielding offers. Listen intently to what the interview has to offer and say. If he or she makes you an offer, thank the interviewer and ask if you can call him or her back later that day. Don’t wait too long or else the employer may think you aren’t interested, however don’t just jump with an answer of “yes” the minute the interviewer presents the offer. You still want to obtain the best scenario for you.

, Calling your interviewer from your car five minutes following your discussion will most certainly make you look desperate. When it comes to follow up, apply a few rules typically reserved for dating:


Contact your interviewer after 48 hours of your interview with a thank you phone call and brief card. Don’t jump on the horn immediately but don’t drag your feet with follow up. A two business day wait time will make you still appear interested in the job but not desperate. Also, the two-pronged follow-up allows you to verbally touch base and answer any questions the interviewer may have, and the card keeps you front and center on paper.
Avoid re-stating why you should have the job. Instead focus on why you enjoyed meeting the interviewer. Your interviewer most likely knows the reasons why you want the job (based on your interview), so re-stating those reasons during your follow up may lend you toward appearing desperate. Instead, just re-iterate that you enjoyed meeting him/her and mention that you are open to any questions not covered during the interview.
Only follow up once, but make sure your follow-up left a positive (and not desperate) impression. If you follow up two days later but don’t hear anything a day or two later, leave it alone. At this point the interviewer knows you're very interested in the job and if you keep calling and/or following up, he or she may get annoyed with you. Also, when you make that follow up call, be upbeat and to the point. Tell the interviewer you were touching base in case he or she had any additional questions, and then mention something about the positive exchange you had.

Write down your greatest achievements and strengths.,
Talk about your work experience.,
Write out and memorize your pitch.,
Use your pitch to answer commonly asked questions.",How to Answer Tough Questions in an Interview1," Talking about your strengths and positive accomplishments may be harder than you think. To prepare for questions regarding this, you should write down a list of your greatest strengths and achievements., Write down the most relevant work experiences you've had, and strengths that have followed you from job to job. Adding a recent concrete example of a recent work experience will give credence to your pitch., Once you've written down all the elements to your pitch, you can put it together into a cohesive statement. Start with an introductory statement about your experience, and then talk about your positive personality traits. Try to frame your experience in a realistic and concrete way.


An example of a good pitch would be something like ""I'm a 30 year veteran in writing and editing. My last job was as a senior editor at Shark Publishing Co. While I was there, I wrote over 30 different published manuscripts and manuals. One of the best things about me is that I'm a hard worker and always meet deadlines. As an example, last year we had a deadline that we didn't get the details for until two days beforehand. I worked 12 hours straight to make sure that the content got in on time.""

, You can use your pitch to answer questions like ""Tell me about yourself,"" ""What experience do you have that would help you in this role?"" and ""What are your greatest accomplishments?""

"
"
Prepare for interview questions that probe your weaknesses.,
Highlight your professional growth over your shortcomings.,
Practice talking about negative experiences in a positive light.,
Don't be disingenuous when answering.",How to Answer Tough Questions in an Interview2," Typical questions include ""Tell me about a time when you failed,"" ""Why did you leave your last job?"" and ""What are your greatest weaknesses?"" Take these questions into consideration and start to form answers to them.


These questions aren't aimed to make you feel bad or for you to reveal your current weaknesses, but are meant to expose how you learn from mistakes and how well you rebound from failure.

, When asked about weaknesses or mistakes that you've made in the past, make sure to highlight how these challenges made you grow professionally. Employers are looking for areas where you believe you could use improvement, as well as how well you can rebound from failure.If asked about why you left your last job, you can talk about limitations on your growth or advancement in the company.
If you've miscommunicated on a team and it led to a failure, don't talk about the failure as much as you talk about how it taught you that communication is critical.

, If you've ever had a negative experience, there was probably something to be learned. Instead of emphasizing the negative experience, practice talking about what you were able to get out of the experience.To explain a weakness, you can say something like ""When we worked on the project at Boeing I was new at working in conjunction with a team. I didn't communicate my part of the project as well as I should have, so it affected our results. The experience helped me get used to effectively communicating with others, even if I wasn't great at it to begin with.""

, When employers ask about your weaknesses, don't take a positive and try to frame it as a negative for the question. This comes off as disingenuous. An example of this would be ""I work so hard that sometimes I overwork."" Instead, be realistic and concrete, and use specific examples whenever you can to explain the weakness.

"
Evaluate the meaning behind the question.,
Don't talk badly about past co-workers.,
Have humility and confidence when answering questions about yourself.,
Give specifics when asked questions about your industry.,
Understand the person interviewing you.",How to Answer Tough Questions in an Interview3," Often an interviewer will ask you a question to get more information about your personality, aptitude, and experience. Sometimes the question is aimed at learning something that isn't apparent. Think about the actual meaning behind each question before you give your response, and cater your answer to what they are actually asking., Blaming past coworkers for your own shortcomings could signal to the employer that you don't take responsibility for your actions and aren't a team player. Instead, talk about how their communication or management style didn't mesh well with yours, and emphasize how you were able to adapt and accomplish goals, even though this was so.If the interviewer asks ""What did you dislike most about your last boss?"" they want to understand your expectations of management and understand which management styles you have trouble working with.
You can answer ""Tell me about your worst boss"" by saying something like ""I had a boss who communicated differently than me. I learned that you have to be able to adapt to different personalities if you want a project to get done on time.""

, If they ask, ""Why are you better than anyone else for this job?"" they are looking to gauge your level of confidence and humility to see if you can fulfill expectations while still being a team player. Talk about your experience and why it makes you capable, but also talk about your passion for learning and getting better at your job.


You can say something like ""I have a decade of experience, and I work well with other people. Also, you won't meet a person more passionate about this than I am.""

, Sometimes an interview will contain specific questions regarding your industry. These questions are designed to see if you understand the current standards and practices of the industry as well as your experience level. Make sure to have a solid grasp of the specific technical and operational aspects of your potential job.Jobs where you may be expected to have an intimate knowledge of your industry include biotech, pharma, business, coding, IT, medical, design, and many more.

, Think of the goal of the interviewer and what they need out of a person to successfully fulfill the role. They also want to make sure that you would be a good team member and pleasant to work with. Think about what would benefit them the most, depending on what role they have in the company, and cater your answers to their role.For example, an HR manager wants to know that you can communicate well with others and can adhere to the company culture.
A director of a department will want you to communicate well and accomplish results in a safe and effective way.
An external recruiter will want to know that you have the experience for the job and are a good candidate to send to the employer.

"
"
Stay calm.,
Use a past experience to answer the question.,
Try to answer truthfully.",How to Answer Tough Questions in an Interview4," Sometimes an interviewer will ask you a question that is entirely unrelated to your industry or to the job that you're applying for. This is usually to see how you handle pressure and how you will react to the situation. The most important thing is to stay calm and to act like the question doesn't phase you.Hiring managers want to see if you will become flustered or frustrated by the question.

, If you can, try to answer the question by thinking of a situation in your life that relates to it. For example, the hiring managers at Mastercard ask employees ""What do you do if you are approached by an employee who is complaining about a colleague who has horrible body odor?"" You could answer by saying something like ""Well, I actually had this issue in Highschool, and I was the smelly kid. The kids actually got me more interested in different sprays and colognes while we were in the locker room, and it helped me a lot. So I'd probably do something like that."", Sometimes these questions are aimed to see what kind of person you'd be like to work with. For that reason, when given a strange or curveball question, just try to answer truthfully without coming off as disrespectful.


For example, Whole Foods Market hiring managers ask ""Would you rather fight 1 horse-sized duck, or 100 duck-sized horses?"" You could say something like, ""A horse-sized duck would be terrifying and horrifying. I'd definitely go with the 100 duck-sized horses."""
"
Research the company that is interviewing you.,
Practice answering questions before the interview.,
Prepare well in advance.,
Be prepared to give your desired salary.",How to Answer Tough Questions in an Interview5," Candidates who know about the business will stand out from their competitors. Do a search for the company's website and get a sense of their core values, company culture, target customers, and the products or services they provide.As you do your research, write down any questions that you have so that you can ask the interviewer during the interview.
An excellent question to ask the interviewer at the end of the interview is something like ""What does it take for an individual to succeed in this role?""
Search online for the most commonly asked questions in your industry and for your role.

, Practice answering tough interview questions in front of a mirror or record yourself using your webcam. Examine your body language, vocal tone, and face to see if you are doing anything strange or seem to lack confidence. Try to be open, have a smile on your face, and speak in a clear voice. Rehearse answering questions in front of family or friends and get their opinion.Confidence can be exhibited by your voice, body language, and facial expressions.

, The more prepared you are, the calmer you'll be in the interview. Memorize the name of the person who is interviewing you, make sure to select an outfit, and print out or look up directions the day before your interview. Before you go into the interview, review the job description again so that it's fresh in your mind.If you are nervous because you are late or unprepared, you'll have a harder time answering tough questions.

, While you should never bring up salary without being prompted, having the answer in your head will make answering this tough question easier. Make sure that in addition to a monetary salary, you also have an answer for the things you'd want in benefits or additional bonus compensation if it's applicable to the job."

Envelope Stuffing - The victim pays a ""registration fee"" then is told to post an ad similar to the one the victim responded to in order to gain more ""registration fees"".







Medical Billing - The victim is asked to pay a fee in order to do the work.





;
, Is the salary in line with the going rate for comparable work in your area? Is it advertising that you can work from home or some other attractive perk? If so, look for, or ask about, good reasons that the pay is higher: does the job include some special duty or require qualifications that might warrant higher pay, or is it just bait?

, Many job listings require that a candidate be over the age of 18, and that's nothing new, but a real job listing should also list qualifications and job duties that describe the job itself. Generic job listings may be an attempt to draw in as many prospective targets as possible.

, Never send bank or credit card information, either. Either request should be a red flag that something is wrong. You should not have to pay for software, a credit check, a resume tune-up, job information, or anything else in order to get a job. You should not be asked to open or change a bank account.


Legitimate employers will often even pay your travel expenses if they ask you to travel out of your area for the interview.






Legitimate employers, if they require anything to do with a bank account, will ask for a voided check in order to set up direct deposit. This is standard, and it should happen in the first couple of weeks of working there. You should never need to open a bank account, transfer funds, or send money during a job application process.







,


Most companies, especially larger ones, will have job openings posted through their own websites. In the U.S., all government jobs are publicly posted, as well.If you find listings on job boards, look for the original. Sometimes scammers use big company names to draw people's attention.






Ask if a company is really hiring through a particular recruitment or placement firm, too.

, Does the service cost anything? If so, how much? Is there any refund if the process is unsuccessful? Remember that many recruiters are paid when they successfully find and hire a candidate into a client company. If a firm is asking a job hunting candidate to pay, why?

, If they found you on Linkedin, check their profile there.

, If you're applying at Acme, you should see email from an @acme.com or similar address, not from a personal email account., Look for bad grammar and poor English. Real recruiters and companies may occasionally send typos, but be on the lookout for communications riddled with misspellings, poor punctuation and English grammar.

, If you are offered a job, ask to receive the offer in writing, including the salary, before you begin working. A firm which is hiring you legitimately will not hesitate to supply a written offer, and it will protect you if you are not paid.

, You may begin working before all the paperwork is finalized. Benefits, especially, may not take effect right away, but you can generally expect to see an employment contract during your first couple of days at work. If you are promised benefits and don't see applications for them within the first week or so, ask.


You are not a volunteer but an employee. Even if your work begins with training or with a provisional or trial period, you should still be paid for that time.







, If you spot a questionable post on a job board, report it or flag it on the job board. If you are taken in by a scammer, you can report it to the FTC (in the US)., Does the pay and benefits sound great and work sound easy?






Are you offered an interview via instant messenger? Yahoo instant messenger is very popular among scammers, so be especially cautious if any part of the process involves Yahoo instant messenger.






Do communiques use a personal email address? If any non-company email addresses are involved in the search process, it is probably a scam..







, To seem legitimate the scammer may list job requirements and qualifications that are broad and vague and that almost anyone can meet.

Be ready to answer follow-up questions.","How to Answer ""Tell Me Something About Yourself"" in a Job Interview"," If you’re really not sure where you’re going with your answer, ask the interviewer to clarify what they’re looking for. You might find that they specifically want to hear about your personality, or they may want to know the ins and outs of your last job.

Be careful when asking for clarification. Don’t say the question didn’t make sense or that it’s too vague. Instead offer specific things that may help guide your answer: “I’d love to do that, did you want to know more about my professional experience or my personal interests?”;
, This gives a more casual start to your answer, and makes you seem like a more well-rounded person. Try and stick with hobbies and interests that you can link to the job opening, but always be authentic. Don’t pretend to be interested in softball just because the interviewer has a little league trophy on their desk.For example, if you’re applying for a job in the finance sector, it’s a good idea to talk about your personal investments.

, This is especially important if you have a particular cause you care deeply about; it adds another level to your character. Focus on specific tasks you had as a volunteer and mention your best accomplishments.

This is crucial if you don’t have a lot of work experience. Volunteer experience can help you put emphasis on qualities you want prospective employers to know about.
Whether you worked in a soup kitchen or organized an entire fundraising event, most volunteer experiences can be a great opportunity to outline your strengths., More than anything, the way you frame your professional history will show how fit you are for the job. This is your chance to reference skills that are relevant to the job opening and show how you handled difficult workplace conflicts. Always make sure to spin these situations positively.

Don’t make the mistake of saying you didn’t learn anything from a previous job. You should be able to draw a lesson from any work experience.
A great way to spin workplace conflicts positively is to focus on the concrete actions you took to resolve it. Did you go to your boss, respecting the chain of command? Or maybe you proposed the perfect compromise?, Answering the interviewer’s question with rapid fire facts is sure to bore them and make you seem uninteresting. Use lighthearted humor that’s relevant to the conversation; don’t go into a monologue about your dog. The key is to use humor to offset situations where you’re doubtful or uncomfortable.

For example, if an interviewer asks if you’d have a problem with working weekends, you can answer something along the lines of: “I can’t miss Sunday night football!”. Then mention that you’re kidding, and outline examples where you sacrificed weekends for work., The whole reason you want to prepare your answer is to avoid hesitating when the question comes. You want to show whoever’s asking that you’re confident and self-aware enough to answer their question quickly and efficiently. Confidence in job interviews is something that comes with time. Until then, “fake it till you make it.” Think of yourself as a confident person and you will become confident.

Keep your answer to 60 seconds tops. Otherwise you risk rambling and making the resulting answer unclear., Write down a list of good qualities about yourself that show you’re just right for the job. Anything that comes to mind should be jotted down until you run out of ideas. Skills and abilities generally fall into three main qualities:


Knowledge-Based Skills. These are skills that you learn as you mature and include languages, computer skills, mathematical reasoning, and technical know-how.
Transferable Skills. These are skills that you take from job to job. They include people management skills, communication, and problem solving.
Personal Traits. Your unique, innate qualities including your sociability, confidence, excitability, and punctuality., Your answer shouldn’t just be about your skills and qualifications. While the interviewer is trying to get a sense of what you’ll be like at work, you need to give them a sense that you’re a complete person. Come up with a list of things you are passionate about and keywords that you think describe you best.


If you’re having difficulty coming up with these things, ask yourself what inspires you, what you’re passionate about, and what defines you., After you’ve chosen things that are relevant to the job posting, you need to compare what you’ve come up with to the company you’re applying to and see what sticks.Research the company’s values. Each company has a culture, and you can pick up on this in their job posting as well as their website. Companies that value efficiency above all will prioritize performance while a non-profit may pay more attention to passion and drive.
Look at the job specifications. For example, if you're applying for a marketing position, you probably should be outgoing, excellent at communication, relationship-driven, and fast-paced. Make sure you have at least one of these characteristics in mind for the interview.

, An elevator pitch is a short (30 seconds to 1 minute) summary of who you are and what you do. It should include what you stand for, who you are, and how your ambitions stand in line with those aspects of your personality. It's what you can meaningfully tell someone about yourself on an elevator ride from the ground to the top floor.


The best elevator pitches focus on just a few key aspects. Think of one characteristic that defines who you are, one that characterizes what you do, and one that illustrates your goals.
An elevator pitch will be useful outside of job interviews as well, so spend some time working on it., One of the best ways to be prepared for this question at an interview is to practice your answer. Have your friend pretend they’re the interviewer. When they ask, “OK, well how about you tell me something about yourself?” give them your answer.


Once you’ve answered, ask for honest feedback. Try and get your friend to give you their overall impression of the answer, as well as telling you any specifics that should be added or left out.
You can also practice answering follow-up questions by having your friend ask you questions about your answer.

, The interviewer will most likely ask the question early on in the interview, so you might not have much to work with. Some interview settings will call for a polished sales pitch while others will require a more casual touch.


Here’s an example of a polished sales pitch: ""I'm a consultant working in telecommunications. For the past three years, I've been helping clients organize their workforce and restructure their pricing packages in order to boost profit. I love consulting, but my real passion is music, and I want to use my talents within that industry. That's why I'm applying to your organization.""

, Whether it’s in your elevator pitch, your strengths or your weaknesses, don’t lie. If the interviewer catches your lie, you won’t be getting the job. If they don’t, you’ll have to try and keep up the lie while you work. Eventually you’ll be found out, and you may end up losing the job anyway., Whatever you say, do so with feeling and with authenticity. Your interviewer will be more sympathetic to what you say if the way you say it rings true to them.

, Buzzwords or jargon are catchwords that are trendy to say but that don't really mean anything. They’re often bland, and not usually relevant to a particular industry. Stick to terms and expressions that are specific to your industry. It’ll show off your knowledge more than trying to add buzzwords to your vocabulary.

, The goal of answering this question isn't just to get information about who you are. It's about how confident you are, how well you speak, whether you’re calm and deliberate, and whether you can establish a rapport with the interviewer.


If you do happen to mumble an answer or say something you didn’t mean to, laugh it off. Chuckle and say something like ""Boy did I get tongue-tied for a minute there."" Then move on, showing that you are confident in yourself and that one little slip up isn’t the end of the world to you.

, A lot of the time, hiring managers hire people that they like over people better qualified for the job. Your job here is to be likable. This means smiling and being confident enough to hold eye contact with your interviewer.


Smile. Smiling will help you feel calmer. Smiling will also help you put the interviewer at ease and perhaps even make them happier. It’ll make you come across as a warmer, happier person, helping to set a more relaxed atmosphere.

, If your interviewer wants to clarify something, or maybe even test you about an item in your elevator pitch, be prepared. You should know your elevator pitch inside and out and always be ready to defend it under scrutiny.

Turn monotonous tasks into games.Be playful and try to have fun.



Play pranks on your coworkers. Have fun, but make sure not to do anything that will get you fired! Unless, of course, you want to get fired.

, Think about your friends, your family, and your community. Bring your attention to your hobbies and passions.

Optimism asks you to look at the big picture, but living in the moment involves looking at the tiniest picture possible. See if there is a way for you to cope with this job by accepting your place in the present.Do not dwell on the past. Whenever negative past events pop into your mind, bring your attention back to the task at hand. Similarly, don't imagine about the future. Oftentimes we imagine future events that never happen, so we worry for nothing.
Living in the moment is not always easy to do. Meditation or mindfulness meditation can help.

, Perhaps you hate your job even more because you feel that you need it to survive. Don't be a slave to the job! Your livelihood is, of course, essential to keeping yourself afloat and maintaining your lifestyle – but living in fear is no way to live. Consider which you value more: freedom or stability. Happiness or safety?

, Prayer can help you get through the toughest of times. It can help to ease the mind of all tension, and it may lighten your heart. Change your attitude to, ""Yes, there is going to be a happy ending."" Keep an eye out for the wonderful opportunities that you encounter on the way!"

Though some companies have policies against giving overtime hours to employees, many will allow you to do so. If your company is receptive to the idea of you working overtime, ask your supervisor for permission right away. Not only will this show your boss that you're willing to go that all-important extra step to get the job done, but it will also give you a nice bump in your next paycheck.


In the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) dictates that employees that work more than 40 hours in a given week will receive at least one and a half times their base pay for the additional hours worked. Though individual states may have laws that differ, eligible employees are legally entitled to the federal one and a half rate if it is higher than state law allows.Note that overtime generally is only an option for hourly employees—salaried employees don't necessarily get paid more for working longer hours. If you're salaried, you may instead want to ask your supervisor for a bonus for performing extra work.;
, Generally, managers and supervisors love it when their employees take on additional responsibilities without being told to do so. Doing so shows initiative, intelligence, and ambition. If executed correctly, it can also make life easier for your boss which can earn you his or her respect as well as more tangible rewards. However, when pursuing new projects, be careful not to overstep your authority or embarrass other employees. Your goal is to be ambitious; not arrogant. Below are just a few ideas to get you started:


Present your boss with a report detailing ways that have made your work more efficient, then suggest ways to use your ideas throughout the work place.

Organize and run meetings to help you work effectively on other projects without bothering your boss.
Brainstorm to create a list of strategies for increasing the company profits.
Organize internal office events (birthday parties, holidays, and so on).

, It's much, much easier to work effectively if you have a positive relationship with your colleagues. This means making an effort to have friendly, positive interactions with everyone on a regular basis. At the very least, you should strive to spend meal breaks with your coworkers on most days. Use these opportunities to get to know your coworkers through small talk and friendly conversation. If you can't think of anything to say, you can always ask about the food they're eating.


If you find that you enjoy talking to your coworkers, you may want to invite them to spend time with you outside of work. For instance, you can invite them to get drinks with you, to play a game of golf (or your preferred sport), or to visit a mutual acquaintance. However, if you don't see yourself being a close friend to your coworkers, this isn't absolutely necessary.

, Work can often seem like one long chain of looming deadlines—daily duties need to be finished by the time you leave each day, minor projects need to be finished by the end of the week, major projects need to be finished by the end of the month, and so on. If you can manage to complete your work earlier than you're required to, not only will you make a great impression on your superiors, but you'll also give yourself a chance to take on additional responsibilities, which can in turn increase your profile at work. When your superiors are giving out promotions, they're likely to consider the hard-working, prompt employees first. Make sure you're at the top of their list by gaining a reputation for delivering high-quality work with a quick turnaround.


While it's a great idea to make a habit of turning in projects early, be careful not to do this too much. If you turn in every single project early, your superiors may get the impression that they're not giving you enough to do and may increase your workload, making you work more for the same pay. If you can, try to focus on turning in only the most important, attention-grabbing projects early.

, As noted above, most managers and supervisors respect hard work, ambition, and creativity. If you're looking to get ahead at work, there's hardly a better way to do it than by giving your managers more than what they expect. Doing this shows that you're serious about your commitment to your job and that you're a valuable employee who does more than others who deliver what is asked. However, as when attempting to finish projects early, you'll need to balance your ambition with the reality that consistently working extremely hard can be tremendously taxing on the body and mind. Try to reserve your absolute best efforts for important projects that are likely to be noticed and appreciated. Below are just a few ideas:


If asked to present a report of internal company data, do your own independent research and extrapolate meaningful take-aways from your results.
If asked to clean up a cluttered storeroom, develop your own system for organizing the items and write out directions so others can use the system.
If sales figures for your company are slipping, develop and test your own sales techniques, then share them with your coworkers.

, When most people get home from a long day on the job, more work is the last thing they have on their mind. However, if you can stand to do so, occasionally doing additional work at home can separate you from the pack. This can be in the form of telecommuting to meetings from your home computer, doing additional research or analysis ""homework"" for important projects, taking important business calls, and more.


If you have a family, you'll want to avoid doing excessive amounts of work at home. While a single person can get away with doing lots of extra work at home, the commitments of a family can make it difficult to devote your entire attention to your work when you're at home. The exception to this rule, of course, is if the nature of your job requires you to do most or all of your work from home.

, Though there are plenty of exceptions to the rule, in general, people are somewhat shallow, especially if they know you in a formal business context. If you dress in a serious, dignified manner, people (including your bosses and coworkers) are more likely to treat you seriously. This doesn't necessarily mean that you need to wear tailored suits to work every day—expensive is not always better. Unless you've got the cash for a seriously high-class wardrobe, you're probably better off sticking with one of the affordable yet dignified options below:



For men - It's hard to go wrong with a plain pair of khakis or slacks and a modest dress shirt. For extra class, you may want to consider adding a jacket and a tie. If you work at a casual place of business (like an internet startup), you may be able to get away with an outfit as informal as a T-shirt and shorts. It is a good rule of thumb, though, to dress one station higher than your current position, that is—dress on a par with the most sartorial stylish of your bosses' colleagues.

For women - A long-sleeved shirt and skirt combination works well in most offices. Conservative dresses are also a good option. Suits and pantsuits are smart choices for jobs that require you to interact with the public. While casual jobs may allow you to get away with a T-shirt and jeans, it is best to not go that route, or step it up a notch with a bit dressier attire.

, In addition to dressing to fit the part of a serious, dedicated employee, you'll want to ensure that your deportment also gives this impression. To a certain extent, others' opinions of you are shaped by your opinion of yourself. Thus, treating whatever you're doing at the moment as highly important is a great way to make other people in the office realize that you are important. Try adopting the following habits to ensure that people think of you as an indispensable employee:


Walk briskly and with purpose, even if you're just heading to the cooler to get a drink of water.
Articulate clearly and confidently.
When you walk past people, greet them warmly, but keep walking.
Sit up straight in your chair when at your desk.

, For the most part, unless they have delicate egos, bosses appreciate receiving feedback from their employees—positive or negative. Offering your opinions occasionally shows that you're engaged in your job and that you care what happens to yourself and to the company. Depending on the company morale at your workplace, this can noticeably set you apart from the majority of employees. Below are a few ideas for when and where it's appropriate to express yourself:


At company strategy meetings, offer ideas for how the company can make itself more competitive.
Ask intelligent questions whenever you are unsure of how to proceed in your work. This can make you look especially good if you do so when others seem reluctant to pose their own questions (like during an awkward silence following a tense meeting).
If you're unhappy about some aspect of your job, talk to your supervisor about changing it. However, don't be offended if you receive a ""no"".

, Taking on new responsibilities at work can be quite challenging, especially before you've had time to adjust to a new role. However, if you're successfully able to perform your new duties, you'll be rewarded with recognition, a more important position at your business, and (possibly) more money. However, in seeking new responsibilities, be sure not to over-extend yourself by biting off more than you can chew. Make sure that you can handle the additional workload before taking on new responsibilities or you run the risk of having to ask for less work, which can be embarrassing on a professional level.


If there aren't any obvious ways to expand your current responsibilities at work, try asking your supervisor directly for more responsibilities. There's a significant chance that she or he will be able to assign you additional work, and even if she or he can't, you'll be noticed for taking the initiative to ask for it.

, If you work hard, you deserve to be recognized for it. However, in the hustle and bustle of the work week, good work can easily go unnoticed. Don't let your accomplishments get swept under the rug. Instead, look for excuses to showcase your efforts. Try to bring up successful projects in ways that make it clear that you are responsible for the success without seeming like a braggart. If you've actually done a good job, you have no need to be embarrassed by doing so. Below are just a few opportunities where you may have the opportunity to show off your good work:


If you've completed a project and haven't received much recognition, try sharing it with others via a group email. You can easily pose your email as a mere ""keeping everyone up to speed"" message while ensuring that important coworkers and supervisors see your work.
If you've completed a project that is relevant to a new project being discussed, bring up your old work as an example of how to proceed or as guidance for new areas of work to explore.

, Having an upbeat, positive attitude in the workplace isn't just a way to appear energetic and motivated to others, it's also a way to keep your own spirits up and make yourself a more effective worker. If you go out of your way to be friendly, you'll have an easier time interacting with other employees and they will also generally find it easier to work with you. This makes it easier to collaborate or ask for help on projects, thereby increasing your productivity. Finally, it's worth noting that you're more likely to receive rewards and promotions if you're well-liked.


While you'll want to make an effort to be friendly, you'll want to stay away from touchy topics of conversation and racy humor. Getting a quick laugh isn't worth sabotaging your efforts by offending a coworker or showing a lack of sensitivity.

, There's no reason to spend hours and hours at work if you can't get anything done while you're working. Ensure that you're a productive worker by removing any and all distractions that might sidetrack your efforts to get your work done. Some ideas for eliminating some of the most common distractions for workers are listed below:


Reduce the distraction of idle noise/chatter at the workplace by using headphones or earplugs or moving to a different work area.
Cordially tell the persistent conversationalists that you're busy and will be able to talk when you're done. Alternatively, try placing a sign at your desk or work area politely notifying others not to disturb you.
Install productivity add-ons and site-blocking programs to your browser to circumvent the tendency to pursue internet diversions (games, social media, and other time drains).

, If you're having trouble staying motivated to work hard, deciding on a specific goal and deadline can help you get out of the workday doldrums and focus on the task at hand. When choosing goals, be ambitious, but have a firm grasp of what you can and can't achieve in a given time frame. Setting goals that are out of your reach is setting yourself up for failure, which can cause you to feel like an under-achiever. It is likely that setting goals too high will end up hurting your morale and make it even more difficult to stay motivated in the long run.

, Sometimes, important projects can seem so large and intimidating that it's difficult to tell where to start. In these cases, it can be helpful to focus on some small but significant aspect of the project and complete this first. Completing this small part of the larger project gives you a sense of achievement that you can use to fuel your motivation as you continue to the rest of the project. You'll also have an idea of which parts of the project are likely to cause problems and can thus dedicate more effort to these things.


For example, if you've been tasked with making a half-hour presentation to a group of high-level company employees, you might want to start by focusing on creating a thorough, detailed outline. Though the outline only represents a fraction of the work needed to prepare for the presentation, it can make the rest of the project easier by guiding your creation of slides, talking points, and so on.

, Leadership is a skill that's desirable in nearly all professions. Supervisors look for employees who have natural leadership abilities when they're looking for employees to reward. Showing leadership at work can get you recognition, more important responsibilities, and even raises and promotions. To demonstrate leadership, make an effort to help others in their duties and to spearhead your own group projects. As noted above, you'll also want to ensure that your leadership is recognized by showing it to others and bringing it up at appropriate opportunities. If you have a reputation as a leader at your workplace, it's usually only a matter of time before you become an actual leader. Below are a few opportunities for leadership:


Take advantage to opportunities to train new employees and help them become acquainted with their duties.
Design your own project, then, with permission from your supervisors, enlist other employees to help you complete it.
Make a point of leading the discussion during group meetings which have no designated leader.

, Workaholics should spend much of their time working, but they shouldn't spend every second of their day working. Occasional breaks recharge your body and mind, ensuring that you're as sharp as possible throughout the day and increasing your long-term productivity. Additionally, breaks help you stay in a good mood, which can be an essential component of staying effective at your job, especially if you work face-to-face with customers. Don't skip your breaks to squeeze in a few more minutes of work—work smarter, not longer.


It's worth noting that you may also be legally obligated to take breaks. In the United States, there are some federal laws dictating the types of breaks an employer is obligated to provide.However, state laws vary from state to state. For instance, in California, employees must take a 30-minute meal break if they work for more than five hours straight unless their total work for the day is less than six hours., During vacations, sick days, days off, and family time, try to work as little as possible, if at all. The periods in which you're off of work are meant to allow you to recharge your energy reserves, reset your attitude, brighten your outlook, and recuperate from the grind of working hard. While some work may be unavoidable, devoting too much of your ""off"" time to work will short-circuit the restorative benefits you might have gained.


To ensure that you're able to stay fully motivated when you're actually at work, allow yourself to enjoy your days off completely work-free.
Keeping your schedule clear during your time off may mean doing additional work before you leave. If this is the case, do as much work as you can before your time off so that you'll be able to spend as little effort worrying about work as possible.

, Nearly every part of a job is more difficult if you're not well-rested. Staying focused during meetings, keeping track of numerous projects, and ensuring your work gets done on time can be challenging when you haven't had sufficient rest. To avoid these problems, try to get a full night of sleep as often as possible (if not every night). Doing so makes it easier for you to stay focused on your work when it really counts—at your job. By keeping your immune system strong, adequate sleep also decreases the likelihood that you'll need to take time off of work because of illness.Though everyone's biological needs are different, most medical sources agree that adults generally need somewhere in the neighborhood of seven to nine hours of sleep on a regular basis for optimal health, mood, and mental function., Though work should be a big focus of a workaholic's life, it shouldn't be his or her only focus. Having friends and hobbies outside of your work life can help keep you motivated at work by keeping you from ""burning out"" from the routine of your job. More importantly, it's a way to enrich your life by increasing both the quality and variety of your experience. People aren't defined solely by the work they complete in their lifetime—they're also defined by the relationships they form, the fun they have, and, most especially, the love they share and the memories they create. Don't spend your entire life working. If you don't have something to work for, what's the point?


Sometimes, people who devote most of their energy to their work have a difficult time making friends outside of work. If this is true for you, don't feel stressed, as this is not uncommon among workaholics. In such situations, you may find that enrolling in a singles club can help you make new connections on a busy schedule.

, Let's face it—not every job is a dream job. Sometimes, the things we do to support ourselves can be very, very different than the things we like to do to find personal fulfillment. However, it's almost always easier to work hard if you can find some reason to invest yourself in your job emotionally, even if the reason is a small one. Look for aspects of your job that give you satisfaction, allow you to take pride in your work, or make the world a better place in some small (but noticeable way).


For instance, if you have a job that's often described as being relatively unimportant—working as a cook at a fast food restaurant, try to focus on the positive, satisfying aspects of the job. For instance, in your position, you're responsible for quickly satisfying hundreds of busy, working people every day. If you don't do a good job, you can easily put some of them in a foul mood, which may affect them in other areas of their life. On the other hand, if you take pride in your work and focus on doing a great job, you can help these hundreds of people have satisfying meals, which can in turn help them be the best that they can be at home and work.

, This is something that many workaholics struggle to do and some fail to do entirely. The work/family balance is one that's sometimes difficult to manage even for people working normal 40 hour per week jobs. For people who work 70 hours per week, striking the right balance can be extremely challenging. However, your family is not something that you should neglect in order to devote extra time to work. Ultimately, the love of a happy family is much more fulfilling than the rewards offered from a demanding job. If you find yourself having to debate whether to spend a few nights every week with your spouse and children or to work extra-long hours to get the promotion you've been eyeing, recognize that your priorities are out of order. Even workaholics should strive to be loving spouses and parents, and sometimes this means shelving the work to make time for the things that really matter.

, Just as it's easier to work hard if you can find satisfaction in your job, it's also easier to work if you give yourself something to work for. For a few lucky people, working is an extremely satisfying activity in and of itself. However, for most, it's often something to be done simply to support oneself and one's family. During the humdrum daily grind of work, it's easy to forget the end purpose of your work. Reminding yourself of the reason why you're working can help you focus and put in the extra effort it takes to get ahead when it really counts.


For example, if you're working to support your children in a job you're not crazy about, you may find it helpful to place a few small pictures of them in your cubicle or work area. When you're having a hard time motivating yourself to stay late or take on an extra project, look at these pictures. They provide a handy reminder of exactly what you hope to achieve by working so hard.

, Once you finish your physical challenges on the ground, you will complete challenges on higher ground.


Use a landing fall platform to develop proper parachute landing techniques. This is an important skill to learn early in training because it will be harder to do once you train on higher ground.
Practice controlling your parachute during a descent. You have to learn this skill before you can continue with jumping off the training towers.
Complete jumps from a 34-foot tower that will allow you to get used to the actual sensation of a parachute jump. This will be your first high jump during your airborne training.

, In the second week, your training will be reinforced with more physical training. The intensity will increase, and training will consist of more off the ground challenges.


Learn how to deal with oscillation and falls upon landing. This is important so that you can make sure you do not get hurt.

Become a U.S. Citizen.,
Be able to acquire security clearance.,
Be willing to relocate.,
Talk with other defense contractors.,
Check on-line job listings.,
Fill out your application completely.,
Be patient.,
Cooperate fully with the security investigation process.",How to Become a U.S. Defense Contractor1," Almost all U.S. defense contractor positions require applicants to be United States citizens. If you are not a native citizen, you can go through the naturalization process to obtain your citizenship, which involves taking an extensive test on English and Civics., You cannot actually obtain a security clearance until you are employed in a government job, or have been sponsored by a company or agency who wishes to hire you. However, you should try to determine if you are eligible for clearance before you begin. If you have previously had a security clearance in the past, this is a good indicator that you will be able to obtain one again. The following are some of the factors that generally prevent a person from obtaining a security clearance:


Past criminal convictions that lead to jail time of 1 year or more.
Current use of illegal or controlled substances.
A determination of mental incompetence by a DoD-approved mental health professional.
A dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces.
Unwillingness to surrender a foreign passport.
Severe, repeated financial problems.
Intentional false statements made in the application process.
Repeated alcohol abuse.
A pattern of criminal or conduct or rule violation.

, Defense contractor jobs are available throughout the world, however, to have the best shot at obtaining the kind of position your are interested in, you should be willing to relocate.

, The best way to learn the ins and outs of becoming a U.S. defense contractor is to talk with people who already have the kind of position you are hoping to land. These individuals can give you insider tips on how to locate jobs, red flags to look for on job listings, and perhaps most importantly, position-specific instructions on how to format your resume and complete your application in a way that gets you hired.

, The Department of Defense maintains a job listing site for civilian employment opportunities with the DoD and all military branches. You can either go to the DoD’s website and click “Employment,” or use the main www.usajobs.gov portal and use the keyword “defense” to look for these jobs. Private companies looking to hire individuals into defense contractor positions usually advertise on major job search websites, like monster.com and indeed.com. Enter “defense contractor” into the search line to locate these positions.

, Government jobs usually involve a notoriously detailed application process. Read the application thoroughly before beginning, and make sure to fill it out completely before submitting it. And be honest in your application; obtaining a defense contractor position will eventually require a thorough background check, and any errors or omissions in your application are likely to be exposed., The hiring process for government jobs moves much more slowly than it does in the private sector. You can expect it to take anywhere from several weeks to a few months to find out if your application made the first cut, and even longer to get all the way through the application and evaluation process. Remember that the payoff in job security, benefits, and salary if you get the job will eventually be worth the wait., If you become a finalist or are offered a position, you will need to complete a rigorous investigation process to obtain security clearance. You must comply with this process fully, answer all questions truthfully and completely, and provide all information that is requested quickly and accurately. It is unfortunate to get through a months-long application process only to lose out at the end over a mistake or omission, but it does happen."

A recruiter will be able to answer any questions you might have about serving in the Army and whether or not being a medic is the right fit. At your initial interview, the will also ask you a number of questions to determine whether you are eligible for serve.The recruiter will ask you about your education level, criminal history, age, marital/dependency status, and your physical condition.
Think of this meeting as a job interview with the recruiter evaluating your fitness to serve.;
, When you meet with the recruiter, it is important to bring required documents. These documents will prove you are who you say you are and ensure that you meet the Army’s requirements.Bring a social security card, driver’s license, high school diploma or GED, and a direct deposit form. If you are married or have children, you will need to bring information about any dependents.
The Army will also run a background check on you.

, Once you have met with the recruiter and provided all necessary documentation, you will schedule a time to take the ASVAB. This multiple choice test will highlight your strengths and pinpoint which Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) or job best suits you. The ASVAB tests your knowledge of subjects like math, science, and reading. It will also test your understanding of electronics as well as mechanical and auto familiarity. In order to be a medic you will need to score a 101 on the Skilled Technical and a 107 on the General Technical sections of the ASVAB., Your recruiter will help you schedule a physical examination at the nearest Military Entrance Processing States (MEPS). They will gauge whether you are healthy enough to serve in the military. They will also evaluate your psychological health as well.During your visit to the MEPS, someone will guide you through which career opportunities will work best for you.
After your passing your physical, you will be sworn into the Army with the official Oath of Enlistment.

, Before you begin your journey to become an Army medic, you should first talk with your parents and other family members about serving in the U.S. military. Discuss with them about your desire to serve and what that means. Joining the U.S. armed forces is not an easy task and one that should not be taken lightly. Talking with others might give you some insights about why you want to serve and what your expectations are.


Chat with family members and friends who have served and inquire about their experiences.

, Once you are accepted into the United States military, you will begin the required physical and mental training to become a soldier. BCT consists of ten weeks of highly intense and challenge physical training as well as integration in the military way of life.BCT occurs at several different locations across the United States.

, Depending on your ASVAB score, education background, and the Army’s needs, you may be selected to become an Army medic. If selected, you will undergo Advanced Individual Training after completing basic training. At AIT, you will learn different medical treatments for wounded soldiers. This period can take 16 to 68 weeks to complete, depending on what different skills or training you complete.Although the Army takes your interests into consideration, there is no guarantee you will get the assignment you desire. The Army makes its assignments based on its needs, as well as your test scores and individual skills.
Building some basic medical skills before entering the service may help you obtain a position as a medic, but it is not a guarantee that you will be placed as a medic.
AIT training occurs at Fort Sam Huston, Texas.
You will be trained to perform basic first aid, bandage wounds, start intravenous lines, and other practical field exercises.
Once you have completed AIT, you will receive the distinct of 68W (68 Whiskey) and be considered an Army Medic.

, Once you have completed AIT, you will be assigned to a unit. Depending on your capabilities and what you want to do, you could be assigned to a number of different roles, ranging from a front-line combat unit to a field hospital. In your new role, you could serve as a flight paramedic, a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN), or many other specialties. Depending on your assignment, you will receive further training specific to your new role.The civilian equivalent of a medic is an EMT.
Again, the Army’s needs, with consideration of your skills, will largely dictate what type of unit you serve in.

, After you are assignment, your unit’s Physician Assistant (PA) may prescribe you advanced training depending on your unit’s role. This will be a series of lectures, seminars, and practical training that teaches you further medical skills.Front-line combat medics receive training in venous cutdowns, the placement of chest tubes, and various methods to control bleeding.
Medics in medical units may learn to administer medications.
Others are trained to serve in field hospitals may learn plaster-casting techniques and the sterilizing of surgical equipment., As a medic, you will be eligible to further your medical training as a Physician Assistant. Once you have completed the equivalent of a bachelor’s degree and met the program’s science requirements, you will be able to apply to the IPAP. After completing the two-year program, you will have a master’s degree, an officer’s commission, and the opportunity to apply for civilian certification.IPAP training also occurs at Fort Sam Huston.

, After completing your training to become an Army medic, you may want to serve as a special operations medic. SOCMs serve as medics in United States Special Forces units. Because these units operate on their own for large stretches of time, SOCMs are required to have a much broader medical knowledge. They need to be able to treat traumatic injuries as well as chromic injuries and illnesses.


These medics receive the skill indentifier “W1” and serve with Special Forces units like the Rangers.

, After completing CBT and AIT, you will volunteer to attend Airborne School, a three week program at Fort Benning, Georgia, where you learn the basic paratrooper training. Receiving and passing military parachutist instruction is a requirement of obtaining further special forces training.Airborne School is also widely known as Jump School.

, Once you are accepted into the special forces training program, you will complete RASP, which is the Army Ranger training program. RASP is a physically and psychologically intensive program designed to prepare typically new recruits for assignment to the 75th Ranger Regiment. All soldiers seeking to be SOCM must complete RASP.


RASP is an eight-week course that is held at Fort Benning, Georgia.

, Before beginning official SOCM training, you will receive a six-week civilian college course in physiology and anatomy at Columbus State University. These courses are designed as a crash course intended to give you base of knowledge about the human body.All classes must be passed with an 80% or higher, or the student will not be able to proceed with their training.

, The SOCM course consists of six 6-week blocks of training and a 4-week clinical rotation. Courses are inter-service and include Special Forces “operators” from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. This is a highly competitive training environment that is both mentally and physically strenuous.The six course blocks for SOCM are EMT-Basic, Anatomy and Physiology, Clinical Medicine, Trauma 1, Trauma 2, and Trauma 3.
Once you have completed SOCM training, you will have the medical knowledge equivalent of a Nurse Practitioner or a Physician Assistant.

Comply with the security clearance process.",How to Become a U.S. Defense Contractor2," The U.S. Government doesn’t just work with major companies. The Department of Defense sets aside a substantial portion of its budget to contracting with small business. Small businesses owned by women, veterans, and minorities are given further advantages in the bid selection process. Working with the DoD can be a real boon for your small business!

, Working with the federal government requires understanding and following a lot of complicated rules and procedures. The U.S. Small Business Administration maintains a comprehensive guide for small business that wish to take on federal contracts.The ACQ also maintains a helpful Guide to DOD Contracting Opportunities.It is important to study and understand these materials before seeking out federal contracts.


The materials noted above are admittedly dense, but know that the paperwork you will need to keep up with to seek and maintain government contracts will be just as bad, so consider these a litmus test for whether or not you are up for the challenge.

, It is important to have a very good understanding of your own company, and what it has to offer, before seeking government contracts. Identify the specific product or services that you can provide, and think about how much you can reasonably charge to do so, and still make a profit.

, Most defense contracts require that some, if not all, of the employees who will be involved in carrying out the contract have security clearance. Think about your own background and any problems that might be present there. If you did not run background checks on your employees when you hired them, you should discuss your intentions to apply for government contracts with them, and let them know that they may be required to obtain security clearance to continue with the company.

, Applying for and carrying out a federal contract requires completing a lot of paperwork, and keeping very careful records. Be sure that you are up for the challenge before proceeding, and budget extra time and resources to dealing with this paperwork., You will need this information to look for contracts, and complete applications. It can be located at www.naics.com/search.

, You will need to apply for a D-U-N-S identification number from the company Dun & Bradstreet.Obtaining your D-U-N-S number is free of charge.

, All federal contracts that go out for bid, including those for the Department of Defense and the Armed Forces, are listed on the “Fed Biz Ops” website www.fbo.gov. Check the site frequently for contracts that your business might be able to compete for.

, These centers are located in most states, and can help you figure out the best way to market your product or service to the DOD. They can also offer more general advice on marketing, and to small business in general.

, Be sure to follow all directions in the call for bids in your proposal, and to clearly and specifically explain how your company can provide the product or service that the agency is seeking. Provide detailed product brochures, and any other helpful materials, and make your presentation as professional and clear as possible.

, Databases are very helpful, but having real human contacts in the defense industry is crucial to getting the inside scoop on upcoming opportunities, and how best to market yourself for open contracts. Identify specific agencies that you would like to contract with, and seek out contacts within them. Attend any events that these agencies might hold, and follow closely any websites or publications they maintain., If you are awarded a contract that requires security clearance, the agency hiring you will send you information on obtaining security clearance for yourself, your company, and your facility, depending on the nature of the contract. Be ready to complete any preliminary paperwork that is requested, and to fully comply with all facets of the investigation. Failure to comply or to pass the investigation process will lead to the revocation of your contract."

Complete a bachelor's degree program at a community college or university.,
And if you do well enough, you might earn a spot at Undergraduate Pilot Training.,
Be in shape.,
Once you've been through all that process, you will find yourself in the last crucible: UPT.,
Then one bright day, you'll walk across the stage in the base theater and receive your first set of silver wings.",How to Become an Air Force Pilot," The second step is earning a commission as an officer (a Second Lieutenant to be precise). You have essentially four choices: The US Air Force Academy (4 years of marching, looking good), The US Merchant Marine Academy and accepting your commission in the Air Force, ROTC (4 years of wearing uniforms to class and saying very un-pilot-like things like ""AirPower,"" marching and well groomed haircuts), OTS (12 weeks of early mornings, vaguely annoyed instructors and a decent salad bar). Your choice: you'll earn a commission no matter which way you go.;
, Things determining that are: Your GPA, Class standing (for USAFA and ROTC), Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) scores, Pilot Composite Selection Method (PCSM) scores, Recommendations.


The AFOQT is a comprehensive, day long test that your recruiter or school can arrange. It measures academic potential as well as a number of measures of piloting skill and problem solving abilities.






The PCSM is part-simulator and part-psych profiler. The final score also includes not only aptitude results but real-world flying experience in the form of hours accumulated in real aircraft. This is the surest way to enhance your chances of being selected. It also happens to be quite fun.







, In order For one to become a USAF pilot, they must achieve the utmost medical, physical, and academic requirements and be at least the rank of Officer in the United States Air Force.

, It's a grueling 54 week ordeal that requires every ounce of energy you can muster and has claimed many students who didn't have the right stuff. You'll work 12 hours a day for 5, 6 or 7 days a week and study an additional 2 or 3 when you get home. You'll think about absolutely nothing but flying airplanes. But that's not to say you won't have fun: flying solo in a jet, being number 2 in a fingertip formation, low-level navigation are just a few of the things that await you. That and the dreaded stand-up interrogations every morning.

, You'll have become one of the best trained and most able pilots in the world. All that remains is to prove yourself in the next airplane you're assigned to.

As a pilot, you may take part in warfare. Your duties include antisubmarine efforts, search and rescue operations, and vertical replenishment operations. Vertical replenishment means transferring cargo and supplies between helicopters.You will also likely conduct surveillance on enemies via collecting photographic evidence.Training is longterm. Throughout your career, you will receive continued, specialized training for the specific plane you operate.You will be in control of all internal and external functions of the aircraft you operate. Using the plane you're flying, you will provide attack and defense support for Navy fleets.;
, Not just anyone can become a Navy pilot. There are certain requirements that must be met in order to qualify for training.


For education, you will need to have at least a bachelor's degree. This can be obtained at a civilian college or the U.S Naval Academy.To enlist in the Navy, you must be at least 18 years of age. You must be commissioned as an officer before you turn 28., The Navy has strict physical fitness requirements for all members. Work on staying physically fit in the time leading up to enlisting and strive to meet the Navy's requirements.


To enlist in the Navy, you have to pass a physical readiness test. This consists of a series of push-ups, sit-ups, and a 1.5 mile run. You will be asked to perform as many sit-ups and push-ups as possible in 2 minutes, and your run will also be timed. In addition, you have to ride a stationary bike or elliptical machine for 12 minutes without pause.There's also a standard medical screening to make sure you meet basic health requirements. This includes taking basic vitals and an assessment of any risk factors you might have.For body fat, men can have a maximum of 22% and women can have a maximum of 33%.
In the event you are unable to pass, you will be given 3 weeks to prepare and then try again.
Your vision must be no worse than 20/40 and needs to be correctable to 20/20. The Navy does accept officers who've undergone laser eye surgery. If your vision is a problem, this is something to look into.If you are colorblind or have trouble with depth perception, you can't be a Navy pilot., Joining the Navy requires a great deal of personal sacrifice, for both you and your family. Make sure you're prepared for those sacrifices going in.


Navy pilots move a lot, both during and after training. During your 2 to 2.5 years of flight school, you can expect to move 3 or 4 times. While you will be home during school, you will work odd and often inconsistent hours.Your work obligations are dependent on your country's needs. You may be overseas for long periods, with limited access to communication. You might not always know ahead of time when you'll be leaving, meaning plans in your personal and professional unrelated to the Navy are subject to change quickly.Training is a lifelong process. Even after you've completed flight school and gone on to earn your wings, you will be called back for training throughout your career. This means moving around and spending a great deal of time away from loved ones., The first step to becoming a Navy pilot is enlisting in the Navy. You can do so as soon as you turn 18. However, to be a pilot you will need a bachelor's degree. Many people therefore forego enlisting until after college. However, if you'd rather enlist sooner you can enroll in the Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps (NROTC) at a civilian college. This allows you to take military classes while enrolled in regular college curriculum. Over the summer, you will report for midshipman cruises with the Navy., You need a bachelor's degree in order to become a Navy pilot. Before or after enlisting, complete the requirements to earn a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university.


There is no specific path of study outlined to become a Navy pilot. Specific training comes after you undergraduate career, when you enlist in flight school. If you want to be a Naval Flight Officer, which is slightly higher up than a pilot, you need a degree in a technical field.
Certain courses can help you in your goal of becoming a pilot. Physics and math factor heavily into the operation of an airline, so majoring or minoring in one of those fields can help.Communication factors heavily into a pilot's job. Consider taking English, communication, and telecommunications classes.Aeronautical Engineering provides you with advanced understanding of how an aircraft works. Consider majoring in the field, and seek out universities that offer that as a major or minor. This can really help when applying for flight schools, particularly if you're setting your eyes on the prestigious U.S Naval Academy., After completing your bachelor's degree, you must become a Naval officer commissioned at the rank of ensign. In order to achieve this, you need specific military training.


As stated, NROTC programs can be taken during your time at a civilian college. If you've decided to enroll in such a program, you may not need further education upon graduation.
Officer Candidate School is an 12-week crash course in military studies. You will train at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida. In addition to becoming familiar with the basic rules and regulations Navy training, you'll engage in physical challenges like swimming, running, and other physical conditioning.The U.S Naval Academy, located in Annapolis, Maryland, is the most difficult route to becoming an officer. Only about 10% of applicants are admitted each year. In order to make the cut, you should have a great academic record, a history of leadership, and a background in sports and other physically rigorous activities., Once you've completed your military training, you need to pass the Aviation Selection Test Battery to qualify for flight school and subsequent pilot training.


The test has not changed much since World War II, when it started being used as a screening tool for Navy pilots.The test contains five timed subsets: mathematical and verbal, mechanical comprehension, aviation and nautical, spacial perception, and survey gauging interest in aviation.Minimum requirements depend on the program and specialization you enroll in after taking the test. If you do not meet minimum requirements, you can retake the test. However, there is 3 time lifetime limit. If you cannot pass the test your 3rd time, you will be unable to become a Navy pilot., After you successfully completing the Aviation Selection Test Battery, you will need to enroll in flight school.


If you have a recreational or private pilot's license, you may be able to forego flight school. Check with Navy officials to see if you can skip this process and proceed to training.Flight school begins with an introductory flight screening, which includes 25 hours of instruction. Once this period has passed, you will begin an aviation program. This last 2 to 2.5 years and training begins in Florida. However, as stated, you should be prepared to move around throughout your training.The screening period is followed by primary training. You will relocate to the Florida panhandle, where you'll get hands-on instruction in regards to operating and repairing aircrafts. You will spend roughly 100 hours in flight.At the end of your primary training period, you will specialize in a particular aircraft. Where you go next depends on what type of aircraft you're chosen to specialize in operating., The Wings of Gold are granted to an elite group of pilots who can become Navy Aviators. It takes years of training and dedication to earn your wings, but if your'e dedicated to a career as a pilot, it's a good longterm goal.


After completing flight school and preliminary training, you will enter an intermediate training phase. This builds upon what was learned in basic training.After intermediate training, you will move on to advanced training. This includes mission specifics and allows you to truly specialize in one type of aviation device.Once you've completed intermediate and advanced training, you can earn your wings and become a Navy aviator."

A Marine pilot provides assault support and offensive air support, engages in anti-air and electronic warfare, controls aircraft and missiles and conducts aerial reconnaissance.A Marine pilot may get to fly some of the most advanced aircraft in the world.It draws on an incredible body of knowledge. You’ll train on a wide variety of subjects including warfare, how to fly a plane, as well as lead fellow troops.Protecting the United States, your fellow troops, and persons in other countries, along with getting to operate cool machinery can be very rewarding- both personally and professionally.It can be emotionally demanding. You’ll be exposed to a variety of situations, including active warfare and the death of fellow troops, that may cause you stress.It requires superior physical fitness. For example, you may have to fly extended missions or train for long hours. You may even need to survive in a hostile environment if your plane goes down.;
, Once you’ve acquainted yourself with becoming a Marine pilot, actively weigh whether or not this is the right career path for you and your lifestyle. Ask yourself questions such as:


Do I meet basic requirements or am I able to attain them in the course of training?Does this fit into my current lifestyle? How would this change my life? Do I want to work on weekends and possibly not have vacations for long periods of time?
Can I perform the physical demands? Am I able to stay up for long hours performing physical and mental tasks?
Can I handle the emotional demands? Am I willing to be a leader and go into war situations? Am I willing to uphold commands and orders with which I may not agree?
Does being a pilot pay enough for my life? Can I support myself and a family?

, If you have any questions or want more information about being a Marine pilot, contact a Corps recruiter. He can give you an idea of what you need to enlist and do to become a pilot.

To take one of these courses, you must volunteer and be selected by your unit, so talk to your superiors if you are interested in the opportunity. The Scout Sniper Course (SSC) is a twelve-week training program, designed to educate designated trainees in the basic techniques and equipment of Marine snipers. It is divided into three phases.

, Though classwork and practical applications, this phase will introduce students to basic tasks of snipers, including land navigation, functional fitness, marksmanship, ballistics, cold bore, and range estimation. Students will receive training in shooting at known distances using the M40 series sniper rifle and Semi-Automatic Sniper System (SASS). Practical training will cover hides and surveillance, and coursework will cover mission planning and orders writing.

, This phase equips students with knowledge and skills to engage with moving and unknown distance targets. Topics include camouflaging sniper equipment, firing positions, and methods of engaging targets at various ranges. By the end of this phase, students will demonstrate mastery of target movements at distances of 1,000 meters, and of engaging targets at unknown distances up to 800 meters.

, In this phase, students receive instructions regarding the duties of each billet within a scout sniper team, in order to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to plan sniper missions. The phase will end with a performance evaluation designed to test students’ abilities to plan, coordinate, and execute an assigned mission.

, Depending on your skills and your unit’s needs, you may train and/or serve as one or both.


A sniper makes precision fires on selected targets, often from long ranges. Snipers also conduct surveillance and reconnaissance.
Spotters detect, observe, and confirm sniper targets, and calculate the range and wind conditions on a given target. They also conduct surveillance and reconnaissance.

, This is a great way to enhance your skills and move your career forward. The course is divided into five blocks:


Block 1 teaches fundamental skills, offers ballistic training, and exercises live firing at 100-200 meters.
Block 2 trains snipers in the use of ballistic software, sniper equipment, engagement techniques, known distance shooting, and the practical application of equipment.
Block 3 covers sniper tactics and employment, foreign weapons, ballistic testing, glass shooting, unknown distance shooting (day and night) with various rifles, and the shooting of moving targets.
Block 4 provides qualification through a composite score based on four drills including barricade shooting, day and night shooting at an unknown distance, and spotter qualification.
Block 5 covers aerial sniping, explosive loophole breaching, loophole shooting, side-prone shooting, high-angle shooting, urban hides, vehicle hides, and the practical application of surveillance equipment. Block 5 also entails a culminating exercise of a four-day scenario in which sniper teams locate targets, conduct surveillance, and eliminate targets as part of a Marine Special Operations Team.

, It covers everything from engineering to artillery. Your commanding officer can help you decide which one is the right one for you to join the special forces., You can be denied this clearance for any number of reasons, from having lied on your application or problems with your personal conduct in the past to bad credit and being influenced by other nations., You also need to complete airborne training to qualify for special forces.Basically, in airborne training, you learn how to jump out of airplanes using parachutes., If you are enlisted, you must be in the E-4 to E-7 pay grade, though there are some qualifiers for E-7: you must not have more than 12 years Time in Service or more than 9 months Time in Grade. You also must have 3 years left on your Time in Service once you complete all of the special forces training.

Develop a budget.",How to Start an Online Shop Cheaply," It’s best to get a domain name that has the “.com” suffix, as that is the most common. This is one area where you want to blend in.


Get your domain name as close to the business’ name as possible, and if you can't get something that’s very close, come up with a new business name. It's very important for your web address to be memorable and easily associated with your business.
Once you've come up with a name you're happy with, register it with a registrar such as godaddy.com, wix.com, or one of the dozens of others. You’ll want to price this out, but it shouldn’t cost much at all. Registering the name alone can be purchased for as little as $8.;
, There are dozens of professional software platforms that are available to help you build an online store from top to bottom. Consider investing in one so that you have a site that looks and functions professionally.Paid platforms are often expensive, but costs are wide ranging and come with a variety of options, so it’s important to shop around. No matter which software you choose to use, there are more upfront costs if you go the software route than if you tried to build the store from scratch by yourself.
However, it’s probably cheaper and easier in the long run. Unless your store is very simple, or you are a very savvy coder, you’re going to have to expand functionality at some point, which will involve buying software or hiring a third-party.

, Find a vector logo that you like and buy any other vectors that you think will be useful in the design of your website. You can find these at any stock image site, like shutterstock.com. Vector-based images are images such as those made in Adobe Illustrator that are non-pixelated, allowing them to be shrunk or enlarged to any size without compromising aesthetic quality.


If you want custom graphics, you'll need to hire a graphic designer. You can do this locally or online. There are hundreds of graphics design firms online that design small images like logos for very low prices. Just do a google search and pick one you like.
Find a font that matches your logo for your business’ name and website's text. If you designed a logo yourself, you can use the font from the graphic design program. If you hired a graphic designer, either ask them for some suggestions or just look around (www.fonts.com is a good option) for something complimentary.

, If you don’t go with a software program, you’ll need to design a website. Do a web search for ""free css templates"" and browse the various sites until you find a free template you like.


CSS templates are beneficial because they reduce compatibility issues. They are seen the same way across mobile and desktop platforms.

, If you decide to build a website from scratch, you'll need a web designer, which you can find in any number of ways. There are probably hundreds that you can find locally, but if you don't want to leave your desk, check out some options at www.freelancer.com. You may also have a friend or family member who can do this work for free. The website designer will integrate your logo into the template and adapt the template for an online shopping cart., Like many of the choices along the way, there are dozens of companies that allow you to process payments on your website.


Some, like PayPal, take the customer away from your site and lead them to their site. Depending on the service you use, the transition can be more or less abrupt. Other services, like Braintree, allow you to keep the customers on your website when they pay.
Some payment processing companies charge a percentage of each transaction (typically from 2.5%-2.9%), and some charge a flat monthly rate (typically from $10-$35 per month). Others use a combination. Using a service like Square, located at https://squareup.com, is a good simple solution that a lot of retailers use.

, You may be able to find a friend to do this or you may need to pay someone to do this. They will need to know how you expect to receive payments.

, Before you launch, you want to do as much testing of the website as is possible, and test it on different platforms, Android, iPhone, PC and Mac.Credit card processing is an area you need to pay special attention to. You might only have one chance to make an initial sale with a particular customer. Don’t blow it by not being able to open your virtual cash register.
Pictures need to be in the proper sizes and resolutions across all platforms, and they shouldn’t slow down functionality.
Make sure all the links on your website are working. Try every available link on all of the different pages. Be thorough.

, If you stock inventory conventionally, you'll have to take photos of your items and upload them to your shopping cart so that people can see what they are buying. Use a high quality camera and take photos of the items against a neutral background, such as a sheet. Pay attention to lighting. You'll want your photos to look professional., This is a good way to keep customers happy. Aim to respond to every question within eight hours, and sooner if possible.To that end, make yourself available in multiple formats. You’ll want to be available through email, phone, social media, and maybe even a chat function on your website.

, Don’t just take one type of credit card, and for goodness’ sake, accept more forms of payment than PayPal. Make it as easy for a customer to give you their money as possible.

, Give out coupons, early-bird deals, and even a few freebies. These types of incentives make customers feel appreciated and exclusive. Reach out to these customers and get feedback on what they like and don’t like about the store, and tie that into additional rewards., Far more businesses have failed because they didn’t have a good business plan than have failed because they didn’t have a good website. Regardless of whether your store is online or brick and mortar, a good business plan is critical.Niche or mass-market? You need to decide what corner of the market you will serve. Of course, niche services have an inherently smaller customer base than mass market stores, like Target or Walmart. Conversely, you need to be aware that mass market stores have large infrastructural advantages that allow them to sell products very cheaply, and you might not be able to compete.The money has to come from somewhere. One of the first steps in your business plan needs to be figuring out where your revenue stream is going to come from. You can make money through ad revenue, profits on items sold, shipping fees, and even on financing. Decide on your various revenue streams and what proportion of the total they constitute early on.

, The marketplace is competitive, so you need to give yourself an edge over the competition. Develop a proficiency that other retailers don’t have.Look at similar retailers. Go to other retailers’ websites in your field. Pay attention to what they do well, what they do poorly, and what they don’t do at all. Reviews and message boards are a great way to get a sense of this.
Focus on one thing. Particularly when you are starting out, focus on one thing to develop your advantage. Get orders filled in less than a day; sell the highest quality; stock the most unique inventory; align yourself with a lifestyle. Whatever it is, focus on becoming the best at that one thing.

, Originality here is distinguished from comparative advantage. You want to focus on making the customer’s experience original in addition to offering a distinctive service.Online commerce is different. Online commerce has advantages and disadvantages over physical commerce. A disadvantage is that it eliminates the advantages of geographic convenience. One laundromat doesn’t need to be different from another. It just needs to be close, because no one is going to travel 20 miles to do laundry.Setting yourself apart is therefore critical. No one online retailer has an advantage over another in initial accessibility. As long as the customer has the URL, they can get to the biggest website as easily as the smallest. So there needs to be some reason why customers remember you and seek your shop out.

, The more focused your service and presentation are, the better able you are to understand your customers. You want to know as much about the target going in as you can, as it will allow you to gain traction in the marketplace more quickly.Why do your customers want to use you? As you’ve developed niche product offerings and targeted specific areas of the market, you can better analyze why your prospective customers want to shop with you. Armed with that information, you can answer the more important question, which is how you can adapt to better serve their needs.

, It’s the kind of thing that goes without saying, but needs to be said nonetheless. Get out the calculator, take a look at your assets and liabilities, and decide what you can invest yourself. Not a ballpark figure, but a specific dollar amount., It’s easier than ever to manage retail inventory, with an explosion of options in the past two decades. Consider your options and decide what’s best for you.Buying upfront is the conventional way to approach inventory. You buy what you’re going to sell, hold it in a warehouse (or your garage), and hang onto it until it’s gone. It’s simple to understand, but it might not be the most efficient for your business.
You can also use a logistics provider. Logistics providers are firms that specialize in warehousing and shipping inventory. In this case, you buy the inventory, the logistics provider tracks it and holds it, and then ships it when needed.
Drop-shipping is the newest frontier in inventory management. With a drop shipper, you sell inventory that you don’t actually own. The drop shipper fills the orders for you. It’s very simple to use, but it can be more expensive, as you lose advantages from buying in bulk.

, Your marketing strategy will be an integral component of distinguishing yourself in the marketplace. While you need a distinctive business model, you also need to let customers know about it. That’s where marketing comes in.Google adwords is probably the cheapest form of advertising for a start-up. Customers see your ads when they search for a product that you sell, and you only pay when they click.Social media marketing can be cheap or expensive, and it’s difficult to know if you’ll get what you pay for. You can hire a firm to do this, but you’ll want to research them carefully.

You can also try and do this yourself, but it can be very time-consuming.

There is also a writing sample that is not included in your LSAT score. However, it is provided to the schools you apply to. The LSAT is offered several times a year in different locations in the US and internationally. There are test dates to accommodate religious holidays and Sabbath observances. There are free test preparation materials, as well as sample tests for purchase. At a minimum, you should get comfortable with the format of the questions and working under the time limits.

The Air Force offers the Graduate Law Program which combines military training with your legal studies. First year law students are eligible to apply. Students interested in the Navy JAG program can apply to The Navy JAG Corps' Student Program. Second year law students who are accepted into the program are commissioned in the inactive Navy Reserve and can transition straight from law school to the Naval Officer Development School. , A Juris Doctor degree, or equivalent, from one of the 200+ law schools approved by the American Bar Association (ABA) will meet the requirements to sit for the bar exam in any state.Attending an ABA-approved law school offers many benefits over a non-approved school. Primarily, with an ABA-approved law degree, you will be eligible to take the bar exam in all 50 states. Bar exam passage rates are also higher for graduates of an ABA-approved law school. Some states, most notably California, will allow a graduate of a law school not approved by the ABA to take the bar exam and be licensed to practice.Licensing in any state is all that is required by the JAG Corps.

, The ABA requires that law schools offer instruction in the ethics and responsibilities of the legal profession. A typical course looks at the history and development of legal ethics and how to apply these rules to the practice of law.

, Law schools vary slightly in degree requirements, but to meet the ABA standards,schools will require you to complete a prescribed field of study. Requirements typically include classes in contracts, torts, property, constitution, civil procedure, and legal research. Most schools require that you graduate with a minimum 2.0 grade point average in your legal coursework.

, The scope and content of the bar exam varies somewhat, but all states use a combination of tests prepared and administered by the National Conference of Bar Examiners. A typical bar exam lasts two to three days.The Multistate Professional Responsibility test is a two-hour 60-question exam administered three times per year and tests knowledge of ethics rules of the legal profession. The Multistate Bar Examination tests torts, constitutional, criminal, contracts, civil procedure, evidence, and property law. It is a grueling six-hour, 200 question examination. The Multistate Performance Test challenges analytic skills with a realistic legal fact pattern. The Multistate Essay Exam is a series of 30-minute essay questions drawn from all areas of the law. States may also add state-specific essay tests to the array of multistate tests.
Bar exams are typically administered twice a year with the results released about 10 weeks after the test.

, You will apply to the bar in the same state you took the examination. Different states may vary slightly, but there are some consistent requirements.


You must be at least 18 years of age when you apply to the state bar.
While bar entrance generally accepts permanent ""green-carded"" residents, the JAG Corps requires that you be a citizen of the United States.
Demonstrate good moral character and fitness. This requirement is satisfied by a thorough background and reference check. You will complete forms disclosing previous addresses, criminal records, treatment for mental illness or substance abuse, and releases of your tax records and credit scores. If you have black marks on your record, you can submit an explanatory statement.Provide a set of fingerprints. Some states accept prints sets transmitted electronically by law enforcement, other states require paper ""ten cards.""
Pay the required registration fees. This varies by state, but average $300 to $500.

, The easier way to take the oath is to attend the state's swearing in ceremony held a few days after the results to the bar exam are released. Each state also has a list of alternate officials that can administer the oath. An example of an accepted official is a district court judge. The state bar will have the appropriate forms and guidelines.

, With a law degree and admittance to a state bar, you are eligible to seek enlistment and induction into the JAG Corps of all branches of the United States military including the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard.


If you joined a JAG Corps through a special program, you will be transitioned from law school to active duty per the branch's internal procedures.

, The enlistment procedure is different for each branch. You can either speak to a recruiter in person, request to be contacted by a recruiter through the branch's website, or, if available you can apply online. , If you are accepted and sworn into a military JAG position, you will receive advanced training. The typical commitment is four years of active duty. At the end, you can re-enlist or leave military service. If you have prior military service, either active duty, reserves, or National Guard, you will receive time-in-service credit for pay grades and assignments.

Give your team members good commissions.,
Consult professionals about your business.",How to Succeed in Network Marketing," Choosing the right company is key to your success. Quick and easy internet searches can usually answer many of the questions you may have. Do some research to determine which company is best for you personally. Some questions you should ask yourself when researching companies are:How old is the company? Is it well-established or is it just starting out?
How are the company's sales? Are they rising or falling?
What is the general reputation of the company? Reviews and blogs can usually give you a good idea if the company is reputable or suspicious.;
, Keep the same things in mind as when you investigated companies. Is the company leadership reputable and law-abiding? If company leaders have been accused of carrying out scams or have had legal trouble, you may want to avoid this company.

, Since you'll be responsible for pitching and selling this product, make sure it is reputable. Some MLM companies market questionable or dangerous products, and you could face legal action if you take part. You should keep the following in mind when considering a product:Is this product safe?
Are the product's claims backed up by legitimate research?
Would I use this product?
Is this product priced fairly?

, When you've found a company you're interested in, you'll likely meet with a recruiter or another representative. Be skeptical during the recruitment process. Remember that your sponsor makes more money if you sign on, so he may not be as open with you as he could be. Don't get distracted by promises of how much money you'll make and really think about what you're about to do.Ask direct and specific questions. If you find the answer too vague, ask for clarification.
Ask exactly what the company will expect of you- how much are you expected to sell? How many people are you expected to recruit? Are you required to take part in training programs?

, Don't sign anything right away. Take some time to read over and understand the entire contract. You may even want to consult a lawyer or accountant to make sure you're getting a fair deal and that the company is legitimate.

, According to the Federal Trade Commission, some businesses posing as MLM companies are actually illegal pyramid schemes. Pyramid schemes scam recruits into buying into a company and almost always result in a loss to the recruit. Some things to look out for are:If a company makes more money selling products to distributors than to the public.
If a company makes more money recruiting members than by selling products.
If anything seems wrong to you, don't sign a contract.

, When you have a few potential companies in mind, write out your plan for building and expanding your business. Even before you've officially aligned with a company, it helps to have this plan figured out early. Thant way you can hit the ground running when you do eventually start at a company. Keep these things in mind when designing a business plan:


What product or service are you intending to sell?
Who is your intended market?
How much time will you dedicate to this? Will it be a part-time commitment or are you planning on working seven days a week?
What is your goal? Do you want to get rich or just make some extra money?
Think long-term. Where will you be in five years? Ten years?
What is your marketing strategy? Will you make cold calls? Use the internet? Go door to door?
You can update or change the plan as needed, but it helps to have a guide when you're just starting out.

, In most MLM models, the person who recruited you becomes your mentor. That mentor will coach you through the early stages of your work. Typically, the more successful you are, the more money your mentor makes, so it is in his best interest to be there for you. In a mentor, you'd want:Someone who is available if you need help.
Someone who you could see yourself working with.
Someone who will be honest with you if there's something you can do better.

, It's your job to sell these products, so you should dedicate yourself to knowing everything about them. You'll need to plan how you will pitch the product to potential customers, how to answer any questions or doubts they may have, and any relevant research or studies that support your product., These will help you make new contacts and learn new skills. You can leave them better prepared to build your business successfully.

, In network marketing, leads are potential customers. You'll need to keep finding new leads if you want to keep making money. There are various ways you can find new leads, and you should use multiple strategies to attract the largest market possible.


Social media is a cheap, easy way to generate buzz for your product. Start a page for your company on each of the major social media sites and update them all regularly.
Buy advertising space online and offline. Websites and newspapers can help build awareness for your product.
Cold calling, though old fashioned, is still a popular method of finding potential leads.
Personal interaction is also useful. Always have business cards on you and be ready to talk about your company. You never know when you may come across someone who is interested in what you have to offer.

, To turn leads into paying customers, you'll have to follow up with them and pitch your product.


Set up your web page with an auto responder designed to contact people who visit your page.
Manage all your contacts in an organized file with all their information easily accessible.
Have a sales pitch ready at all times when you contact a lead.
Try more than once to turn a lead into a customer. Just because someone wasn't interested once doesn't mean they will never be interested. Be careful not to overdo it, though- you could easily get a reputation as a spammer, which can hurt your business.

, Just like you were recruited to a network marketing company, you'll have to recruit members to your team if you want to be successful. Always be on the lookout for new prospects who you think will be valuable additions to your team. You'll want someone who is personable, a good salesperson, and a team player committed to cooperating with you.

, If recruits are successful, you make more money, so you should be prepared to train them well. This may be a substantial time commitment, even up to several weeks. But you should understand that you're building a team and it is in your best interest to spend enough time making sure your recruits are competent enough to go off on their own., By compensating your recruits well, you're ensuring that they have a good incentive to sell. That way, they'll earn more money for you and for themselves. It will also help keep them around longer, which is good for you- you want to keep talented sellers on your team so keep your business successful.

, Remember, you are responsible for everything associated with running a business- taxes, laws, etc. It helps to have an accountant and lawyer on hand to help you manage your business in the most effective way possible."

And most importantly, keep unhealthy foods and sugary drinks out of reach.;
, Establish your office hours, and avoid working too late so as to prevent you from getting enough sleep. If you can, do not stare at your computer monitor for extended periods of time; avert your eyes away from the screen every 20 minutes or so for at least a few seconds to help with eyestrain.

, This is possibly the greatest benefit you will have when working out of your home. Take regular breaks that involve not switching from your desk chair to the sofa for a sip of soda, but getting up and walking such as to the mailbox or up and down a flight of stairs. Better yet, hit the gym or the pavement for a full workout before work begins each morning or after work ends every evening. If your company is like-minded about the importance of keeping in shape, see if obtaining a stationary bike for under your chair or even a treadmill desk are possibilities.

Stock up on fresh fruits and vegetables for snacking throughout the workday, and drink lots of water when you're feeling thirsty. Plus, not only will you have access to healthier lunches, but you'll save money not getting takeout every day instead.

If you're doing a full renovation, you may want to consider adding radiant floor heating to your garage if you live in a colder climate., Depending on the age of your home, your garage walls and ceiling might be fairly dirty. As a result, you’ll need to paint them in order to complete your transformation.


If you plan to partition a corner of your garage, you might consider just painting that area.
If you’re doing a garage conversion in an older home in a humid region, you may need to have the ceiling resurfaced or ""remudded"" – as the original taping and mudding job might be deteriorating.

Purchase standing blinds or partitions to cover about 2/3rds to 3/4ths of the perimeter of your new office space.
Position your partitions on two lines so you create a square between them and the garage wall.
Leave a hole or two for walkways.

Pick a desk.,
Pick a computer.,
Install internet service.,
Secure important items.",How to Set Up a Home Office in Your Garage3," If the room is still a functioning garage and you haven’t removed the garage door, the room will be subject to more moisture than if it were a fully enclosed part of your home.

The type of business you form determines your next steps, including what kind of bank account you’ll need, whether you need to file articles of incorporation, articles of organization, and whether or not you need to

, Your funding request should include a specific timetable of how you’ll spend the money and how you’ll pay it back.


Include data on potential future funding requests as well. Project at least five years out.
Describe your past and potential future earnings. As a new business, you might need to draw on your past writing experience in order to show you understand the writing market.

, Work part-time with your writing business early on and keep your full-time job. Decide carefully when to write full-time. Set some benchmarks to know when you should transition to making your home-based writing business a full-time endeavor.


For instance, you might decide that when you earn at least $2,000 each month from your writing business that you’ll make it a full-time gig.
Maintain enough savings to carry you through months of lean times. You should have enough money saved up to cover your expenses for at least six months.
If you have a supportive spouse or partner with their own income streams, you’ll be in a better position to take the risk needed to make your home-based writing business a full-time job.
If possible, maintain flexible part-time work which could be scaled up in the event that your home-based writing business is not providing you with enough income to meet your needs.

, You should already have most of the things you’ll need to start a writing business: a printer, a phone, and an email address (though you might want to make a new email address for your business correspondence). Additionally, you’ll need a comfy chair.Head to your local office supply store and try out a few office chairs.


Get a chair which supports your spine and provides support. You’ll be spending a lot of time sitting if you’re starting a home-based writing business, so you might as well be comfortable.

, Most computers today come with free word-processing software. If, however, your computer does not, you might need to shell out a few hundred dollars to get MS Word or another reputable word-processor. If you’re looking to save money (and you should be), check out a free option like OpenOffice or Kingsoft Office.


A good word processor should have a clean, simple interface and be intuitive and easy to use. If a word-processor doesn’t make it immediately obvious how to change margins or utilize a different font, avoid it., There are several ways to price your writing.You can price your writing per word, per page, per hour, or per article. If you price your writing per word or per page, the longer the article, the more you get paid. In this case, you’ll need to decide on the cost per page, as well as the exact formatting layout your client wants your piece to conform to.


Charging per project can be risky since you might end up taking longer than you though you would on a given project, and thus end up earning less than you would have if you’d charged per page or per word.
Charging per hour can also be hard, since an employer will have no way of verifying how long you took to write a given piece.

, Ensure your prices are competitive. Analyze the going rates for the type of writing you're specializing in and set your price at a comparable level. If the average rate for science writing, for instance, is $10 per page, you could set your prices at $9.50 per hour when you're starting out, then raise them to $11 or $12 per hour after you gain a reputation as a solid writer within the genre.


Decide what you want your salary to be when setting your prices. For instance, if you plan on working a standard 40 hours each week and want to earn $2,000 each month, you’ll need to bring in at least $500 per week, or $12.50 per hour.
Charge based on the kind of writing you’re doing. Resume edits and reviews are generally easy, so you need not charge a high rate for them. Medical or technical writing, on the other hand, require a high degree of accuracy and know-how, and can justifiably earn a much higher wage.

, Advertising can be expensive. Other business expenses like travel, insurance, computers, or web hosting costs should also be considered.


Draft a business plan in order to secure funding from banks or loan agencies. The business plan should provide specific funding requests and describe exactly how loaned money will be used.

, Post high-quality content to your website or blog. Make your site and its content useful and easy to navigate.


Having a degree related to writing is a useful bona fide, but practical credentials are more useful. If you can cite other writers or articles which link to your writing, or you know how many average page visit you get per day, use this info to bolster your reputation.
WordPress or Tumblr are useful, free content systems which you can utilize to present your work. Keep your layout clean, professional, and slick.
Include a concise but memorable bio on your website. Besides your writing, describe your interests and work history whether it’s related to your writing career or not.
Develop a snappy logo and a memorable name for your business. Build your brand carefully and maintain its integrity by producing quality writing.

, If you’re looking to write for clients as a technical writer or a freelance journalist, you’ll need to get noticed. Email or direct mail samples of your work and article pitches to outlets which accept them.


If you hope to engage in writing advertisements for a business, position your writing business as offering a solution to their marketing needs.
If you want to write for a specific publisher or periodical, identify their submission policy. Investigate who is in charge of reading and editing potential pitches, and address your questions and concerns directly to that individual., Answering this question will help you figure out what tone you should adopt when crafting content. Be specific about your interests, talents, and abilities in order to find your niche. Consider also whether you want to write online, in print, or both.


Identify the major publications which might be interested in your writing. For instance, if you are writing about hiking and the outdoors, you could pitch articles to ‘’Outdoors Magazine’’ or ‘’The Mountaineer.’’
Promote your work via social media. The more reblogs, likes, and retweets you get, the more people will recognize you as a quality writer.

, If you’re interested in the environment and ecological science, for instance, you might be best suited to writing about issues pertaining to fracking, energy policy, deforestation, and animal rights. You might be hesitant to limit yourself to a specific set of issues or topics, but doing so will help you find your niche and further develop your voice and reputation as a writer.

, Connect with people in your writing niche -- editors, community leaders, other writers -- nearby in order to get your work recognized and attract new business. Network with community members, especially if you’re writing to a local audience. Making connections with others who are writing or working in your particular market niche will help you gain an audience. These connections will also be useful in helping you get the scoop on unfolding stories you might be interested in.


In your local community, volunteer or attend local town council meetings to get to know your community leaders.
Have some business cards made up so you can leave them with people who are interested in your writing. Be sure to include your name, number, email, social media accounts, and your business’ name on the card.

, Networking sites like LinkedIn are useful for developing contacts further afield. Connecting with more distant individuals is important if you’re interested in or writing about issues of national or global significance. Email, online forums, and social media make networking at a distance easy. Traveling to national conferences or seminars for writers, journalists, or professionals in your area of expertise is a good way to gain a wider network of contacts as well.Advertise yourself as resume reviewer or writer on job boards where many people are looking for such a service.

, You need not write anything extravagant or lavish them with gifts; a simple reminder that you appreciated their business is good enough.


Express thanks and maintain a good working relationship even with clients who are demanding, impatient, or ungrateful. Don’t take their criticism of your writing personally, and try to see things from their point of view.
Rely on your past clients or employers to provide you with positive letters of recommendation. Use their testimonials in promotional materials for your new writing business. Satisfied customers will be your ambassadors."

Have a nice, quiet place to work.,
Keep your goals in sight.,
With respect to goals, it is necessary to set goals that are within your reach and that you can accomplish.,
Know what is driving you.,
Set your work schedule and hours.,
If you do not learn to deal with all of them, including the distractions and procrastination issues, you will never meet your goals and succeed.

",How to Reach Your Goals when Working at Home," Successful work at home is only going to happen if you have some space that is quiet. Never try working in the middle of everything. Distractions are the single biggest reason people who try working from home fail. It is absolutely necessary to stay away or be away from the home ""noise"".;
, Next if you are serious about being successful and reaching your goals, you must keep them in sight at all times. A suggestion is that you put up a board with each one of your goals written out and placed in plain sight so that you can have a constant reminder of where you are headed. Focusing on your goals visually will help keep the thoughts in your mind directed towards the goals.

, Discouragement from reaching goals is a major factor in just giving up. If you expect too much of yourself and the goal is not met, you will just give up and think you will not be able to do it. Do Not Give Up.

, Again regarding goals. What is motivating your goals? What is it that you really want? Whatever the answers to these questions are, use them to make you work harder towards your goals. Goals will not be reached if you are not motivated enough.

, If necessary put up a sign at your office door or imaginary door. These are the hours that people in your household have to respect. Make sure everyone is aware of your working hours. Within the same information, just because you are working from home does not mean your office is open 24 hours. You have a life and a family. Respect their needs as well.

, The goal is to create a long-term consumer base so that you will have a mountain of residual and passive income.

, Your coach or mentor should already be at the level that you are striving for. He or she will help you gain access to the blueprint of success in your particular industry. You will avoid time-wasting and money-wasting mistakes by having a good mentor.

, This is especially important in your first few months to the first year in your learning phase. Having a support group will encourage you and you will also be learning from others who are in the same situation you are in.

, You will also need to implement online marketing systems that can work for you 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. One such tool is Google’s Adwords.

, You can convert a spare bedroom, shed or garage if need be. Plan to keep your business equipment, tools and supplies in there and not spread around the house. Be sure to purchase separate supplies for home and business, to discourage family members coming into your business space to search for items they need.
, This is not as difficult as one would think. Every home office's needs are different, but there are some fundamental staples that all require.


You will want to have a clean, noise-free environment that has good lighting and is free from distractions. This will help keep you more focused and productive. You will need a desk and chair. The size of your desk will depend on what its function is. You will want a place to store all your information about your customers such as a computer and/or a filing cabinet.
Communications: You will also want a phone, fax/scanner/copier, Internet connection, and any other communication tools you might need at hand.
Meeting and storage space: If, like many home-based businesses, yours will focus on services or affiliate products, there will be no need for storage. However, if you are planning to sell stocked products and ship them yourself, then make sure you have room to store them all. If you plan on holding meetings outside of your home, there will be no need for a conference room. If you are going to be seeing clients in your home, and don’t have a conference room, then be sure to keep your place clean and neat at all times.

, You need not be a fashion plate or break the bank, but you must have neat, clean attire appropriate to your industry. Make sure you attend to personal grooming before getting dressed for appointments.

, Set up a bookkeeping system, and be prepared to hire an accountant if necessary.

, Plan your days off ahead of time so you aren't temped to ignore work on any given day because ""you don't feel like it"".

, A to do list is a great way to stay on task.

, If you have family members, especially small children, let them know that they are only to interrupt you in an emergency. Establish rules, such as ""do not disturb Mummy when she's on the phone"", and ""do not come into the office without knocking"". Do not talk to or yell at the children, the spouse or the dog while on a business call. First impressions say a lot.

, There are online networking sites and usually locally based groups for business owners.

Get a digital foot pedal.,
Get headphones.,
Get transcription Workflow software.,
Start looking for work.",How to Set Up Your Home Transcription Office," Many people already have a computer at home. If not, you do not need a top-of-the-line expensive computer. You can get started with a basic computer that will cost you less than $800. As long as you can run Windows and some word processing software and have 256 MB of RAM you should be fine!;
, If you will be transcribing digital audio files that you must download over the Internet then a high speed connection is a must! Cable and DSL internet packages are getting cheaper every day, and it is well worth the money to get connected if you are serious about a home transcription career.

, Many computers come with either WordPerfect or Microsoft Office. You need to have and be able to use one or the other of these word processing softwares, and it will make you a more flexible and attractive transcriptionist if you have and can use both.

,, This is the crucial piece of hardware for digital transcribing and you will probably have to order it online. It will cost about $80. If you are a serious transcriptionist you will have another pedal as back up because if the one you're using breaks you do not want to be out of commission while you're waiting for the next one to come in the mail! The makers of Express Scribe also sell foot pedal hardware (https://www.nch.com.au/cgi-bin/hw.exe?class=FP ). I use the VEC USB pedal, which is the best product if you have a USB port. If you have a very old computer that does not have USB ports you may have to get a pedal that connects with a serial connector.

, Get the very best headphones you can afford. Believe me, you will make the money back in increased efficiency. (If you will be using a notebook computer to play digital audio files you will also need a good set of external speakers to ""boost"" the audio volume and quality -- plug your headphones into the external speakers.)

, Even if you start out small, workflow software can save you time, keep you organised and prevent human error, for example it can do all your invoicing automatically, and help you to receive huge sound files. The two main providers are Winscribe (http://www.winscribe.com/) and ScribeManager (http://www.scribemanager.com/). In addition, it may be useful for you to install text expander software to quickly type common words and phrases, such as FastFox (http://www.nch.com.au/fastfox/).

, One of the largest companies that accepts applications from freelance transcribers is Way With Words. You can also try FindTranscriptionWork.com (http://www.findtranscriptionwork.com/), which is a free site listing medical, legal and general transcription jobs.

Play to your strengths.,
Perform a service.,
Put your skills on the market.,
Become an affiliate marketer.,
Buy and sell the Internet.,
Be creative.",How to Make Money Online for Free1," Making money online is a lot easier when you are doing things directly related to your source of income.


For example, if you are a regular blogger and have a following, you can use Google AdSense to generate income. AdSense analyzes your content, and directs ads to your page that is relevant to your followers. The more followers you have, the more AdSense will work for you.;
, There are many businesses out there that need as many people as possible, working online, to become successful. Usually these service-oriented companies do not pay a lot per item, but if you're fast and accurate, the the pennies add up to dollars and can be a great source of income. Look for opportunities like these:



Online surveys. Consumer data is an incredibly valuable commodity that companies will pay a lot of money to have, and the way a lot of this data is collected is through surveys. The more surveys you complete, the more you will earn.

Be a writer. The Internet is jam-packed with readers (you're one now!) The one thing that readers need the most are writers. There are sites such as Zerys that specialize in bidding out writing jobs that range from $.01 to $.10 a word. You may start in the $.01 to $.03 range, but the more you write—providing you write well—the more you will make per word.







, You may have talents in audio or film editing; you might be an awesome graphic designer; maybe your forte is programming, or making mobile apps that people love. Where once people went to the temp agencies, they now sign up with sites like Upwork (formerly Elance and oDesk).


Sign up is free, generally easy, and often can be handled simply by signing in through Facebook or Twitter. Create an online profile, use a professional photo, and people who need your skills will see your smiling mug and awesome skillset when they're looking for somebody with your talents.

, Like using Google's AdSense, if you have a web presence with any kind of following, becoming an affiliate marketer can generate a substantial income if you do it well.


Sign up with a company that has an affiliate program. You can research popular or trending topics with Google Trends, and pick an affiliate partner based on current events, or you can pick a partner based on your own preferences.
For example, if you are a musician, Musician's Friend offers an Affiliate Program that is very partner-friendly.

, OK, maybe not the whole Internet, but buying and selling domain names can generate some extra spending money.


Think beyond the obvious. While most short names have been long-since taken, consider a couple alternatives: hyphenated names are more common now that the one-word names have been assigned; also, unique family names have selling potential. While it may not generate the kind of dollars a multinational corporation might pay for a name, family names are personal enough that people might be willing to part with a few hundred dollars to ""own"" their surname on the Internet.

, Above all, use your imagination when investigating online money-making opportunities. Regardless of your education or experience, you have skills that people want. Grab your Google, plug in some keywords, and find your niche!

Look ahead.,
Open your calendar application.,
Switch to the week view.,
Remember, quality over quantity.,
Be a self-starter.,
Be realistic.",How to Make Money Online for Free2," While finding ways to generate an income online can be fairly straightforward, taking that from the spare change category to a full-fledged income takes some dedication. But the process isn't difficult if you do a little planning.

, If you're going to make money online, you're going to need to manage your time. Google Calendar is a great solution if you don't already have a calendar application.


Look at the month view. See all that empty white space? We're going to rectify that.

, Now, scroll to next week, and starting next Monday, create an event that represents the time you can spend working.


If you have coffee with a friend in the morning, a racquetball game at noon, or have to pick up the kids at 3pm, adjust your time accordingly—including commute and decompress time.
Repeat this step for every day of next week, until your calendar is filled:
Don't forget to give yourself a lunch break of at least a half hour. You—and your eyes—will need the break.
This will not only help you plan your work availability, it will also help you see where you might be able to recover some extra time for launching your online career.

, Launching a career requires hard work, but if your time is managed well you are exponentially more likely to become successful than if you dedicated an entire day but accomplished nothing.

, This may or may not come naturally to you, but it's a valuable skill to master for working online. As the saying goes, ""On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog,"" but you do. Here are a couple tips to help you stay motivated:


Remind yourself at the start of the day what you are doing, why you are doing it, and what you hope to accomplish. Do that for the short term—today—and for the overall goals you have set for your online career. If you don't do any of the other steps, do this one. It not only helps direct your focus, it puts you into a ""work"" mindset.
Keep a morning routine as if you were going into a professional office. (On casual Friday. Let's not get carried away here!) Set your alarm clock, work out, shower, shave, have some breakfast—whatever your routine might be for office days, keep it going. It puts you in the mindset of ""professional,"" rather than ""homebody.""
Don't sit for 8 hours at a time. Every couple hours—or whenever you finish a significant task—get up and take a walk. The latest reports say sitting all day is very unhealthy. It's hard to be motivated and at your best when you are ill.
Don't neglect your personal life. It can be very easy when focusing your energy on starting a career, but play the long game. Friends and family are important, and will be there long after you've retired.

, Starting a business—any business—is hard, and it's not going to make you rich overnight. You've probably heard the stories where the excited housewife went from living in a trailer park to owning a mansion in just a year, thanks to ""Willy Billy's Patented GetRichNow™"" program, but that's not reality.


Willy Billy, on the other hand, wrote and sold 50,000 copies of his book for $39.95 and raked in nearly $2 million.
He also planned a marketing and sales campaign that hooked a mere hundredth of 1% of the U.S. population. Willy Billy got rich, but he didn't do it overnight.
Exercise due diligence when looking at any online opportunity.

Just as in the world of brick-and-mortar, there are entry-level jobs and high-paying careers. You may need to start at entry level and work your way up, or you might be able to start at the top. But don't expect to start at the top unless you've already got a lot of expertise and recognition in your field.

, You may not have the expertise or recognition you need—right now—but if you think ahead, and think big, there's no reason not to get started now, and start building for the future. Here are some online careers that have a lot of traction now, and will likely continue to be career-worthy for some time to come.


Home-based physicians and radiologists. Part of a growing field loosely defined as ""telehealth,"" medical professionals are finding life outside the office is rewarding, both monetarily and in flexibility. Other jobs in this field include registered nurses and medical transcriptionists.
Software engineers. This is one of the original ""work at home"" professions, and comprises software engineers, computer scientists, system administrators, technical support, database programmers, UX designers, and more.
Creative arts. This broad category includes authors, bloggers, graphics designers, PR specialists, social media experts, and the ever-popular web designer.







, Whatever online career you undertake, there will be successes and failures. Accept this, but do not become complacent.


Learn from your mistakes and use the information you've gathered to change your methods and improve your productivity, quality, or whatever you've found needs attention.
Keep moving forward. As philosophers have long recognized, ""perseverance furthers.""

If you are skilled in crafting, sewing or cooking you may decide to make and sell home décor, accessories, jewelry or edible items.
If you have an eye for bargains you may be interested in buying and re-selling antiques or other items.
If you enjoy working with a network of business owners and socially interacting with your customers, you may consider becoming a consultant for an existing home-based direct sales company.;
, To have the most possible success as a home entrepreneur, you want to make sure you're not just selling any old product. You want to make sure you're selling awesome products — products that are convenient, portable, and cheap to manufacture:


What makes a home product really good:

Convenience. Your product makes life easier for your customers
Portability. It ships easily. That also usually means it's easier to manufacture.
Cost. It doesn't take an arm and a leg to manufacture. Try to get your margins at or above 50%.What makes a home product not so good:

Overly mechanical and liability-prone. If your product demands super high quality standards or puts you at a liability, stay away. No mechanical drills.
Imported by big retailers. If the product you're trying to sell at home already is being sold at Walmart, don't expect much.
Trademarks. Unless you want to spend all your profit fighting legal battles with huge corporations, stay away from items that are protected under trademark.



, Okay, so you've decided to sell miniature craft accessories — miniature chairs for doll collectors, perhaps. The next question you should consider is how good of a business proposition is this? You may be the best miniature craftsman (or -woman) that money can buy, but it won't mean very much if no one buys miniatures for dolls, or if the market for doll miniatures is already really competitive and margins are razor thin.


The size of the market is effectively how much money people are spending today on whatever product you're selling. You can usually research market size online by consulting market studies, journals, and government reports.The bigger the market size, the bigger the market opportunity.
How competitive a given market is should be a big consideration in your choosing to step into it. If there are a lot of players vying for a piece of the pie, your job is going to be very hard. If there are not as many players vying for a piece of the pie, you're going to have an opportunity to make more money.

, Wholesale is buying the product or things necessary to build the product directly from the manufacturer, thereby avoiding a markup from any middlemen. If you can buy whatever you need to make your product without involving any middlemen, your profit margins will be much bigger.


You can get the best wholesale prices by shopping around. Reach out to several possible suppliers (with a junk email, unless you love spam; or by telephone) and ask them about getting a tester sample of whatever it is you're ordering. A tester will let you determine the quality of the product you're ordering.
Be sure to ask about the minimum order, as well. If you need to buy 1,000 sets of dish drying racks in order to get the deal, it may not be a great investment, especially if you're just starting out.
If you are joining a direct sales company, get signed up on its website or through another consultant and order your starter kit of inventory.

, Very few retailers successfully buy wholesale and then flip the product(s) without changing it in some significant way. What you'll probably find yourself doing is buying the raw materials from a supplier or host of suppliers and then spending time and manpower fashioning your product into reality.

, You may think you've got a really reliable product on your hands, but no one is as discerning as the customer. The customer uses the product, sometimes on a daily basis, sometimes the ""wrong way."" The customer is constantly asking herself, ""did I get my money's worth?"" Testing your product on focus groups, friends, or even (especially) strangers might give you insight into how to make it even better.


Say, for example, that you order 100 vegetable peelers wholesale, stick your name on them, and then sell them with a 100% markup. That's not necessarily a bad idea if you can get swift sales. But what if the vegetable peelers dissolve under hot water, and a week into your new sales venture, you've got dozens of angry customers whose dishwashers have been ruined by the peeler? If you had tested them, you'd know they weren't a good product. If you hadn't tested them, you'd be giving refunds, losing money and having your brand take a hit.

, A tax ID will allow the government to set up taxes associated with your sales. In most cases, you'll need to register your tax ID number in each state you plan on selling your goods.

, This makes it easier for you to track your profit and expenses, though you can transfer your earnings into your personal account once your records have been noted.


This also makes things a whole lot easier come tax season, when you need to be exact about what expenses you had and how much you were paid.
Link a PayPal account to your business bank account in order to make online transactions more efficient.

, It may sound boring, but boring is better than fines or jail time when the IRS comes auditing.


You may choose to hire an accountant or bookkeeper to track these records for you.

, A product will usually sell in one of three ways: repeat buys (meaning the customer enjoyed it the first time and went back for more); word-of-mouth (rave reviews from trusted influencers); and advertising. If the quality and usefulness of your product is already high, there's not much you can do to affect repeat buys and word of mouth. That's where advertising comes in. Advertising is a way to build interest in a product by selling a dream of how to use it.


Order business cards and distribute them to everyone you know or meet.
Create business pages on social media sites and invite your friends and family to follow you. Encourage them to invite others, and make frequent status updates to keep your followers up to date on your business.
If you joined a direct-sales company, review your materials for promotional ideas customized for your brand of products.

, PPC stands for ""pay per click,"" where you (the advertiser) pay the website on which your ad appears (the publisher) anytime a customer clicks on the link. Increasingly, however, many people are finding it difficult to generate leads with PPC. Social networks, like Facebook and Twitter, offer promotional content or advertisements as well. Social networks like these may be good at branding, but they don't necessarily translate into swift sales. Try both of these methods for yourself, but don't make them your entire advertising budget.

, Unless you truly want to sell products from your physical home (not recommended), you'll probably want to put the product up for sale online. There are several upsides and several downsides about selling online:


The advantages:

Lower startup costs.You don't have to pay nearly as much for an online domain as you do for a retail store. Listing items on eBay is relatively cheap.
Farther reach. Even if you're in New York, you can reach customers from all over the world.
Seamless marketing and convenience. Market online, and allow customers to buy with a click or two from the comfort of their living room.


The disadvantages:

Security issues. Credit card or other payment information can be breached, making for angry customers.Difficulty and time associated with delivering goods. It may be difficult and take weeks to ship a product to Tanzania, for example.



, If you plan to do online sales, create a website that customers can shop from. Link your PayPal account to the website. Make sure that the layout and design of the website make it dead simple for customers to buy the product. People who are familiar with their product and website layout often find it much easier to understand than people with no knowledge of the product or website.


It's becoming increasingly easy to build your own sales channel online. Many online services now exist, like Shopify, that let you pay for someone else to build and maintain your sales tools for you. The less commission you need to give eBay on each sale, the more money stays in your own pocket.

, There are a lot of things that do into selling on eBay, the internet's biggest auction place. But the main idea is simple: Create a listing, decide how you want to sell it, and then ship it when the listing is sold. Here are some other things to keep in mind:


Pictures are important! Take attractive, useful, clear pictures. Your products will sell more if people feel like they can understand them through pictures.
Choose an auction format or fixed price format. Auction format works best for rarer items that people are likely to fight over, while fixed price format works best for more common items where the supply outstrips demand.
Be kind and courteous to everyone — even jerks — in order to keep your feedback rating high. Your reputation may well be the selling point if a competitor lists an item like yours at the same price.

, Selling on Amazon is much like selling on eBay, except that the auction format isn't available on Amazon. To sell on Amazon, all you need to do is create a profile, list your item (along with descriptions, condition, and price), and then ship the product once it's sold. As on eBay, pay attention to your ratings and feedback.


If you want to start selling a whole range of products on Amazon, you can develop your own storefront that's brand-personalized and allows customers to easily search for several items at a time.

, Etsy is a digital marketplace designed for crafts. Unlike eBay and Amazon sellers, who sell anything and everything, Etsy sellers focus on handmade crafts with a personal touch. So if you have a talent at crafting something like a fabric coaster, platinum jewelry, or folk art, Etsy might be just the place you're looking for.

, Whether you want to supplement your online income or rely on your personal charm, selling door-to-door is still a viable way of hawking products. It's certainly not easy, and it's not for the faint of heart, but with a bit of know-how and a lot of determination, it can bolster your bottom line.

, If you want to make the best possible impression on your customers, package the product elegantly (making sure it won't break during shipping), bring it to the post office, and ship it off. It's really as simple as that.

, Unfortunately, sometimes the customer isn't going to like what they bought. Make the return/exchange policy clear, but don't burn bridges by refusing a refund. Eating these refund costs will be a good business practice, and should keep your Amazon/eBay/Etsy ratings high.


Cycle the feedback you get into making your products even better. Iterate on bad designs, negative interactions, or product flaws.
Remember that the customer is always right, even when they aren't. It's one of the hardest parts of doing business, but it's one of the oldest rules in the book. If you treat your customers like undeserving bums, they'll feel like that. And while that may feel good after a brutal exchange, it certainly doesn't pad the wallet.

, In the beginning, it can be a good strategy to stay focused on one or two products, so that you get a hang of the process and don't spend too much time juggling pictures, descriptions, demographics, etc. After you've gotten a foothold in a market and developed confidence in an e-commerce platform (such as eBay), it could be profitable to start selling distinct, but related, products.

, If you're serious about making money, you'll want to look at your sales after a couple months and figure out how to increase them. Here are just a few ideas you can use:


Negotiate better prices from wholesale. As you buy more in bulk, your power to negotiate goes up. Don't be afraid to use it! The wholesalers want your business.
Look for recurring revenue sources. Think about ways you can ensure repeat business. Could email, snail mail, a subscription pack, or something else creative get you return business?
Ask for help, or outsource. Could a few more pairs of hands and legs help you deliver more packages and increase the sales you make? Especially if you're only selling part-time, constant trips to the post office and regular time sunk into payment processing could be eating away at your profitability.

Encourage repeat customers.",How to Make Money by Selling Other People Products," Affiliate marketing is essentially selling through advertising without ever having the product in your hands. Direct sales, also known as MLM (Multi-Level Marketing),involves being an agent or a contractor for a particular product and selling it for the company.Affiliate marketing is best if you do it in association with another business or hobby and is primarily an advertising approach.For example, if you write a popular blog about parenting, you may want to look into affiliate marketing for baby- or child-related products.Direct sales is best if you have the confidence and experience to be successful in sales. This requires a particular type of personality that not everyone has.Affiliate marketing usually involves getting a smaller percentage of the sales profit than direct sales (MLM), but may require less work on your part; it is best to research the details of each before deciding which business model to choose.;
, Research the company or product that you are planning to represent before you begin working with them.Be sure that others have had success working with the companies, and that they are prompt with compensation.Search for reviews of the company online and be sure to read the specific comments that people have made.
Find out the company’s quality control, customer service, and affiliate payment policies before you select a company.

, If a company seems too good to be true, it might be. Be sure to avoid pyramid schemes, which are illegal ""companies"" that encourage you to invest money, then recruit other people to invest money, but generally have no actual product behind them.If you're not sure whether something is a pyramid scheme, read the FTC's consumer information here.


If something says it will help you ""get rich quick,"" it probably won't. Many such companies can actually cause you to lose money.

, It will be far easier to market or sell a product that you actually believe in.Being able to stand by the quality and usefulness of your product will enable you to be more confident in your salesand rest assured that your product is something that people will actually want.Be sure to try a product yourself before you try to sell it. Many companies may offer you a sample, or you can find another person who is doing the type of marketing or sales that you are planning to do and buy a product from her.

, Be sure that you are fully aware of any start-up fees, transaction fees, or sales percentages that the company you are working for will take from your compensation. Reputable affiliate marketing companies do not usually charge you startup fees.Be sure that you are aware of your sales quotas and any penalties associated with failing to meet your quotas., In addition to believing in the quality of your product, you should feel fairly assured that it will sell well.Think about your friends and family and whether they would be interested in the product. If people you know won’t be interested, think about who your target sales audience would be and decide whether there is a need for your product.

, Your friends and family are the most obvious first stop for your marketing, particularly for direct sales. Try to approach them with a low pressure but thorough sales pitch.


You may even want to ask your friends and family to give you feedback on how to improve your sales strategy when you expand it to a broader audience.
Use caution when approaching close friends and family; you do not want them to feel like every time they see you, you are trying to get their money., If you don’t have a website already, make one. You should have a neat, professional webpage that offers information about your products with easy links for ordering and paying for products.


Use social media websites to expand your social network and find a larger customer base., Even if it is a little old fashioned, you should go door-to-door in your neighborhood. People who can ignore your online messages will find it more difficult to say “no” to your face. Additionally, seeing your (hopefully) high-quality product(s) in person will help people feel confident about what you are selling.


Be sure you are not violating any non-solicitation regulations.
Dress well and act professionally so that people are not suspicious of you.
Having a product that people have heard of may also help build trust among potential clients.

, There are online marketplaces that will allow affiliate marketers or sales representatives to advertise and sell their products.There are advantages and disadvantages to using these marketplaces; they greatly increase your potential customer base, but be aware that you may have far more competition.
Affiliate marketplaces may be best for very niche products without much competition.

, Be sure that you communicate with your customers what happens after they place their orders, when and how their payments will be processed, when their orders will arrive, and how they will ultimately receive their orders. Do everything within your power to meet expected deadlines, but communicate clearly and concisely about unexpected delays.With affiliate marketing, you may not have any responsibility for payments or orders, but you should be familiar with the systems in place with the product you are marketing in order to know what you are giving your “stamp of approval” to; if a customer has a bad experience with a vendor you plug, he may no longer trust your recommendations.

, One of the most important ways you can keep buyers happy is to communicate with them clearly.Have a system in place (such as email notifications) for informing customers about any changes in the “status” of their orders.


For example, you may want to notify customers of the following status changes: “payment processed,” “order placed,” “order shipped,” and “order ready for pickup.”
If there is ever a problem with a product or order, it is usually best to offer an immediate refund or replacement. Keeping customers happy, keeping your seller ratings high, and encouraging repeat business should be your biggest concern as a seller.

, Once you have established a sales relationship with a core group of buyers, ask them to refer you to others. You may want to have one or two people write testimonials for you and the products you represent to feature in your website or print materials. You can also ask people to host informal get-togethers with their friends to market your products.

, MLM companies are set up so that if you recruit other sellers, you get paid a percentage of their sales as well as your own. If your product or organization works that way, you may want to invite some of your trusted regular customers to also become sellers.

, Always act professional when you are selling or advertising your product, even while pitching it to family or close friends. Remember that when money is involved, business often trumps friendship, and you should act as though you are engaging in a business transaction, not a friendly favor., Follow-up with customers who placed orders to be sure that they are happy with their products and to inquire about further needs. If you are selling a product that “runs out,” (such as essential oils or beauty products), get a feel for how quickly people generally use their products so that you can contact them just before they need a new product.


Try to make personalized suggestions to customers based on their past purchases.Find out their interests and preferences and make specific product suggestions tailored to their needs.
Try to be sensitive to any budget constraints and be consistent when offering products. If a customer feels that you are trying to “up sell” them to make more money, she may stop using you altogether.

Become an economist.,
Remember the ""all other things being equal"" mantra.,
Learn to read charts like a pro.",How to Make Money in Forex," The forex market is a global exchange of currencies and currency-backed financial instruments (contracts to buy or sell currencies at a later date). Participants include everyone from the largest banks and financial institutions to individual investors. Currencies are traded directly for other currencies in the market. As a result, currencies are priced in terms of other currencies, like Euros per US Dollar or Japanese Yen per British Pound Sterling. By effectively seeking price differences and expected increases or decreases in value, participants can earn (sometimes large) returns on investment by trading currencies., In the forex market, prices are quoted in terms of other currencies. This is because there is no measure of value that is not another currency. However, the US Dollar is used as a base currency for determining the values of other currencies.


For example, the price of the Euro (EUR) is quoted as (price quote number) USD/EUR.
Currency quotes are listed to four decimal places.
Currency quotes are simple to understand once you know how. For example, the Yen to US would be quoted as 0.0087 JPY/USD. You should understand this as ""you need to spend 0.0087 US Dollars to buy one Japanese Yen.""

, Arbitrage, put simply, is the exploitation of price differences between markets. Traders can purchase a financial instrument in one market with the hope of selling it for more in another.Within the forex market, arbitrage is used to profit from differences in the quoted prices of currencies. However, these differences do not occur between two currencies alone, so the trader must use ""triangular arbitrage,"" which incorporates three different trades, to profit from differences in prices.


For example, imagine that you notice the following quoted prices: 20.00 USD/MXN, 0.2000 MXN/BRL, and 0.1500 BRL/USD (between the US Dollar, Mexican Peso, and Brazilian Real). You wonder if there is an arbitrage opportunity here so you start with a theoretical value of $10,000. With your $10,000, you could buy 200,00 Pesos (10,000*20.00 USD/MXN). Then, with your 200,000 pesos, you could buy 80,000 Reals (200,000*0.2000 MXN/BRL). Finally, with your 80,000 Reals, you could buy $12,000 Dollars (80,000*0.1500 BRL/USD). By making these trades, you've gained a $2,000 profit ($12,000 -$10,000).
In reality, arbitrage trades offer very little, if any, profit and price differences are corrected almost immediately. Lightning-fast trading systems and large investments are used to overcome these obstacles.
Trades in the forex are made in terms of lots. A standard lot is 100,000 units of a currency, a mini-lot in 10,000 units, and a micro-lot is 1,000 units., Traders, even very good ones, are often only left with a few points of arbitrage differences or trading gains. To counter these lows return percentages, the traders must make trades with large amounts of money. To increase the money available to them, traders often use leverage, which is essentially trading with borrowed money. Compared to other securities types, trades made in the forex markets can be made with incredibly large amounts of leverage, with typical trading systems allowing for 100:1 margin requirements.The 100:1 requirement means that you only need to actually deposit 1/100th of what you are investing in the currency. The deposit is known as the margin and protects you against future currency-trading losses.Trades using leverage magnify both potential gains and potential losses, so be careful when making these types of trades.

, The broker should be a member of the National Futures Association (NFA) and be registered with the U. S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a Futures Commission Merchant and Retail Foreign Exchange Dealer.Usually, you can determine if the broker is in compliance by visiting the ""About Us"" section of its website. That's where the company will disclose if it's a member of the NFA and registered with the CFTC.


The NFA establishes rules that preserve the integrity of the currency exchange market.
The mission of the CFTC is to ""protect market users and the public from fraud, manipulation and abusive practices related to the sale of commodity and financial futures and options, and to foster open, competitive and financially-sound futures and option markets.""

, It may be the case that you're looking to trade a specific pair of currencies (for example, U.S. dollars for Swiss francs). Be absolutely certain that the brokerage you're considering offers that pair.

, If you think you've found a great brokerage, search online for reviews of the brokerage and see if other people have had a good experience. If you find that the vast majority of reviewers are complaining about the brokerage, move on.

, Make sure that the trading platform is designed in such a way that you find it easy to use. Usually, brokerage sites will offer screen shots of their trading platforms online. You might also find some YouTube videos showing people actually using the trading platform. Be sure that it's the kind of platform you can work with.

, You're going to have to pay money every time you make a trade. Be sure that the commission you're paying is competitive.

, As with everything else in life, you get better at forex trading with practice. Fortunately, almost all of the major trading platforms offer a so-called practice platform that you can use to trade currency without spending any of your hard-earned money. Take advantage of that platform so that you don't burn cash while you're on a learning curve.


When you make mistakes during your practice trading sessions (and you will), it's important that you learn from those mistakes so that you avoid making them again in the future. Practice trading won't do you any good if you're not benefiting from the experience.

, When you've completed your practice trading and have determined that you're ready for the real world, it's a good idea to start small. If you risk a significant amount of money on your first trade, you might find that fear of loss kicks in and your emotions take over. You might forget what you've learned in your practice trading and react impulsively. That's why it's best to invest small amounts at first and then increase the size of your positions over time.

, Record your successful and unsuccessful trades in a journal that you can review later. That way, you'll remember the lessons of the past.

, Arbitrage opportunities pop up and disappear many times every day so it's up to you as a trader to locate them and make your move. Looking for these opportunities manually is almost impossible; by the time you've calculated whether or not arbitrage exists, the moment is over. Luckily, many online trading platforms and other websites offer arbitrage calculators that can help you locate opportunities quickly enough to take advantage of them. Search online to find these tools., If you want to be a successful forex trader, you're going to need an understanding of basic economics. That's because macroeconomic conditions within a country will affect the value of that country's currency. Pay particular attention to economic indicators like the unemployment rate, inflation rate, gross domestic product, and the money supply.Even more important: pay attention to the trend in those indicators so you get an idea of where they're headed.


If a country is about to enter an inflationary period, for example, then that means that the value of its currency is about to go down.You wouldn't want to buy that currency.
Pay attention to countries with an economy that's sector-driven. For example, Canada's dollar tends to move in tandem with crude oil. If there's a rally in crude oil prices, it's likely that the Canadian dollar will also appreciate in value. So, if you think that oil will increase in value in the short-term, it might be a good idea to buy the Canadian dollar.
Follow a country's trade surplus or deficit.If a country is running a healthy trade surplus, that means that buyers of its products will have to convert their currency into the nation's currency first. That's going to spur demand for the currency and cause it to appreciate in value. If you think a country's trade outlook is going to improve, it might be a good idea to buy that country's currency.

, There are a number of principles of sound forex trading mentioned in the previous step. However, the economic conditions that are described there don't exist in a bubble. You have to look at the complete economic picture before purchasing a country's currency.


For example, a country could run a healthy trade surplus, which might cause its currency to appreciate. At the same time, that country could be a sector-driven nation with a currency that's tied to oil. If oil is dropping at the same time that its trade outlook is improving, its currency might not appreciate in value.

, Technical analysis is another way that you can make money in forex. If you examine the historical chart for a specific currency, you might notice certain patterns in that chart. Some of those patterns can offer predictions about where the currency is going.


The head and shoulders pattern is an indication that the currency is about to break out of its price range.That's a technical indicator used by many forex traders.
The triangle pattern is an indication that the high-low range of a currency is tightening.It's also a signal that the currency could break out, depending on the overall direction of the triangle.
An engulfing pattern is noticeable on candlestick charts. That's when the range of one candle completely engulfs the range of the previous candle. In that case, the currency is likely to move in the direction of the engulfing candle. It's an excellent trading signal used by many forex investors.

Find a good riding school with a good reputation.,
Take and watch riding and horse care lessons, even if you already know how to ride and care for horses.,
Tell your instructor your ambitions.,
Get involved at the riding school.,
Start teaching the basics.,
Help in lessons.",How to Become a Riding Instructor or Coach1," Although all riding students should try a find a good riding school, it is even more important for someone who plans to go into a profession that is very reliant on reputation. For an unqualified or newly qualified instructor having the recommendation and contacts of a respected instructor can be make or break.;
, Being able to ride and care for horses is not the same as being able to teach riding and horse care. Watching is, in many cases, better, as you can watch a range of levels, do not have to focus on learning or riding yourself and it’s free.

, He or she is the person in the best position to help and advise you. If you want to become an instructor you should have a passion for horses and other ponies.

, Although it is a good idea to view as many schools and instructors as possible early on, at this stage it is best to make a commitment to only one or two schools. Some riding schools have a volunteer program which will allow you to take part in stable duties. Be reliable, helpful and friendly with the staff.

, Knowing when new students come in is very helpful. Offer to give them a quick tour, show them their mount, and teach them to groom and tack up.

, In horse care lesson this is fairly straight forward and you may well be more involved in the teaching. For a mounted lesson this could mean helping people check tack before the lesson, putting up jumps and moving equipment, cleaning up after the horses, having a horse/pony on lead rein and generally being a second pair of hands. While in the ring stay alert and look alert. Even if you are aware of where all the horses are all the time the instructor must feel confidant that you are. Don’t give instructions, talk unnecessarily or otherwise distract attention. If you must talk you will normally talk to the instructor only, the exception being if you are helping a student with something. Talk to a low clear voice, close to the person you are speaking to. If you have any questions about the lesson ask them after the lesson is over and the students and horses have been seen to. Remember that this is the riders’ lesson not yours.

Decide on your method of gaining your qualification.",How to Become a Riding Instructor or Coach3," In some countries you can work completely unqualified as a professional (paid) riding instructor. You must however be honest about you qualifications with all your clients.

, Liability insurance is expensive, especially for unqualified, free-lance instructors, but without it you are risking everything you own. Unfortunately for someone with only one or two clients, the cost of insurance will mean you will make a loss.

, Try teaching a friend to ride and encourage them to enter shows when they feel confident with their ability. Some one might see your student, comment on how well she rides, and ask who taught her. This will spread your name around the show ring and you may just get a few new pupils.

, By becoming a member you may be covered by their insurance for volunteer club activities. It is a great advertising platform to gain paying clients

, Ask at livery yards if they allow outside instructors to teach their livery clients in their faculties, and if they will allow you to advertise on their board. Be aware that some won't allow it, most will want to see proof of insurance. Keep an eye out in horse magazines and your local newspaper, as they might have advertisements looking for an instructor or a coach.

, This will probably be the most sensible route for you to take too, as your instructor will know what will be expected of you and will be able to help prepare you better.

, The Internet is good resource for this but make good use of the phone too. You want an internationally recognized and respected qualification.

, Working student positions are common and if you do not have family commitments, you are free to move to the best opportunities. Your employer will pay for your training; however you must be prepared to work hard for little money. Taking a college course is another option, though it will probably only take you so far in your instructor rating. If you are under 19 years old, in a country with free education, this is often the most affordable option. Organizing and paying for the training and exams yourself is the most expensive option. For most people it will mean working another job outside the low-paying equine industry, thereby cutting your studying and experience-building time. Your instructors, riding school and riding club will be vital if you choose this method.

, There will probably be a member fee, but insurance is sometimes included or you will be able to get a reduction.

, Even if you must work for free, do a few lessons for them a week. Working free-lance under no supervision will at best allow you skills to stagnate, at worse let them slip. You will never finish learning all there is about horses, riding or teaching.

Take your first subbing job.,
Set the tone for the class by introducing yourself and laying out classroom rules.",How to Become a Substitute Teacher in the United States," The educational requirements for substitute teachers varies from state to state. If you already have a teaching certification to be a regular teacher, you can often fast track the process by contacting the local school district’s office to apply to be a sub.In most states, if you do not have a teaching certification, you must at least have a bachelor’s degree. The bachelor’s degree does not need to be in teaching or pedagogy, though an undergraduate degree in these fields is considered beneficial for subbing.
In Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Delaware, Maine, and Vermont, you can be a substitute teacher as long as you have a high-school diploma or a GED equivalent. Detailed information on the educational requirements for substitute teachers by state can be found online.Some states, such as New York State, also require you to pass a state teaching test to ensure you are fit for teaching.;
, The pay for substitute teachers can be pretty good, in general, though it may fluctuate based on the state you are teaching in. Substitute teachers are paid per diem, or per day. As a sub, you can be signed to a contract at a specific day rate but you may not receive extensive employee benefits.Substitute teachers who have a teaching certification can earn around $100 to $125 a day. Substitute teachers who do not have a teaching certification can earn around $80 a day. You may earn more than this based on your state’s mandated pay rates for substitute teachers. For example, in New York state, substitute teachers without a teaching certification can earn around $150 a day., As a substitute teacher, you will be expected to sufficiently cover the absence of regular, full time teachers. You may be responsible for planning lessons, instructing students on the learning material for the class, and managing the classroom so students do not get out of hand or appear unsupervised. You may also need to perform administrative tasks and ensure the overall safety and security of the students.As a sub, you have the flexibility to choose the days that you work and how often you work. You can also choose which schools you work in.Subbing can be a good way to get first hand experience as a graduate student in education or as a way to connect to students without the commitment of a full time position.

, You should bring proof of your bachelor’s degree and a copy of your official transcripts to the school district’s office. These documents are required for the application.If you do not have a bachelor’s degree, you should bring a copy of your high school diploma or your GED equivalent.
The application is pretty straightforward and requires you to provide personal information as well as education information. The school district will also run a background check on you to ensure you have not been convicted of a felony involving minors.
You may need to pay a processing fee for the application, usually around $50-$100.

, Some states, such as New York state, require you to get nominated by a principal at a local school. The principal will complete an online nomination for you, putting your name in the system as a substitute teacher. Once the online nomination is processed, you will receive an email with instructions on how to complete your application.You will then need to complete Employment forms and any follow up requirements, such as fingerprints for a background check.

, Make sure you complete the application for employment through the school district and supply all the necessary documentation. You can complete the application in person at the school district’s office or online through the school district’s office.As part of the application process, you may want to list skills and abilities you have that will make you a more attractive candidate. Note if you have ever worked with children and have taught in some form or fashion before, such as after school tutoring, mentoring young kids, or working at a youth summer camp. You should also note if you have skills in a particular subject, such as writing experience for an English class or business experience for a mathematics class. These skills can help you stand out and increase your chances of getting hired as a sub.
If you are hired, you will be notified of your employment through your local school district. You will then be placed on the substitute teacher list for your school district. This means you are now eligible to sub in your school district.

, Like permanent teachers, substitute teachers are unionized. You should sign a contract for subbing and be aware of who your union representative is. It is your responsibility as a sub to know your rights under the union and to read your contract carefully.Each state will have their own teacher's union and the union will have their own contracts. You should check with your union representative about the details of your contract so you are aware of your rights.
You should check that your pay rate is on par with what subs are paid in your state. You should also note if your pay rate is different due to your lack of teaching certification, as you may be paid less if you do not have a teaching certification.

, Once you have a substitute-teaching license, you should consider which grade levels you are interested in subbing for. Some licenses only allow you to teach K-6th grade. You may be able to sub for other grade levels if you take additional training programs or classes.In a pinch, some schools may bend the rules and allow you to sub for different grade levels. It can be useful to determine which grade levels you are comfortable with, as you are more likely to do a better job if you know what to expect of the students.
Pre-K to 2nd grade classes tend to require more hands on care and attention while students in grades 3-5 may be more challenging to your authority but also eager to learn academic subjects in detail. Many older grades, grade 5 and over, can be more challenging and require a thick skin. It can be especially hard for substitute teachers to connect to older students, as you do not have the luxury of building a relationship with them over a long period of time.

, It’s a good idea to be prepared ahead of time, before your first subbing assignment, as you will need to rely on your own expertise in the classroom to do well as a sub. Having a few assignments and activities on hand can really make your subbing experience a lot smoother. Though some full time teachers will leave a lesson plan or an outline for the class, you should not depend on this always being the case.This means gathering school supplies, such as grade level workbooks, that you can then use as part of your lesson plan for a class. You can also keep a list of books that are appropriate for certain grade levels and copies of these books in the event you need them for a class. Look up fun educational activities online that you can use to fill time in a class and keep them on hand.
You should use any materials left for you by the full time teacher, as you want to try to integrate her lesson plans into the class. Deliver what the full time teacher wants you to during class time and if there is any available time, deliver a little of your own lesson plans.

, This is done through a phone call one day before the subbing date or on the morning of the subbing date. You will be notified of the grade you are teaching, the teacher’s name, the subject you are teaching, and the school where you are subbing.Try to arrive 45 minutes early for the subbing assignment and take a walk around the school. Note where certain areas are located in the school, such as the gym, the cafeteria, the computer lab, and the library. This will ensure you feel comfortable in the school and appear confident to the students when you walk into the classroom as the sub.
You should also review any lesson plans left for you by the full time teacher and note any supplies you may need, such as photocopies or school supplies. Ideally, you will also have access to an attendance sheet so you can note any students who are absent and get a general sense of the names of students in the classroom. This will make it easier for you to connect to students by name.

, The first ten minutes of the class are crucial for setting the tone for the class and maintaining control over your students. Start by introducing yourself by writing your name on the board and telling the students your name and one to two short details about yourself. Then, note that you are subbing for the regular teacher and though you are not the regular teacher, you still have ground rules for the class.

You can create your own rules for the class but it would be a good idea to set at least two key rules: No talking when you are talking and be respectful towards other students as well as towards you as the sub. You can then add more rules as needed, but setting these two rules upfront can help to set a respectful and productive tone for the class.
You should also keep the energy up in the room by asking students to lead discussions or take the lead on certain assignments or activities in class. Make sure you follow any lesson plans left for you by the regular teacher and keep student participation high so the students are focused and engaged.

In some countries, certain grades from these school years are necessary. In other words, the better you do, the better your chances.;
, Most teaching programs won't even consider admitting you if you don't have a reasonable amount of experience working with kids. Volunteer in a classroom, doing Big Brothers, Big Sisters, or get a job at a daycare or other child-friendly facility.

, You will need to get a higher degree beyond the basic secondary/high school degree. This should preferably be a degree in education, but some countries and states have a bit of a leeway on that. Find out the requirements for your area. Again, the better your grades, the better your chances., There are usually a series of tests you will need to complete in addition to your degree, which will allow you to become a teacher. Complete these tests and anything else necessary to get your certification.

, Usually, a period of student teaching is necessary before you can get your certification. There may also be other requirements as well, however. Most areas will require, for example, a background check and fingerprinting. All necessary requirements will be made clear to you upon completion of your certification.

, This is the basic, state-funded school where the majority of students will be found. This requires the most amount of effort and training but tends to lead to more secure employment and benefits.

, At-risk schools are low-income schools where the students are at risk of falling into a life of drugs or crime, never finishing school, and generally going on to very hard lives. Often times, these schools have students who are second-language learners (ELLs). Teaching at schools like these can be more rewarding but is also more challenging and dangerous. If you go on to teach at schools like these, there is the possibility of your student debt being forgiven. Many programs like these are in-place across the world.

, Private schools are those run by companies or churches which often require perhaps a better education but often fewer hoops to jump through. A formal certification may not be necessary, but a high degree often is. These teaching jobs can pay better and the students will generally be better behaved.

, If you find that perhaps children aren't right for you, you can teach at a college instead. This usually requires at least a Masters degree, and most times a PhD. The pay is sometimes better, but the teachers have fewer resources available to them.

, If you want to avoid getting proper credentials but you have a degree in an appropriate field, you can get a job as a teacher at an online school. This will probably not pay as well, there will be less job security, and you may not have access to benefits, but you can work from home and your schedule may be more flexible.

, If you find that these routes are all too challenging for you, you can also just be a private tutor. You can join a tutoring center or you can work for yourself. This does not pay well but provides much more flexibility and one-on-one contact.

,, This is a letter you write stating your wish to apply for a particular position. Only include this if it is asked for.

, These are crucial for getting a job. Have your references written out and formatted properly. Also, make sure that all of your references know you're using them as a reference!

, Get samples of lesson plans you've written, your students' work, sample items you've used in lessons, and books you like to work with in your classroom. The schools will wish to see this material.

, Every school, area and country have different requirements for applying teachers so look out for other materials that may be called for in the application.

, You can find positions through the district website, non-profit organizations, job fairs, and other places as well. It depends on the type of position you're looking for. Most teaching programs will have resources to help you find a job when you graduate. , This is important. Go in looking like a pro and make a great impression. You can be the most qualified teacher in the world but if you have a giant stain on the front of your shirt and you show up late, you're not getting the job.

Don’t rule out starting as an Assistant Teacher or teacher’s aid.",How to Become a Nursery Teacher," Many people who want to become preschool teachers do so because they love working with children, but it is a very intense and grueling profession, often involving long hours crafting lesson plans or writing student evaluations. However, it is also an invaluable profession that helps the youngest students become lifelong learners. The following are among the content and skills you’ll be responsible for guiding students through:Learning to recognize letters and sounds
Learning numbers and counting
Learning the basics of writing
Learning to follow directions, voice their needs, and socialize;
, Preschool teaching is not for everyone, especially given the long hours and relatively low pay. In addition to a passion for working with children, you should have the following characteristics:Ability to communicate with different kinds of people. Communicating with a four-year-old requires different skills from communicating with her parent or presenting to colleagues and administrators.
Creativity and adaptability. Not only must you be able to develop engaging lesson plans, but you must also be able to adapt these lesson plans. Different students will have very different needs.
Organization. You will need to make careful notes about your lesson plans (what you did, what worked and what didn’t, what you would change in the future). While preschool teachers generally do not give their students formal grades, you will also need to keep track of your students’ work so that you can write regular progress reports.
Patience. A room full of preschoolers can’t help but be frustrating at times, but you cannot become overwhelmed by this inevitability. Can you maintain your calm at all times?
Energy. Preschoolers are also physically exhausting. Do you have the stamina to interact with them for seven or eight (or more) hours a day, most of it standing, and then spend several hours writing lesson plans afterwards?

, While the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that preschool teaching will continue to grow over the next several years, meaning that there will be more jobs, these jobs will continue to pay modestly.The number of children between three and five is expected to grow over the next several years. Many of them will be enrolled in preschool.
You will have a much easier time finding a job if you have some education past high school, especially if you have a bachelor’s degree.
However, even those with bachelor’s degrees will likely make less money than people in other closely-related professions.

Preschool teachers had a median salary of $27,130 in 2012.Kindergarten and elementary school teachers had a median salary of $53,430 in 2012.Part of this difference can be attributed to the different places in which nursery teachers work, with those employed in schools making more.Keep these factors in mind when it comes to pursuing different qualifications.

, These range from a high school diploma to a bachelor’s degree.Childcare centers require that you have a high school diploma and a special certification for working with young children. The most common certification is the National Early Childhood Program Accreditation.Head Start programs (founded to serve low-income children) require you to have an associate’s degree, although half of their teachers must have bachelor’s degrees.Public schools generally require you to have a bachelor’s degree.

, In some states, you are legally required to have experience working with young children to be hired as a preschool teacher. Even if it is not required, prospective employers will certainly look for it. Experience could be in a daycare, summer camp, after-school program, or as a teacher’s aide., At two years, an associate’s degree can put you on the path to your desired profession faster and less expensively than a bachelor’s degree. Community colleges in your area will frequently offer associate’s degrees in early childhood education and related fields.You will take courses in subjects including educational principles, child development, administration and management, and language arts instruction for young students.
You will also complete some student teaching.

, A bachelor’s degree in early childhood education or a related field will combine coursework in core social sciences and humanities subjects with both courses and extensive fieldwork (observation and student teaching) in education. These programs will also prepare you to become certified in your state.

, Most states will require you to pass additional tests before you can become certified to teach in public schools. In some states you will take a test called the PRAXIS, while others develop their own testing materials. Online guides have also compiled directories of each state’s requirements, though much of the content will not vary.The Education of Young Children PRAXIS will test your knowledge of subjects including child development; appropriate observation and assessment techniques; professional behavior, communication, and development; level-appropriate content; and pedagogical strategies.State exams may be structured differently, but they will test much of the same knowledge, including your understanding of both the subject matter and how to teach it and your ability to interact with children and families from diverse backgrounds.Once you have completed testing, complete your state’s certification application (go to your state’s Department of Education or visit its website), and gather some or all of the following: transcripts, test scores, previous teaching certifications, recommendations, and background check results. Mail the application and required documents to the address specified on the application., Although preschool teaching is a growing field, people are also waiting longer to retire, and state and federal funding for education is an often-contested field. You might not find your dream job at first, but there are steps you can take to increase the likelihood of long-term success.

, Find job listings for positions in public schools on state Department of Education websites.The National Association of Independent Schools posts listings for jobs in private schools., While you become certified in a specific state, many states have reciprocity with one another. For instance, if you are certified in Pennsylvania, you will be able to teach in public schools in Delaware and other neighboring states. It might make for a longer drive, but in many cases it is doable.

, While every school is different, employers will be looking for many of the same qualities in potential hires. You'll be doing yourself a disservice if you go into your interviews blind. Instead, be prepared so that you will meet--or even exceed--your interviewers' expectations.Practice answering tough questions. Being able to speak extemporaneously is important, but that doesn't mean you should avoid practicing answers to difficult questions. Be ready to discuss the following:

Why you decided to become a preschool teacher
Addressing different styles of learners
Your pedagogical approach and the theories underpinning it
Communicating with parents
Assessing student progress
The specific school or school district where you are interviewing


Bring the right materials. You've already sent them your resume, letters of recommendation, and perhaps a portfolio, but interviewers will be impressed if you bring copies of these materials on interview day, as well. Don't overwhelm them with content--just bring enough to appear organized and professional.
Be prepared to do a teaching demonstration. You may be asked to conduct a sample lesson in front of administrators and current teachers. This is usually not something that happens at a first interview. Teaching demonstrations are time-consuming, so schools will generally only invite finalists to do so.

, The turnover rate among preschool teachers can be high, so schools are sometimes left scrambling for a qualified candidate just days before the school year begins. Just because you did not get a specific job that you applied for in April, you are not necessarily out of luck come August. If possible, you should submit applications even to schools without advertised openings just in case such a situation occurs.

, Part of this will depend on the qualifications you have, but some of it will also be preference and job availability. Believe it or not, only 16% of preschool teachers work in public or private elementary or secondary schools. The rest are employed in daycares (54%), religious and other independent centers (21%), and individual arrangements (3%).Teachers in schools will generally teach during the school year, although they may also work in camps or elsewhere during the summer.
Teachers in daycares and other centers will generally teach all year long, and they may be with children for more hours of the day.

, Requirements vary greatly for substitute teaching, and they can differ even on a district-by-district basis. While some locales require that you be a certified teacher, others ask only for a high school diploma. Substitute teaching can be a great way of gaining experience and getting your foot in the door.You’ll need to contact the school district (or specific school, if you are interested in substituting in a private school where requirements may be less strict) to determine if you are qualified.
Be prepared to provide the school/school district with any transcripts and the results of a background check.

, Since preschool children require so much attention, many schools hire other adults to perform various instructional, organizational, and preparatory tasks. Like substitute teaching, this is both great experience and a way to make yourself a known quantity in the school.Some states have special programs where you can become an Assistant Teacher after completing two years of a bachelor’s degree program.
This way, when you graduate you will have a degree, a certification, and lots of experience—a good combination for being on the job market.

Use tutoring to gauge your interest in physics.",How to Become a Physics Teacher," In addition to physics, you should take classes in chemistry and biology. The math classes you should take include geometry, algebra, pre-calculus algebra, and calculus. If available, you should also take trigonometry and analytical geometry. This will give you a good idea about whether or not physics is a subject you truly enjoy.


Take your coursework seriously. Even if you decide to pursue a different career, if you want to go to college, you will need to have good grades in order to get into the university you want.Some school districts begin with biology, then move on to chemistry and physics, while others offer physics first, and then move to the other sciences. Some high schools also offer advanced as well as introductory physics classes.
You should also take as many English classes as you can in high school to improve your written and verbal communications skills; you may also want to consider a foreign language if you think you might like to teach in a foreign country.;
, The level at which you plan to teach physics will determine what credentials you need. If you plan to teach at the middle and high school level, you will likely need only a bachelor's degree initially, while if you plan to teach at the community college level, you will most likely need to obtain a master's degree in addition to your bachelor’s degree.Remember that you can always change your mind. If initially you wanted to be a high school physics teacher, but later decide you’d actually like to become a professor, you can always return to college to earn a higher degree.

, Different states have different laws that determine who can and cannot teach a particular subject, especially at the high school level. If you wish to teach high school physics be sure to understand the legal requirements for becoming a physics teacher.This information should be available through your state board of education. You can find this by doing an internet search with the terms, “State Board of Education” and the name of your state.
You can also talk with any teachers you know to see if they can give you any advice about becoming a teacher in your state.

, Depending on which college you attend, you may major in physics and minor in education, major in education and minor in physics, or go for a double major. Your physics classes will include classes in electromagnetic theory, optics, quantum physics, and thermodynamics, and may also include classes in astronomy and geology.Typically, your education coursework will include classes in general education theory and practical courses in teaching physics, concluding with either a single semester or 2 semesters of student teaching during your senior year. Most bachelor's degree programs take about 4 years to complete.
Some programs are structured so that you take your physics classes first and then your education classes, while others are structured so you take your physics and education classes at the same time.
College classes in either technical writing or scientific writing may also be helpful to build on the English classes you took in high school.

, If you plan to teach physics at the community college level, you'll need to get a master's degree before you can obtain a teaching position. If you plan to teach at the middle or high school level initially, you probably won't have to get your master's degree at first. However, many districts do provide incentives for teachers to get their master's degrees, and some states require teachers to hold master's degrees either at the start of their teaching careers or after several years. Most master's programs can be completed in 2 years and usually are oriented toward more independent study than undergraduate programs.Some universities will also accept master's degree holders as professors of physics on a part-time or adjunct basis.
Check the Board of Education website for the state or district in which you plan to teach to see whether and when you need to acquire your master's degree to be a physics teacher.

, This step is likely required if you're seeking a full-time position as a physics professor at a college or university that leads to tenure. PhD programs last for several years, during which time you'll combine teaching as a graduate assistant with independent study and research.You will need strong research skills to become a professor at a university as nearly all universities require their professors to publish their scientific findings on a regular basis.
You may be able to teach at a university without a PhD, but your contract will likely be limited when it comes to opportunities for advancement. If you have a PhD, you can also teach at lower levels if you wish. For example, you may be a top candidate for positions at private or independent high schools.

, In some states, if you already have a bachelor’s degree, but not specifically in education or science, you may be able to undertake a certification program that will allow you to teach. However, this varies widely by state so you will need to consult with the board of education in your state to see if this is a possibility.Beware online certification programs. While there are likely some legitimate online certification options, chances are that if you simply search Google, you will come across some scams or other programs which promise certification, but do not hold the accreditation necessary to do so. If you are interested in online degrees or certification programs, be sure to consult with the board of education about what online programs are accredited.

, Regardless of what degree you will need to earn, there are many options available to help you cover the costs of earning a degree. The best way to find out what’s available at your university is to visit your financial aid office. They will be able to explain to you the process of applying for financial aid, and can also give you a list of scholarships that you can consider applying for.The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program offers lots of scholarship options to aspiring teachers. In addition, PhysTec offers a number of scholarships to students of physics.
Many master’s and doctoral degree programs offer assistantships or other financial aid to students of their program. Be sure to look into what each program can offer you. Some programs require that you apply for the aid, so make sure that you include any required information with your application.

, One good way to gain experience teaching physics is to offer tutoring. You may have done this already to give yourself an idea about whether or not you will enjoy teaching. You can start offering tutoring at any point during high school or college. If you are a student in university, check to see if there is a defined institution where tutors are hired. If you are able to get hired on as a tutor through the university then you will be able to get letters of recommendation from your supervisor.


Be sure to include that you have been a tutor on your resume.

, If you are a university student, your supervisors will likely help you arrange this part of your education. However, if for some reason it is not arranged for you, take the initiative and ask your supervisors how you can get involved in student teaching.Student teaching will give you an opportunity to take everything you’ve learned and apply it under the guidance of a more experienced teacher. You will be required to plan lessons, teach, and answer questions in a real world environment.

, If you are a graduate school student, there are likely graduate teaching assistantships, which will provide you with an opportunity to give lectures to real students. Not only that, but in many cases the professor of the class will give you feedback on your teaching in order to help you improve.An added advantage is that graduate assistantships are usually paid, so you will be able to earn a bit of extra money at the same time.
If you are still an undergraduate student, but know that you would like to teach physics at the college level, then see if there are opportunities for undergraduate teaching assistantships.

, If you completed your student teaching at a school that is in need of more physics teachers, then consider submitting an application there. You will have the advantage that the people who would be hiring you already have knowledge of you and your teaching ability.


Don’t be afraid to talk with the teacher who mentored you, especially if you got along well and were able to impress them. Let them know that you are ready to start your teaching career and are planning to submit an application to teach there.

, Nearly all universities have some type of career services department where you can go to get help searching for jobs. Most offices will offer help even if you have already graduated. Your tuition helps to fund these services so you may as well take advantage of them.Even if you have already found jobs you want to apply for, you can still visit career services to get help with improving your resume, practice interviewing skills, and extra help with writing cover letters.

, While physics teachers often have a lot of good jobs to choose from due to demand, being a teacher is not an easy job, especially when teaching a difficult subject such as physics. How do you feel when you think about teaching the subject to students for the rest of your life?Remember that you can always change careers. While it is certainly not easy, if the idea of teaching the same subject for 40 years scares you, remember that you can try something new if you really do get tired of teaching.
If you enjoy talking about physics with others and have a real love for the subject, then you will probably make a great physics teacher.

, If you are still in high school or college, visit the physics teacher. Tell them that you are thinking of becoming one, and ask them to chat with you about the advantages and disadvantages of teaching the subject.


Experienced teachers can give you a good idea about what to expect when it comes to teaching physics. However, remember that their advice is somewhat subjective. Try to talk to a few different teachers as you may stumble upon some teachers who have become really bitter about teaching for one reason or another.

, One way to help yourself know whether or not this is something you would enjoy is to tutor. If you already have a good knowledge of the field, then consider offering free tutoring to those who are struggling. Although you could charge for your tutoring to earn a bit of extra money, if you are more interested in the experience, then offering tutoring free of charge will give you a chance to tutor more people.


You can advertise your tutoring by placing flyers with your name, phone number, and/or email near classrooms where physics is being taught. You can also place the flyers around your town where students typically hang out.

Ask yourself if you are self-motivated.,
Consider your communication skills.,
Think about your ability to prioritize and focus.,
Assess your home environment.",How to Know if You Should Work from Home1," Working remotely requires a certain degree of self-motivation. You won’t have the same degree of supervision as you do at a brick and mortar office. You will need to exercise discipline in completing your work and staying on task, which can be difficult without the in-person support of a boss and co-workers., Working from home requires good communication skills. You will be using web-based applications, email, and the telephone to communicate with your supervisor, co-workers, and clients. You should have clear writing skills, be able to effectively communicate via email, and be able to express yourself effectively over the phone and internet., Working from home means having the wherewithal to set priorities and focus on finishing the task at hand. This can be more challenging than it is in a traditional office where you have more direct supervision. You will be in charge of setting your hour-by-hour priorities and focusing on getting them done, despite distractions like dirty laundry or hungry kids., It's important to think about exactly where you'll be working in your home. You need a dedicated office space that is clean, free from distractions, and equipped with the proper technology. For example, if your current computer room is also where your ten-year-old practices piano and your husband tosses his dirty laundry, it might not be a suitable space for working from home.

Consider teaching private lessons.",How to Become a Music Teacher," You probably would not be interested in becoming a music teacher if you did not already enjoy and play music. If not, now is the time to start! Join your school’s chorus or band to see if you enjoy and excel at the serious study of music.;
, In addition to a music background, this career requires that you enjoy working with children, which is not for everyone. Do you have the patience, enthusiasm, and positive attitude to inspire the next generation of musicians?


Look into teaching music at a summer camp or in an after-school program. If you continue to pursue this kind of work during and after college, it can also count as teaching experience when it comes time to apply for jobs.Ask the music teacher at the elementary, middle, or high school you attended if you can interview them and/or shadow them for the day. Be sure to ask them what the most challenging and the most rewarding parts of the job are.

, If your school offers them, take classes in music history and theory, including AP Music Theory. Child psychology is also a natural fit for people interested in becoming music teachers.

, You might be surprised at the others kinds of classes that may be helpful. Since so much of music is now technology-driven, make sure you take the necessary classes to become computer literate. Aspiring composers in particular may find that they enjoy advanced math classes and that these classes help them think about music in new ways.

, It’s great to play in your school’s band or sing in the chorus, but if you want to attend a good program, you will need to do more than that. Private lessons can be pricey, but the right teacher can help take your skills to the next level.


Your teacher can also be a useful resource in identifying the best schools for you and preparing for auditions, which most music programs will require.

, You should be familiar with a range of styles, from classical to musical theater to rock. This doesn’t mean you have to shell out a lot of money to attend concerts. If you live near a college or university, you can likely find free or cheap live music, and almost everything is available on the internet., Most schools will not hire you without a degree in music, music education, or elementary education with an emphasis in music. You can determine which is best for you by thinking about what you want to focus on.


Music programs will focus on performance or composition.
Music education programs will include a combination of music and pedagogical (teaching) training.
Your pedagogical training will include both coursework and student teaching.

, Music and music education programs exist almost everywhere, so this can be an overwhelming process. Look for schools that are accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM). Narrow the field by thinking not only about the “best” schools, but also the best schools for you.


Research tuition and scholarships, both those offered by the school and by outside organizations.
Think about location. Each state has its own teacher certification process, so you might want to think about attending a school where faculty and advisors can guide you through this process in the state where you want to teach. At some schools, you can receive initial certification by completing the curriculum.
Visit the campus. University websites can tell you a lot about size, geographical location, and even courses, only visiting the department can really tell you whether the culture and feel are right for you.

, Most music and music education programs will require not only an application with test scores, grades, personal statements, and letters of recommendation, but also a live audition. This can be nerve-wracking!


Be prepared. You probably already know to practice, practice, practice your pieces, but practice the conditions of audition day, also. Do this by performing your pieces for family and friends, making sure you think about all the aspects of the audition—dressing professionally, greeting the committee, maintaining poise, etc.Stay excited about your pieces. Practice them in lots of different ways so that, on audition day, you are focused on the music rather than your nerves.The day of the audition, focus on your breathing. Make sure you are doing so deeply, from your diaphragm. This is especially important for singers, but it will also help to calm your nerves and so applies to everyone.
Don’t rush! When you are nervous, you tend to speed up. Your committee wants to see someone who can really interpret the music, not just pound out the notes.Know that mistakes will happen. This is OK! Your committee members are looking for potential, not perfection. You are auditioning to be a student, after all. You still have a lot to learn, and they know this., Your coursework will largely fall into three categories: musical practice and knowledge, pedagogy, and general liberal arts requirements.Musical practice and knowledge courses will likely include instrumental or vocal training, ear training and sight reading, music theory, and music history.
Pedagogy courses will likely include development psychology, methods for teaching elementary and secondary school students, and advanced study on special educational topics of your choice.
Liberal arts requirements are more open, but they will likely include writing and/or literature courses.
With these complex requirements, you should meet with your advisor early on and before each semester’s registration to make sure you are on track for graduation.

, You will need to hold at least a master’s degree if you wish to teach at the college level. Doing this immediately has some drawbacks, though. If you attend a graduate program without any teaching experience, you may price yourself out of the market.

, The state where you wish to become certified will look at your coursework and transcripts to make sure you have fulfilled all of their requirements. You might need to take more classes before you can receive initial certification. , This test will assess will test your knowledge of both core liberal arts and sciences topics and teaching skills, and you will need to pass it before you can move on., You will also need to demonstrate your master of the subject area you will be teaching.While these vary by state, there are some things you will probably need to know anywhere.


Testing areas will likely include music theory, music performance, listening skills, and music history and culture.
Questions will likely be a combination of multiple-choice and essay format.

, Many people who train to become music teachers are primarily interested in finding full-time work in schools, but this is not always easy to do. For starters, funding for the arts regularly comes under attack.Moreover, many teachers are waiting longer to retire. For these reasons, aspiring music teachers need to be proactive on the job market. Start applying for jobs before you graduate. It can take a while, so be patient.
Be prepared to relocate. The uncertainties of the job market might mean that you are not able to get a job in your first choice of location.

, With many more applicants than there are positions, you will need to find a way of setting yourself apart.


Maintain your own musical chops. You’ll be better prepared to educate others if you stay excited about performance and are constantly improving your skills.
As you deepen your skills, make sure you broaden them as well. In a crowded market, a singer/saxophonist/virtuoso improviser will be a more attractive candidate than someone who can do only one of these things.
Stay up to date on technology. It is rapidly introducing not only new ways of producing music, but also new methods of teaching it.

, Whether due to financial exigencies or preference, many music teachers end up giving private lessons. Teaching out of your home or studio can offer more flexible hours, the chance to connect with students one-on-one, and the opportunity to work with many different ages and ability levels, but there are also some drawbacks.


There is no required certification process for individuals who wish to teach music privately, although the Music Teachers National Association does offer a certification. Moreover, the people paying you for your services are depending on your skills, talents, and patience. If you cannot deliver, they may take their business elsewhere.
If you are a performer, it can be easier to balance rehearsals and performances with a private teaching schedule. You can also decide how many students you want to take on.
However, you will need to create individual lesson plans for each of your students. While it can be freeing not to be beholden to a curriculum, it can be very time-consuming, as well. You also cannot rely on a steady income the way teachers in schools can (at least on a year-to-year basis).
Your business will grow largely through word-of-mouth.

Eliminate your daily commute.,
Spend more time with your children.,
Save money on transportation, clothing, and lunch.,
Strike a more manageable work life balance.,
Minimize office drama and politics.",How to Know if You Should Work from Home2," When you work remotely you can save precious time each day when your daily commute is eliminated. Instead of spending an hour commuting to and from a brick and mortar office, you can spend that time on more important things like planning healthy meals, exercising, or spending time with friends and family., Working from home can mean a more flexible schedule and fewer hours spent commuting back and forth from the office. This translates into more time you can spend with your children during the workweek, allowing greater opportunities for transporting children to and from school, participating in extracurricular activities with them, and devoting more time to helping with homework. Parents of small children can even spend the work day with their kids., Remote workers don’t need to spend their hard earned cash on gasoline, bus fare, or train tickets. You also won’t need to invest a ton of money into your work wardrobe, and you’ll save money on eating out for lunch as well. These savings can be significant, especially when you consider the miles you won’t be putting on your odometer driving to and from an office space away from your home., A 2011 study found that people working from home reported around twenty-five percent less stress than those working away from home. They were also more likely to sustain a positive work life balance and managed to eat healthier than their counterparts who worked at corporate offices., Working from the comfort of your living room means you might be able to avoid some of the politics and drama at the workplace, because you will have fewer face-to-face interactions with your co-workers. Employees who work remotely may be less likely to engage in gossip and idle chat because they’re not hanging out in the break room, around the water cooler, or having lunch together."

Contemplate the challenges of maintaining work life boundaries.,
Consider the costs.,
Think about the importance of human connection.,
Examine your IT and computer maintenance skills.,
Don’t disregard distractions.",How to Know if You Should Work from Home3," While working remotely has its perks, it also has some downfalls. When you work from home it is often difficult to establish and maintain boundaries between work time and the rest of your life. When work bleeds into non-work, or vice versa, it can be difficult to maintain boundaries and effectively complete tasks., While working from home may save you money on transportation, it also might mean that you are bearing the burden of other work-related costs such as electricity, office supplies, and even equipment. Carefully consider these expenses before deciding whether working from home is right for you. You might, however, be able to take a home office deduction on your taxes., Working from home most often means working alone. By doing so you are foregoing day-to-day, in-person contact with your co-workers. This can lead to isolation. The lack of contact also means you are missing out on valuable face time that can spawn creativity and boost productivity., Working from home means you will not have the benefit of onsite computer maintenance and information technology specialists that many brick and mortar offices provide employees. When you have a computer issue while working from home you may have to assess the problem and find a solution on your own., In order to successfully work from home, you will need to figure out ways to eliminate distractions. These can be as simple as that unfolded basket of laundry or as complicated as a crying child who interrupts an important conference call. Take all possible distractions into consideration before you ditch the office and take up business in your bedroom."

Talk to your boss about working from home.,
Explore careers that are open to telecommuting.,
Develop a new skill set.",How to Know if You Should Work from Home4," The first step in figuring out whether you should work at home is exploring the possibility with your current employer. Many employers already have work-from-home policies in place, and you can explore these options with the help of your supervisor and your company’s human resources department., There are endless possibilities for working from home in the 21st century. Fields like computer and information technology, sales, customer service, marketing, finance, research, and web and software development often encourage employees to work from the comfort of their own homes., Once you’ve decided working from home is a good choice for you, consider developing a new skill set that will help you find employment in a telecommuting-friendly field. This could be as simple as refining your already existing web development skills or pursuing an entirely new degree in a field like computer science.

Though not every single Montessori-related job will require a college education, many states in the U.S. (and many countries outside the U.S.) have this as a requirement for Montessori teachers.In addition, the lack of a college degree may, in certain situations, qualify you only to become certified only for assistant-level positions. For these reasons, a college degree can greatly expand the range of Montessori opportunities available to you.


Luckily, Montessori teachers-in-training usually aren't required to have majored in education or a related field in college. Many successful Montessori teachers originally studied in fields as diverse as law, engineering, or the humanities.;
, Montessori certification training is a serious investment — though it will give you valuable skills and credentials, it can cost thousands of dollars and require a year or more to complete. Because of this, it's very, very important to be sure that the training center you enroll at is fully accredited by a recognized Montessori accreditation agency. Most legitimate training centers will be more than happy to disclose their accreditation status with you. If the training center you're thinking of enrolling in lacks the proper credentials, do not enroll — this can be a huge waste of your time and money.


Luckily, Association Montessori Internationale (AMI), the global Montessori association, has a directory of certified training centers available on its website. In addition, The Montessori Foundation has a more extensive list of training locations.
Additionally, the American Montessori Society offers a free online training center locator.
Note that, in the United States, accreditation from the Montessori Accreditation Council for Teacher Education (MACTE) is generally seen as the definitive sign of a training program's legitimacy., Contrary to popular belief, Montessori isn't just a style of teaching for preschool-aged children. In fact, it's a versatile teaching method that's used for children up to (and, in rare instances, through) their teenage years. While the foundational principles of Montessori teaching are the same for all Montessori classrooms, the techniques and skills used to teach different ages of children can vary substantially, so, in general, most people who want to become a Montessori teacher need to specialize in one or more educational age ranges. The most commonly-offered areas of certification are:Infant & Toddler: (0 - 3 years)
Early Childhood: (2.5 - 6 years)
Elementary I (6 - 9 years)
Elementary II (9 - 12 years)
Elementary I & II (6 - 12 years)
Montessori administration
Note that some special programs offer skills for teaching children up to age 18.

, When you've located a fully accredited training center near you, you'll want to enroll in the next available training session. The precise start and end dates of your training period will vary based on your training agency — for instance some courses run year-round, while others take place over one, two, or more summers.Pick a training schedule that accommodates your goals and needs.


Montessori training programs vary in price, but, in general, you should expect to spend at least several thousand dollars. For instance, some relatively low-cost Infant/Toddler training programs run at about $2,000 in total., Though training programs can vary, in general, people training to become Montessori teachers attend classroom lectures, complete written coursework, and practice hands-on training. The mixture of abstract and practical work offered by most Montessori programs is designed to produce a graduate who is comfortable and experienced working in a Montessori classroom setting and who understands the principles of Montessori teaching well enough to adapt to any situation. In general, Montessori teachers-in-training should expect to:Complete approximately 1,200 hours of instruction in total.
Demonstrate an ability to create Montessori teaching materials for all subjects.
Participate in approximately 90 hours of classroom observations and supervised teaching.
Complete an on-site teaching practicum.

, Congratulations! You've completed your Montessori training and you're now fully certified to lead a Montessori classroom. Many Montessori teachers get their first job from connections they make during their on-site training and practicum. However, if you don't, this is OK — except in some cases (like for certifications earned through distance learning),Montessori credentials are transferable, marketable skills. Generally, people who have just received their Montessori credentials will want to apply for jobs at local schools with open positions for teaching children of the age range(s) for which they are certified to teach.


While you can simply contact local schools directly to check for job openings, an even easier way to find open positions is to use an online Montessori job finder! For instance, the American Montessori Society's online job search utility allows you to quickly find Montessori openings in your local area.

, As you would do when searching for any other job, you'll generally want to apply for multiple positions when you're looking to become a Montessori teacher. In some situations, you may be in competition with other Montessori teachers for the opening, and since you've presumably just become certified, you may have less teaching experience than some of the other candidates, so applying to a range of positions gives you the best possible chance of eventually getting a job.


Note that, in the U.S., public schools generally pay their teachers higher salaries than private schools.However, for some teachers, private schools offer a freer, easier teaching environment with none of the bureaucracy of the public school system.

, As with most other jobs, prospective Montessori teachers generally go through an interview/vetting process before being hired. You may be required to provide a resume, proof of your certification, and/or personal references (for these, the teachers with whom you completed your practicum are great choices). As you're being considered for the job, you'll want to show your potential employer that you fully understand the principles of Montessori teaching and that you're able to put them in to action in a classroom setting. Below are just a few things you may want to be prepared to talk about:The main principles of Montessori education (see section below)
Your plan for organizing your classroom and coursework
Unique teaching materials and opportunities you developed during your practicum
Instances when you worked to help a slow-learning child progress during your practicum
Your commitment to your students, the public, and your profession (a teacher's three main commitments in the Montessori code of ethics), As a first-time teacher, it's a possibility that you won't get your ideal teaching position immediately. This is OK — like any other job, the profession of teaching values experience and seniority. As you teach in positions that may not necessarily be ideal to you, you'll gain valuable skills and experience that, in addition to making you a better teacher, will also make you a more attractive job candidate in the future. Stick with it — when it comes to getting your preferred jobs, more experience is always a good thing.

, Unlike traditional classrooms, Montessori classrooms are largely student-led. In other words, students have a great deal of freedom in choosing when and how they complete their assignments (and, in some cases, even which assignments they complete). This principle is fundamental to the Montessori style of teaching. Children who lead their own educational experience learn independence and are more motivated to learn because of the freedoms they're given.


For instance, in Montessori classroom, it's not uncommon for the teacher to act as a ""guide"", rather than an instructor. She guides the children to their hands-on activities (and sits down and helps them if needed), but she allows them to interact freely with their environment. She doesn't force them to sit in rows of desks and complete assignments according to rigid rules.

, Montessori classrooms are much more hands-on than traditional classrooms. While some Montessori coursework may involve writing, spelling, drawing, and other activities that are done at a desk or table with pencil and paper, Montessori teachers look for opportunities for students to learn by manipulating hands-on objects like blocks, beads, and specially-designed Montessori teaching materials. Montessori educators understand that children (especially young children) don't learn best by sitting and listening to lectures — they learn by teaching themselves and each others as they interact with their environment.


For example, while a traditional classroom may teach the concept of addition by rote math drills, Montessori classrooms may use hands-on materials like abacus-style ""grids"" of sliding beads to teach the same concept.

, In Montessori classrooms, children are largely free to come and go as they please. While there may be some periods of quiet, organized instruction, most of the time, children are allowed to move throughout the classroom from activity to activity. The classroom is designed to be accessible to the children — for instance, in a Montessori preschool classroom, teaching materials will usually be arranged on low, open shelves and the chairs, tables and work stations will all be appropriately sized for young children.

, While Montessori teachers are always available to offer their help to children who need them, often, they make an effort to step back and monitor the children as they learn, stepping in only as needed. Montessori teachers give their students opportunities to interact with their educational materials and each other with a minimum of interruption for hours at a time. This approach allows children to learn at their own pace without the interference of a rigidly structured schedule, which, for many children, can present unnecessary barriers to learning.


For example, in a Montessori classroom, the teacher may instruct her children that, by the end of the day, they need to complete and turn in three specific educational tasks. During the day, the teacher will walk through the classroom, interacting with the children, monitoring their behavior, and offering help to those who need it, but she won't assign specific time deadlines for them to complete their various tasks.

, One important hallmark of Montessori education is that classrooms can include children of varying ages. With this approach, the older, more experienced children are encouraged to teach the younger ones, which benefits both students — the young children receive instruction from their peers and the older children demonstrate mastery of the coursework by teaching it themselves. In addition, children taught in a mixed-age environment gradually become more patient and comfortable interacting with others of varying learning ability.

, When you pursue an undergraduate degree, you must choose a major in which to concentrate your studies. Depending on what course of study you choose, you also may be able to pursue two majors, or one major and a minor area of study. While some colleges and universities offer a pre-law major when earning your bachelor’s degree, it is not required that you hold a bachelor’s degree in law or even a closely related field in order to attend law school. It is fairly common for people seeking to attend law school in the future to earn bachelor’s degrees in pre-law, political science, business, and economics. However, individuals holding degrees in other fields often are accepted to law school.


To maximize your ability to successfully attend law school, you should consider taking courses that would strengthen your public speaking, writing, and analytical skills, which are necessary such as speech, English, business writing, and similar courses.
If your interest in the law concerns legal business transactions, you may explore a degree in business or a related discipline.

This can be either a bachelor’s of science degree or a bachelor’s of arts degree, depending on your chosen major. You cannot attend law school without an undergraduate degree, and you cannot become a law professor without attending law school. Obtaining an undergraduate degree typically involves a course of study lasting four to five years, if you pursue the degree on a full-time basis. Attending college on a part-time basis is likely to take longer, depending on how many courses you take each semester.

, Most law schools will not admit a student who has poor grades. Some law schools even require that you have a certain grade point average in order to eligible for admission. If you cannot maintain a high grade point average, you are not as likely to do well in law school.

, Most college campuses have a pre-law group for people who are interested in eventually attending law school or becoming lawyers. These groups often sponsor a practice LSAT, which is the law school admissions test. You also may be able to get information about different law schools through this group., Even if you find a clerical job in the court system or a job running errands to the courthouse, being exposed to the legal world can help you decide if law is a career that you want to pursue. You also can observe the legal environment in which you are working and learn about the inner workings of a law firm or court.

, You will need to understand that the majority of law professors graduated from the most prestigious law schools, like Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Chicago, Columbia, Michigan, NYU, Berkeley, Virginia, Duke, Penn, Cornell, Georgetown, Northwestern, Texas, and UCLA. In fact, most law professors graduated from Yale, Harvard, Stanford, and Chicago. According to at least one law professor, you will have little change of getting a law professor position unless you hold a law degree from one of these schools. Take this fact into consideration when choosing law schools.There are a few other schools that have produced law professors, including USC, Vanderbilt, Emory, Notre Dame, Minnesota, Iowa, George Washington, and Washington and Lee, although those individuals were at the top of their law school classes and had other impressive credentials.

, While you are still pursuing your undergraduate degree, you should study for and take the LSAT. The LSAT is the traditional admissions test for law school. You may want to consider taking the LSAT during your junior year of college, so that you will have the opportunity to retake the LSAT during your senior year if you want to improve your score. Just as other professions require applicants to take admissions tests prior to enrolling into the program, prospective law students must complete this standardized admissions testing.It costs $175 to take the LSAT. There is an additional $170 fee if you want to have your scores sent directly to the law schools to which you apply.
The LSAT is offered in many different locations nationwide four to five times per year. The test is administered at several locations in each state.
The LSAT is a half-day exam that consists of five sections of 35 multiple-choice questions. Four of the five sections contribute to your overall LSAT score, which is what the law schools to which you apply receive. There is also a 35-minute unscored writing sample that is also provided to the law schools to which you apply.

, Contact each law school in which you are interested for its individual admissions requirements. Most law schools will require you to complete an extensive application. Additionally, you will be required submit your LSAT scores and provide certified copies of your undergraduate transcripts to each law school to which you apply.


The Registrar’s office of your college will be able to assist you in getting certified copies of your transcripts. A small fee is often charged for getting certified copies.
When you take the LSAT, you will have the opportunity to have your scores directly sent to a number of law schools that you designate. Your writing sample also will be sent to those schools.
Most law schools charge an application fee, which typically can range from $25 - $75 per application.
Some law schools are more competitive in terms of admissions than others. Some schools may require a certain LSAT score or a certain undergraduate grade point average in order to qualify for admission. Be sure to choose a number of schools to which to apply, including at least one that you believe is likely to admit you as a student.

, When investigating and obtaining information on law schools, be sure to ask what resources and opportunities they offer to students. It is also important to verify that each law school that you consider is accredited. Understand that your choice of law school may have a substantial impact on whether you will be able to obtain a law school position; the more nationally prestigious your law school is, the better change you will have of breaking into the legal teaching market.

, Most accredited law schools offer a three-year course of study. Some law schools offer four-year joint degree programs, such a J.D/M.B.A. degree. Required courses for law students typically include those pertaining to civil procedure, criminal law, torts, constitutional law and legal research and writing.

, A top academic performance in your law school career is essential to becoming a law professor. Many law professor positions are reserved for the best and brightest of law school graduates. Getting good grades will put you in a better position to achieve your career goals. Having a high class standing is often essential for getting a law professor position.

, In addition to developing legal knowledge and expertise, working in the legal field also allows you to network with others and establish connections. These contacts can be invaluable resources as you venture into other career opportunities.


You often can complete internships and summer jobs for law firms and other entities providing legal services in order to get experience while you are still in law school. Some of these opportunities are quite competitive, and will select only the top students from law schools.
You may be able to work part-time at a local law firm while attending school. While your primary focus should be on your studies, getting a few hours per week of actual law experience can be invaluable.

, All law schools have at least one law journal that is largely managed by law students, under the guidance of a law professor. Being selected for law review can be a quite prestigious honor. Most students on law review have excellent grades and writing skills. You also may have the opportunity to publish a student note in a law journal, which is a research article on some aspect of the law.


Try to be selected for one of the law journal’s board positions, such as Articles Editor or Editor-in-Chief. This is a credential that is highly recommended to have when seeking a career as a law professor.

, All law schools have moot court or mock trial program, in which law students compete against one another. These programs offer a certain measure of prestige for the winners. The programs also teach you practical trial and public speaking skills that will be invaluable in your future career.

, Many law schools have clinical programs that allow law students, under the supervision of a licensed attorney, to handle actual cases in certain areas of the law. For instance, some law school clinics focus on cases involving children. Other clinical programs provide legal representation for domestic violence victims. These programs give you not only academic credit, but also real-life experience practicing law.

, Once you have completed the course of study at your law school, you will graduate with a J.D. This is the final degree required to become a law professor. While there are advanced law degrees available, particularly for international students seeking to become educated as lawyers in the United States, they are not a requirement for becoming a law professor.It is estimated that only 10 – 25% of law school professors hold an advanced law degree such as a LL.M, Ph.D, J.S.D., or a D.Phil degree. It is far more common for law professors – and lawyers – in foreign countries to hold advanced degrees.
The one benefit of pursuing a LL.M or J.S.D., which are the advanced degree options typically offered at law schools, is that you will have the opportunity to be in the academic environment and publish at least one article in a legal publication.

, All law professors are licensed to practice law in at least one state, even if they no longer actively practice law. Your law school will have information about the bar examination that you wish to take, including registration forms. The applications tend to very lengthy and require you to obtain a great deal of background information about your life.


If you wish to practice law in another state, you can contact that state’s bar association for information. You can find a list of state bar associations by clicking here.
Because bar admission applications are a huge undertaking, give yourself adequate time to gather all of the information that you need.
You are likely to have to supply a list of your addresses from the past ten years, documentation of any legal proceedings in which you have been involved, including traffic tickets and divorces, and a comprehensive list of every job at which you have worked since turning the age of 18.

, All states require you to undergo a character and fitness written examination that tests your knowledge of legal and professional ethics. This is often referred to as a professional responsibility exam. In some states, you also may have to be personally interviewed by a representative of the state board of bar examiners.

, Unfortunately, attending law school does not tend to prepare you very well for taking the bar exam. It is recommended that you take a commercial bar preparation course, usually during the summer following your graduation from law school. This course will prepare you for the subjects about which you must answer questions on the bar exam.

, You cannot become a practicing attorney unless you pass the bar exam. It is a lengthy test lasting two or more days in most states. Passing rates vary widely from state to state, with the California bar exam being notorious for its high failure rate.

, A curriculum vitae, also known as a CV, outlines your educational and academic background, research, publications, honors, memberships and affiliations. Curricula vitae differ from resumes in that they are usually more than two pages in length and provide the reader an in-depth overview of the individual’s experience.

, It is not common for new law school graduates to immediately become law professors. Rather, lawyers often become law professors only after they have worked at large, prestigious, national law firms, clerked for judges at high-profile federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, or worked in high-level government jobs. Obtain one of these types of jobs and you will increase your chances of being selected for a law professor position.

, It is becoming more common for potential law professors to have published an article in a legal journal following graduation from law school. This publication should occur in an academic legal journal, as opposed to a more mainstream publication aimed at practicing lawyers.

, There are different types of law professors. Some are full-time employees at a law school with full benefits. These are tenure-track positions, similar to professors in other academic disciplines. They are required to publish legal articles in scholarly journals on a regular basis, in addition to teaching law school courses.


Another type of law professor is an adjunct professor. Adjuncts are practicing attorneys who teach a class or two per semester. An adjunct professor is likely to be a practicing attorney who has expertise in a particular area of the law.
All law schools employ legal research and writing professors. These professors handle all of the first-year legal research and writing classes, which are required to complete law school. The emphasis for these professors tends to be student contact and feedback, rather than publishing and scholarship.
There are also clinical law professors, who operate legal clinics in different areas of the law. These clinics are run by law students each semester, who handle actual cases under the supervision of their law professor. More often than not, these are experienced attorneys who have spent many years practicing law in a particular area.

, To aid in your job search, take advantage of resources offered online or your law school’s career services offices, focusing on legal employment opportunities. For example, it is now possible for you to create and save a query identifying the geographic location in which you are seeking employment and the types of positions in which you are interested in pursuing. When a posted vacancy meets those requirements, you receive an email notification.

, The AALS facilitates the hiring of most individuals as law professors each year. 179 law schools are members of AALS.This non-profit organization maintains the Faculty Appointment Register (FAR), an online recruiting system for individuals seeking law professor positions and recruiters from law schools seeking candidates. You can register for the FAR by clicking here, and for a fee, you can upload your biographical information for recruiters to view. By registering with FAR, you will receive a one-year subscription to the Placement Bulletin, which is published quarterly by AALS.
You also can attend the annual AALS Faculty Recruitment Conference, a three-day event at which candidates can interview for open law professor positions.

, Complete and submit required documentation for each position. You should ensure that you adhere to all guidelines. Be sure to read the vacancy announcement carefully and check off each item you obtain it. It is also important to keep documents organized, preferably in the order listed in the job announcement, so the reviewer can easily review your application packet.

, Many law schools now offer a VAP program, which is a one or two-year fellowship that allows aspiring law professors to spend time researching, publishing, and teaching before searching for a regular, full-time, tenure-track, law professor position., There are many undergraduate courses that relate to law in one way or another. As a result, there are ample opportunities for someone who wants to teach law-related courses to do so on a college campus.

, While it's a parent's responsibility to make sure they are following the law, you don't want to perform academic services forbidden by the state. Some states require that parents perform a certain amount of hours themselves, so hiring a tutor may have regulations.

Do some research, talk with a mentor, and observe the activities of the group to become a pro. As a leader, you want to be the person with the answers. Being an expert will make you feel confident, and you will appear experienced and capable., Leaders come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few common traits that experts believe make the best leader. For some people, transitioning into a leadership role is very natural because they already exhibit many of these leadership qualities. But for others, these qualities need to be learned and practiced. That’s OK! Take a look at these qualities shared by the most successful and most admired leaders, and identify qualities you need to work on:A strong desire to take action and try new things
The ability to express themselves effectively
Good at motivating others
Exhibit good judgment, with the ability to think fast and retain composure under pressure
Genuine interest in the opinions and ideas of others
Imaginative, often coming up with creative ideas or solutions

, Depending on the specific group, you may not be able to join in right away or you may have to start at the bottom and work your way up. That’s okay! You are gaining lots of knowledge about the inner workings of the group and the people involved. Working your way up will also help you become an expert because you will have first-hand experience in more aspects of the group. Join in and look at how the current group leader runs things. Take note of what you think works and what you would improve upon if you were the leader., Maybe you want to be student council president but currently are just on the board, or perhaps you want to write for the newspaper but are just on the staff. Whatever the case, leaders don’t wait for things to happen, they make them happen. Come up with some ideas for the group and figure out how you can make them happen.If you are on the newspaper staff but aren’t yet a writer, pitch story ideas to the editor or volunteer to go to the football rally to interview players post-game.
If you’re assigned to a project at work, schedule a meeting with the other group members to outline the project and discuss goals. Being proactive in this way will put you in a leadership position within the group right off the bat.
If you’re involved with a club, organize special events to raise awareness of important issues or celebrations associated with the group (e.g., throw a toga party fundraiser for the Latin Club, create a display at the school entrance for Black History Month, organize a pastry bake sale for the French Club, etc.).

, As you take on more responsibilities and get more involved with the group, remember that confidence is extremely important. Confidence is a quality that people associate with intelligence, capability, and acumen. Even if you don’t feel 100% confident yet, it is important to act like you do. Be purposeful with your words and in your movements. Try using these power positions, which help send subconscious signals that make others agree with you:Dress like a leader by always appearing professional and put together.
Watch your body language. Stand up straight and avoid looking bored, tired, or uninterested.
Make direct eye contact when you’re talking with someone.
Nod your head when you are listening.

, One of the most important aspects of being a leader and gaining momentum within a group is to include other people in your ideas. Leaders lead, they don’t just boss people around. Be sure to ask other group members if they like the idea and encourage them to contribute to the idea or its design. By sharing your vision and getting other people to adopt it as their own, the group will work together to bring your idea to fruition with you as the lead., Whether you are already the leader of the group or you are still working towards this goal, it is important to always act in a way that reflects the positive, confident, and praiseworthy qualities of a leader. Acting like a leader will not only show the group you take the role seriously, it will also dictate the standard you want group members to uphold.Always keep your promises.
Try to always be positive, outgoing, optimistic, and respectful.
Show the group you are willing to do the same things you ask them to do.
Be trustworthy and have integrity; don’t be fake or talk about people behind their backs.
Be fair and encouraging to all group members, and don’t play favorites.

, As a leader, it is your responsibility to have a big picture of your plan and anticipate challenges before they arise. Instead of just waiting for problems to happen and then solving them, try to take steps and come up with ways to prevent them from happening at all. Not everything is preventable, but you can at least come up with possible solutions preemptively. A manager is responsible for responding to various situations, but a leader is someone to who sees all of these possibilities and takes effective action to prevent them before they even occur., It is important to delegate tasks to group members that have proven themselves responsible and skilled enough to complete the task on their own. Delegating tasks will encourage individual participation and cooperation in achieving your group’s goals. It will also give you more time as a leader to plan out the next steps for the group.Assign tasks that are reasonable; impossible tasks kill morale and discourage participation.
Give clear instructions for what to do, but let the person decide how to do it.
Quickly recognize accomplishments for delegated tasks to boost group morale and individual self-esteem.
Don’t overload one person with responsibilities; it may overwhelm them or appear to be favoritism to other members of the group.

, As you start to delegate responsibilities and encourage feedback from the group, it becomes more difficult to stand out as the leader. You want to be approachable without losing all influence, and you want to hand over some of the responsibilities without losing control; it’s very tricky. The key to maintaining your authority is to be firm in your convictions and your stance.Getting a group consensus is important, but don’t be afraid to override decisions sometimes if you truly feel it’s the best thing to do. Use good judgment and remember that you set the rules and boundaries. Just avoid being unkind or acting like a dictator!

, As a leader it is important to be resourceful and to make contacts along the way for your group and for yourself. This can help you raise funds for your group, recruit new group members, and diversify your interests by trying new things. This will help keep the group fun, fresh, and exciting!Try partnering with like-minded groups for special events (e.g., get the boys swim team to join the girls swim team for a carb-loading team dinner the night before a meet).
Attend political fund-raisers, rallies and social events to see how more established groups represent themselves.
Volunteer at an event in another community to help spread the word about the group to a different audience.

, As you grow as a leader, it is important to continue developing your skills, widening your interests, and bettering yourself. In order for your group to get better, everyone within the group has to grow, including the leader. Continue to earn respect from those around you, and learn everything you can about your group’s area of interest so you can keep being the person people turn to for advice!"

If you're new to supervising others, recognize that you will probably make some mistakes along the way, but that does not mean you are not a good leader. Cut yourself a little slack, but then commit yourself to doing the best you can.Keep in mind that you were hired to be a supervisor because your boss believes that you are capable of doing the job! Now you just have to prove your boss right.
Don't let yourself believe that bosses never make mistakes. Nobody expects you to be perfect except yourself.;
, It's important to give your employees a good example of model behavior. Just because you are in charge does not mean you no longer have to abide by the rules. If you are hard-working, committed, and ethical, your employees are more likely to be that way too.Remember not to let your new-found power go to your head. It's important to respect your employees if you want them to respect you in return.
Your attitude is just as important as your actions. Always be friendly and professional., It's important that your employees know what to expect out of you. Be sure to always lay out the rules and expectations to new employees and to enforce these policies consistently. If there are changes to the policy, make sure the employees understand them.Try to keep your emotions under control as much as possible.
Always treat employees fairly, and don't favor one over another.

, Good supervisors can't be completely stuck in their ways. They need to be willing to recognize when a specific approach isn't working and make changes accordingly, even if it involves admitting that they were wrong.You also need to be able to adapt your management style to the needs of different employees. Some employees may flourish under hands-on management, while others may benefit from more freedom. It is your responsibility to recognize these needs and react accordingly.
This does not mean that you should have different standards for different employees in the same role. While you may want to customize your approach to each employee's working style, you still must be consistent in your expectations and disciplinary measures.

, As the supervisor, you are responsible for your whole team. If you miss a deadline or lose a client, don't point fingers and blame others for the mistake. Instead, evaluate the role you played, admit your own mistakes, and come up with a plan to avoid making the same mistakes in the future., Communication is vital to good leadership. You need to communicate your expectations clearly, whether you're explaining a single project or reminding the entire team about the company's policies.Make sure you take the time to get to know all of your employees, and let them know that you are available to talk to them whenever necessary.Communication involves listening as well as talking, so be open to listening to whatever input your employees have for you. When you give workers your undivided attention, they feel respected and are more willing to listen to your guidance. Strictly giving orders without listening can erode worker commitment and enthusiasm.
Avoid lecturing workers or sending directives by way of wordy emails. Think about the most important messages you want to convey and communicate them face-to-face or over the phone. Put thought into your email communications to ensure that they are clear, concise, and respectful.
Regular meetings with employees will give you the opportunity to ask them about the projects they are working on, hear worker grievances and triumphs, discuss team successes, and brainstorm solutions to new problems.
Always be responsive by answering your employees' emails and returning their calls promptly.Multitasking is very convenient in today's busy world, but sometimes it just doesn't work. Let your employees know that you value their time by putting all distractions aside when you meet with them., You can't expect perfection out of your team, so be careful about over-criticizing or setting goals that are beyond reach. This will only discourage your employees.You can still expect excellence out of your employees, as long as that excellence is actually attainable.Take the time to talk to your employees about your expectations and get their feedback. If you encourage an honest discussion, your employees are more likely to let you know if your expectations seem unreasonable.
You should have a good understanding of the work volume that already exists and the amount of time it will take your employees to finish a specific project before setting a deadline. If you don't have the right information, you risk over-committing your team.

, As a supervisor, it's impossible for you to do everything yourself, so you need to be able to trust your employees to take care of things without you. You may have to give up a little control, but you will have more time to focus on your own responsibilities and you will be giving your employees the opportunity to flourish.Remember that you are still ultimately responsible for your employees' work, even if you delegate specific tasks to others. If you don't completely trust your employees to do the work on their own, establish some kind of review process until you think they can handle it.

, When an employee does a good job, it's important to acknowledge it! Give all of your employees credit for a job well done and let them know that their hard work is appreciated.Some supervisors feel threatened by successful employees, but this will only hinder your ability to be an effective supervisor. You should be proud of your high-performing employees, not jealous., One of your responsibilities as a supervisor is to unlock the potential of all of your employees. You can do this by offering constructive criticism and by looking for ways to allow them to take on new responsibilities or new roles within the organization.Pay attention to the unique talents and skills of each worker and utilize those strengths for the benefit of the project or company. For example, a worker may be excellent on the phones but a slow typist. Find opportunities for her to apply her phone skills to building company connections, selling products, or serving customers.
Whenever possible, offer training to employees to help them learn new skills. A slow typist, for example, can be encouraged to take a typing class or be assigned additional typing tasks to improve her skills.
Avoid drawing attention to weaknesses unnecessarily. Excessive focus on employee weaknesses can result in discouragement and low employee morale.
Use employee reviews as an opportunity to both praise your employees for their strengths and to offer constructive criticism on what they can do better. Part of being an effective manager is assisting employees to transform their weaknesses into competencies. The first step is creating awareness of an area that needs improvement.
Don't wait for your employee's next yearly review if you can offer some constructive criticism today!

, Supervisors have to deal with a lot of uncomfortable situations, from disputes between employees to layoffs. While it may be tempting to avoid dealing with these situations as much as possible, it's best to tackle them head-on instead.Your employees will not respect you if they see you as someone who runs away in the face of conflict.
When having a difficult conversation with an employee, always focus on objective observations and avoid making accusations., Procrastination is bad when employees do it, but it's even worse when supervisors do it. As a leader, you need to make a plan for tackling a project as soon as possible., Instead of wasting your time complaining about the problems your organization or your department is facing, use that time to come up with a game plan.Keep in mind that long-term solutions are always better than short-term solutions, even if they are harder to implement.Being an effective problem solver means staying focused on the facts of the situation and thinking of creative solutions. Avoid focusing on emotions and blame. Think of the necessary steps for helping employees to regain composure and resume the task at hand.

, Good leaders should always be looking for new ways to challenge themselves and their teams.This doesn't mean overwhelming your team or taking on more than you can handle, but it does mean stepping outside of your comfort zone every once in a while. Encourage employees to do the same by offering them the opportunity to work on projects that are unfamiliar to them.

, It's important that a leader have a good understanding of the department's goals and objectives, so take some time periodically to go over the projects your team is working on. Create specific deadlines or targets for your employees to help keep them on track and motivated.Be sure to listen to your team if they tell you the goals are not attainable. There's no reason a goal can't be modified.
The better your sense is of how much your team has to accomplish in a certain amount of time, the better you will understand how much additional work they are actually able to take on.

, The supervisor needs to be able to step in and help the team problem solve whenever necessary. Make sure your team knows that if they are ever having a problem with a project, you are available to help them figure it out.The importance of feedback cannot be overstated. Make sure you let your employees know how they are doing, whether good or bad.

, Create systems to save employees time on a task and/or to eliminate errors. Create documents that outline employee responsibilities and who is responsible for which tasks.


Automate menial tasks whenever possible, encouraging employees to focus more on productive and engaging projects.

, Not everything will go according to plan, and as a supervisor, you need to be okay with that. Try not to take failures too personally. Instead, learn from them and apply that knowledge to your next project so you can avoid the same mistakes.


Keep in mind that negative energy will trickle down to your entire team, so be sure to set the right tone.

Because the job outlook for English teachers isn't great, and the pay is mediocre, a teacher needs to be someone who has authority and cares about making an impact in students' lives.


The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the job growth between 2012-2022 for high school teachers is six percent. Teachers who focus on math and science subjects have a higher chance of gaining a job, so with English, understand that it may take a little bit of time before you are able to earn a full time position.As a teacher your job often doesn't remain in the classroom. You will likely have papers to grade after school, parent-teacher conferences to attend, and other extracurricular activities. However, with a good mindset you can have a lot of fun doing these things, especially if you make some teacher friends along the way.;
, Some teachers have luck and have a class of students who are all really passionate and engaged in the class material, but the truth is that in many schools, a lot of the students don't want to be there or don't care about reading literature. As a teacher, your job is to make them excited and passionate to learn -- to teach so well and be so passionate yourself that the students can't help but be engaged in the lesson.


Think of it as striving to be like the teacher in ""Dead Poets Society"" or ""Stand and Deliver."" These teachers were able to ignite passion and motivation in their students in the specific subject areas they were teaching.

, Most states require that a teacher receive their bachelor's degree before they begin to teach at a high school. In order to teach high school, the bachelor's degree you obtain should be in English, and it can be helpful to focus on a track like literature.To teach English for elementary or middle schoolers, people often pursue bachelor's degrees in education, but because you will be covering different topics as a high school instructor, it's best to pursue a degree in a specific subject, as you'll have better foundation in the subject matter. You can then go on to learn about the education side through your teaching certification or through other courses during your bachelor's program.Many schools with English degrees give you options for different tracks to pursue like creative writing, rhetoric, and literature. Because you will most likely be focusing on the literature aspect with your students, its helpful to pursue that track in college.
Some of the top ranked schools to obtain your bachelor's degree from are:

Stanford efsu
Harvard
University of Pennsylvania
Duke University
University of Notre Dame
Georgetown University
Vanderbilt University
University of Florida



, After you have completed your bachelor's, you'll need to gain your teaching certification before you can actually begin teaching. You can find these education programs at many universities and they usually take 12 to 24 months to complete. Some bachelor's programs allow you to take courses towards your certification as well, so often times you can graduate and jump straight into student teaching.All public schools require certification, but if you are looking to work in a private school there may be different requirements., After you have attended a teacher education program, most states require you to take a standardized Praxis test, which will test you on your basic skills or on a specific subject area. Some states require you to take the Praxis I before you begin your teacher education program and others require both that test and the Praxis II.Make sure you review your state's licensure requirements, because all of the states vary in what they require to become a licensed teacher. Keep in mind too that just because you have a license to teach in Texas doesn't mean you will be able to teach in New York.

, This certification is not necessary to teach, but it can help the job mobility of a teacher as well as providing extra benefits. Depending on the school you work at, if you are National Board Certified you may receive a higher salary, gain compensation for continuing your education, and have greater opportunities for advancement., Most states require that teachers gain teaching experience under the supervision of a licensed teacher for a semester before they begin teaching on their own. Usually student teaching is part of your teacher education program, and your program should help locate a school for you where you can gain experience teaching.Student teaching is unpaid, but you have the opportunity to practice teaching real classes, with a teacher over you that can help guide you through the process. You will usually student teach in the same setting you hope to teach in later -- if you are looking to become a high school English teacher you will likely student teach in a high school English class. Often times you can pick the specific grade level and type of school too, just so you are better able to discern if this is the type of school and grade level you want to teach.

, A master's degree isn't usually required to teach in a high school (although some schools do require it), but it can help you have an advantage when applying for jobs. A master's degree also allows you to teach at a junior college. Some teachers go on to pursue their master's so that they can teach dual credit courses at their high school, which also increases their salary.Many teachers will get a master's degree in education, and may focus on a specific track like curriculum development, depending on their career ambitions for the future. Some teachers will earn a master's in their specific subject area like English or a degree in educational leadership so that they can eventually go on to become principal or district supervisors.It's best to think about your career ambitions before you pursue a master's so that you know what master's program would be most beneficial to you. Then, search for the top schools with those programs. Some high schools offer to pay for part of the teacher's master's program, so check with your school as well to see what they can offer you.

, Before you begin applying for jobs, you'll want to read up on what a high school teacher primarily focuses on, so that when you go into job interviews you look prepared and educated. The basic tasks for a high school English teacher are to help students develop their critical thinking skills, hone in their writing abilities, and discover literature., This can be key to a positive teaching experience. Some teachers have a passion for teaching in low income schools with at-risk students, while others would prefer to teach advanced placement classes. Do some research in your area to figure out what types of students you'd like to teach before you begin applying to schools.


Hopefully when you student taught you were able to gain an idea of the type of school you wanted to teach in. If you think you lean towards a certain type of school, then try your best to attain a student teaching position in that school so you can have some experience teaching those students before you jump in as a full-time teacher.

, Because teaching is a competitive field, your resume needs to stand out and show that you are passionate about teaching and are qualified for the position. There are a number of ways to make your resume stand out:Show a passion for teaching. You can demonstrate this in your objective section of the resume, or in your career summary section. Use this section to communicate your teaching philosophy, your belief about education, and your desire to help students. Make sure you are communicating that you are teaching for the right reasons. Employers want to know that you care about the students at their school.
Credentials: Your credentials should be the first thing employers see. You should list your degrees and any certifications you have at the top of your resume along with your GPA. Because this will be the first thing employers see, you want to present yourself well and show that you are accomplished and educated.
Use key words: Employers may be looking for certain words throughout your resume that are industry specific. Because employers usually get a lot of resumes, they will be scanning many of them and these key words will help your resume grab their attention. Some key words to use in the education field are: teaching and learning, curriculum planning, peer tutoring, peer mentoring, teacher-parent relations, special needs students, ESL/ESOL students, technology integration, classroom management, student involvement, interdisciplinary teaching approaches, K-12, etc.
Accomplishments and related jobs: This is really what will make you stand out from other resumes, because everyone will likely be applying with a similar bachelor's degree, but not everyone will have job related experience. Think about the accomplishments you have made throughout college that are related to teaching, leading, working with students, etc. and find a way to incorporate those into your resume through the related experience section or in your activities section. Think about the qualities that would make someone a good teacher, or the experience that could help them in teaching. Then, think about what things you have done that you can include in your resume to make you well equipped to become a teacher.
Look up sample resumes. If you are still stumped as to how to boost your resume, there are always tons of resources on line that give example resumes in specific subject matters. You can use these as references or a guideline for how to boost your resume.

, Often times you can visit a school's website on their jobs' or careers' page to see the positions they have available. Many universities also have career fairs in education in which you'll have the opportunity to talk to many of the schools from that state.


If you find a job and are invited in for an interview, make sure you are prepared by learning about that school district and about the specific position. It could also be good to come up with a statement about why you decided to be a teacher and what you hope to provide to the school and students.

, Because some teaching jobs aren't exactly in high demand, obtaining a position may take some time and patience. Many schools in big cities that are in low income areas, are often in higher need for teachers than schools in the suburbs or ones that have a student population that is predominantly middle class.


As an English teacher keep in mind that you are probably going to be looking for a longer time than someone who is planning on teaching math or science. This is because, for some reason, there is a shortage on teachers in those subject areas. English, on the other hand, is a popular degree for students to study in college to become an English teacher, and so you are competing with more people for those jobs. English also tends to be a favorite among students when it comes to their classes, and so those students are more likely to pursue a degree in English to become an English teacher., While you may not be able to gain a teaching position right out of college, a great way to get your foot in the door in the schools you would like to teach in is by subbing. Subbing is a great way to meet the administrators and students at the school as well as getting some part-time teaching experience before you obtain a full-time position.


Some states and cities require that substitute teachers have a teaching certificate, so you may already have an advantage over others.
Take as many substitute teacher positions as possible so you can get a lot of exposure to the schools you are subbing in.

, Teach for America is an alternative to directly applying for a position in a school. TFA is an organization that places students passionate about learning in a low income school district and gives them the opportunity to teach for a year. To apply for this program you won't need a teaching certification, but you will need a bachelor's degree.You will apply to the program through the TFA website, and will be taken through a several part interview process. At the final stage of the interview you will prepare a fake lesson to give in front of some of the staff for Teach for America. You will also have the opportunity to choose the top cities you would like to teach in as well as your preferred subjects and grades you would like to teach. If hired, you will then be placed in one of those cities to begin teaching.
While TFA is a great way to gain teaching experience, it is not for everyone because often times you won't receive much training beforehand, and for someone who didn't go through the teacher education program, you might be a little lost. Depending on the school district, you may receive adequate help from other faculty, or you may have to navigate most things yourself.

, The Peace Corps gives you the opportunity to teach in another country, usually in areas that you will be very immersed in the culture. This organization allows you to enter as a ""Volunteer,"" which means you aren't making a salary, but you will be given a housing and living stipend as well as paid transportation. Peace Corps openings can be found on their website, in a number of different fields, and a minimum of a bachelor's degree with some teaching or tutoring experience is usually required.With the Peace Corps you will be placed with a host family or in a dwelling determined by the local host organization. You will be asked to adhere to cultural norms, as the Peace Corps is also an opportunity for your to learn about different cultures and respect the differences between your country and the one you visit.
The benefit of the Peace Corps is it gives you teaching experience, but also offers entry into unique graduate school opportunities as well as the option to forgive or defer certain public loans., This includes getting a master's or Phd in your desired field. You can also participate in workshops and training sessions that may equip you to serve in different roles or help advance your teaching experience and skills. Some states require you to participate in professional development to renew or maintain your license. Visit or contact your state's agency to learn about the education requirements for your state."

Strive for consistency.,
Value transparency.,
Follow through on your promises.,
Get things done.,
Give credit to others.,
Avoid gossip.",How to Be an Effective Manager1," People will feel more comfortable once they see you as a known quantity. If you are unpredictable, they will keep information from you out of fear.Instead, be predictable. Be steady.


Employees also won’t trust you if you show favoritism. If you punish someone for breaking a rule, you need to punish others who break the same rule.;
, Employees won’t trust you if they think you have a hidden agenda. Accordingly, you need to be open with them. Share information as soon as you can. Always be truthful.


Never lie. Team members talk, and if you say one thing to Janet but another thing to John, they’ll find out you are a liar.
You should also avoid withholding information. For example, if the company is performing poorly, then you should be upfront with your team. There’s no reason to sugarcoat information.
You can’t share everything. For example, if you fire someone, you shouldn’t tell the team why. However, transparency should be your default option., If you say you will do something, do it. If you ask for people’s opinions, then listen actively to what they say. You’ll lose your team’s trust if you say one thing but do another.The key to following through is not overpromising. For example, if you can’t get a team member promoted, don’t promise that you will.
You might want to make few promises initially, at least until you become comfortable in the role.

, Your team will trust your leadership once they see that you are someone who gets results.The longer your track record of success, the better.


Occasionally, you may need to get your hands dirty and help out when the team is overwhelmed. Show that you are as committed to the team’s success as they are.

, Don’t claim something was your idea if you relied, even in part, on someone else’s ideas. Instead, credit the person who contributed and acknowledge how you built on their idea.For example, you can say, “I met with the company president and shared with him Janet’s ideas on a new marketing campaign.” Say this even if Janet’s contribution was small. People will trust you when they see you aren’t trying to steal their credit.

, Any group of three people gossips—two people will talk about the third. However, you should strive to avoid the gossip vine.If you get pulled into your team’s gossip, you won’t look like a leader.


Nevertheless, you should be aware of gossip. Let your secretary or assistant keep you appraised of what is happening.
In particular, pay attention if team members are working to sabotage you.

Listen.,
Encourage others to participate.,
Be clear.,
Use email carefully.,
Minimize your use of meetings.,
Provide effective feedback.,
Communicate across all levels of the organization.,
Dress the part.,
Don’t obsess about being “nice.” The sign of a novice manager is a fear that your team won’t like you.,
Overcome shyness.",How to Be an Effective Manager2," Listening is as important as what you say. If you are in a team meeting, you should probably listen to your employees before speaking yourself.To become a skilled listener, get rid of any distractions. Put away your phone or tablet, and don’t glance back over your shoulder to your computer screen. Instead, focus on the person who is talking.As you listen, focus on body language, which contains important cues. Someone who claims to be happy while sitting with their arms crossed is saying one thing but signaling another.
Also tend to your own body language as you listen. Practice sitting still and listening to people share bad news. It’s important not to snap back in response.

, You never know where you best ideas will come from, so you should encourage team members to voice their opinions. Give people many outlets for sharing their ideas. Not everyone likes to talk in meetings, so welcome people to share ideas via email or in individual meetings with you.


Remember not to make fun of someone for their ideas, even if those ideas are unoriginal or poorly thought out.If you knock someone for voicing an opinion, you are sending a message that people should keep their ideas to themselves.
Also ensure everyone can participate. This may mean reining in any team member who is overly negative or is trying to dominate the conversation.Say something like, “Gregg, thanks for sharing your thoughts. I definitely hear you. Now, I’d like to hear from Sonia and Marie.”

, Effective communication is clear and thorough.Strive to be as clear as possible to minimize misunderstandings. Think before you reach out to someone else and make sure you know what you want to say.


Balance thoroughness with brevity. You don’t need to take up everyone’s time with endless emails or team memos. Get to the point.

, Email is incredibly convenient. You can pop off a written note to a team member at any time of the day and retain a copy of your communication. However, it’s difficult to read someone’s tone in an email. For example, you might send an email intended as a joke which the recipient perceives is hostile.


No modern business can survive without email. However, use it strategically.
For example, you should avoid email if you are having a difficult relationship with one team member. Instead, communicate face to face so that they can read your non-verbal cues.

, Meetings often take longer than necessary. If possible, communicate in other ways. If you do hold a meeting, draft a schedule and distribute it ahead of time. Stick to it as much as possible.Sometimes, you need to have meetings, and an effective manager can identify those times. Don’t hold a meeting when you can send a memo instead.
However, hold meetings to brainstorm, or when you want to hear your employees’ perspective.

, As a manager, you are also a coach. You need to provide guidance to your team members so that they can perform at their best level. Tailor your feedback to each team member’s communication styles and motivation.


Ideally, however, you will balance negative feedback with praise.Also follow up negative feedback with concrete advice. Don’t say, “Maybe focus harder.” Instead, show an employee how they can manage their workflow, or put them in touch with someone who can help them.
Remember your company’s employee assistance program (EAP). You aren’t a therapist tasked with helping an employee sort out their personal life. However, you can encourage them to contact the EAP and schedule a counseling session.

, In your early days as a manager, make it your goal to get out and meet everyone in the organization who directly or indirectly affects your team.Walk around the building and introduce yourself to people. Ask questions about their department.


Communicating broadly helps in two ways. First, you’ll get to know who you should contact whenever you need help. For example, you might find out that an assistant wields all of the power in Human Resources. They can be your go-to person.
Second, you’ll build rapport with people, who might go the extra mile to help you when you need it.

, Communication is also non-verbal. Maintain your credibility in the eyes of your team, which means looking like the manager on your team. Aim to dress slightly more professional than your team members.If your employees dress casual, you should dress business casual.
If your employees dress business casual, then wear a suit to work.

, In fact, they should respect you, not be your best friend. If you’re too nice, employees may slack off, knowing they have nothing to fear.You don’t gain much by being “hard as nails,” either. Instead, aim to show empathy. Remember that “kindness,” not “niceness,” is what is important.

, Shy people can certainly be effective managers. However, you need to work deliberately to counteract your shyness. Consider the following tips:Get to know team members in a way that feels comfortable. For example, you might want to schedule one-on-one meetings in your office at first. Write a short agenda that will give you something to refer to if you feel tongue-tied.
Prepare properly. Employees tend to question business decisions, so arm yourself with facts ahead of time to explain the decision you’ve made. This will help you speak authoritatively.
Lean on mentors to help you. Find someone higher up to coach you on difficult tasks, such as disciplining employees.
Be yourself. You’re shy—and that’s okay. You don’t need to pretend to be a standup comic. Instead, be yourself. If you’re consistent, your team will come around to appreciate your management style.

"
"
Lead by example.,
Create individual and team goals.,
Reward hard work.,
Tailor your management style to each employee.,
Inspire employees.,
Deal with underperforming employees.",How to Be an Effective Manager3," You can’t realistically expect your team members to outperform you. Accordingly, you need to be a conscientious employee yourself. To get the best results, model hard work and the right way to interact with people.Also acknowledge your mistakes. You’ll earn respect from your employees and create a culture in which others aren’t afraid to approach you when they mess up., Both are important. If you create only individual goals, then you’ll damage team cohesion. If you set only team goals, then individual team members won’t know where they fit into the larger picture.


Goals for individual team members should be challenging but still something the employee can achieve. Also make sure the goals are measurable.Something like “bring in more clients” isn’t a good goal. Instead, provide a bench mark: “Increase number of new clients by 50% in a year.”
Remember to involve your team on setting the team’s goals.Of course, you can’t let the team set the goals all alone, but make sure you tell them how you have incorporated their ideas.

, If you want to get outstanding effort, you need to reward it. Your reward can be small—a gift card to a nearby coffee shop—or it can be more substantial, such as a bonus. Whatever you give is beside the point: the key is to recognize the effort.Sometimes the only reward necessary is public recognition. Tell the other employees about the great job Sue and Steve did on a client presentation.
Remember to be consistent when giving rewards. If you reward one team member for bringing in a client, you can’t overlook another team member who does the same.

, No two members of your team are alike. Accordingly, you shouldn’t use the same management style with each employee. Instead, find out what makes each team member tick.For example, some team members might be overconfident and need to be challenged regularly.
By contrast, other members might lack confidence and do their best work when they receive praise.

, Strive to make even the lowliest member feel that their job is crucial to the team’s success.Most people yearn to be part of something larger than themselves, and they find meaning in helping the group accomplish its goals.


Don’t just tell employees you value them (though that is important). Also explain to them why their job is crucial to the team’s success.

, Avoid spending a lot of time trying to improve a weak employee. Generally, you’ll never be able to make them better than they currently are.Instead, tell them what they need to do to keep their job and give them a deadline for meeting your expectations.


If you need to fire someone, remember to follow your organization’s policies to the letter. There’s logic behind all that paperwork you have to fill out. You’ll sleep better at night knowing you fired someone in the right way.
Also pay attention to how the termination affects those team members left behind. Talk about the firing. Even though you can’t explain in detail why you let someone go, you can put your team at ease that you aren’t downsizing for economic reasons.

Start teaching classes in the fall.",How to Become a Gender Studies Professor," Before you take your first steps down the long road to a professorial job in gender studies, you should spend some time getting yourself well acquainted with what the gender studies discipline is about. Read work by prominent scholars in the field to learn more about it.


Gender studies explores gender as a concept rooted in our culture and society. It raises questions about gender, how they got the way they are, and how they impact us as individuals and a society.Spending some time immersing yourself in this field of study will give you a better sense of whether this field is really for you. It will also help make you more knowledgeable about research in this discipline, which will be very helpful when filling out applications for graduate programs.
This is especially important if your undergraduate degree was not in a field related to gender studies. If you do not yet have an undergraduate degree, getting one in this area will set you on the right path.;
, Like any other field of academic study, becoming a professor of gender studies requires an advanced degree. Most major universities will require you to have a PhD, though some smaller schools may allow you to teach with a master's. Look into different schools that offer a PhD in related field.


Note that some schools will hire professors with other, related degrees, and some will not. You may also be able to secure a position as a gender studies professor with a degree in sociology, political science, history, or English literature, if your studies focus on gender issues.There are thought to be about 20 schools that offer a PhD in gender studies.When researching schools, look at who the faculty that teach there are. Your first priority should be selecting a program where you will have the opportunity to work with prominent gender studies scholars who's work you find interesting. This will help you secure a job after graduation.Look into other resources provided by the school. Do they offer fellowships, grants, or assistantships that can help you pay your way?
If possible, visit schools that you are seriously considering applying to to meet the students and faculty.

, Once you have researched gender studies programs around the country (or even the world), choose some to apply to. As a rule of thumb, you should probably apply to about five programs.Choose one dream school, the one you would most like to attend but is very difficult to get in to. Choose two schools that look good, and you think you have a decent chance of being accepted at. Choose two ""safety"" schools that might not be your favorites, but you you are fairly sure you can get in to.
Your application materials will typically include a cover letter and/or personal statement, academic records from your undergraduate degree, and a writing sample. Spend some time crafting these materials, and read up online or in a guidebook about how to write an effective application.Your academic performance and participation in school-related activities as an undergraduate can play an important role in whether you will be accepted, especially if your bachelor's degree was in a related field.

, Hopefully you will receive one or more offers to join a graduate program in gender studies. Consider your offers and decide which one is best for you.


Typically your offer will include not only your acceptance to the program, but also any funding package the school is willing to offer you at the time. In this case, you'll typically need to respond by April 15.Keep in mind that the best offer may be somewhere far from where you currently live. You will probably have to consider moving, perhaps far across the country, to pursue a degree.

, As with any other graduate program, the first part of your gender studies program will involve taking courses in (or related to) the field. You will typically have an advisor who can help you choose the best courses for you based on where you are at in the program and what topics interest you most.


Your coursework is an opportunity to both learn more about the field and develop relationships with the faculty.
When it comes time to choose your advisor, choose carefully. You will work with this person closely throughout your graduate school experience, so it's important that you work together well., As you complete your coursework, you will begin to develop the skills for producing your own gender studies research. Take courses in research methods, and try to start developing your own studies as soon as possible.


Your term papers in your courses can often become the start of a submission to an academic conference or journal. Conference presentations and publications are important for securing a job in the field after you graduate., Hopefully, your gender studies program will give you an opportunity to start developing your teaching skills, either as a teaching assistant or as an instructor of a stand-alone course, or through pedagogy courses designed to teach you how to teach.


Teaching experience is important for securing a job in the field. Like research, it will be a major part of what you do once you become a professor.
Many programs will have optional seminars or presentations you can attend to develop your teachings skills and style. Take advantage of these opportunities whenever possible.
Many college professors do not have a solid background in teaching.Because gender studies classes are often particularly oriented toward discussion and conversation, developing good classroom skills is imperative for your future success.

, Most graduate programs require you to pass comprehensive examinations after you have completed your coursework. These exams involve months of study in advance, followed by an intensive period of writing.


This process usually involves developing a long list readings, in conjunction with a committee of professors, which will be divided up into several topic areas.At the end of the reading period, you'll have a few hours or days to produce essays on questions related to those topics. Depending on the program you attend, you might or might not know in advance what the questions will be.

, A gender studies program will require you to write either a thesis or dissertation, or in some cases, both--a master's thesis, and then later a doctoral dissertation. This is essentially a long paper based on an original research project.


The process of writing a thesis or dissertation is a collaborative one--you'll work with committee of professors to develop your research and writing.
Writing a dissertation can take months or even years.
Your dissertation will typically be the most important way that schools will evaluate you and your academic identity when you are applying for jobs. Start thinking about this, and having conversations with your advisor about your ideas, as early in the program as you can., The last hurdle in most programs will be an oral defense of your dissertation. The process varies from one school to the next. You may be asked to give a presentation about your dissertation. Then, you will be questioned by the professors on your dissertation committee.


This defense is essentially your ""final exam.""Once you pass it, you are a doctor of gender studies!

, Before you actually graduate, you'll want to start looking for jobs. An important first step is to develop drafts of all your application materials, which you'll want to customize based on the specifics of each job you apply for.These materials can include any of the following:


A cover letter
Curriculum vitae (CV), which is basically a long academic resume
A statement of teach philosophy
A teaching portfolio featuring materials you've used in classes and sometimes student evaluations
A statement describing your research agenda and future research plans
Writing samples, such as your dissertation and conference papers or articles you've published
Letters of recommendation from faculty in your graduate program

, Just as when you were applying for graduate school, you'll now need to start researching schools you might want to work at. The approach here is somewhat different, however.


Instead of picking a few schools to apply to, you'll typically want to apply for just about every tenure-track position you can find in your field, so look for positions often and in many places.
There are many places to look for jobs in your field, such as the websites of professional associations you may have joined, such as the National Women's Studies Association,or other websites dedicated entirely to higher education job postings., View job postings carefully and be sure your materials cover everything requested in the posting. If your application catches the search committee's attention, you might be fortunate enough to get an interview.


Very few programs are likely to interview you. The job market for academics is highly competitive, so apply everywhere you can.
If you do get an interview, you will usually be expected to give a talk about your research, usually based on your dissertation.Start thinking about your job talk as soon as you start applying for jobs.

, If all goes well, at the end of this process you should have one or more offers from a gender studies program that wants to hire you as a professor. You will now get a chance to negotiate the terms of the offer and then (usually) move to another city for a new life as a professor.


Once you have been made an offer, you are in a position of some power. Don't go overboard or be arrogant, but you can usually ask for more than what was offered, in terms of pay, funds for relocation, or other resources related to your job., Do good work, teach your students well, and be proud of your accomplishment. You deserve it.

Say “hello.” It’s simple, it’s painless, but it’s also a good way to stay connected.,
Get out of your office.,
Help your team members stay connected.,
Schedule a meal together.,
Delegate.",How to Be an Effective Manager4," You might be so stressed and busy that you retreat into a shell. Taking time to acknowledge other team members can reap great rewards., It can be very easy as a manager to lock yourself up in your office. Soon, you won’t really understand what is happening on your own team. Get your finger back on the pulse by getting out of your office. Stop by people’s cubicles to chat.


Remember that the goal is not to make “friends.”Feel free to chat about shared interests and people’s lives outside of work.However, your goal as a manager is not to get people to like you.
Instead, ask how their work is going and if they need anything from you.

, Your employees will also benefit from interacting with each other in unstructured ways. Tolerate employees spending a few minutes chatting with each other at the water cooler or in the break room.

, A team lunch or dinner is a great reward for employees. It also helps you stay connected as a team. Try to schedule a team meal at least quarterly.If you want, you can do something else as a team—play paintball or go to a movie. Make sure it is something fun that all team members will enjoy.

, Doing everything yourself is a great way to get cut off from the team. Instead, you should parcel out tasks to employees. Remember that something doesn’t have to be done perfectly.You’ll benefit enormously from delegating. For example, you’ll get to assess your employee’s strengths and weaknesses. Maybe you’ve found a new right-hand assistant.
You’ll also reduce your own stress load, thus making you a better and happier manager.

Limit the options.,
Give deadlines.,
Expect them to follow you.,
Understand and use The Law of Inertia.,
Give objectives, not tutorials.",How to Be an Active Leader," If you have different plans and you want to discuss it with your members, narrow your plans down into 3 or 2. It will give less arguments to the group. People tend to think if they did the right decision after making one. By narrowing down the options, you are able to avoid confusion from people you work with.;
, If you assigned different tasks to your members, you should give them a specific deadline for that certain task. You should also give consequences if they accomplished their task before the deadline. People tend to think that there is plenty of time to work if you give them a month to do the task. By giving them 3 days, 5 days, or a week, you will be able to get results from them as soon as you need it.

, If you give trust to your members, your members will return it to you. People do what they are expected to do because they do not want to damage their reputation. One powerful statement will be surely make a person do what you want them to do. ""I know that you are a very hardworking person, I entrust you the task of compiling these files and putting them in an envelop. I need it by Tuesday."" This powerful statement will surely make that person to do the task, because that person has the inner thought that if he did not do this task, his reputation as a very hardworking person will be damage. You just have to trust your members and they will trust you back.

, Things that in motion, stays in motion. This law is also applicable to us people, this explains why we do not want to get up from our bed every morning when we have to go to work. We are at rest and therefore, stays at rest.

To make your members do their tasks, you'll need a starter. To make them start big tasks, ask first to do small tasks. If they did the smaller task, they would be likely to do the bigger task afterwards. See how it accelerates just like motion? It applies to human behavior too.







, Lastly, You should give them just the objectives and not how its done. You will be surprised by the results if you let your members do the task on their own way.

People work in their optimal state if they have confidence. When you give them freedom, you give them confidence. If your member doesn't really know how its done, then its the time you show it to him.

Establish a hierarchy.,
Make the time to lead.,
Lead by example.,
Delegate when appropriate.,
Manage projects, lead people.",How to Be a Good Team Leader1," Ineffective team leaders aren’t just people who boss everyone around and demand a level of respect that hasn’t been earned. Ineffective team leaders are also people who don’t establish a clear, transparent hierarchy within the team as a whole. If you are the leader, you are at the top. You have the final say on things and assign roles to your team.Hold a meeting with your team, especially if you are new to leading or your team has just been established. During your meeting, discuss with your team everyone’s role and be clear about who reports to who.
Draw up a chart that has everyone’s name and title on it. Your sheet should have a hierarchy that shows you and your role at the top, who reports directly to you, and so on.
Also make it clear that you intend to respect everyone’s roles and acknowledge how important and vital each one is to your successful team.;
, This not only means keeping frequent and open communication with your team and helping to answer any questions. It also means filling in any gaps, solving any problems, and that you should be working the hardest, and often, the longest.


A bad team leader delegates projects and tasks to everyone else and goes home early. A good team leader is constantly making sure everyone is on track, organized, and picking up any slack.
Make yourself available to your team when you are needed. You should also set boundaries that everyone will adhere to. Your team should be able to get your attention when needed, but not every time a question arises. Use your hierarchy to facilitate a chain of command and set your boundaries.
Additionally, set boundaries on both your and your team’s workload. Before accepting a leadership position, re-negotiate your own workload with your boss so you can be available to your team. Then, do the same for your team.
As a team leader, you may have to stay later than your team. Come into work earlier, or even on the weekends. Your goal is to prevent your whole team from having to do this. Give your team workload boundaries that can be followed so the members of your team don’t get overwhelmed or too stressed.

, This is similar to making the time to lead. As a team leader you may have more perks, a bigger paycheck, and an extra vacation day or two, but you also have more responsibility. Your team’s mistakes are ultimately your fault and your responsibility.


Treat everyone on your team with equal respect. Keep an open and honest communication and show your team that you are here to solve any problems or make any needed adjustments that benefit the team as a whole.
Be respectful of other teams and people in other departments. Never criticise other individuals or departments, especially around the team. After all, if your team sees you behaving a certain way, members may think it’s ok to behave similarly. Not only is that kind of behavior disrespectful and unprofessional, but it falls on you.

, Although your job isn’t just to hand off work to others, part of establishing yourself as a good team leader is knowing when to delegate certain tasks. Make it clear what everyone will be expected to do and accomplish. Don’t hover either. Trust your team to do the job at hand.


Be decisive as well. People are more likely to follow and respect you if you can make quick, well informed decisions. When you procrastinate, your team sees that and it can be perceived as weakness. You’re there to lead and make decisions, so be prepared to do so.
If you are faced with a decision that impacts any part of the team, or you may not have all of the information you need to make an informed decision, go to your team. Ask for a report or status update on a part of a project that can help you with your decision. Talk with your team about your options and get input.

, Being a good team leader is knowing how to differentiate between managing all the projects your team is working on and leading the team that is working on those projects. While you need to oversee everyone and all of the projects, you should let your team do the work that each team member was hired to do.Managing is more task-oriented, keeping track of meetings and events, building and maintaining everyone’s schedules, and allowing the proper time and resources for tasks to be completed correctly.
Leading your team requires you to provide support and motivate your team members to accomplish the assigned tasks. A good leader won’t micromanage and tell team members how to do everything. Instead, inspire and motivate your team members to contribute ideas and methods that work best for each individual.

Encourage your team.",How to Be a Good Team Leader2," Most likely, you earned your role in a leadership position. It wasn’t just given to you because it was your right. Think of being a team leader as a privilege.


Though you are in charge of your team, and therefore above the other members, your position as the leader needs to be respected by the members of your team.Earn respect by being a confident, competent member of the team. Carry a positive attitude towards your team as a whole, and towards each member individually. Listen to your team and get everyone’s input.
You will sometimes have to be creative and make an intuitive decision on the fly. This decision may not always be what everyone in your team wants. Explain clearly why you made the decision you did, and ask for input or feedback from your team.
Listen to what your team has to say, and value the ideas that come your way. People will be more willing to accept your leadership role when everyone knows each opinion is valued and considered.
Keep to schedules. If your team feels like both work and personal schedules can’t be met, or aren’t respected, this could affect morale and your team’s opinion of you as a leader. Give everyone time to have a personal life. Talk regularly about weekly schedules, and hold a meeting on Mondays to sort out the week. Additionally, give your team enough time for a project. If you disrupt one task because another has arisen, this can cause conflict. The minute you know a task will have to be accomplished, inform your team.
If an emergency task or project comes up from another department or your boss, your job as a leader is to sometimes push back. You should be the first line of defence for your team against other departments.

, Even though you are the team leader and you make the decisions, you should get your team’s opinions and ideas whenever possible. Try to incorporate these inputs whenever it's feasible. Encourage suggestions on how to solve a particular issue or complete a task.


Take in others' suggestions. When someone gives you an idea, work on it. Think of how you can improve on it. A good leader is one that listens and not just talks. Show the team you are flexible.
If someone proposes a solution or idea, don’t discount it by saying that you’ve already tried that particular approach. “Yeah, but” statements should be avoided as well. Instead of discounting an idea, think it over again, maybe it could work now whereas before it didn’t.
Talk things out with your team. Ask questions to get further information on an idea. Your job as a leader isn’t to discount an idea that may not work, it’s to help your team discover a solution.

, If some people are a little behind on a project or task, help them. Keep a positive attitude and spend some time with the individual to assess why there is an issue. Find a task for everyone no matter what their skill or level.If you’re helping someone who is having a hard time with a task, don’t just demonstrate how to do the task. Not only will quickly demonstrating not help your team member to learn how to accomplish this task themselves, but it may lower morale. No one wants to feel incapable or inadequate.
Stay positive and welcome the opportunity to help. Be excited that your team member wants to learn and improve. Walk a team member through the steps for a task. Schedule a time to help if you’re busy.

, Sometimes people are scared to try something, and this is where the leader comes in. You have to encourage your team members. Show your team that the task is possible, even if difficult, and try to make it fun. Celebrate the positive results of someone’s work.Enthusiasm is contagious. If you get excited, then your team is more likely to be excited about the project. If your team respects you and looks up to as a leader, your excitement and encouragement will foster creativity and a desire to perform well.
Acknowledge your team for a job well done, even if it’s small. Small compliments and acknowledgements can be more effective than big ones. Even if you can’t reward good work with a pay raise, verbal appreciation holds a lot of weight. If your team is doing a great job, consider taking everyone out to lunch one day to celebrate hard work. During lunch, spend the time connecting with everyone on a personal level. Leave the work talk for the office. Get to know who your team members are outside of the office.
A simple “thank you” goes a long way. Taking a second or two to stop and thank team members shows you are a leader who cares and relies on your team.

Know what you are talking about.,
Enjoy being a leader.,
Pay attention to morale.",How to Be a Good Team Leader3," If your team members are as confused as you are, how will they know what to do? As the leader, you must do the research first, have the most information on a project, and know who to assign tasks to.


Do outside research on a topic or project so that when it’s time to lead your team you have all of the knowledge you need to answer questions and discuss ideas.
Pay attention to your team. Listen to each member and pay attention to everyone’s individual strengths and skills. When doling out tasks and roles, you need to be able to give the right task to the right person.
By learning everything you can about your team and the projects you are working on you can provide an authority and give your team the tools to be the most efficient.

, Even though leaders have to take things seriously, there is no reason you can't have fun. Just don't get too carried away. Balance the serious business at hand with regard for the morale and spirits of the team.


Sometimes, you might have a bad day. The same is true for everyone on your team. If a member is lost in a task or frustrated, this is your time to shine. Use your great personality and sense of humor to help your team member. Discuss what it is that’s causing stress and help your colleague with finding a solution.
Helping your team is the fun part of the job. All the planning, handing out tasks, and making sure that everything is completed on time and to standards can get overwhelming. Enjoy the moments when you get to help someone with something.

, A demoralized team won't function. You must set the positive spirit, make the goals clear, show how the job is feasible and possible. No one will work for an impossible goal.


If morale is low, encourage an open conversation about why. It may be a larger within the company as a whole that you can’t quickly fix. At the very least you can come up with some creative ideas to help your team, even on a small level.
Take walking meetings. No one likes sitting in a stuffy room discussing the nuts and bolts of a project. Being in motion gets the blood flowing and facilitates clarity resulting in great ideas. If you can, take your team on a walking meeting out of the office, or even just through it.Play games as a reward or as a way to brainstorm. Or throw a ball around while you have a meeting to discuss goals.
Set fun team goals and reward those goals. You may have certain project goals and department-wide goals that your team has to hit, but you can come up with your own too. Perhaps you set a goal that your team has to complete a portion of a project by a certain date. If the team succeeds you go get drinks after work on your dime, or you plan a field trip day somewhere that is fun but can also help the project. This won’t always be the case, but if you work in a more creative environment you may be able to take your team on an outing to foster bonding or research something that is relevant to your work.
Address frustrations immediately. If you know someone is unhappy or upset, don’t wait until the situation escalates. Talk to that person and work on a solution together. This not only shows that you are paying attention, but that you care.

Use your experience to help others.,
Be someone who comes up with a solution that is the most acceptable and doable.,
Consider how you will involve other people in the solution to fixing problems.,
Share your vision.,
Be a good decision maker.,
Check that others are enjoying your leadership style.,
Be inspiring.",How to Be a Real Leader," If you already know how something would be done well, lead by example and make space for others to follow what you are doing. Do not dissuade people by telling that only a few chosen ones are clever or capable enough; instead, inspire everyone to find that piece that they can contribute and make a difference in doing.;
, If something isn't working, a real leader thinks it through and looks for the angles that will help solve the problem while thinking of others' needs, not one's own. The creativity actually comes from those who accept and move the solution forward, so don't get bogged down in trying to be the creative problem solver; be focused on getting out solutions that others relate to and are willing to work on.


Ask yourself: Will the solution be acceptable/workable for others?

, Letting go of the solution so that others can improve upon it, add to it, build on it and tailor it to everyone's needs is a large part of being a real leader. There is no need to try to perfect the solution yourself; indeed, to try to do so is to shut others out, which is more managerial or territorial by nature, and does not reflect good leadership. Allow others their moments to shine by fostering the environment where that is likely to happen.


Delegate efficiently and willingly. Let go of your knowledge, your ideas, your thoughts by sharing them and putting them out there to percolate among those you trust and know will take up as their own cause and motivation.
Be sure to avoid making the tasks, work or actions burdensome on others. Take great care to match the right people to the tasks they're best suited for, the right skills to the right actions needed.
Check that others are comfortable with what they've been assigned to focus on or do. If not, find out ways to tweak this so that it will work better.

, A real leader both has a vision and willingly shares it. It should be something you're passionate about, that you know will help the greater good and that is considerate of all persons involved. Your vision is something that will motivate others, even during the hardest of times, and will give strength, hope and support to everyone involved. Motivating people through your vision is a skill that is deserving of your best efforts.

, Make the necessary decisions, especially those decisions that others are afraid or unsure to make. While it may seem hard at the time, always think of the longer-term consequences and the betterment of everyone's situation. A manager will have far shorter-term thinking, focused on making things okay now; a real leader must have the courage to push beyond that and see the future, causing disruption now for the sake of the cause or vision succeeding in the future.


Making tough decisions does not mean harming people along the way. A real leader finds gentle and supportive ways to deal with untenable situations, poor performers and anything likely to cause problems. Deal with people with dignity by being open, forthcoming, honest and generous.
Through good decision-making, your leadership qualities will be respected by many. Although there will always be naysayers and the discontented, a real leader cannot be swayed by this, noting that once the decision is made it requires no regrets and a continued focus on the vision.

, Do not be afraid of criticism or feedback. It is the news you truly need to inform you as to whether or not you're doing things the right way as a whole or whether you're about to have a rebellion on your hands. The earlier that you hear, listen to and learn from bad news, the faster you can resolve the problems and discontent and ensure that everyone feels engaged and involved again.

, A real leader will be inspiring and lead people to believe that their job or task is calling and a vital responsibility, not a burden or chore. To have people actively loving what they're doing is what real leadership should aspire to. It is not your legacy that matters, it is the quality of what you've inspired others to do and become that truly lives on.

Be nice.,

Be social.",How to Be a Leader in Your Group," Does your group consist of at least you and one other person? Good. Then you have a group.;
, Is there already sort of a leader in your group? Someone who makes the decisions, who tell others what to do? Or is your group more all-for-one, meaning it makes the decisions, well, as a group. No one person decides. If so, this is the perfect chance for you to step in.

, When someone suggests to sit near the door at lunch, you say that sitting near the vending machines would be better. Start making little decisions like that, and eventually the group will just naturally look up to you as their leader.

, If someone starts picking on a member of your group, stand up for them and defend your friend. Then people will see you as the one in charge. The brave one, the one who will stand up for what you believe in.

, Maybe you can make the invitations for your annual Easter egg hunt. Possibly the New Year's bash could be held at your house this year. Your birthday party should be the coolest ever. Organizing little things like this will make your group realize that you want to have a say in things, and you like to be in charge.

, Are all the ""popular"" kids sporting brand new fancy perfectly coordinating clothes this year? Who cares? Maybe your group could wear jeans and hoodies every Friday. Or you could buy matching sneakers. Whatever you decide, start the trend and make it special to your group.

, Nobody wants to follow someone who's bossy and obnoxious. If your group is totally against something, every single member, don't try to fight it. But if there's a small debate about something, don't be afraid to give your input. Don't be snobby or bossy though, because then no one likes you and you'll probably lose your group.

, If whenever you hang out with somebody you always have an awesome story to tell, then more people will want to hangout with you. Causing you to become the leader.

, Never turn down a chance to hang out with somebody. If they're in your group, you can turn it into a bonding experience, to make then like you more. And even if they aren't in your group, you can still get some gossip out of them, or even invite them into the group. Either way never turn down a chance to hang out with someone.

Write in a journal.,
Look for larger themes throughout your personal story.,
Identify your strengths and weaknesses.,
Discern what stories define who you are today.,
Reframe your experiences as positive ones.",How to Be an Effective Leader Using Narrative Psychology1," Get in the habit of writing every day in a journal. Instead of recording your daily activities, write one story from your past per day. These do not need to have a narrative structure; you will organize them later. You should write for at least fifteen minutes without stopping. Write as many details as you can remember. If you cannot think of what to write about, you can choose one of the following prompts.Write about a time you overcame a personal failure.
Write about a time you couldn’t overcome your own weaknesses
Write about a difficult time in your life.
What is your favorite childhood memory?
What was your first job?
Describe someone who helped you through a difficult period.
Describe your family growing up.;
, Once you have written a few entries, start looking back through your life to see what the common themes, patterns, and events there are. Try to decide if there is an overriding feeling, difficulty, or identity that occurs over and over again.Sometimes it can be hard to identify these themes yourself, so you might consider asking a close friend or family member to help you do this, as long as you are comfortable sharing this information with them.


For example, if you felt as though you didn’t fit in high school and you struggled to find friends as an adult, you might decide that you always found it difficult to conform to the expectations of others.
If you’ve had many successes followed by immediate failure, you might write about how you learned never to take success for granted.

, As you continue to write stories and reflect on their meaning in your life, you might start realizing what your strengths and weaknesses are. To discover your strengths and weaknesses, you should ask yourself:What characteristics have led to my success in life?
What characteristics have led to any failures or disruptions in my life?
How have I improved upon my weaknesses over time?
What is my usual response to a difficult situation? Does it work? Does it not work?

, As you write and reflect, you might find yourself returning to particular experiences over and over again. This might indicate that these stories are the most definitive experiences of your life. What this means is that, from a narrative perspective, these are the stories that have most significantly led to who you are today. This story might be about:


A personal triumph. For example, you might tell a story about how you managed to pay off all your debt within two years on minimum wage.
How you got your first job. You might talk about how you networked with a local business owner to talk your way into a job.
How you overcame a personal tragedy. For example, you might discuss how cancer has affected you and your family.
A childhood hobby or practice. You could explain how collecting baseball cards influenced your financial decisions as an adult.
Your relationship with a family member, mentor, or significant other. You might tell a story about how your father taught you a valuable lesson on respecting others.

, How we view our stories allows us to craft our own reality. This does not mean that you invent events or details in your story. Rather, you consider how you took control over each step in the story and what meaning this story gives your personal narrative.Instead of thinking about how things happened to you, consider how your actions caused opportunities to arise.
Take one of your weaknesses in your life, and think about all of the times that you weren't defined by this weakness. For example, if you believe that you are bad at communicating, think of all the times when you demonstrated effective communication skills.Keep in mind that even your perceived mistakes can be reframed as positive experiences because you can use them as learning opportunities. For example, if you were fired from a job when you were just starting your career, then you might reflect on what you learned from that experience. Did it teach you something about the kind of work you do and do not like? Did it show you the importance of communicating with your superiors? Try to figure out what you can take away from things that did not turn out how you wanted them to.

These are skills indispensable to any workplace and can help you move up in your company faster. Some leadership courses are available as online certifications, however you can take leadership courses through a local college., If you are faced with a new challenge, ask a senior coworker how they would begin the project. If you run into an unexpected problem, reach out to a manager for assistance and trouble shooting.Leverage other people's experience to complete tasks effectively and efficiently. The next time you encounter the same problem, you'll be prepared to tackle it independently.
People will respect you for asking, valuing their opinion, and offering assistance more frequently.

, Not everyone is a natural public speaker, but there are ways to overcome stage-fright, along with other pitfalls of public speaking.


Join Toastmasters.Toastmasters is an international organization devoted to helping people become better, more comfortable public speakers. Many businesses support an internal chapter and encourage their employees to join, but you can find Toastmasters clubs in nearly any community.Learn how to speak without filler words. ""Uhm,"" ""like,"" and ""uhhhh"" are just a few examples of filler words that creep into everyday speech. These words can distract listeners from the message we are trying to present and may even make the speaker seem unprepared or lacking in knowledge., Being positive allows you to take full advantage of opportunities when they occur. It also greatly assists with establishing a social network in your workplace. Below are some helpful tips for maintaining a positive mental attitude:Remember that you are capable and qualified for the job. You would not have been hired if you did not possess all the qualities the job requires.
Say ""yes"" to challenges and new experiences. Undertaking challenges and succeeding builds confidence and can positively influence coworkers and supervisors.
Remember that you are in control of how you think and feel. Negativity exists within each of us, but everyone has a choice whether to foster it. When negative feelings creep in, actively remember the things you have to feel grateful for, pushing negative thoughts to the back of your mind.
Spend time with positive people. It's much easier to be negative when talking to other negative people. Choose to spend time with people who are upbeat and committed to positive thinking.
Find reasons to smile. It's easier to think positive thoughts when we surround ourselves with objects and mementos that bring joy and laughter.

, Being proactive means taking responsibility for your actions and the tasks assigned to you. It also means refusing to worry about things you can't control and focusing your time and effort on the parts of a problem that you can change.. Below are some suggestions for how to be more proactive at work:Be solution-focused. It's easy to get hung up on details and blame sharing, but real leaders focus on the task at hand and what is required to complete it.
Demonstrate accountability for your work. If you make a mistake, own it. If you have an idea, pitch it. Don't be demoralized if people don't always agree with you. By speaking up and contributing, you are demonstrating engagement and concern, both important leadership qualities.
Be consistent and dependable. Treat all coworkers with the same degree of professionalism and respect. Show up to work on time, prepared and ready to contribute. When tasks are due, complete them within deadlines or ahead of schedule.
Offer honest communication. While it is never a good idea to bring personal matters into the workplaces, being honest and open about problem-solving and task completion is an important part of leadership. For example, if you are lacking the tools or resources to complete an assigned task, speak to your manager sooner rather than later about what you need or how to create a work around.

, Not only does this demonstrate respect and attention to the person talking to you but it helps you. Below are tactics for active listening:Restate information: Demonstrates listening and also gives you the ability to clarify things you are less certain of.
Offer subtle ""encouragers"": Nod you head. Say ""uh huh"" or ""I see"" to encourage the person talking to continue and elaborate on their ideas.
Give feedback: This allows you to collaborate with the speaker and even nuance the information that is being offered.
Probe for more information: Ask questions to draw out elaboration on points that are important.
Validation: Tell the person you are talking to that you appreciate them taking the time to offer their thoughts.
Summarize: Summarizing information into your own words permits you to take personal ownership of the information, increasing learning.

, Role models are people we look up to, who model behaviors we seek to emulate. Some ways to be a role model are:Show confidence. Take on new challenges. Be positive. Show others that you are not afraid of new roles or projects.
Be unique. Don't try to be like everyone else. Be proud of who you are and the ways that your unique talents are create value-add moments in your work.
Communicate with everyone: This doesn't just mean talking. Part of good communication is listening to the concerns of others.
Show respect and concern: People notice when you use others to get ahead. It's important to demonstrate that you care about your team and their success as a group.
Be humble. This doesn't mean that you should hide your accomplishments; however, showing humility makes it easier to admit mistakes when you (inevitably) make them and encourages others to help you.
Do good things outside of work: Commitment to worth causes reflects well on your ability to commit to a company.

, Understand the vision of the business or project and keep it at the forefront at all times. Prioritize the success of the organization over personal interests in advancement. Below are some steps to achieving goal alignment:Set goals that reflect company values and objectives. Every company has a masthead statement reflecting what the company stands for and hopes to achieve through it's efforts. Before assigning tasks, make sure you are familiar with these core objectives and ensure that employees are aware how their own efforts align with company values.
Communication expectations to employees. It is often a good idea to put verbal directions in writing and check in with employees periodically to make sure they understand the task.
Document progress. This can often be automated through a database or tracker; however, it can also be done through email memos or a spreadsheet.
Offer feedback on deliverables. There are various ways this can be accomplished. Informally, you can communication through instant messaging; emails are good if you need to attach documentation for records or printing. Finally, if the deliverable is a major project, feedback can come in the form of a quarterly review, where you meet directly with the employee to review performance.

, Training may be provided by you, other team members or an outside training consultant. Customize training to the specific needs of workers, focusing on goal alignment between employee objectives and the organizational bottom line.It is also a good idea to talk to employees directly about what they would like training on, using this to help guide curriculum needs.

, Meetings are important to team success. They are a place to share in formation, collaborate, reach decisions, and align goals. Organize meetings at regular intervals-- every two weeks for a 6 week project, or every 3 months for a year-long initiative--to discuss project details and re-affirm organizational goals., Schedule meetings to accommodate availability and realistic limitations. For example, while everyone may be available late-afternoon on a Friday, it may not be the best time to discuss challenging issues.


If not everyone can make the meeting, assess who the key players are for the project, ensuring the meeting matches their respective schedules.
Delegate note-taking and ensure the meeting details are disseminated to those who could not attend., An agenda should, at minimum, set a topic list, delegate presentation duties, and set the time devoted to each agenda item. When typed out, it can be circulated before the meeting in case agenda items need to be added, and can also be used as a checklist during the meeting. , This means taking steps to ensure all agenda business is resolved and all voices are heard. Below are suggestions to assist with this:Establish meeting rules to mediate when individuals monopolize discussions. For example, set and maintain times limits for discussion.
Open the floor to designated presenters. After presenting information, open discussion for all team members.
After each agenda item and its corresponding discussion, briefly summarize outcomes and move on.
After all agenda items have been discussed, confirm and action plan.
Schedule the next meeting and collect suggested agenda items.

, Decisive leadership avoids stagnation and vacillation, keeping workers on task and motivated, while also behaving responsively to change and new information. Below are the features of decisive leadership:


Clarity of purpose: Ensures alignment of all decisions with organizational goals and ethics.
Engagement: Allows leaders to live by example, embodying engagement with company values that allows for effective, efficient decision making.
Transparency: Does not permit self-interest. Instead, demonstrates how decisions for the good of the company help everyone flourish.
Creating a culture of honest failure: Honest failures are learning points that act as springboards to better decision making. Decisive leadership embraces those times when mistakes are made.
Open and effective communication: Alignment with company values ensures that, where communicating upward into senior management or down the hierarchy to managed employees, there is no inconsistency or contradiction.

, Being a leader in the workplace often involves recognizing when workers need greater direction. This is especially important for new employees or those in new positions who are still norming to their role.


Be sure new employees have training before beginning their new role. Walk the employee through the steps of their new position, providing note-taking materials.
Ensure the employee handbook is up-to-date and easily accessible to all employees, new and existing alike.
Delegate instruction and allow new employees to shadow senior coworkers.

, Appeal to the professional interests of each worker by creating clear paths for development and promotion. Motivate workers by challenging them. Many people thrive when challenged to innovate or perform new tasks. Encourage team members to increase efficiency by creating new systems or recommending product changes., When employees perform well, acknowledge their achievements verbally or by setting up rewards systems. Announce these achievements to the rest of the team, offering opportunities for positive reinforcement and role modeling. . Opportunities for recognition can include:


Completing a unique project that is important to the success of the team.
Taking a leadership role within a company charity event.
When an employee has a major life event (i.e. marriage, childbirth, graduation)
When an employee received a promotion or bonus.

, When resolving a dispute between others in the workplace, focus on the facts of the situation. Avoid making character assessments or personal comments. Management should always be impartial when reviewing employee conflict and avoid personal relationships that can create bias.
Open a dialogue between the parties involved. Often conflicts arise from miscommunication. Be a mediator and open dialogue between the parties in conflict, helping them come to a constructive conclusion to the issue.
Be firm but fair. People aren't always going to get along and some personality types clash in collaborative settings. Set down ground rules for employee comportment, but don't act rashly, especially if this is a first time conflict.

, If the conflict is between yourself and an employee, discuss the issues one-on-one. If there is a conflict between the team and management goals, call a team meeting. Avoid confronting and calling out individual team members about sensitive issues in group meetings., Deal with the issue as soon as it comes to your attention. Otherwise, it could escalate and negatively impact employee performance. Just make sure not to address the issue too quickly, before you’ve had time to consider a course of action., Encouragement and motivation are powerful tools when used correctly.Remind individuals of what they did correctly while also criticizing how they reacted poorly.
Offer criticism that solves problems. Instead of focusing in on what an individual did wrong, ask ""How could this have been approached more productively?""
Be specific and relevant to the point of the discussion. It's easy to get side-tracked, but be sure to keep the discussion focused on a sustainable and positive outcome to the conflict.

, When conflict happens and resolution occurs, praise teamwork and collaboration and recognize the people who made it happen.


If the conflict is between two employees, remind both of their strengths and weaknesses and how glad you are that the situation is resolved.
If the conflict is between the team and management, recognize the key compromisers and team players who achieved resolution via an email memo to the whole team."

Choose a story from your journal.,
Start by describing a stable time in your life.,
Talk about an event that disrupted that sense of stability.,
Describe obstacles that you faced.,
Explain how you overcame the event.,
Identify the lesson you learned.",How to Be an Effective Leader Using Narrative Psychology2," Once you have compiled many stories from your past, you can start writing a narrative. This narrative will have a structure like a book or movie, but it will involve real events from your life. Choose a story from your past, or have a trusted friend or family member help you to pick one.


This story may be made up of one story from your journal. For example, it might be the time when you saved up enough money from your afterschool job to buy your first computer.
It might also come from several stories that you wrote that all carry a common theme. For example, you might write about how you had to constantly overcome your own shyness to become more assertive.

, A good story usually begins with a description of a safe or successful time in your life. This sense of stability will make the eventual disruption seem even greater when it arises.For example, perhaps you felt very secure after graduating college. You had a great job lined up.

, This disruption will present the first conflict in your narrative. It may be a mistake that you made, a personal tragedy, or an unfortunate accident.


For example, you might write about how you lost your first job in an economic recession.

, There are often many obstacles that may have made it difficult for you to achieve your goals. Describe each of the trials and tribulations you faced trying to overcome your problem.For example, as a relatively inexperienced worker, you struggled with finding a new job. You had to take an unpaid internship, which made it difficult to support yourself and find paying work.

, The story should resolve with you overcoming your problems and achieving your goals. Describe the steps you took that helped you seize control of your life and come out on top. These should be framed as positive actions that empowered you to take the necessary steps towards success. Keep in mind that it is okay to include any missteps you made along the way because this will emphasize your resiliency in that situation.


For example, you learned how to be frugal and efficient. You applied this skill at your internship, which impressed your bosses and got you a full-time job., There should be some moral or guiding lesson that you can derive from your story. This might be a lesson that anyone can benefit from, thus making your personal experience a story that can lead others in your example.


Think about how this story made you who you are today. For example, you might say that the practical financial skills you learned from long-term unemployment taught you how to manage money, a skill which you used throughout your career.
You may also try to come up with a motivational statement or metaphor that sums up your experience. This can be a saying that you then pass on to your team, employees, or mentees. For example, you might say, “Even in our darkest moments, we can learn valuable skills that will help us succeed not just in our careers but in our lives.”

Ask yourself what unique value you can bring to the situation.,
Motivate your team with your narrative.,
Listen to others' stories.,
Build on your similarities with others.",How to Be an Effective Leader Using Narrative Psychology3," When you draw on your personal narrative for support, you should analyze each situation separately. Use your narrative to guide yourself. Look towards your personal story to uncover what skills you have that can help your current team, project, or situation.Try visiting with a mentor or someone who knows you well. Exchanging ideas with this person about your value can be very helpful.
Always read back through your daily journal to try to find inspiration from your past.If you’re struggling with a situation, you might write about it in your journal. The process of writing might help you work through the problem.

, If your team is facing a problem or your employees are lacking morale, you might take one of your narratives, and share it with them. This story should be relevant to the current situation, but it can also be personal and inspirational. Be sure to include some information about your insecurities and mistakes as well or your story might come off as bragging, and this would have the opposite effect on your team.


For example, if your team is struggling to meet a deadline, you might consider all of the different ways that you made deadlines in the past. Consider what you did in those situations, and decide if those stories can help inspire your team.
Stories at the beginning of a project should be motivational whereas stories later in a project should be strategic.For example, at the beginning of a project, you might tell a story about how hard work and motivation helped you persevere through a difficult work load. In the middle or end, you might state ways and methods you used to reach the deadline.

, You can learn as a leader by listening to others' stories as well. This will create a bond between you and your team. It can also help you learn from someone's different experience, and if they ask for your advice, you can provide meaningful guidance from your own experience. You can also use this as an opportunity to encourage someone else and give them confidence in their abilities, which will help to motivate your team.


Instead of interrupting their stories to tell your own, start asking meaningful questions that will help both of you explore the present issue. For example, you can ask them “why do you think you were unable to get a response from the client?”
Reflect back what the other person is saying to demonstrate that you understand. You can say, “What I’m hearing is that you were frustrated when your team members were not listening to you.”

, An effective leader develops a team that feels like a community. To do that, you will have to build on your team’s similarities to form a cohesive group.As a team building activity, try to encourage your team members to look towards their own narratives for inspiration. You can ask them:


“Have any of you ever encountered a problem like this? Can you share how you overcame it?”
“Can you all share a story about a mistake or personal failure in your past?”
You can even start by telling your own story, then encourage others to follow up by asking, “So what do you think of this? Have you ever experienced something similar?”

Meditate.,
Find a coach.,
Read narratives of other successful leaders.",How to Be an Effective Leader Using Narrative Psychology4," Mindfulness is powerful tool to help you realize what makes you unique. Spend at least five minutes a day reflecting silently about yourself. Try to find a calm, quiet place where you can reflect without interruption.Sit with your eyes closed for between five and twenty minutes. Breathe deeply, and focus on your breath to help clear your mind. Once your mind is clear, you can start reflecting on your personal narrative.


Keep in mind that this takes patience and practice. Try not to get discouraged if it takes several attempts for you to get your brain to slow down and stay in the present moment.
If you have never meditated before, you can learn by watching a YouTube video, downloading a meditation app, or by taking a mindfulness class.
Sometimes listening to peaceful music or nature sounds can help you clear your mind.

, Narrative coaches are a type of personal coach who can help guide your story by asking relevant questions and helping you realize the larger picture. Narrative coaches can be found online or through motivational coaching services. Some narrative psychologists at universities or through private practices may also offer coaching.Coaches will often ask you questions to force you to consider elements of your narrative that you may have missed or glossed over.
If you're struggling with finding a positive framework to view your past, a coach can help you. They can also teach you positive thinking techniques to shape future narratives.

, The best way to learn the structure, themes, and metaphors of a successful leader is to look at how others have done it before you. Look to historical leaders as well as current business leaders, political leaders, and other success stories. Read their narratives, and reflect upon how their stories relate to yours.For example, if you work in management, you might read the memoir of a Fortune 500 CEO to learn their secrets.If you are struggling with a personal crisis, such as mental illness or a death in the family, you might read the memoir of someone who went through a similar ordeal.
If you are struggling with balancing family and work, you could look for stories from others who managed to succeed in both their personal lives and career.
You can even ask people who are close to you about how they overcame difficult situations.

Steer kids towards better role models.",How to Be a Great Role Model to Young Kids," Once you grow up, you lose touch with your childhood. As a result, you will find yourself thinking of children all in the same way. Many adults adopt a broad approach made to fit the concept of “kid” and, as such, forget how they wanted to be treated when they were young. Adults don’t want to be talked down to, and neither do kids.Don’t lump them all together. Whether your reasoning is age or expectation-related, doing so prevents you from appreciating individuality.
It’s easy for adults such as parents to get absorbed in the responsibilities that come with authority, but they’ll remember someone who is personal and friendly rather than someone who dictates.
Try doing things like shaking their hand and asking non-patronizing questions. Ask about their viewpoints, like “What do you think about the news yesterday?” in order to get to know them and further customize your speech to them.
When speaking to them, don’t jump to conclusions about how they think and feel. Instead of saying, “You must have felt angry,” let them express that in their own words.;
, A common mistake adults make is to overcompensate for their discomfort around children. They’ll raise their voice in a childish way and make awkward praises in order to get on the child’s good side. Many fall into this extreme in order to assuage the burden of having to pose as a confident, authoritative adult.


Avoid sounding insincere. Instead of saying, “Good job!” in a drawn out, lilting tone, say, “I like the way you took the initiative to take out the trash.” Be specific, personal, and convicted.
Don’t feel the need to point out every action the kid does, exaggerate it, or compare it what others are doing. These mistakes make your praise sound inauthentic and kids will begin to lose confidence in their own abilities., This is situational, but knowing when to make your words sound the way you intend is critical and requires practice. Children infer a lot from tone, so sounding dismissive when they tell you about themselves, whether that be getting a hit in a baseball game or a serious problem, for instance, distances yourself from them. Your tone should be appropriate and non-threatening.Yelling and screaming is reactionary when something bad happens, but you’ll have more of an effect as a role model by handling problems the cool and collected way. Rather than get mad about that broken vase, say, “It’ll be okay. Accidents happen.”
It is useful to vary your tone to match their feelings. For instance, you’d want to express pride and enthusiasm during an accomplishment or seriousness after a bad experience.Public figures such as teachers should remain professional without sacrificing warmth. Rather than say, “This is the greatest writing ever!” or “This writing is terrible,” say “I like the way you’ve started. Do you want me to help you?”

, While in many ways children feel and learn the same way adults do, they communicate very differently. The younger the child, the less capabilities they have in abstract thinking and the less attention they have for your spiel. When trying to get a child to get somewhere on time, rambling on about why they won’t make it doesn’t show them the consequences but does cause them to tune out.Address the child by name, then put the point you’re trying to make up front. Avoid rambling and displaying uncertainty in your message.
Pay attention to how kids speak and mimic that. You’ll see them use short words and sentences.
Monitor your own speaking patterns with children. If you go on too long or in a way they can’t comprehend, they’ll appear disinterested. Use this to make adjustments.

, Kids make mistakes. They struggle at school. They don’t listen to your directions. Consider how much you like being berated and having your mistakes put on display. The way you relate to a child is a key factor between you being a role model or them spiraling down into resentment.


Instead of yelling at a child for struggling in school, for instance, make a point of acknowledging their efforts to improve. Show your support. Cheer them on.Use words of encouragement rather than negative corrections. Demanding they out the trash later provokes a negative feeling compared to saying, “You’ve been doing a good job remembering to take out the trash.”Displaying belief in them is a sure way to indicate to them that they deserve self-worth and can improve in whatever area is difficult for them.

, Children unconsciously pick up cues for their parents. A gloomy, anxious parent, for instance, spreads a mood that the child adopts, which can lead to depression and anxiety.Read any book on inspirational sports athletes. You’ll see that the best role models encouraged them by instilling the self-confidence needed to deal with life’s obstacles.
Instilling a positive attitude doesn’t mean you need to be unrealistic. Handle situations with healthy optimism because delusional thinking can lead to later problems if the child doesn’t understand consequences and how to deal with them.

, The last person a child respects is someone who they feel refuses to listen to them or value their thoughts and feelings. The dynamic between you and a child should feel relaxed and more equal than authoritative.


A possible way to do this is to meet children at their level. Instead of lording over a young kid, for instance, try squatting or kneeling.
Conversation comes from open-ended questions. Many adults use this trick to converse with other adults. Instead of asking for their dog’s name, invite the child to tell you about the dog.It is tempting to simplify questions into those that provoke closed, one-word answers. If the child is unresponsive, change your approach in a way such as offering an entertaining narrative or try again later.

, Naturally, a display of coldness such as crossing your arms, turning away, and not smiling will suggest to anyone, including a child, that you’re not interested in them. If you’re a potential role model such as a parent, this has devastating consequences, including showing kids that you don’t care to reason with them or offer respect. Your body language should be in sync with your words.


Offer smiles with your praise. Smiles that are sincere feel open, familiar, and comfortable while making you appear genuine.Proper eye contact is a must. Offer just enough to connect with kids personally. A lack of it displays disinterest or a lack of confidence. Too much feels invasive or even authoritarian.
Even your presence can lend strength. For instance, sitting close to a child when discussing a serious issue suggests you support them.

, It’s easy to hear what someone’s saying; it’s hard to hear what someone means. Most people in daily life don’t put in the time and effort to truly get to the heart of what someone else is trying to tell them. For children, this is important because they may be unable to tell you outright and instead express this through actions that can be cemented by an inappropriate response from you.Mirror the child’s apparent feelings to try to get to the bottom of the issue. Instead of saying, “You must be sad,” say, “You might be sad” to avoid making an assumption.
The wrong way to actively listen is to add epithets in an attempt to teach a lesson. Saying something like, “Big girls don’t cry” is demeaning and devalues the child’s emotions.

, Psychological studies show that children learn through imitation. While issues such as domestic violence and alcohol abuse are considered cyclical, behavioral imitation extends to habits far less obvious.


For instance, it isn’t enough to talk about eating healthy or saving money. If a child sees you being irresponsible by ignoring finances or eating lots of fast food, chances are that will become a habit of theirs too.The more routine you make the behavior and the more positive examples of the behavior the environment holds, the more the behavior becomes normal for the child., You’re human. You make mistakes and swear on occasion. To be a role model, you don’t have to be perfect; rather, it is important for you to own these mistakes and use them as a learning opportunity. Remember that excuses make your own behavior appear acceptable.


First, accept personal responsibility. Apologize sincerely if necessary. Owning up to your mistakes is difficult but honest and therefore impressive.Second, seek to remedy whatever problem arises from your actions. This can be anything from having an honest discussion with a child after missing an event to helping a stranger in the street. Once the strength of your character is apparent, it’ll inspire those around you, including kids.

, It’s easy for an adult to change their mind. If you’re a parent, you may feel tempted to undo a punishment once a child flashes a cute, innocent smile or offers an insincere apology. This causes the child to find ways to avoid punishment not because they’ve learned better, but because they’ve learned that the repercussions of their behavior are inconsistent.Consistent rules invoke transparency and expected consequences which reinforce that the action that merited punishment was wrong.
An unrelated adult such as a teacher still needs to keep their words and decisions consistent. This may mean making a tough judgment call to do what you consider right despite the scrutiny of parents, but the goal is to be consistent without being harsh.

, Often, the people who have the biggest impact on others are the ones who are able to effortlessly display compassion. You don’t have to fund charities or serve terms in volunteer organizations (though those can help), but you do need to display positive emotions to anyone you meet in life.


For instance, someone who presents a positive, happy face in a school cafeteria and takes the time to get to know the children is more likely to have a personal impact in a child’s life than someone who gives millions to charity while showing no compassion in daily life.Be loyal to those around you. Whether that is with a difficult friend, a local business, or your own values, kids will notice your consistency. It's a unique trait in an era where friends can be removed from social media by the click of a button.
Subdue your negative feelings. Instead, show commitment to values such as positive social change or causes such as charity work. Civic engagement and acceptance of others make for great role model displays., Think of why athletes are such popular role models. Other than media availability, many of them have fascinating stories of triumphing in the face of bad life circumstances such as loss and poverty. They had to work hard to get where they are, proving the worth of persistence.


For example, black male students suffer a disproportionate rate of failure in school, but a school that brought in role models who had overcome adversity and had the students imitate them caused student achievement to improve.You don’t need to have survived a genocide to have a moving story. Search your childhood and work history for issues that challenged you and share these with children when they face similar struggles.

, Feelings allowed to fester are ones that have severe consequences on relationships. You can tell kids to be patient on the road all you want, but if they hear you swearing up a storm at other drivers, they’ll adopt that attitude for themselves. Find more positive outlets for expression.Instead of burying your feelings in chips and ice cream, exercise, for example. Teach self-control by example.
Be careful with the relationships you keep. Many kids come from broken home lives and you don’t want to be a contributor. Forgive gracefully and avoid talking negatively about someone behind their back, especially where a child can hear.

, Humans can seem like different people depending upon how their moods go, but good role models are known by the positive qualities they display regularly. Expressions such as “like father, like son” hold true because kids see and mimic behaviors. That means they also see when adults aren’t following up their words with behaviors.”Walk the talk,” so to speak. If you promise you’re going to spend time with a child, for instance, follow through on that promise or your word is meaningless. “Do as I say, not as I do” never works.
Your body language and actions should always indicate that you’re there for support. This applies to whatever lesson you teach, such as self-respect and generosity. Choose the legacy you offer.
Step back and examine your actions for consistency. When you tell kids to be self-respecting and compassionate, do you end up in destructive relationships? Hypocrisy will cause kids to find alternative role models.

, Everyone who thinks of a bad role model first goes to celebrities. Unfortunately, they get a lot of media attention for their worst behavior. This attention has the effect of normalizing the behavior for kids. They see someone they admire doing it, so the behavior becomes learned through admiring success.Avoiding these role models requires forming a strong relationship with the child. If the child respects you and values your presence, they will be more likely to hear what you say.
Ensure that they realize there is a difference between public performance and private life. For instance, children are often wowed by athletes who command a lot of intention, but society often conflates winning a championship with being a good, responsible individual.
Find out what the child thinks of the behavior. Ask, “What do you think of that football player shoplifting?” Help them to understand, if necessary, then help them find ways the celebrity could have done better.
Ensure the child knows they don’t have to emulate all qualities of a bad role model.

, The other common example of a role model is a peer. Peers for kids are important, because they allow kids to grow and gain experiences that help them to navigate the world, but still, bad friends can impart many bad lessons. Limit their influence by setting a better example.


For children who struggle socially, find ways to teach proper interactions. Display these interactions in your own life, but also consider using the services of a therapist or teaching them such skills as conversing and problem-management.Give kids opportunities to interact. For younger kids, you can have them together in a safe environment where they can play. Older kids still have to be allowed to make their mistakes and solve their problems.
The earlier you stop bad behaviors such as a bad attitude or drug abuse, the better. During calm periods have discussions with the child, but focus on the behaviors rather than attacking the bad peer.Instead of forbidding the relationship and driving the child further towards the peer, institute rules such as having the peer over when you’re around.

, When it comes to an athlete who happens to be involved in lascivious and violent behavior off the field, the child will see things such as wealth, fame, personal success, attention, and freedom. While these may seem nice to have, the negative lessons also come with them. Once you find these qualities, you can try to switch their attention to a role model who embodies similar traits in a positive way.


Be sure to teach them that every person has good and bad qualities. It can be helpful to not portray yourself as an infallible parent or public official. Own your own mistakes and adversities.

, If you don’t, you can leave a blank in the child’s life where they aren’t sure who to look up to and can therefore end up going back to the bad role model.It can take some compromising to find a substitute. You may find another athlete, for instance, who embodies positivity, or you may have to look to someone who never made the professional levels and had to go into a different field.
Talk about the people you look up to for inspiration. If you can explain your own feelings, hopes, and weaknesses, you can share these with kids to reach them in a personal and relatable way while providing them a better role model.

Different people have different ideas about what makes someone good, but there are a few traits that most will agree are desirable traits to have. Develop your own list of qualities you want to work on to become someone others look up to.


You may determine that ""good"" means having integrity, being reliable, and being honest.
Some see goodness in humility, generosity and kindness.
The ability to empathize with others and be nonjudgmental is another way to be good.;
, There is nothing wrong with striving to be a good person. However, it's not a good idea to change yourself just to be popular. You can't be everything to everyone. Strive to be good for the sake of being good, not to impress others.


If your mission to change yourself is motivated by other people's opinion of you, it will be easy to get off track. You may find yourself catering to others' expectations instead of doing the right thing.
That said, it's fine to want to set a good example for others, especially children. If you are a parent, the values you exhibit will leave an impression on your kids.

, Being genuine means saying what you really think and backing up your words with actions. People admire those who are genuine because they don't try to pretend they are someone else, and you can trust they mean what they say.


To work on being more genuine, see if you're living by your values. For example, if you value protecting the environment, does your lifestyle reflect that? Doing things like recycling, carpooling, conserving water, and so on are ways to be true to your belief that it's important to protect the environment. Accept your whole self. Everyone has areas they know they are strong in and areas they know that don't come as easily. Everyone must deal with mistakes and not seeing a payoff for their efforts on the first try. People don't have to be perfect to be good. Genuine people are comfortable with the fact that they still have their challenges and strengths. They are also comfortable with having to try multiple times until they succeed.
Do not judge those around you. Genuine people tend to not compare others to themselves or to outside standards. Truly genuine people accept others for who they are. Try to avoid judging friends, family members, and co-workers., Acknowledge the good things about yourself and celebrate your successes. Being comfortable with yourself is vital to becoming a good, admired person. People tend to look up to those with reasonable self confidence and it's easier to think of others when you're not preoccupied with your own perceived inadequacies.


If you feel you have low self esteem, pursue activities that make you feel good about yourself. For example, if you're good at listening to others, you could volunteer at a nursing home and spend time talking with people there. You can feel positive about doing good work that fits with your skillset.
Talk to yourself in a positive way. When you're faced with a challenge, tell yourself, ""I can do this."" When you do something well, congratulate yourself.
It can be very difficult to improve self-esteem, especially if you have any preexisting mental health conditions that affect your perception of yourself. If this is the case, consider seeing a therapist or counselor to talk through these issues. You can find a therapist by asking your general practitioner for a referral or looking online through your insurance company to see what practices and independent counselors accept your insurance. If you're a student, you may be eligible for free or discount coverage through your college or university.

, It's okay to have negative feelings from time to time. However, it's important to learn how to deal with these negative feelings in a constructive way, otherwise your behavior will be negatively influenced. You can do this by practicing emotional regulation, which is a way of processing your emotions to deal with them in a healthy way.


Emotion regulation is a step-by-step process. First, acknowledge that you are feeling anger or another negative emotion. Notice how it feels and give it a name. Think about what's causing the emotion. Take a moment to evaluate how you feel about having the emotion, and how you want to deal with it. Finally, choose an appropriate action to take.Taking the time to process your emotion in this way will give you the chance to use the emotion in a healthy way instead of having an impulsive reaction. For example, let's say your daughter comes home after her curfew. Instead of angrily yelling at her, take the time to process your anger and decide on a course of deliberate action, such as scheduling a time to talk it over the next day.
Sometimes past trauma and abuse create emotional patterns that can impede the process of emotional regulation. You may find yourself having emotional outbursts that affect the people around you. Try distraction to help calm down, then work on productive inner dialogue, such as, “It’s okay, I’m just having a bad day. It happens from time to time. I’ll have a better day tomorrow.” It may also help to explain to the people around you, “I had a bad day, and I feel stressed and a bit upset. I’m going to go calm down for a little while first, then we can talk when I feel better.”
Forgiveness is important to being a good person. Forgiving others and yourself for past mistakes can untether you from feelings of resentment, distrust, and anger that could be affecting your behavior in the present.
If you have difficulty forgiving, and a tendency to hold grudges, talk to a therapist about how to let go of past resentments. Yoga, which preaches living in the moment in a spiritual sense, can also be helpful for learning to forgive., Take stock of the person you are in the present moment and be honest. Is there anything in your life that's affecting your relationships with others? How can you go about fixing that?


Get your mental health in check. It's hard to be good to others when you struggle to take care of yourself. If you're suffering from depression, anxiety, or any other psychiatric issues seek help from a trained psychiatric professional. Being stable mentally can help you be a better person to those around you.
Confront any existing addictions. Addictions can be both physical (smoking, drinking, narcotics) or emotional (video games, internet). Whatever form they take, it can be very difficult to foster meaningful relationships and gain admiration and respect when you're struggling with an addiction. There are a variety of self assessment tests online to evaluate whether you show symptoms of addiction. If so, you should seek out help from a therapist. There are also support groups, like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, that have centers in communities nationwide that can work to help you cope with addiction.

Keep your stress levels in check. If you're a high stress person, you may affect those around you without even realizing it. If you're very worried about your own issues and problems, you may inadvertently neglect or dismiss the needs of others. Meditation, therapy, regular exercise, and talking to a therapist or counselor can all help you manage your stress levels., In order to get people to look up to you, charisma is important. Work on honing your speaking, listening, and story-telling skill to become a more charismatic, likable person.



To be a good listener, practice active listening. Instead of thinking about what your response will be, really listen and be present when someone is talking. Encourage them by nodding and asking questions.
Try to stay informed about the world around you. People tend to be impressed by people who are in-the-know and well informed. Read newspapers, magazines, and online journals. Keep track of current events. You do not necessarily need to have strong political views yourself but having some sense of the current conversation is important to come off as charismatic.Use your body language to convey confidence. Maintain eye contact with others. Stand up straight. Nod and respond to what others are saying to convey interest and understanding. In conversation, ask about others. People are drawn to people who are genuinely interested in those around them.Practice good story telling. People tend to admire people capable of telling good stories, so try and be able to entertain others with amusing personal anecdotes. It can help to listen to radio programs, like ""The Moth"" or ""This American Life,"" to get a sense of good storytelling., In other words, tell people how you really feel instead of sugarcoating it and hiding your true thoughts. This is a way to build people's trust in you. Being direct and honest with those around you will make you a better, more admired person.


Practice being honest with others about your actions, even when you made a mistake. For example, if you miss a deadline at work do not blame lack of sleep, stress, or other factors. Simply step up and say, ""I wasn't paying attention and I screwed up. I will work harder next time.""Being honest even when it could hurt someone's feelings isn't always easy, but there's a way to do it without causing pain. Frame your feedback in a constructive way. For example, if someone asks for your opinion on a new shirt you don't think is attractive, you could say, ""That's not my favorite shirt on you. How about I show you the shirt I love you in the most?""However, do not offer unsolicited advice. This usually comes off as preachy and people are not generally receptive. Especially when dealing with sensitive issues, like someone's weight, job, or relationship status, it's best to hold your options to yourself unless you're specifically asked., Being generous with friends and family members is a great way to be admired and to be a better person. Small, kind gestures go a long way.


If you're invited to a party, bring something to share. A snack or a drink will show the host you appreciated the invitation. Even if you know food will already be served, it couldn't hurt to bring a dish.When going out with friends, offer to buy a round of drinks or be the designated driver.
If a friend is having a hard day, making them a small gift, like a homemade card or a baked good, can help.
Giving does not always have to be in the form of physical gifts. You can give people your time. For example, take an hour visit a friend in hospital or stop by a family member's house if they're going through a rough break up. Sometimes, just the presence of another person's positive energy is helpful.

, Finally, being a good person should stretch out beyond the confines of your immediate friend circle. Find ways to give back to your community.


Volunteering is a great way to give back to your community. Try to find a cause you're passionate about and can contribute to. For example, if you're an avid reader, volunteer to read to children or the elderly at a hospital, nursing home, or daycare. If you love animals, see if they need volunteers at your local shelter.Donating money can also help, but you can take it up a notch by fundraising. Offer to make phone calls to past donors on behalf of an organization you care about. Participate in fundraising activities like charity dinners, auctions, marathons, and other events.You can also offer to help on a small scale. Pay attention to the neighborhood your live in. If you have elderly neighbors, offer to rake their leaves or shovel their driveway in the winter. If you have neighbors with young children, offer occasional free babysitting. If someone on your block loses a family member, stop by with homemade casseroles and pastas to help take some pressure off them during the grieving process."

Search for someone whose work aligns closely with your own career goals if you are looking for a professional mentor. If looking for someone to provide more general support, look for individuals with strong moral character who live lives that you hope to emulate. Consider making a list of two or three names.For instance, if you are looking to receive mentorship in your goal of becoming a marine biologist, see if there are any local to you, at your University, or if your friends or family have any connections to someone in this career.
For more general life mentorship, you might choose someone you admire from your community or place of worship.;
, If you are looking for a career mentor, going to networking events can help you make connections. These events can provide a good opportunity to meet other people who are in (or trying to get into) your chosen field, and some of these people may be potential mentors.If you are in high school or college, you might be able to attend career fairs or networking events hosted by your school, or join a student club related to your interests.
If you’re already working, look for opportunities to attend conferences or networking events in your field.
If you connect with anyone, be sure to exchange contact information. Send a follow-up email letting them know that you enjoyed meeting them, and leave the door open for further communication.

, After you have selected your potential mentor, do your research on them. When you do finally connect, you will be more confident and have more to talk about. You will also make a good impression on your potential mentor by letting them know that you have familiarized yourself with their work and recognize their accomplishments in their field. Find out what work they have done in the past, any awards or accolades they have received, and their general life trajectory that led them to this point.You can do a simple Google search to find this information. You can also look on their social media accounts or the websites of their current or past employers or schools.

, Perhaps the person you are hoping will mentor you is your professor or upper level staff person where you work. Begin establishing a relationship with them in small but meaningful ways. Visit office hours and talk about your research. Find ways to interact with your potential mentor at work, such as by attending trainings that they are leading or other functions that they might attend.


The goal is to start building mutual familiarity: as you get to know your potential mentor, they should also be getting to know you.

, Overly long messages tend to get ignored more often than succinctly worded ones. Send them a short and to the point email introducing yourself, referencing some of their work that you admire, asking for what you want from them, and requesting a meeting or a phone call.Your email might read “Dear Dr. Locklear, I’m reaching out to let you know that I am fascinated with your work on the dialects of North Carolina. I hope to do work that is very similar one day and I am hoping to find someone assist me in this journey. I was wondering if you would consider being my mentor and if so, could we meet for 15-20 minutes this week or next?”
Be sure to know their title. Don’t call them Mrs. if they are a Dr.

, Before sending the email, ensure that the subject line is attention grabbing. Avoid generic and vague email subjects like “Hello” or “From a Fan.” Use this opportunity to create something eye-catching so that it won’t go ignored.An example could be “Inspired by Your Research on Cultural Appropriation”.

, It will be up to you to rearrange your schedule to make this meeting happen. If they can only meet after 5PM, but you don’t like to meet that late, you may have to just bite the bullet in this instance. It is very likely that your potential mentor has a packed schedule, so them making any room for you at all should be celebrated.Go to their office; do not ask that they come to you.

, If you come off as overly needy, entitled, or self-centered, your potential mentor may wish to distance themselves from you. Take care to avoid the following pitfalls, which could alienate a potential mentor:

Being excessively needy.
Demanding too much of their time, or not letting them know that you value their time.
Being insincere or going overboard with compliments and praise.
Making the relationship one-sided. Your mentor will be more interested in helping you if you have something of value to offer in return.

, When you enter the meeting, no matter how short it is, be prepared and be sure to have notes with questions you may have. Shake their hand firmly, come well dressed, and try to speak slowly and assertively.Avoid rambling and don’t interrupt them when they are speaking.
You will feel more confident, appear more serious, and be less likely to waste your own and your mentor’s time if you prepare for the meeting in advance.

, Once you are in the meeting, reiterate and expound on your wishes for them to mentor you. Talk about your interests and goals and how and how much you admire their research, work ethic, or any other positive characteristics you would like to highlight.You might say “Thank you again so much for agreeing to meet with me. As I mentioned in my email, I notice how people really gravitate to you and how well respected you are in the community. I really would like to be more like that as I grow. I am hoping that you can mentor me and that we can perhaps set up a lunch or meeting once per month?”

, Discuss concrete ways that you would like for them to be able to guide you in your life or career trajectory. Perhaps you are looking for advice on the best medical schools to apply to and how to be successful throughout your studies. Tell them this. Also discuss any ways that you might be able to assist them with their work.

, Though you are sure to be bursting with ideas and questions, honor the time commitment that you asked for, unless they ask you to stay longer. You do not want to keep them from other assignments or meetings that they must attend.Wear a watch to keep track of time or set an alarm on your phone.

, After you have met with them, send them an email and include a thank you note. You can also mention a reminder of any next steps that the two of you discussed, how they helped you, and any resources you made mention of., If they have agreed to serve as your mentor, then you will now need to begin formalizing your relationship. Think about the amount of time and commitment that you and your mentor have. Perhaps you might ask for a lunch meeting that lasts one hour per month or a thirty minute phone call every few months., Once you begin to meet with your mentor or speak to them regularly, they will likely begin imparting invaluable life and career advice to you. Honor their time and wisdom by following their advice. If they feel that you never take the advice that they give you, they won’t feel that their role as a mentor is very effective and may want to stop making the effort., Some mentors may come right out and ask you for things like help with their social media accounts. However, others might not be comfortable asking but might readily accept help if offered. When receiving help from your mentor, don’t forget to give them help in return. Always ask “Is there anything that I can do to help you?” or “Would you like some help with that?”If you agree to do something for them, you should follow through on your promise so that they view you as diligent, dependable, and trustworthy.

, If you are at a crossroads in your academic, career, or life journey, use them for advice on how to proceed. Perhaps you are considering taking a gap year to backpack through London or are considering turning down a summer internship. Get their feedback about any potentially important decisions that you might make and allow them to truly mentor you., The work and time of a mentor can truly benefit you in ways that other relationships cannot. Thank them for all of the help, advice, and connections they have provided you with and realize that you might not have the level of success that you have without them. Thank them each time you speak to them and consider writing them a card once a year or so to show your appreciation., Perhaps you have found a good match in your mentoring relationship and are very satisfied with your dynamic. But perhaps they never emailed you back after you sent a follow up email or they expressed that they do not want to be your mentor. Do not pressure them to change their mind or meet with you. Find another mentor who will be willing to help."

Know the rules.,
Learn by example.,
Your motion should be specific, unique, and concise.,
Make Preparations.,
Consider your delivery.,
Open your motion with ""I move..."" You can try saying ""I move to..."" or ""I move that..."" This is the equivalent of saying ""I propose."",
Obtain the floor.,
Make Your Motion.,
Wait for your motion to be seconded.,
Allow the presiding officer to state the question.,
Engage in the debate.,
Vote.,
Allow the presiding officer to state the result of the vote.",How to Make a Motion at a Board of Directors Meeting," Not all organizations use exactly the same rules or require the same level of formality. If your organization maintains written documentation on its preferred method for making a motion, read it carefully.;
, Observe how other members of your organization make formal motions during meetings.

, Include all the relevant details and none of the irrelevant ones. Be unambiguous, and leave as little room for interpretation as possible.

, Not everyone can construct motion like this entirely in their head, and there is nothing wrong with this. If necessary, draft your motion in writing beforehand and carefully consider its delivery.

, Individual words count in situations like these, and the effective delivery of an idea can make all the difference in how that idea is perceived and understood.

,

, Before making your motion, it is necessary for you to obtain the floor, and be recognized by the presiding officer. If you making your motion without completing this step, it is much less likely to be taken seriously.


Wait until the floor has been yielded or is otherwise made available.
Address the presiding officer by their formal title, such as ""President,"" ""Chairman,"" or ""Moderator."" Address men as ""Mr."" and women (married or unmarried) as ""Madam.""

, This is the moment of truth, but if you have planned and/or practiced your delivery (or had your afternoon coffee), it will be a breeze.


Do not forget to start with ""I move...""
Address your motion to the entire Board, not just the presiding officer.
Make no more than one motion at a time.

, With few exceptions, all motions must be seconded by another member of the Board. This is to ensure that the Board does not spend time evaluating a proposal which only one member favors, and it's why effective delivery is so crucial.


In a formal setting, they will say something along the lines of ""I second the motion,"" or even just ""I second.""
In certain cases, such as when a general consensus is apparent, the presiding officer can choose to skip this step and move on to the next one.

, Once your motion is seconded, the presiding officer will re-state it. This is called ""stating the question.""


Until the presiding officer does this, your motion is not formally up for the Board's consideration.

, Once the presiding officer has stated the question, the Board can debate it. Typically, only one member can speak on the question at any given time, and they can only speak twice if there is no other member who has not yet spoken who would like to speak.


You can participate in the debate.

Other members may make secondary motions to amend the primary motion.

, Once the debate has run its course, the presiding officer will ask who is in favor of the motion and count the affirmative votes.


Unless the number of affirmative votes indicates an even split in the Board, the presiding officer will typically not request negative votes.

, The presiding officer will announce the result, instruct the corresponding officer or member to take action, and introduce the next item of business.

Avoid the distorted thought of following: do not use another person's goals and ambitions.,
Lead to help realize your dreams by pursuing them.,
Decide to explore new opportunities and your possibilities.,
Develop leadership skills, by valuing and supporting individual life and actions as personal opportunities.,
Seek freedom defined as:


Freed ""to"" act (and not freed ""from"" actions), example: ""have freedom to believe in and seek your goals"";
Freed ""for"" a cause (and not freed ""of"" responsibility), example: ""use freedom and make the effort to create your success or failure, by trying, striving for your goals such as betterment for you and others"";
Seek your own individual vision that fits your ambition and your own industriousness, example: ""Take hold of freedom to decide with the freedom of choosing your own way."",
Be competitive in personal and group efforts for success versus mediocrity as your decision without being condemned or restricted.,
Get education and training: Support your dream for your way of life.,
Consider promoting or criticizing political officials, candidates or parties, if you wish.,
Cooperate to help fulfill others pursuits as well as help your own: but do not be neutral or compromising your opportunities.,
Work individually beyond group boundaries which are necessary as long as there are differences among individuals who will set some borders and bounds to protect one's personal prerogatives to freedom.

,
Make your own life's career, and live firsthand not vicariously.,
Expect different ideals and differing results for different folks, so seek what you prefer to be, not what an aptitude test or counselor reveals or indicates.",How to Avoid Life As a Pawn by Leading," Seek liberty for yourself and other people, or if you received life by a drawing, by chance, then would your life be expendable and probably lacking value?;
, It’s not too late to dream big.


Dreams can be started fresh -- or can be renovated.

,


Whatever your calling in life, age or situation, there are unrealized possibilities that you can form from new dreams and plans to be lived-out.

, So, you can then appreciate your unique, personal value, and your fulfillment which centers upon finding opportunity for yourself and others to live fully by ones own plans based on a set of goals and ambitions.


Avoid being expendable by being different, not droning on the same as others. That means work-out your dreams, and goals.

,

, Consider retiring later, if you wish, be productive longer; seek to compete and fulfill visions of personal self-fulfillment.


It is not too late, example: Colonel Sanders, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), was 62 years of age when he sold his first KFC franchise (he had worked for over 30 in his own, small chicken place). He sold KFC for millions of dollars at age 74, AND lived to be 90!

Break from family and friends ways, if they have failed to show you better ways and have even dragged your ideas down until now. You may have been discouraged from dreaming; or acting in your own upward mobility and expecting that for your family: some may be accused of acting like you are better than others of your people.

Move-on, in upward mobility. If some resent the fact that you now want to move up or to do something significant with your life, so what. Or, maybe they were trying to protect you from pain or disappointment, but still you’ve been discouraged from living your dream.

, Choose your education and career to have upward mobility in the next generations of your family and cheer your neighbors to ""live well in freedom.""

, Support or oppose a political official, candidate or system.

, Live your life creatively, not formless, amorphous life, but unique.

,, Write your own diary, avoid merely being a book-worm (like reading another person's diary): seek to be free in the domain of personal beliefs, ambitions, family, property, places and things.

, Do not depend on testing or opinions to reveal who you are, or what you can be, should be, or must be. Understand your abilities and aptitudes, but consider what actually interests you and worked into what fits your opportunities. Make it work.

Understand the difference between having an opinion and being opinionated.,
Determine whether you are coming from a place of altruism.,
Keep your cool if you want to give advice out of excitement.,
Stop yourself from giving advice if you are annoyed.,
Avoid pontificating.",How to Stop Giving Unsolicited Advice1," While you may sometimes think that you are innocently expressing your opinion, understand that other people might take it as forceful or judgmental advice. It can be helpful to know the difference between expressing an opinion and being too opinionated so that you can avoid these situations.


An opinion is merely a belief or idea that is based on preference instead of hard fact. An example of an opinion is ""I'm not a fan of that television show. I don't think it is very funny.""
An opinionated person is very rigid about their opinions. Instead of expressing their preferences, they state their personal opinions as facts. They often do not allow others to express dissimilar opinions or ideas. They might become critical or judgmental. For example, an opinionated person might say, ""That TV show is so stupid. I can't imagine why anyone would want to watch it. The humor is so dumb. It must only appeal to a caveman."";
, Think about whether you want to help the person you have a desire to offer unsolicited advice. Although your motivation may be well intentioned, you should know that even advice coming from an altruistic place usually backfires. If you offer unsolicited advice for altruistic reasons, people may become defensive in order to maintain their personal freedom and life choices.For example, you may be worried about the health of a friend who smokes cigarettes. If you start offering them unsolicited advice about how to stop smoking, they may get defensive of their lifestyle. It won’t help that your advice is coming from a good place, since you are failing to respect their lifestyle and personal choices.

, If you are really excited about a new life hack or solution to something in your life, you may have a desire to share it with others. However, you should keep in mind that your friends, colleagues and family members may need to come up with their own solutions to life problems. It is probably better to keep your advice to yourself, unless they ask for it explicitly., It can be annoying to hear about the same problem from a friend or a colleague for years while having some resolutions in your mind.Although empathy and listening attentively is a lot of work, it is better to continue listening to the same old problems than to start offering unsolicited advice. You don’t know what situations may hinder your friend from taking the solution or advice you want to offer., If you have a desire to pontificate about particular subjects, try to remember this tendency and take note of its effects on others. You may notice that it doesn’t always have a great reception, in which case you may want to stop offering unwanted advice to people."
"
Listen with an open mind.,
Acknowledge what they are saying.,
Empathize instead of giving unsolicited advice.,
Ask if you have understood them correctly.",How to Stop Giving Unsolicited Advice2," If you are in a face to face conversation, face the person, maintain eye contact and listen with an open mind to what they are saying. Likewise, if you are on the phone, listen attentively with an open mind. Try to just comprehend what they are saying.If you are having a hard time concentrating, try repeating their words in your mind.Rather than going on to offer unsolicited advice, you should continue trying to understand their situation in greater depth through active listening. Only offer advice if they directly ask you for it., To assure them that you are actively listening to their story, you can nod your head in affirmation. You could also say, “uh huh.” Where appropriate, you can offer affirmations such as “thanks for sharing” or “that makes sense.”, If your intention is to make friends, perhaps you should try simply listening to the person. If you offer unsolicited advice, they may react negatively and it could defeat your purpose. Instead of offering advice, try listening and then making empathetic nods or making the following kinds of statements:“I understand, tell me more”
“That sounds hard, I’m sorry to hear you had that experience”

, After they have finished speaking, you could try making a comment or question for the purpose of recapping what they have said. This will ensure you have understood them correctly. Try recapping and then asking if your recap of their story is a correct interpretation:“What I understand from what you have just told me is that you feel terribly about what happened to John and you want to do something about it. Do I understand you correctly?”
“From what I understand, you really want to fix your relationship with Sue, which seems to have gone south since Christmas. And the issue seems to be partly the long distance but also these other things you were talking about. Am I getting this right?”

"
"
Stop trying to fix their problems.,
Try to understand their state of affairs.,
Ask how you can help.,
Give advice if they specifically ask for it.,
Talk to them if they are at risk of self harm.",How to Stop Giving Unsolicited Advice3," Consider dropping your own assessments of their problem and related ideas about how to fix things. Instead, consider ways you could be more empathetic. For instance, consider letting go of your desire to fix their problem and try to understand the details of their situation.You may not agree with their interpretation of their situation, but you should still listen attentively and try to understand them.

, Often, unsolicited advice comes from a place of not adequately understanding the situation or challenge that another person is going through.To move beyond this problem, you could try to understand and empathize with the challenge that they are going through. It might help to ask them clarifying questions:


“Can you tell me a little more about that?”
“That sounds really tough. I’m not sure I understand how you got into that situation. Can you remind me how that happened?”

, After listening attentively, you can ask them directly how you could help out. They may simply say that you are helping by offering an attentive ear. If they need something specific, they may tell you. If they are specifically looking for advice, they will have the opportunity to ask you for it. Try saying:“I’m here anytime you need me. Really, anything you need.”
“What can I do to help?”

, Advice that is specifically requested is much more appreciated than unsolicited advice. If you are called upon to give advice, you can go ahead and offer your two cents on how to resolve the situation. Give advice if they ask the following kinds of questions:""I really need advice on how to resolve this situation with my brother. I'm at a loss right now. Do you have any experience that would help?""
""Have you ever dealt with a family member dealing with depression? Do you have any advice based on that experience?""

, Rather than telling them specific things to do, you should convey your care for them and listen to their problems. You shouldn’t promise to keep any secrets, since you may have to convey the information to a mental health professional. Listen with attentive ears to everything they have to say and try to be there for them.If there is an emergency, you should call 911 and wait until help arrives.

To do so, especially in a business setting, it is important that you are clear on exactly what authority you do possess.If your powers and responsibilities have not been clearly defined, discuss the particulars of your authority with your boss. Having things specifically laid out for you may make it easier for you to accept and represent this authority.
Another benefit of conferring regularly with your boss is making sure that you are on the same page. Making a decision, only to be quickly contradicted or overruled by your supervisor, tends to diminish your appearance of authority.;
, While Machiavelli's advice that it is better to be feared than loved may be a bit extreme for a workplace setting, it is true that strong leaders tend not to worry too much about the popularity of their decisions. Having authority is not easy or fun; it is often hard work, but work that needs to be done — by you.Nobody wants to be hated, of course, but you’ll probably find that being direct, making the tough decisions, and doing what must be done will earn the respect of others. If you focus too much on trying to please everyone, you’re likely to sacrifice respect for the sake of some superficial likeability.Deep down, most people would probably rather follow someone they respect than someone they like.

, Some of the things you do to demonstrate your authority may actually be making you appear weaker. If you seem to be trying too hard to “show who’s boss,” you’re more likely to be mocked than respected.


Unless you’re a drill sergeant, getting angry and shouting are not usually the best ways to demonstrate your authority. Likewise, appearing defensive when questioned or challenged tends to indicate weakness, not strength.Some people think being authoritative means making snap decisions and sticking with them no matter what. In reality, taking the time (whenever possible) to think through a problem and making a calm, reasoned decision — and then sticking to it — demonstrates secure authority.To convince others of your authority, you have to convince yourself first. Once you embrace the authority you know you have, you won’t feel the need to try so hard to prove it to other people. Your confidence will speak for you., You may assume that donning a “power suit” or otherwise over-dressing for an occasion is the best way to appear authoritative. Quite often, however, this will be taken by others as another case of trying too hard.To appear authoritative, you want to act like you “have it all together,” and by the same token you should look “put together.” Choose a style of dress that generally approximates what those around you will be wearing, but with extra emphasis on a crisp, clean look. If “dress casual” is the norm, emphasize the “dress” part without abandoning the “casual.”
Your wardrobe need not be bland, but a more subdued color palette and styling may give you a bit more gravitas.

, To appear authoritative, you have to be noticed, and standing almost always makes you more noticeable. Standing makes it easier for you to command the spotlight, the stage, and the attention of those under your leadership.If you are looking for a way to gain more authority by appearing more authoritative at work, you may want to try standing at a meeting while others are sitting. This makes you more noticeable and commanding in appearance. See if you can arrive at the perfect time so that you aren’t late but there are no seats left.
Stand even while you’re talking on the phone. When you sit, you tend to talk in a more reserved, less enthusiastic (and commanding) voice. Standing tends to make you speak with more energy and urgency.

, Your mother may have told you it was good manners to look other people in the eyes while speaking to them, but it also helps attach an additional air of confidence to your words. Like an animal asserting authority in the wild, stand tall and directly face those whom you intend to lead.If you are giving a presentation, for example, assume the “power position” at the start — stand in front of the podium, directly facing the audience and making eye contact throughout the room. If you are going through slides, don’t get caught facing the screen or standing perpendicular to both screen and audience the whole time. Face the people and look at them whenever possible.
You don’t need to intensely stare at someone while speaking to him/her. But return your gaze regularly to the person, and try not to look down at all while talking.

, Being confident and sounding confident are not always one and the same. Some people may be bursting with confidence in their authority, and yet the way they speak gives away this entire advantage. Once you feel authoritative, make sure you sound that way as well.Don’t go to ridiculous lengths to deepen your voice, but adding just a bit more depth can help make what you say sound more authoritative.
Practice not allowing your voice to trail off at the end of a sentence. Some people tend to raise their voice inflection at the end of every sentence, making even declarative statements sound like questions. Don’t let it seem like you doubt what you’re saying., Some people feel like silence is a sign of weakness, and want to fill any gaps by talking. Prattling on, however, is more likely to be taken as a lack of seriousness or certainty. Taking time to think through what you want to say, and using pauses and silence for effect while speaking, helps to bestow authority to your speech.


Always think through what you want to say before speaking. Even when you’re “on the spot,” take a couple seconds to gather your thoughts before you begin. That small period of silence will demonstrate that you are serious about addressing the topic at hand and saying exactly what you mean.Practice getting rid of “fillers” like “um,” “uh,” “I think,” etc. Even if you aren’t using them because you’re uncertain of what you want to say, they tend to sound that way. A silent pause is preferable.
Use “chunking” while speaking — pause for effect between bursts of speech that each emphasize a key point. Give people a chance to soak in what you are saying., Making eye contact and facing the audience have already been mentioned in this article, but there are additional steps you can take to demonstrate command of the room when you are addressing a group of people. You want all eyes on you as much as possible.Walk around the stage or the part of the room you are occupying, as if you are marking it as your territory. You don’t need to stalk it like an animal, but walk and stand with confidence — as mentioned, it will be reflected in your voice.
Don’t be afraid of hand gestures either. Keeping your hands glued to the podium or clasped together may appear like fear or submission. No one needs to see you pound your shoe on the desk or anything of that sort, but some confident, deliberate gesturing will add weight to your words and your appearance.

, In addition to adding some depth to your voice, finishing off sentences properly, and eliminating “fillers,” you can also work to perfect the tone and pace of your speaking. Speaking too quickly, too softly, or without enthusiasm can all be remedied with practice, and give your words more authority in the process.You might feel silly reciting famous speeches from Shakespeare’s works in your bathroom mirror, but doing so can in fact be helpful. Think of yourself as a great actor on the stage, tackling Hamlet or Macbeth. Speaking with authority will come naturally.
More practically, you can practice the speech you’re going to give in a similar manner. Take note of your tone, pacing, volume, gesturing, and so on. Consider recording yourself so you can examine your practice run.

, All your efforts to appear more authoritative will likely fall short if you lack essential self-confidence. You have to believe you can wield authority, and deserve to have it, in order to express and use it effectively. While it is true that some people are naturally more confident than others, self-confidence is also a perspective that can be nurtured and developed.



How to Build Self Confidence offers an extensive list of ideas for becoming a more confident person. Its major subjects include:

Establishing a positive attitude.
Dealing with your emotions effectively.
Taking care of yourself — mind, body, and spirit.
Setting your goals.
Getting help when you need it.



, People with low self-confidence tend to compare themselves to unrealistic idealizations of others, and thereby find themselves always coming up short. Instead of holding yourself to impossible standards and focusing on your failures, work on training yourself to emphasize your successes. Focus on why you deserve to have authority.Keep an updated list of personal accomplishments and positive attributes if that helps. Take note of compliments and positive feedback from others (and take them seriously). Surround yourself with positive reinforcement.

, Looking authoritative and looking confident have many similarities, but you can’t really master the former without first nailing the latter. It may seem naive to think that looking confident can make you feel more confident, and yet it is true for many people.Practice good posture. Take your personal grooming and dressing routines seriously. Look in the mirror and see a confident person staring back at you.

, People who lack confidence avoid or run away from their fears; they try not to depart their comfort zones. Self-confident people learn to swim by jumping in the water, or deal with a fear of heights by skydiving. Get out of your comfort zone, and when you achieve success doing so, use it as evidence in your confidence-building process.Identify your goals, and establish a way to address them head-on. If you are afraid to speak up at meetings, draw up a list of potential questions or comments beforehand, and make yourself use at least one of them.

Remember that you are a leader, but not necessarily a dictator.",How to Lead a Successful Meeting," Never encroach upon the group members' personal times when setting a meeting date unless it is absolutely necessary or unavoidable. If members need to cancel their plans in order to make your meeting, they may end up harboring feelings of resentment. Pick a date that falls on a regular business day and make sure to give your group members a notice a few days ahead of time.;
, Your meetings should have an appointed starting time, an appointed ending time, and you should avoid overstepping these boundaries out of respect for the meeting members. Time is the most important factor when planning a meeting, as it gives you a foundation for planning the rest of the meeting details.

, Don't get sidetracked trying to deal with off-topic gripes and grievances.

, Meetings that don't have a set target goal will inevitable meander through many topics--often unrelated--and that may result in confused and bored members. If you don't have an ultimate goal, then there is a good chance that calling a meeting is unnecessary.

, You can ensure a successful group meeting by praising in public and criticizing in private. Public criticism tends to reduce overall group morale and can even cause rivalries or competition to form within the group. Instead, discuss the good things during a meeting and save the bad things for private 1-on-1 meetings.

, Group meetings are sometimes used to rally members of the group to agree on a certain decision. However, you should avoid doing this as it will reflect negatively on you, the leader. Excess peer pressure will also cause dissonance among the group.

, It's not uncommon for coworkers to become friends with other coworkers, but these friendships and relationships should temporarily be set aside during a meeting. Bias and favoritism will quickly dissolve a meeting's integrity, and group camaraderie may be damaged.

, For long-term success over multiple meetings, you want people to participate and speak up when appropriate. If you always override someone's suggestions or comments, over time they will find it futile and will cease speaking their mind. Allow people to be open and do your best to take their thoughts into consideration.

Make sure to leave enough time before the appointment to account for any mishaps that may come up., If you can group questions together that are about the same topic or uses the same website that will help with the flow of the meeting., If you have completed step 3 correctly then you should have plenty of time to get the appointment early. It's always best to arrive 15 minutes before your appointment. Many advisors have meetings right afterward so you don't want to cut down on your time to ask questions., It is always a great courtesy to greet someone with some quick small talk about their day or if they are feeling fine. This is a step that can be used on all human interactions, You should already have a good outline of the meeting.

It is better to write it down and ask it after so that you are not rude to your advisor and so you don’t miss out on the information that is being given now., After writing down your new questions, go ahead and ask them, but you do want to keep in mind of the time restraint. They most likely have a meeting afterward with a fellow student so you don’t want to cut into their time., When you feel satisfied with the information you have been given it is best to start progressing into some small talk where you can get their information and then finally say goodbye. A conversation should flow so when you progress to small talk it helps ease into goodbyes instead of a sudden stop to the meeting., It is best to review the new information you received from the advisor. This step is especially important for those who haven’t decided their major yet. Your advisor may give you some information about the choices you have that may require some research. Your advisor may also direct you towards other resources that they think you might like or that might benefit you., When your advisor gives you new information you will want to do more research.

Some even make it a priority of theirs to follow up with a student after their appointment."
"
Broaden your knowledge.,
Speak your mind, even if your opinion isn’t popular.,
Focus on your strengths.,
Draw on inner strength and faith in yourself during times of personal tragedy.,
Acknowledge your imperfections without fostering them.,
Learn from others, even if it means you must follow for a while.",How to Lead Like Thomas Jefferson," A polymath by nature and experience, Jefferson spoke five languages, and was passionately interested in philosophy, science, religion, architecture and invention. He was well read and always had a thirst for knowledge. Devote at least one part of your week to reading books, articles, journals, newspapers and other reputable sources of information in order to keep up with developments in your own field and beyond.


Never assume that you are ""above"" digesting popular information sources as well. A leader should know the pulse of what the majority of the public is thinking and following by way of trends, fads and curiosities. Knowing what matters to the people you lead (whether it's a team or a company) will always help you to tailor your ideas and visions to make them resonate with those you're guiding. Be curious and genuine in your desire to understand what moves people.
Claiming ""I cannot live without books"", Jefferson accumulated thousands of books for his library at Monticello. You may not have the space for thousands of books in your actual home but do make use of eReaders, iPads, laptops, etc. that allow you to download eBooks. You can access the majority of the classics for free in this form, and many other great books can be purchased and stored with ease this way. Just be sure to back it all up so that you don't lose your amazing collection.;
, Looking beyond the status quo for a better way of doing things and for ways to improve society as a whole may not be popular initially––resistance to change, however beneficial, is a human certainty. During Jefferson’s times, free America was not fully realized and many Americans did not fully grasp the concept of a completely free society. However, Jefferson turned his frustration into determined persistence and talked to anyone who would listen about his vision of a free U.S. He pushed and persuaded until his dream came to fruition.


Stick to your principles. Don’t allow others to influence or sway you from your original intent. For example, Jefferson believed that people should be able to practice any religion they wanted and that the press should be afforded certain freedoms. Today Americans are free from persecution to practice any religion they choose. Moreover, freedom of the press has continued to keep those in public office accountable to the people.

, There is much said and written about overcoming your weaknesses. While there is always room for tightening up aspects of yourself that aren't working the way you want them to, it is a fool's life to pursue anything that relies principally on your weaknesses. Realize that focusing all the time on weaknesses leaves less time to focus on strengths and in many cases, can cause you to feel ""less than"" rather than to celebrate what you're brilliant at. If you believe you're in a position that isn’t a good fit or you aren’t qualified enough, don’t bluff or “wing it.” Jefferson was made Secretary of State by George Washington and felt at odds with the job and others in the government. He decided to walk away from working in the government, reversing this decision later when he felt ready.

, Personal tragedy can derail even the most steadfast of leaders. Jefferson was no stranger to devastation and misfortune, losing his wife of eleven years, Martha, and seeing only two of his six children with her reach adulthood. However, he refused to allow the tragedy in his life to unhinge his focus and determination. While he grieved strongly after the death of his wife, he realized that he needed to forge on rather than give in to despair. When challenges face you, allow yourself the time to recover but do not wallow in sadness or disappointment for long; as a leader, you have gifts to share with other people who see you as a role model, guide and mentor.


Hold tightly to your goals by being a man or woman of purpose. In 1786, Jefferson wrote about his enthusiasm and passion for life, despite tragedies and disappointments: “Hence the inestimable value of intellectual pleasures... Ever in our power, always leading us to something new, never cloying, we ride, serene and sublime, above the concerns of this mortal world, contemplating truth and nature, matter and motion, the laws which bind up their existence, and the Eternal being who made and bound them up by these laws. Let this be our employ.”

, Even the greatest leader understands that he or she is not perfect. Although Jefferson is considered to be one of the country’s greatest leaders, his character is riddled with imperfection and inconsistency. For example, Jefferson is known to have had an affair with his slave Sally Hemings and fathered at least six of her children, an indiscretion he never denied. Moreover, many scholars find Jefferson to have been a dishonest man because he never owned certain high impact decisions he made in his life and although he proclaimed to believe in equality for all, his continued ownership of slaves was an inconsistent approach to what he preached. While Jefferson's attitude has a historical context, his documented attitude is something you can learn from so that you heed your own inconsistencies.


All human beings are inconsistent to a point, and yet we each need to acknowledge this rather than pretend it's not an issue. Moreover, much of what is inconsistent in us is a result of how we see ourselves at different points in time––and naturally, we change as we mature and age, usually for the better. A good leader will continue to learn and grow, will seek to be less defensive of his or her own ideas and be more open to the perspectives of others. Avoid getting stuck in time or stifling your growth as this is the surest way to stay inconsistent with both yourself and with changes around you; always be prepared to stay open-minded, especially when confronted by complex issues that require considerable thought.
Use your mistakes as a learning experience. If you don’t learn from your mistakes you cannot build and further your leadership. By acknowledging your errors and studying them, you can fortify your ability and credibility as a leader and avoid the same pitfalls and shortcomings in the future. Although it is widely know that Jefferson made many mistakes, future presidents turned to him for advice and lessons, well beyond his actual life.

, Great leaders learn skills by not just forging ahead without knowledge but by identifying mentors or guides, studying their strategies and molding their techniques to their advantage.


Stay aware throughout your life that you don’t always know everything, not even in your own field of expertise. Even seasoned leaders understand that always improving your knowledge is the real source of power––and that it is impossible to know everything. For example, during the creation of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was a junior member of the committee. He was charged with writing a draft, but knew that senior member John Adams had more knowledge and insight to write the draft (although Jefferson ultimately authored the document). He sought knowledge from Adams, even asking him to write it instead.
Gain motivation and insight from your mentors. Although Jefferson asked Adams to create the draft, it was Adams who provided Jefferson with the necessary motivation and encouragement, which led him to pen his draft. Adams pointed out Jefferson’s strengths, one being that he was a better writer. Sometimes it takes other people's observations of you to point out your strengths.

Know who is at your meeting.,
Practice active listening.,
Be punctual about start and finish times.,
Keep good records.,
Use good humor.,
Be considerate of other's commitments and expect them to be the same of yours.",How to Make Meetings More Productive," If you are chairing, knowing everyone's names it the most effective and personal manner for good interacting and keeping the participants under control. People like being referred to by name, simple fact!;
, The more you listen and the less you speak, the better. Not only do you set a prime example but you also encourage others to give their opinions uninterrupted.

, Everyone should know that you mean it when you say a meeting starts at one time and finishes at another. Make it a habit to not wait for late attendees. They will soon learn.

, Someone should be noting the decisions and major issues. This is for fast referral during the meeting so that things are slowed down by ""he said/she said"" arguments. Obviously also good for follow-up and great springboards for the next well-managed meeting.

, This makes meetings more interesting and helps to defuse possible negative conflicts. Make sure to let positive and constructive conflicts run their course, however; a good chair can use humor to aid this process.

, Always explain that a meeting should finish on time because everyone has other commitments and time is precious. Using an agenda is a vital part of ensuring the meeting runs as scheduled and allotting time spaces for each item of business is crucial; again, the chair must be considerate of the time allotted and keep to it as best as possible.

Gain the floor.,
Bring a motion.,
Bring the motion to debate.,
Give preference to the member proposing the motion.,
Follow rules for a civil debate on the subject under discussion.,
Amend the motion.,
Bring the motion to vote.",How to Learn Robert's Rules of Order1," Before a member speaks, he must be acknowledged by the chairperson. Depending upon your organization’s procedure, he should either raise his hand or standing and state “Mr./Madam Chairperson.” The member is not allowed to continue speaking until the chairperson has acknowledged him by name.


It is against procedure to begin speaking until the last speaker has finished his statement.;
, To bring a motion to consideration by the group, a member must be acknowledged by the chairperson. At which point, the speaker can say “I move that we (motion).” For the motion to be discussed another speaker must rise and say “I second that we (motion).”


The motion is some sort of substantive proposal that the organization is can enact. The debate should focus exclusively on whatever the current motion is.
For example, “I move that we pass the budget as is.”
Oftentimes, motions to be voted on will be set on a predetermined agenda. Robert’s Rules of Order, however, allow this agenda to be amended, by either adding motions, taking motions off the agenda, changing the order of the motions, or amending the motions., Debate over the motion does not begin until the chairperson restates the motion and asks “are you ready for the question?” If no one stands to discuss the motion, then it goes straight to vote., If debate over the motion ensues, the person who moved the motion has the first right to speak. Since it is his motion, he has the most direct knowledge of its intent and can explain it better than his peers., The rules are meant to ensure that all debate centers on the merits of the particular motion under discussion. Discussion of anything else can be ruled out of order.


All remarks should be directed at the chairperson. This is designed to prevent cross talk between the members that could escalate into a personal confrontation.You are not permitted to discuss personalities or motives. You should refrain from alluding to people by name or using language that is not courteous.
No member is permitted to speak twice until everyone else interested in speaking has spoken at least once.Ideally, debate should alternate between speakers who are pro and con.
Comments should be specifically directed at either a motion or the amendment, not both, so as to make the import of the comment clear., Anyone can ask to have the wording of the motion changed. To do this, he must be acknowledged by the chairperson. Then, they should stand and say “Madame Chair, I move that the motion be amended by adding the following words _________.” Another member must second, and then a majority vote can be held.


Alternatively, one can ask that “Madame Chair, I move that the motion be amended by striking the following words _________.” One can even ask to both add and subtract words for the motion: “Madame Chairperson, I move that the motion be amended by adding the following words ____________, and by striking the following words _________.”If the person who made the motion is friendly to the amendment, he can stand and ask to modify the motion, and no majority vote is required.If the motion is changed, the person who originally seconded it is entitled to withdraw support. At that point, it will be necessary to find another person to second the motion., After debate has slowed, the chairperson can stand and ask again “Are you ready for the question.” If no one stands to continue the debate, the chairperson will ask “As many as are in favor, say ‘Aye.’ Those opposed say ‘nay.” After counting votes, the chair will announce the results.


When the chair announces the results, she will either say “The ‘ayes’ have it, and (repeat the text of the motion)” or “The nays have it and the motion fails.”Alternatively, a member can call the motion to vote. Once being acknowledged, announce “I move the previous question.” The chair will call a vote. A 2/3rds majority is required to end the debate. At that point, a separate vote will be held on the motion."
"
Call point of personal privilege.,
Call point of order.,
Point of information.,
Refer to a committee.",How to Learn Robert's Rules of Order2," This can be used to interrupt a speaker if the member is having difficulty participating in the debate, particularly because it is too loud to hear the speaker or the person is uncomfortable with the temperature. A member does not need to be acknowledged to call point of privilege.Member should stand and announce “Point of Personal Privilege” After the chair asks the member to “State your point,” the member should indicate what his issue is., A point of order can be called when it is believed that the speaker is violating a rule. This can be used, for example, if the speaker is talking about something other than the motion at hand or is attacking individuals. The person calling a point of order does not need to be acknowledged by the chair.


The person calling point of order should stand and announce “I rise to a point of order.” After being acknowledged by the chair, he can explain his objection., This procedure allows someone, without acknowledgement of the chair, to stand and ask a question. The question should pertain to a fact relevant to the motion, like the amount of money in the budget.


Speaker should stand and announce, “point of information.”, If you believe that a matter needs further consideration and research before voting on it, you can ask to refer it to the committee. The committee is a smaller group that analyzes the motion in greater detail. Afterward the motion, or an amended motion, can be brought to the whole group for approval.


After being acknowledged, the speaker should announce “Madame Chair, I move that the question be referred to the committee made up of members ______, _______, _______, and _______.” If the committee has a formal name, you can also reference the name, like “finance committee.”"

Obtain a copy of Robert’s Rules of Order.,
Have all members review the rules.,
Elect an expert as chair.,
Practice.",How to Learn Robert's Rules of Order3," Robert’s Rules of Order are complex, and it can be difficult to memorize them all. Having a copy of the Rules available at meetings will allow an individual to look up any rules for which he needs clarification.The full text of older editions of the Rules are available for download on the internet. The current edition of the Rules, as well as other editions are available for purchase in book format.
The website for Robert’s Rules of Order also contains some quick summaries of the rules and treatments of specialized subjects., While the chairperson of the meeting bears much of the responsibility of running the meeting, Robert’s Rules of Order can only be effective if all members at the meeting are willing to follow the rules. Board meetings require multiple people to discuss ideas and proposals, and following the Rules allows for this discussion to flow in a courteous and respectful manner.


Members will also be disadvantaged in the discussion if they do not fully comprehend the rules. That is because there are many specialized maneuvers that speakers can use to their advantage in debates. There are so many of this, it can be hard for a novice to exert as much control over the debate as an expert.Circulate a summary of the basic rules to each member, and hold a meeting to discuss the rules and practice them. The Rules are fairly easy to understand, but putting them into practice while engaging in a thoughtful dialogue can take some work. It requires members to think about the Rules before speaking. The only way to get the Rules down is to practice them in a group setting.

, The chairperson will be responsible for moderating the debate and ensuring that rules are properly enforced. The chairperson might even be required to clarify and explain the rules to the members. It is, therefore, imperative that the chairperson be particularly knowledgeable of the rules., The only way to master the rules is to practice. After running many meetings under these rules, you should develop a good sense for how they work. You might even be able to find courses offered locally that will allow you to learn and practice procedures.

If it is too narrow an audience, you won’t find a market for the conference. If it is too broad, you run the risk of a bland theme that will not hold your attendees' interest. Think about the demographic qualities of your attendees, including age, income level, and location. Will attendees be from same organization or industry? Will they be executives, middle management, employees, or a mix? You cannot make proper plans if you do not know whom you are addressing or hoping to attract.;
, After you know who you are planning your conference for, you'll need to figure out how the conference will be set up. Will it be primarily speaking presentations, panels, interactive presentations, or a mix of those? Think about how many speakers or presenters you will have and how long presentations will be. These decisions should be tailored to the subject matter and to your audience.

, The theme will influence everything else, so you want to decide this issue first.Your theme should reflect the purpose of the conference. This lets attendees know exactly what they will be hearing, seeing, and doing there. Ask yourself:


Why would they want to come? Conferences are time consuming and expensive for attendees as well as hosts. There needs to be something you are offering at your conference that no one can get anywhere else.
Make your theme as specific as possible. The theme can be subject oriented or aimed at a demographic target. For instance, the ""Asian-American Law Enforcement Officers' Conference"" is a demographic target, while ""Marketing Manuscripts to Independent Publishers"" is a subject oriented theme.
For another example, the theme ""Awakening the Autism Entrepreneur Workshop"" tells a potential attendee everything they need to know about the conference.

, The scope of your conference will determine all of your logistical concerns, your choice of speakers, and even the location. Be realistic about the scope. You want it to be as narrow as possible while still having a robust market.


Think about the location of the target audience. If you have a possible market of 1000, but they are spread out on three continents, you’re going to struggle to get attendees.
How many would you like to attend? If this is your first conference, don’t try to plan a conference larger than 300-400 people. The learning curve is too steep.
Consider the geographical location of the probable attendees. Are they local, regional, or national? Consider and plan for possible transportation types used by attendees.
Will conference be single session, multiple sessions in a single day, or multiple days with overnight stays?

, Unless the event is local and limited to a few attendees, the person in change will need help. Build a project team with at least one member assigned to each area of conference planning. The areas to be considered are the agenda, speakers, logistics, budgets, accommodations, refreshments, marketing, and public relations. There may be other area specific to your conference as well.


While some items can be combined, a planning team usually consists of three to five people with additional staff as required by the scope of conference.

, Develop a budget and stick to it. Decide whether the goal is to break even or produce a profit, and then if there is a specific revenue target. Include elements of costs and revenues (attendance sales, underwriting guarantees, etc.) with a specific person on your project team being responsible for purchasing and contracting to avoid confusion. You will need to consider several factors, including:


Vendors, such as AV providers, hotels/convention centers, caterers, convention bureaus, transportation providers, and travel agencies. Get quotes from vendors in writing.Costs of speakers, including fees and expenses.
Costs for marketing and website development.Fees for event planners., Individuals on your project team should be responsible for specific areas of your conference preparations. Meet to clarify exactly what each member is responsible for and the powers they have (spending, decision-making, etc.). Make sure to address any overlaps in responsibility so that you can leave your project team to their preparations. Give them an easy way to contact you for clarification of any other issues they experience.

, Your project plan outlines the conference preparations, execution, and followup. Include schedules for meetings and guidelines for communication between project team members, both during preparations and after. Then, set up deadlines for conference preparation, such as when to lock in sponsors or speakers. Finally, set up a preliminary schedule for the event itself with dates and scheduled events.


The extent of your plan will depend on the scope of your conference. A small, short company event and multi-meeting, multi-day commercial event will require different amounts of planning.

, The last part of your project plan is the conference agenda. This is effectively the menu of the event, including the who, what, and where for every aspect of the conference. When creating it, you'll need to consider each segment of conference, the length of speeches, rest periods between them, break out sessions, and the possibility of multiple simultaneous sessions. This should also include refreshments or meals served to attendees and when they will be served.

, If you can find a sponsor for your conference, you can afford to set ticket prices at a level that just allows you to break even. That way, you can make your profit from the sponsorship.Seek out relevant sponsors for your conference. Look within the same industry or for a company that serves the audience that will be attending your conference.
Approach several sponsors. Many sponsors are willing to pay in order to get their message in front of a targeted audience, and all conferences are targeted to specific segments of the population.
Write a sponsorship prospectus which includes information about projected attendance and ticket sales, demographics of the the attendees, and the credentials of your firm. Package these details attractively, with color-coded graphs, charts, and photographs.
Be sure to also set out the terms of what the sponsor will provide, which might include funding, underwriting, or soliciting attendees for the conference.

, You want your ticket price to be high enough to make money (or at least break even), but low enough that it still entices people to come. Consider refreshment costs when setting your attendee fees. You should also think about setting early bird and late arrival rates as well.


Fees should be in line with purpose and likely attendees. An in-house conference usually has no fees, as expenses are paid by company.
A charitable event might have large fees for tax deductions or small to enhance attendance and spread the message.
If you're just starting a small conference, you can't count on employers paying the costs, so take that into account.
Research industry standards to learn about the cost of similar conferences.
Develop a fair but stringent cancellation policy can ensure that guests who have committed to showing up follow through.Make a portion of the ticket price non-refundable. Whether you call it a deposit or a cancellation fee, it helps make people who say they will attend actually attend. Just be sure to give very conspicuous notice—you don’t want an irate canceller to give you bad word of mouth.

, The speakers at a conference are, along with the location, the biggest draw. In terms of attendance, they can make or break the conference’s success. People don’t come for the catering, after all. When choosing speakers, consider the number of speakers, panel members, or hosts needed for conference. Think about what sort of credentials you are looking for, along with whether you want them to be internal or external to your company or industry.


There are dozens, if not hundreds of services that will find conference speakers for a fee, and even a few that will find speakers at no cost to the conference-holder. Speakermatch is one of the free services, and it operates like a cross between a matchmaking service and cars.com. You can search by price, locality, or subject. The speakers set their own fees, and some will even speak for no fee at all.
There are several other ways to find speakers. Check out youtube.com videos or question and answer sites like Quora in the subject you’re looking for, hold auditions, create an advisory board, or simply look at speakers at events in your industry.Set up a contract with the speaker, nothing their fee payment requirements (if applicable), deposit, cancellation terms, and a limit on reimbursed expenses.
If you can’t afford to pay speakers (but you want a speaker that demands payment), then suggest a revenue sharing agreement. If you make a profit, they get a portion of it.Think about the logistics for speakers, including transportation, hotel, meals, AV arrangements, and event participation besides their speech, as well as their potential participation in the promotion of the event.

, Next to the speaker, this is the most important aspect of drawing attendees. A lot of people try to go to conferences just because they’re in a fun or interesting locale. Think about company resources first, especially for company-specific events. The chosen location should be convenient to most attendees depending upon likely mode of travel.


Figure out the city right off the bat. Take your intended audience and the scope of the conference into account. A conference with a national draw or with a wealthier audience can afford more exotic locations. Regional conferences should pick more modest locations.
Nail down a specific venue after you’ve developed a budget and found some good speakers. The facilities themselves are probably the most important factor in choosing a venue. You’re going to want something large enough to hold the audience, with enough rooms to handle break-out groups. Hotels, convention centers, university facilities, and reception halls are the most likely suspects. An independent reception hall in a distinct location can really set your conference apart.Keep convenience and travel time in mind when selecting a venue. You don’t want the venue to be too far removed from the airport, or in a section of the city that is difficult to navigate on foot, since many attendees won’t want to rent a car.Consider parking and ancillary events, especially if attendees are traveling overnight from out of town.
In addition to the event venue, you need to find a good nearby bar (or three) where people can blow off steam, nice restaurants where you can entertain important guests, and lodging where you will put up the speakers., This should include all efforts to attract attendees, including formal and online invitations, web pages, newspaper and radio advertising, and guest interviews. Include a social media plan that covers Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter posts, and guest blogs.Aim to have vendors booked at least a month before the actual conference.
If this is your first conference, begin your marketing campaign early. An exciting marketing campaign can create a definite buzz around the conference, thereby boosting attendance.
Market to similar groups at similar conferences. Just like sponsors pay to get their message in front of targeted audiences, consider apportioning part of your budget to advertising at other conferences.
For more, see how to promote a conference.

, Your registration procedures should clearly outline how and when potential attendees can register and pay to attend the conference. If you're offering online registration, set up a website to receive registrants and their attendance fees. If registration is done through other means, make sure to outline the process for receiving and processing them.


You can also allow fees to be collected at the conference.
Craft a plan to send attendance reminders to attendees either through the mail or over email.
Ask registrants how they learned about the conference. The answer to this question will help you determine where to spend your marketing budget in the future.

, The support materials are the seemingly minor details that are, in reality, vital to your conference running smoothly.These include:


Registration and feedback forms, which are easily created in a word processing program.
Lanyards and nametags, which can be purchased at office supply stores, print shops, and screen printers.
Any speaker requirements as outlined in your contracts with them.
Seating charts for reserved seating.
Handouts,maps, and visitor’s guides, which can be created in-house or through a graphic designer, and printed at an office supply store or a local printshop.
Signage,which can be designed in-house or through a graphic designer, and can be printed at sign printing companies.
Sponsor’s items, which can be obtained from sponsors.

, A good staff is critical to executing a successful conference.You will need people to fill several roles, including:


A floor manager.This is your right hand, the person that makes sure that all the events are executed on-time. When the unexpected arises, you need to be confident in your floor manager to make good spur-of-the-moment decisions without close supervision.A Wi-Fi manager.This is just what it sounds like. Few things will anger conference attendees and speakers more quickly than a spotty Wi-Fi situation. Unless your conference is smaller than 100 people, the Wi-Fi manager should do nothing else.
A social media person, who keeps a flow of tweets, status updates, and posts going for the length of the conference.A doorperson.This can be the same person who conducts registration at a smaller conference. At a larger conference, it should probably be designated individual who is supervising the registrars.
Runners and MCs. A rule of thumb is one runner per 100 seats, and one MC per room.Either the day of the conference or the day before the conference, appoint a head volunteer with good organizational and people skills to assist with any unexpected issues., Make sure all of your team members are on the same page and prepared for the conference. Go over individual responsibilities for team members. Check that communication channels are ready and working. This meeting should occur in a meeting the evening before or the morning prior to the event.


Expect to stay busy. Make sure to keep your cellphone on and charged, because you're likely to be the recipient of frequent calls, texts, and emails. At the minimum, you'll be working 10-12 hours days for the duration of the conference.

, Consider the appropriate seating arrangement for the type of event. For example, you might have audience-style seating, a U-shape seating plan, or a standing crowd, depending on the type of event. Set up break rooms and dining areas for their intended purposes. Make sure there is adequate room in and between rooms for your crowd of attendees to move around.

, Make sure everything works by checking presentations on equipment. Resolve any issues you run into or have someone more tech-savvy do it for you. When you've done so, create a back-up plan in the event of equipment failure.

, Work with your caterer(s) to organize their schedule and responsibilities. These might include the set up of dining and refreshment areas as well as clean-up, particularly if there is a speaker presenting during the meal.

, Work with your security team to make sure your space is adequately protected and prepared for emergencies. Make sure protection is in place for property, attendees, and cash (if fees are taken at door). Consider potential protestors or demonstrations and make plans to ensure the safety of attendees. Have medical personnel on stand-by in case of a medical emergency.

, Right before the conference is set to begin, conduct a walk-through of the venue, making sure that any promised accessories and amenities are in working order.Take your staff to the walkthrough. They are going to be critical in successfully executing the plan.

, Happy, well rested presenters give good presentations that make your guests feel like they've gotten their money's worth. They are the stars of this show. Make them feel special, because they are.Take the speakers out for separate meals, engage them on a personal level. For example, you could say, ""I really enjoyed your talk this afternoon. How do you come up with those great interactive activities that you included?""
Make sure your speakers are completely satisfied with their accommodations.
You and your lead should be the point people for the speakers. If they have any problems at all during their stay, see to it personally that those problems are solved.

, Collect the comment cards and go over the guests' reactions and impressions.Specifically pay attention to their opinions on the content of the conference, including:


Did they learn valuable information? In the end, this is how attendees will justify the expense of the conference, and it will play a large part in determining whether they come back.
Did they enjoy the speakers? Speakers can be a big expense. You want to know how guest’s felt about the speakers because you need to determine whether to invite them back.
Did it meet expectations? This gets at their global impression of the conference, and allows them to suggest room for improvement.
Were the accommodations satisfactory? It helps you learn what to emphasize in a venue the next time—amenities, location, convenience—which helps you make adjustments for the future.

, This type of feedback can be less structured, as you have hopefully developed a good working relationship and developed a rapport with the speakers.Start off with a thank-you card. Hopefully you’ve already gotten a sense of their feelings about accommodations and the like, but get their feedback about the audience; whether they thought they were well matched to it, what they liked and didn’t like, how they might change their presentations and pitches down the line, and what you can do to make them more effective.Be sure to verbally follow-up if a problem arose during the speaker's presentation or event.

, Your staff can give you some of the most valuable feedback with respect to executive functions. Pay special attention to the staff's opinion on the adequacy of plans and the efficacy with which they were carried out.Ask the staff for input about what areas needed to be planned in more detail. This can include both logistical plans and training plans.
What aspects of the planning were satisfactory?
How well was the timeline followed? Your timeline helps give everyone an idea of not only what needs to happen and when, but which items are prerequisites for the later items. How well the timeline was followed is a good overall gauge of how well organized the conference as a whole was.
What changes needed to made in the future? This touches on planning, execution, and physical infrastructure.

, Once you've got input from all the stakeholders involved in the conference, you can synthesize the information. Use the synthesis to make your next conference more successful. Combine this information with your own documentation and comments on the conference planning and execution process.

Knowing who you want to network with beforehand will help you schedule your time and choose which sessions to attend., If you’re interested in meeting a specific speaker, email them or send them a message on social media letting them know you’re excited about their session. They’ll appreciate the gesture and you’ll make a connection with them before the conference even starts., Look online for a conference schedule and read through the different sessions and speakers. Choose sessions featuring speakers you want to network with or sessions that are focused on a hard skill that will make you better at your job., Look for a map of the venue online or reach out to conference organizers and ask for one. You’ll have limited time at the conference and you don’t want to waste any of it getting lost or asking for directions., Email the conference organizers and ask if there are any roles you can fill. Participating at the conference as a speaker or session facilitator will increase your visibility and help you network.Don’t commit to more than you can handle. If you volunteer to do too much, you’ll miss out on important parts of the conference that your company was counting on you to attend. Look at your schedule and allot a realistic amount of time to volunteering.

, Bring your laptop and phone charger so your electronics don’t die on you. Pack lots of business cards to hand out, along with any materials you might need to pitch a sale to prospective clients.Pack business casual clothes for the conference. Bring a couple pairs of slacks or some dressy skirts. Blazers, vests, and button-up shirts are also appropriate. Check the conference schedule to see if there are any formal events planned. If so, pack a suit or a nice dress., It may be tempting to stick together at a conference where you don’t know anyone else, but branch out and attend sessions on your own. Your company will benefit from the different perspectives you get from networking independently.If your coworkers are insistent about spending time together at the conference, make time each day to meet up and discuss what you’ve learned and who you’ve encountered. You could say to them: “I need to attend a session soon, but let’s meet up after and grab some dinner.”

, Get in touch with the people you reached out to before the conference and see if they want to get dinner or grab a drink. Use the face-to-face interaction to your advantage and give a friendly sales pitch.Don’t be pushy when you’re interacting with prospective clients. Conferences are a great place to attract new customers, but focus on laying the foundation for the relationship during your first meeting.
In your meeting you could say something like: “I think I have a few helpful suggestions for your marketing strategy. Feel free to reach out if you ever want to go over them together sometime!”

, Attend sessions hosted by speakers you want to meet and go up to them after and introduce yourself. Speakers are usually industry experts, and attending one of their sessions is an easy way to get your foot in the door with them.Don’t be nervous about approaching a speaker. Go up to them and say something along the lines of: “I really enjoyed your presentation. I’m definitely going to take some of the points you made back to my team. I’d love to chat about these things further if you’ve got some free time.”

, Don’t limit yourself to the strictly-business portions of the conference. You’ll have an easier time networking in a casual social environment where everyone is more relaxed.Watch your alcohol consumption at social events. Having a drink or two is fine, but avoid getting visibly intoxicated. You don’t want to scare off potential clients or contacts.

, Take detailed notes during each session you attend. Write down the name and job title of whoever you meet and note whatever you discussed. You can reference these notes later when you follow up with them.Keep your notes organized so you can make sense of them after the conference. Use whatever note taking method works best for you.
Write down three key takeaways from each session you attend so you can reference them later when you’re going over the conference with your colleagues., Use them to make a detailed report of your conference experience. Transfer the notes you took on prospective clients and individuals you networked with into your customer relationship management system. Decide how to move forward based on the information you gathered., Reach out during the first few days after the conference so people still remember you. If you promised someone at the conference you’d send them more information about your company, send it.Use the notes you took to reconnect with people more thoughtfully. For example, in a followup email, you could write “Hi John, I enjoyed meeting you and discussing your marketing needs. Here’s a sample of that content I was telling you we offer.”

, Use the notes you took to share your top insights from the conference. Connect members of your team with some of the people you networked with.Summarize what you learned in an email and send it off to the other members of your team. If you have a lot of information to share, organize an in-person presentation where you can go over everything."

Listen, but do not encourage.,
Redirect the topic of conversation.,
Let your body language send a message.,
Be firm with a chronic interrupter.,
Pull the person aside and call out the behavior.,
Emphasize that everyone’s participation is a requirement.,
Start by asking feedback from someone else.,
Go around the room with timed comments.,
Check in with the person outside of meetings.,
Set clear ground rules.,
Stick to an agenda.,
Split off into groups, placing high-verbal individuals together.,
Have the group evaluate the effectiveness of your meetings.",How to Deal with Someone Who Talks Too Much in Meetings," Maintain a neutral and level expression to the person who is talking. If you are trying to redirect the conversation, avoid any positive or negative responses, such as smiling or eye-rolling while the person is speaking, as either could make them want to go on more. Also, avoid interrupting, as that will likely make the person go on longer.This approach works best if you are a peer of the person or in a non-leadership role.;
, Pay a compliment to the person who is speaking, but then change the topic to keep the conversation going in a different way. This way you gratify the person, yet take the opportunity to get the meeting back on track.


For instance, you could say, “Thanks, Tyler. I like that idea. Mary, do you have any ideas on how to increase fourth quarter revenue?” Acknowledging the person who is speaking too long tells them to relinquish the floor in a gentle way, and then gives someone else the chance to speak., Since everyone has the right to express their ideas in a meeting, be courteous, even to a dominator. Keep eye contact with the person who is talking and give an encouraging nod here and there when you want the person to keep talking. But, when it is time for them to stop, send a clear message with your body language.


You can do this by orienting away from them to someone else, crossing your arms and/or legs, and acknowledging the next person by making contact. If you are in a supervisory role, getting up and walking around the table can help signify a change of pace and let the person know it is time to move on to someone else.This is a good option if you are running the meeting or if you are the person’s supervisor or manager.

, Some people--whether consciously or subconsciously--think they should always be talking. This becomes a problem when they shouldn't be. Perhaps you're sharing your ideas and they butt in with their own. If this happens, there are ways of dealing with a person who rudely interrupts when you are talking in meetings.Ask to finish. True enough, you shouldn't have to ask to finish talking when you have the full attention of all but one person. But, doing this firmly can help the interrupter remember that you were, indeed, talking and you'd like to complete your thought. Say, ""Hey, Randy, I wasn't finished. Can you hold your comments for a second?""
Keep talking as if you did not notice their attempt to butt in. Although this could lead to a confusing moment of both of you talking at once, the other person will probably recognize that you won't be handing the floor over to them. Hopefully, they'll relent.

, Tell the person directly that they overtake the meetings and don’t allow others to speak. Do this gently, while making sure they understand that dominating is not okay. For example, you could say, “You are very involved and knowledgeable about this topic, but it is important that other people also feel free to make their contributions. Plus, if you are providing all of the information, other people are going to have a hard time participating.” Saying this offers encouragement, but also gets the point across.

, Tell your co-workers that their opinions matter, too, by getting everyone involved. This can be as simple as going around the table and asking each person what they think about a certain topic.Getting them involved too, instead of just letting one person dominate the meeting, will encourage them to speak up and not allow someone to take the floor the entire time.
You can simply say, ""In our office, all opinions are valued. So, everyone deserves an opportunity to speak. Those of you who are timid will need to assert yourselves, and those of you who do all the talking need to start sharing the floor.""

, If you know that a person has a tendency to go on and on, save their feedback for last. Ask another person their take on the topic at hand instead. Then, keep going around the table until the people who don’t usually get an opportunity to speak actually do.Ramblers may want to interrupt, but if they do just hold up a finger and say “Everyone will have a chance to speak, Ricky...Go on, Meredith.”

, Determine a set time limit for each person and set a timer. Doing so helps you to keep the meeting on schedule and may prevent it from taking too long. It can also prevent one person from rambling on and on and taking over the entire meeting.


Let everyone know what the time limit is a few days ahead of the meeting if they will be expected to develop presentations, or inform them at the beginning of the meeting of their allotted time., Approach the person during a meeting break or after the meeting to talk about their ideas. This allows the person to share anything that is important without commanding an entire group.


For instance, say, “My goodness, Charles, I’ve never seen you so attentive in a meeting before. I bet you took a lot of great notes to put into practice. If you have some more ideas you’d like to discuss, you’re welcome to come by my office hours.”
This gives them positive reinforcement, and lets them know that you would like them to listen to ideas, instead of perhaps always presenting them. And, if they do happen to have ideas to share, there are other outlets to do them that don't involve commanding meetings., Begin the meeting by letting everyone know what you are discussing, what the purpose of getting together is, and how long the meeting will last.


Starting the meeting by setting these rules can help the meeting run as it is supposed to. It may prevent your team from getting off topic, and encourage them to work together to come up with ideas.Say something like “Hey, everyone, I’m sure you all have much to discuss, but this will be a short meeting today. The topic of focus is the annual charity event. Let’s stick to that so we can make some progress.”

, Create a schedule that includes topic of conversation, as well as time limits for each person. Creating these rules not only keeps the meeting on schedule, but it can also prevent people from talking for too long and dominating the meeting. Assign a timekeeper to ensure no one goes over their time limits., Stick the people who like to dominate meetings together in a small group while the others meet in another group. Doing so allows the people who don’t get a chance to speak up the opportunity to have their voices heard.


Stop the groups after about 10 minutes to limit their time talking and to show that you don’t need massive amounts of time to come up with a solution., Ask your co-workers what they thought of the meeting. They can either write their opinions down on paper, or speak with you directly about their opinions regarding the meeting. This gives you the opportunity to ask the others what they feel about the person in question, if need be."

Determine your audit opinion.,
Submit your signed document.",How to Audit," It needs to be certain that any auditor is absolutely objective in their assessment. Therefore, it is required that the auditor be completely independent from the company. This means that the auditor can have no relationship with the company outside of the audit. This includes that the auditor(s):


Not hold any interest in the company (not own any of the company's stock or bond offerings)
Not work for the company in any other capacity.
Be rotated regularly during the audit process to get fresh opinions on the material.;
, Before entering into the audit process, the auditor or auditing team should analyze the company and assess the scope of the work. This includes an estimate of how many team members should work on the audit and how long it will take. Additionally, it includes an assessment of any special or work-intensive investigations that must be made during the audit. Figuring this out can help the auditor assemble a team, if necessary, and can provide the company being audited with a timeframe for the process.

, Before beginning the audit, the auditor should use their past experience and industry knowledge to attempt to predict areas where the company may have misstated financial information. This will require an in-depth knowledge of both the company and its current operating environment. Obviously, this is a very subjective assessment, so the auditor will have to rely on their own judgment., Once preliminary assessments have been made, you will need to create a plan to carry out the audit. Lay out all of the different actions that need to be taken, including areas that you think may be of the most interest. Assign team members to each task, if applicable. Then, create a timeline for when each action needs to be completed. Know that this timeline may be changed significantly throughout the auditing process in response to new information., You will need to give the organization being audited plenty of time for them to get their records ready. Tell them the time period to be audited (the fiscal year, for example), and a list of documents that they need to have ready for review. These include:Bank statements for the year being audited
Bank account reconciliation reports. This is where bank statements were compared to cash receipts and disbursements.
Check register for the time period being audited
Canceled checks
A list of transactions that were posted to the general ledger (a manual or online system that tracks a company's transactions, including income and expenditures).
Check request and reimbursement forms, including receipts and invoices for all expenditures
Deposit receipts
The annual budget and monthly treasurer reports

, If they can be substantiated, all the better. However, as an external auditor, that's not in your scope of influence. You just need to make sure everything was posted to the proper account.


For example, there may be two different Accounts Payable, one for raw materials and one for office supplies.

, This means they were entered into the correct accounts and ledger line in the general ledger. Very basically, these would be accounts receivables, but they should be further broken down (or could be) into specific receivables, depending upon the complexity of the organization.


For example, revenue from the sale of a product would be entered into accounts receivable, while dividends issued might be entered into Retained Earnings., These include balance sheets and income statements for the time period being audited. Ensure that all transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in the general ledger. Any unusual deposits or withdrawals must be noted and ensured that they were properly accounted for and legitimate. Check that all these accounts were reconciled monthly.


An unusual deposit might be a very large amount or one from a business located outside the country. Unusual withdrawals would be if substantial amounts of money are going to one person or business over a long period of time.
Reconciling means comparing two different reports or documentation. For example, cash and investments are compared to bank and brokerage firms' statements. Additionally, receivable and payable accounts should be compared to customer orders and bills, respectively. For inventory, a physical count and valuation can be done at least once a year to make sure the information in the general ledger is accurate.
For reconciliation, the auditor doesn't need to look at every single transaction. Taking a statistical sample of the total number of transactions (analyzing a small number and applying the percentage error to the whole set) can provide similar results in a shorter time.

, If you are auditing a non-profit organization, verify their 501 tax-exempt status and that the proper forms have been filed. Ensure federal and state taxes returns, incorporation renewal and state sales tax forms, example, have been filed as necessary., Make sure that what was reported was recorded and the totals from report to ledger books match accurately. Check to see that an annual treasurer's report was prepared and filed., This is a summary of all the activity for the period (usually annually, but could be quarterly as well). This includes:The cash balance at the beginning of the period
All of the receipts during that time
Any and all of the payouts during that time
The cash at the end of the period

, Make sure to especially note when improprieties exist. If you are asked to do so, assess the organization's performance against their budget or other metrics.


For example, you may want to suggest that two people sign every check, not just one. There may be documents that are disposed of at the end of the year, when they should be saved for a longer time period for tax purposes. Point out that originals need to be saved, not copies. Define the time period that all emails should be saved, usually for 7 years.

, At the conclusion of the audit, the auditor must draft an audit opinion. This document states whether or not the financial information provided by the company is free of error and reported correctly under generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) standards. Whether or not the reports meet these criteria is up to the judgment of the auditor. If they are reported correctly and free or error, the auditor issues a clean opinion. If not, the auditor issues a modified opinion. Modified opinions are also used if the auditor feels as though they were unable to issue a complete audit (for any reason)., This is a statement that you have completed the audit and you have found that either the ledgers are accurate or that there are issues. If you found any issues, such as missing checks or receipts (without explanation) or otherwise a math discrepancy, you should point those out in the report. It is also helpful to include any information you deem appropriate to assist in fixing those issues or preventing their recurrence for the next audit period."

Show up on time. Workplace perception matters. If you show up to meetings 15 minutes early, people will assume that you lack productivity or are using the meeting to take time away from other tasks.Have a copy of the agenda on hand. While most things are digital these days, sometimes the best thing to do is print off a copy of the agenda so you can take quick notes as needed.;
, This means taking steps to ensure all agenda business is resolved and all voices are heard. Below are suggestions to assist with this:Do roll call. Meetings are a means of efficiently disseminating information to a group and also permitting discussion to ensure all persons understand their role in the expected outcomes.Doing roll call ensures that you know who is not in the meeting so they can be approached later and filled in. It also demonstrates that you are serious about the information in the meeting.
Review the agenda. This helps participants focus their attention and understand what will be required of them. Many people attend meetings one after the other and providing an advance organizer can be helpful to focus.

, An action plan is an ending summary that confirms what actions must follow the meeting. It also presents a plan for going forward that impacts all meeting members. Below are some suggestions for creating an action plan:


Ensure every objective has a “point person”: The point person is not expected to complete the objective personally; instead, they function as a project manager who connects the people who need to be involved and makes the necessary resources available.Assign progress reports: These can be formal or informal, but the idea is that the person on point knows to check in after a certain period of time to confirm progress on deliverables.

, After each agenda item and its corresponding discussion, briefly summarize outcomes per the group discussion, ask for questions and move on.

, By scheduling a meeting while you have everyone present, it ensures that they can respond immediately with schedule conflicts. Additionally, it also means that your meeting will be scheduled as far in advance as possible, preventing conflicts with other meetings.


Collect agenda items via email. When the meeting ends, indicate that you will use the current agenda as a draft for the next meeting and encourage meeting attendees to send agenda items to you that are pertinent to existing objectives.

, This role typically falls to managers; however, a great way to create leadership opportunities for up and coming team members is assigning them to the role of chairing departmental meetings., Speakers are typically the point personnel for individual objectives. They have been organizing people and resources to get the job done and can describe the process and outcomes most effectively. They can also voice concerns over unanticipated difficulties and the need for more resources.

, Schedule meetings to accommodate availability and realistic limitations. For example, while everyone may be available late-afternoon on a Friday, it may not be the best time to discuss challenging issues.


If not everyone can make the meeting, assess who the key players are for the project, ensuring the meeting matches their respective schedules.
Delegate note-taking and ensure the meeting details are disseminated to those who could not attend., An agenda should, at minimum, set a topic list, delegate presentation duties, and set the time devoted to each agenda item. Below are some helpful suggestions for crafting a meeting agenda:


Ask for suggestions. Email is a good source for this, because you can get requests in writing. Accept agenda suggestions up to two days before the meeting.
Summarize all agenda requests into an a table with columns for topic, speaker, and time allotted. If certain requests are afield of the general theme, contact the person and suggest the request be turned into a separate memo, or discussed at a future meeting.
Be realistic. Don’t try to cram 30 minutes worth of description and discussion into 15 minutes. Instead, over schedule time for meetings and end early if necessary.

, This doesn't have to be formal or punitive but it's helpful to suggest protocol to ensure the meeting goes smoothly and everyone gets to share their insights.


This can be done at the beginning of the meeting. Simply state ""In the interest of time, hold questions and comments until after each speaker has presented. If we don't get to your comment during the allotted discussion time, email me later and we can talk.""

, As part of your agenda, include how long the meeting will last as well as indicators for how long individuals speakers will talk, and how long there will be general discussion following each agenda point.


This gives participants a sense of timing when they contribute and can reducing rambling or extraneous discussion points.
A good rule of thumb is to budget at least 10 minutes after each talking point for discussion.

, The day before the meeting, circulate the meeting agenda. This ensures everyone has a copy, and is prepared for what to expect from the meeting itself. This also gives them the opportunity to approach you if there is incorrect information in the agenda.

, If this is a new or infrequent meeting, send out a reminder one hour before the meeting to remind everyone to attend.

, Take responsibility for communication in the meeting. Ensure it meets all agenda objectives. Delegate relevant leadership responsibilities to speakers who have a role in the meeting. Demonstrate participation in all stages of the discussion., If this meeting addresses an ongoing series of objectives, mention where progress has occurred and who was responsible for it.If there are objectives that had not progressed since the last meeting, address why.
If this is due to lack of time or resources, talk to the point person about how to address this, potentially outside the meeting itself.

, There are times when enthusiasm or frustration can push discussions off course. Stay attentive and be sure to bring off-point discussion back into line with the goals of the agenda.Below are some suggested approaches:


Frame the meeting as a ""fact gathering mission"": When we do this, it implies that everyone needs to be heard in order to accumulate as much information as possible. This can encourage meeting monopolizers to wait their turn.Try Cyberstorming: Cyberstorming uses electronic chat or forum structure to share ideas and can be harnessed for the purpose of informal meetings. Since everything that is entered can be seen by all other team members, it removes the competition regarding who gets heard.Neutralize rambling: If someone is rambling, say ""That's a good point, Bob, and I'm glad you brought it up. Let's talk about that later, ok."" Many times people don't realize that they are rambling, but if the point is important enough to them, they will come to you independently to talk at greater length.Control tangents: Sometimes the problem is not that an individual goes on too long but that they attempt to re-focus the discussion on extraneous point outside the agenda. When this happens, acknowledge what is being said and offer to add the discussion points to the next meeting agenda, but remain firm that the meeting has to move on to the stated objectives.Have a one-on-one. Have a conversation with the monopolizer about what happened. Do this privately. Be sure to take a tone of concern, rather than annoyance. Be sure to focus on what you observed and offer opportunity for the other person to explain their response. Offer to help this person prevent monopolizing in the future.

, Be assertive when maintaining time constraints. This doesn’t mean be rude; however, it does mean letting people know that the meeting is moving on and that they can continue their current discussion with relevant parties after the meeting.


Don't steam roll: Although it is important to keep the meeting on track, it can be counterproductive to more too quickly between agenda items. Before moving on, always ask for questions or concerns. Make sure that the team is on board and ready to move ahead with you, rather than being left behind., Key objectives need to be emphasized, and their relationship to less critical objectives emphasizes.


Help members of the meeting understand the scope of the project and how each individual part is an important piece in a much more important whole.

, There is usually someone tasked with note taking in each meeting; however, if they become overwhelmed, it is the job of the leader to step in and task him or herself.

, At the end of each point, the meeting leader offers a summary that attendees can take away from the meeting. These end cap summaries also present an opportunity for people to chime in when they are unclear on something.


As the meeting leader, be prepared to explain detailed ideas for team members to understand.

, Decisive leadership avoids stagnation and vacillation, keeping workers on task and motivated, while also behaving responsively to change and new information. Below are the features of decisive leadership:Clarity of purpose: Ensures alignment of all decisions with organizational goals and ethics.
Engagement: Allows leaders to live by example, embodying engagement with company values that allows for effective, efficient decision making.
Transparency: Does not permit self-interest. Instead, demonstrates how decisions for the good of the company help everyone flourish.
Creating a culture of honest failure: Honest failures are learning points that act as springboards to better decision making. Decisive leadership embraces those times when mistakes are made.
Open and effective communication: Alignment with company values ensures that, where communicating upward into senior management or down the hierarchy to managed employees, there is no inconsistency or contradiction.

Look up your state's laws, or call your county clerk for more information. Some states require minister licensing, which is the process of registering as clergy with the state. Here are some general guidelines:


The legality of online ordination has been the subject of recent court cases in a variety of states. Laws regarding this issue are constantly evolving, so it's important to have up-to-the minute information about whether you'll be able to legally perform different ceremonies where you live.
Organizations such as prisons and hospitals that allow outside ministers to visit and minister to their clients, inmates, and patients have the right to refuse recognition to certain ministers. Many federal institutions, especially those addressing the needs of veterans and the military, do not recognize online ordinations no matter how legal they may be.;
, If you aren't already a member of a church, this isn't something to worry about. However, if you are a member of a church, getting ordained online could affect your standing. If you want to perform a wedding for a friend but you already belong to a different religion, investigate whether becoming ordained online could get you excommunicated.


Some churches, such as the Catholic Church and the LDS Church, may consider becoming a minister in another religion apostasy, and grounds for immediate excommunication.
If you're unsure, ask your local clergy for guidance.

, Getting ordained online offers an alternative to traditional ordination routes. If you feel you've been called to serve as a minister, you might find it more fulfilling to undergo formal training. That being said, attending seminary school does require time and money. Getting ordained online tends to be relatively inexpensive, and will allow you to perform weddings and other ceremonies. However, you won't be eligible to serve as a pastor in a traditional church. If this is your goal, consider looking into seminary programs that may better suit your needs.


If you want to open your own church or missionary service, you're still better off attending seminary than getting an online ordination. In most cases, online ordination won't provide you with the religious education you'll need to be successful.
Some online churches are non-denominational and open to people of any faith. If you are actively involved in another religion, be sure to check that becoming a non-denominational minister will not affect your standing in your religion.

, Do some research to find an online ministry you can see yourself joining. Some organizations simply send you ordination papers, while, others provide training as to how to perform weddings and other ceremonies. Make sure that whatever you choose is an incorporated and legitimate service.Some sites are quite religious, while others are purposely unaffiliated with any particular religion.
Choose a service that will send you a hard copy of your credentials, with an original signature and a seal. Additionally, find out if they'll send a letter of good standing or a wallet card. Free ordinations will usually provide a certificate to be printed from your browser. A higher-quality version, often with a gold seal will normally have to be ordered for a nominal fee.
Don’t be fooled by sites that say a church must be a tax-exempt organization to be valid. This is not true. It is totally up to the organization to decide if they wish to apply to the IRS for tax-exempt status. Some organizations choose to keep government out of religion through the payment of taxes.

, If you'd like to find out more information about the process, as well as whether your ordination will be sufficient to perform any ceremonies you're interested in doing, contact the ministry. While you're at it, you can ask if they know anything about acting as a minster in your particular state.


Avoid organizations that do not list their contact information on their site or do not respond to your attempts to contact them.
Know that your ordination may or may not allow you to perform weddings in your state. You must check the state requirements by calling the clerk in the county in which the wedding is going to be performed.
Find out about renewal fees. Some ministries will ordain you for life, while others will only ordain you for a year.

, Most online ordination services require you to fill out a short form with your personal information. Every church has different requirements for the ordination process, but most require the following:


Full legal name
Mailing address
Valid email address
A fee, usually about $50.00

, After you submit your information and pay for the services you requested, all you have to do is wait to receive your paperwork. Processing your request should take no more than two weeks. If you still have not received your official certificate and letter of good standing by then, contact the ministry.

If dialogue has begun to drift, you could say: ""But how does this affect the issue we are discussing today?"",
Have a plan for difficult situations and diffuse them.,
Answer and redirect questions.,
Summarize and simplify findings.,
Ask how the meeting went when it concludes.",How to Facilitate a Meeting," While a facilitator should blend into meetings and make their job look easy, it is crucial that they prepare extensively for meetings. Start with writing an Agenda. A good agenda will include key points about the meeting as well as provide adequate detail so that attendees know where to be and what to expect.Note the start and end times of sessions, as well as realistic time limits for each session, to ensure that the meeting will run on time.
Select topics that impact upon everyone attending the meeting. Try to get input from those attending the meeting about the topics that warrant discussion.
Try posing the topics as questions that need answering to stimulate dialogue in the meeting.
Note what the purpose of discussion is. Is it for information, to solve a problem, or to make a decision?
Specify how attendees should prepare for the meeting.;
, This requires a delicate balance. If there are too few or too many people in attendance you run the risk of an unproductive meeting. You will want to invite only people who will help you reach the goal of the meeting.Ask yourself the following.


Who are the key decision makers on the issue?
Who is most knowledgable about the information being discussed?
Who has a vested interest in the topics?
Who will have to implement any decisions that are made?
Some experts suggest 8 people be invited to meetings where a decision needs to be made. By contrast, they suggest 18 people when the purpose of the meeting is to brainstorm.

, Sending an email is the easiest way to invite your attendees. Your email should provide a brief introduction to the meeting. It should also include the date, time, and possibly an RSVP deadline. The agenda should be attached to the email.


Requiring an RSVP is optional, but it will allow you to prepare a proper amount of materials for all participants.

, By reflecting on what a facilitator does during a meeting, you will be in a good position to know what is expected of you when it is your turn to perform the job. A good facilitator will have a number of traits that helps him or her manage time, people and different opinions. It is best to develop these traits early.Value people and their ideas. A good facilitator will insert his or her own complements after an attendee has presented an idea. Say something like ""thank you Samantha, those are very useful points that help us think about the issue in a different way."" By doing this, you will not only ensure that each person and idea is heard, but that others will be confident about speaking up.
Be able to think on your toes. You will have to respond to a number of different situations during meetings. You need to think and respond quickly to these different situations. For example, if someone provides meaningful advice be quick to praise them and immediately look for another attendee who is seeking to build on that line of thought. If someone raises a bad point that is off topic however, do your best to highlight the good in the comment and search for another attendee who will build on what you thought was good.
Be well spoken. It is important that everyone in the room understand you. You will want to speak in a reasonable volume so that everyone can hear; do not mutter or mumble! Use jargon only if everyone at the meeting is familiar with the terminology.

, You'll need to consider if the meeting is going to be face to face, a virtual meeting through screens, or a combination of the two. Depending on the meeting format, you will need to make sure that all the furniture and hardware are in place, including chairs, tables, and projector screens. There are several possible ways to set up furniture for a meeting.A round table set up will help for discussion orientated meetings.
A setting with chairs in rows is good for establishing a speaker as the main focus. This set up works well when the main purpose is imparting information rather than discussion.
A theater setup features a table at the front of the room and allows for a panel of speakers to sit up front. Attendees will sit in rows in front of the panel speakers in a lecture format.
A classroom setup has tables in front of the rows of chairs to allow attendees to take notes while the speaker remains the focus of the meeting.
Utilize the U-shaped set-up for meetings where you want the participants to see each other and interact when needed.
Set up chairs in a circle with you in the center for meetings intended as open and participatory.

, A fully-prepared facilitator will provide attendees with pens, notepads, workbooks, handouts and other tools needed for the meeting. Also consider if you will need to provide any log-in information ahead of time for virtual meetings. There should be a board set up to enable people and presenters to take notes for everyone to view, perhaps a flip chart or white board. This keeps the meeting flowing more smoothly, allowing participants to have their questions answered at specified times during the meeting.


Depending on the length of the meeting, think about providing your participants with beverages (coffee), snacks, water and/or candy.

, People are busy, and without reminders, it is possible that they will forget about an upcoming meeting. Try to send out reminders to those who will be attending two days before the meeting is scheduled to take place.


If you asked invitees to RSVP, you can send a reminder that they need to RSVP before the deadline.
In your reminder email be sure to ask if anyone has changed plans.

, As the facilitator you should be there to greet everyone who arrives at the meeting. Either shake their hand as they walk into the room or greet them as they log in to the tele-conference. This will create a warm environment at the meeting while also showing that you are serious and ready to discuss.

, While everyone in the meeting will have received the agenda, by re-introducing the objectives all attendees will begin on the same page. It will also help to set the tone for the meeting and put people on the right track immediately.You can also make housekeeping announcements at the start of the meeting, including information about break times, fire exits and restroom locations.
You may also think about establishing rules for interaction depending upon who is attending the meeting. Rules could include show one another mutual respect, staying on topic, attacking the problem rather than the person, bringing closure to discussion, and not interrupting others., Everyone has a different method to guiding a meeting and keeping speakers on topic. One vital method is to make sure that conversation and discussion is not dominated by one or two people. Ensure that you are on the lookout for anyone who may want to make a point and allow them to speak by asking them their thoughts.Say a colleague names Samantha looks interested but has yet to contribute. You may try saying: ""Samantha, how does the issue at hand affect your department and you specifically?""

, The facilitator’s job is to keep all attendees or speakers on topic. Allowing off-target tangents with throw your schedule off and may mean that the meeting will not reach its intended outcome. If you sense discussion moving off topic, redirect the conversation by asking question that directly relate to the topic., Or, ""these are all very interesting points. We should discuss these at a later date but for now let's focus on the issue at hand.""


You may also want to flag the ideas being discussed for a later meeting so as not to offend the attendees.

, If you sense to participants are on the verge of getting into a heated debate, bring in another person to speak to the issue. Essentially, you will want to diffuse a debate by bringing in more dialogue. In the event of a conflict, you can also listen to both sides and identify common ground to bring the opposing parties together.


In the event of a difficult situation, you could say: ""it is clear that you are both coming from different sides. However, you obviously agree on the importance of this issue so let's try to focus our energy on finding a mutually beneficial result.""

, As the facilitator you can take questions from attendees so long as you are in a position to respond accurately. If not, you should refer the question to someone at the meeting who is in a better position to respond accurately.In the event you do not know the answer to a question, you may say: ""that's an excellent question, I think Samantha is better informed on this topic however. Samantha, what are your thoughts?""

, Take notes during the meeting and ensure that you are writing down all key ideas and opinions. At the conclusion of a discussion on a certain topic, it is helpful if the facilitator provides a review of what was said and the conclusions that were reached.


Do your best to summarize the key points made by each person in attendance. Also, highlight whatever resolutions were made to the issues addressed.

, Feedback is essential for you to improve as a meeting facilitator. You may think about asking the following: Was the agenda distributed at a good time? How well prepared were the attendees? Did the time allocated to each topic work? Was there enough time for discussion? How was the room set up?Feedback can also be collected by an email survey sent to participants shortly after the meeting.
Be sure to review the result and make any necessary changes for the next meeting.

Calm down to begin with.,
Assume nothing conspiratorial.,
Focus on the future.,
Do a thorough analysis of all the work you did during the year.,
Request your supervisor and/or interviewer for a detailed discussion on your performance.,
Start preparing yourself for moving up in a more focused and directed manner.,
Keep highlighting your good work.,
Be true to yourself.",How to Respond when a Promotion Is Rejected," While you may feel a raging torrent of anger and perhaps a sense of unfairness at being passed over ""after all you've done"", this won't endear you to anyone witnessing a meltdown and it won't make things easier for you. You cannot change what has happened. And while feeling disappointed is natural and expected, making it known that you're upset and devastated about missing out will make others feel uncomfortable and could reach the ears of those in a position to promote you next time, causing them to wonder if you're able to handle difficult situations. Most of all, don't sulk, behave petulantly or act as if something you were entitled to has been ""stolen"" away from you. All of the responses will cause others to think less of you.


People won't mind you saying ""This is disappointing, I really wanted it."" That's expected. What they will mind is hearing you complain and whine about the rejected promotion endlessly, dissecting the interview process and insisting that you were hard done by.
Distract yourself from harboring and focusing on negative thoughts. Indulge yourself in things you enjoy.
Spend time with those who love you. They'll reassure you of all your good points!;
, You don't know the often mundane reasons behind why one person is chosen over another for a promotion; many are very close decisions based on someone else having slightly more knowledge or experience of a particular area than you may have, rather than this being about your personality traits. Assuming favoritism or lack of liking you may or may not have any basis in fact but once you start thinking in such a negative manner, you'll present a very negative attitude that can harm your future chances.


As much as you may not want to, try standing in the shoes of the interviewer. It isn't easy making the right choices for positions in an organization; a lot of things have to be taken into consideration. And it's even harder for an interviewer who knows you but thinks you could do with a bit more experience; they know you will be ready some time soon but not just yet and they also know that the decision will be disappointing.

, This time you didn't get what you aimed for but you can surely make things better in the future and increase your chances of getting a promotion next time. See this as a learning opportunity to help you get over the disappointment. Think back over the interview and application process. You'll know deep down where things could have been improved, where elements that could have been better were highlighted during the process. Start focusing on the things that you need to do to improve your chances and take action.


Believe in yourself. You have it in you and you can change the way things are. If there is any one who can make a difference to your situation it's you!
Tell yourself that you need to take steps so that things improve in the future and you get what you deserve. Prepare yourself for action.

, What were highlights of your performance and, in particular, focus on areas where you felt you couldn't achieve what was expected out of you. Did you have a clear list of goals you were expected to achieve? Did you have the resources, expertise and training you needed? These are all things that can be actively improved upon.

, Listen openly to what they have to say and avoid being defensive. Find out the key parameters on which your performance was judged in the interview and get your supervisor's appraisal of where you're at now. Try to know what you could have done differently so that you would have surely got promoted. Also ask your manager what you need to do in the coming year so that you do not face rejection again.


Be aware that perception of your performance matters, even if you feel that their perception carries no substance. If there is a perception from senior management that you're not promotion material for whatever reason, listen and learn how you can turn around that perception. You may disagree, but seek advice from various people as to what you need to do. Even asking for this impresses people and helps them to realize that you're serious about making the needed changes.
If you suspect you're not getting a straight answer (quite possible if the person delivering the information is worried about upsetting you or isn't comfortable expressing the real reasons), then seek out someone whom you can trust to talk to and is likely to know the reasons and what to do next, such as a mentor or another supervisor or trusted senior colleague.
There is no harm asking an outsider for your prospects either. Talk to recruitment agencies or specialists about your current set of skills and have them assess where they think you should be and are headed and what you need to do to improve your chances. Their neutral assessment can be very helpful and emotionally detached from your current workplace, helping you to see the issues more clearly and be more accepting on them.

, Relate your talent, ability and interest with what is expected out of you for promotion in this role. Are there any additional skills you need to acquire in order to excel in your role? If yes, then immediately take steps to get these skills. Often these can be acquired at company expense, in company time, so see this as a great opportunity.


Start working with a clear focus on what you have to achieve.
Keep taking regular feedback from your supervisor. Be an active listener and even when you feel defensive, stop yourself from back chat and focus on doing what is needed to overcome the weaker areas of your skills.
Don't be afraid to ask for advice from coworkers and others at work. People are generally willing to share their insights about skill improvement from their own experience, provided you ask nicely.

, Make sure those above you and those who decide on your promotion know that you are working hard and you are effective in what you do. Talk to people who make a difference and let them know how keen you are to keep improving, so that they know you are serious about moving up.

, If striving harder to get higher turns out not to be the rosy picture you'd painted, you have a great opportunity now to start reassessing your direction. If you do try hard to change your skill set and attitude but feel that what is required to get promoted in your current role is not what interests you or what you can do, then it may be time to try to find a job which suits you better, or even to be contented within the role you have now. There is also no harm in asking for expanded duties within a current role without having to go for a promotion. Keep all of your options open.

Familiarize yourself with your company's hierarchy.,
Avoid wasting time and resources.,
Work to fulfill your company's mission.,
Do things without being asked.,
Keep track of your achievements.,
Network with potential mentors.,
Express your appreciation.",How to Grow Rapidly in a Career1," Get to know how your company is organized and learn about its key positions. Find out those positions' functions and identify who occupies them.Understanding the hierarchical structure will help you learn more about potential advancement opportunities. You'll also get a better feel for the company's decision making processes.;
, Do your best not to slack off or waste time while you're at work. Try not to waste resources like paper, electricity, and office supplies.For example, check and double check your work if you have to print dozens or hundreds of copies of a document. Wasting printer ink and paper due to a careless mistake will show your supervisors that you don't value the company's resources.

, Work efficiently and refine your output so it's of the highest quality. Complete projects to the best of your ability and in a timely manner to help the company’s bottom line. Your supervisors will see you as a more valuable employee if you show you care instead of completing projects just to get them out of the way., Go above and beyond your job description. From small tasks to initiating major projects, be a self-starter and don’t make your bosses have to micromanage you.Examples could include anything from picking up a piece of crumpled paper in the office to designing an easier way of taking inventory.
Continuing to learn about your current workplace is essential. The more you know about your company’s operations and goals, the easier it is to anticipate ways to make yourself useful.

, Having measurable data about your output will come in handy when you’re up for performance reviews and promotions. Keep a file of successful projects you've spearheaded, deals you’ve landed, or ways you’ve saved the company money.For example, if you helped negotiate a deal that cut your department’s cost of goods sold by 15%, be sure to keep a record of that achievement’s details for future performance reviews.
If you’re a designer or involved in a creative field, keep a portfolio of your output.

, Approach people who have achieved your goals and do your best to learn from them. Reach out to individuals both within and outside of your company, and ask for a coffee date, to pick their brain, for tips, and for honest feedback.If there’s someone at your company who’s mastered what you want to do, ask them, “Would you have time for a coffee or quick lunch? I’d be grateful for the chance to talk about your success in this industry.” Send them an email if you don’t have the opportunity to ask them in person.
Showing someone in a key position at your workplace that you’re passionate about advancement will help you stand out when a promotion is available or when you need a reference.

, Regularly showing your supervisors that you're grateful for the opportunities and guidance they offer will make a big impression. Avoid being insincere and try to be specific when thanking your supervisors and company's officers.Suppose your company's CEO sends out a weekly note to the workforce. In passing say to them, ""Excuse me, I just wanted to thank you for the weekly notes of advice and encouragement. They're valuable and have made a difference in my work!""

Use your downtime to read and learn.,
Expand your industry knowledge through professional development.,
Pursue projects outside your area of focus.,
Learn to delegate.,
Trust the teams you lead.",How to Grow Rapidly in a Career2," Make the most of your time off by listening to podcasts and reading newspapers. Regardless of your industry, there are plenty of materials available to help refine your skills.Take advantage of your commute by listening to an industry-related podcast or audiobook written by someone at the top of your field.
Instead of using your breaks to check social media or laugh at memes, read articles about relevant advancements or new technologies.
If your family has gone out to run errands on a weekend day and you find yourself home alone, use the time to learn instead of watching television.

, In addition to educating yourself during your downtime, go to conferences, take classes, and take advantage of any professional development opportunities that come your way. Making yourself an expert in your industry will improve your performance at your current job and make you a more desirable candidate in the future.Professional conferences are also among the best networking opportunities.

, Without ignoring your primary responsibilities, find ways to work on projects that will broaden your skills and professional network. Projects outside of your focus can introduce you to contacts in related industries and other departments. You'll also learn more about how your industry at large functions.For example, if you’re a product designer and a project manager wants a designer to join their application and installation team, do your best to take advantage of the opportunity. You’ll learn about how the company interacts with clients during the acquisition and installation processes. You’ll add new skills to your resume and have a better understanding of how your designs are used.

, Delegating will become an essential skill as you grow in your career and eventually reach management levels. Start thinking about how you would assign roles to make a project’s execution more efficient and to reap the benefits of team members’ distinct skills.If you're not in a management position, imagine hypothetical ways you'd divide tasks for projects you’re working on, and pay attention to how your manager delegates. When you’re given responsibility over a team for the first time, familiarize yourself with each member’s skills and assign appropriate tasks.

, Lose the mentality that there’s only one right way to accomplish something. Trust those working under you to complete projects well even if they don’t go about it the same way you would. That way, you’ll be a more effective manager and have better control of your own time as you work your way up the ladder."

Switch jobs every three years.,
Get a job at a startup company.,
Choose jobs with challenges that exceed your skills.",How to Grow Rapidly in a Career3," There’s no longer a perception that changing jobs is flakey or disloyal. Those who change jobs every three years or so make more money than employees who stay with a company longer. Over the course of a lifetime, job hoppers are believed to make at least 50% more money.In addition to increased earnings, you’ll also broaden your contacts list, gain new skills, and encounter new ways of operating and organizing a company.

, Do your best to get at least one job with a startup at least once in the middle of your career. By mid-career, you’ll have some expertise in your field, and a startup will give you the opportunity to put what you’ve learned into practice most effectively.You’ll have more direct access to company leaders, allowing you to help shape its organization, operations, and goals.
You’ll be able to leave a visible, measurable, and lasting mark, which will help enable a wide variety of future career opportunities. “Developed and implemented new purchasing protocols for a rapidly growing firm” is a great addition to your resume.   

, Necessity is the mother of invention, and you’re more likely to gain new abilities when challenges exceed your skills. Avoid getting complacent with your current responsibilities. If you’re bored, try to find new responsibilities at your current job or look for a more challenging position elsewhere."

Get ready.,
Know the conference platform.,
Be professional.,
Make the conference call interactive.",How to Conduct Productive Meetings Using Conference Calls," Nothing is as unproductive as holding a meeting with people who are not prepared. Unpreparedness is not only energy draining, but also truly disturbing. In addition, holding a meeting where participants have little or no recollection about the meeting’s agenda can backfire with nothing to show in the end.


This principle applies in conference calls. Participants need to be aware of the meeting time and its agenda. This duty to get people prepared for the meeting falls on the host’s shoulders. The participants should also prepare for the meeting by going through the agenda memo, or invites before the meeting. This will equip them with the ability to make useful contributions during the conference meeting.;
, Hosts and participants need to be well trained in using the conference call program. It’s impossible to get full participation in a meeting if parties are not knowledgeable in how to use the conference calling platform.


Failure to understand the intrigues of a conference call program can make the meeting less productive. On introducing a new conferencing platform to your colleagues, clients or employees, provide the necessary training and tutorials on how the tool is used to make all interactions possible and meaningful. You can also make it easier for them by using free conference calls without PINs offered by services.

, Lack of professionalism is a common hindrance to conference call success. There is a level of fear most people face going into meetings. Questions like, ""Is the conference call being recorded?"", ""Is it open for all of us?"", ""Am I on the spot in this conference call?"", and ""Is it going to be done in private?"" are often dominant in attendees' minds.


Participants need to know their positions throughout the call. While announcing that the conference is being recorded is likely to slow or reduce participation from some parties, it also helps to inform the participant if recording of any nature will take place.
Professionalism also borders around creating a positive environment for the call. This may include limiting the amount of visual and audio distractions around you during the call. Always ask participants to hit the mute button to limit the noise levels from their ends during the call.

, Meetings where parties participate freely are traditionally more productive than those where they don’t. Be open to the other participants' contributions to ensure that they feel an important part of the meeting.


Ask questions and encourage free answers throughout the conversation to avoid being the one dominating every topic in the meeting. Nonetheless, always assert control over the meeting by steering the agenda to the end.
In addition, to avoid falling into the poor retention quagmire most conference calls face, insist on participants coming to meetings prepared to take notes and participate. This should be done in much the same way as they would in face to face meetings. It also falls onto the host to designate one party who will take minutes of what is discussed. You can email these to the attendants when the meeting is over.
Overall, the key to conducting productive conference calls is truly getting ready for them beforehand. Every participant should prepare for the conference call ahead of time by going through the meeting's agenda. They should also learn how to operate the conference call program or prepare their rooms (and themselves) for the conference call, especially video calls (although you can use free conference calls without PINs to make it easy for them).
Productive conference calls also take place when there is a definite host (assertive to steer the meeting’s agenda), and active and focused participants. You can achieve all this by making the conference call interactive, light but objective. It also helps to take notes, maintain courtesy with all participants, and send minutes after the conference call.

Take speech, marketing, history, business and agriculture classes while in school. These courses will help prepare you for the various roles required as an auctioneer.


Though college isn't necessary, it can be useful. A recent poll taken by the NAA (National Auctioneers Association), 35% have degrees while another 36% have some sort of college experience.;
, This is the natural first step to becoming an auctioneer. Start attending auctions! Watch the roles the auctioneer fills during a typical auction day. Observe his actions, decisions and skill. There's a lot more to it than just chanting quickly!

, If you're in high school or just looking to get some experience, start working for an auction company doing whatever odd jobs you can. Even if you're just organizing pieces to sell or sweeping the floor, it gets your foot in the door.


Serve as a ring-side helper that hands items to an auctioneer and aids in crowd control.
Work as a bid watcher. The auctioneer needs help to identify everyone making bids, especially during busy and well-attended auctions. A bid watcher identifies bidders whom the auctioneer doesn't see.
Help set up auctions prior to bidding. Auctioneers rely on help to unpack, set out and arrange auction items for viewing and bidding. Learn more about the business by working on a set-up crew.

, Now that you've got your feet wet, do you like what you see? You may choose whether you want to go on to get your license and become an auctioneer. Currently, 37 states in the US require licensure.Proceed with licensing guidelines as your state requires.


Some states require you go to an NAA affiliated school, some states want one or two years of experience before you're allowed to take the final exam, some want a formal apprenticeship, and some states will allow some combination of the aforementioned types of experience.If you can get hands-on experience, you may not have to take a course.

, That's right -- you don't need a license to be an auctioneer for charity gigs.It's basically volunteer work (you're not making any money), so it's open to whoever is kind enough to donate their time. It's a great way to start developing a résumé and to get your name out there. In time, it'll be all about your reputation. It's for a good cause too; did we mention that?

, Though this isn't always necessary, it's definitely valuable experience. Unless you've grown up with a gavel in your hand instead of a pacifier (aka gotten into the family business), this may be the route for you.The NAA has a list of schools on their website.


Currently the NAA has schools in the US, Canada, South Africa, and an affiliate in Australia.Depending on your location, you may be able to get away with a course that's only a few weeks long or you may need to take one that's closer to a standard college semester. Either way, it's not that long.

Choose between an on-site school or a virtual program. Auctioneer schools are located across the globe, and many programs are offered online. You'll be taking classes in bid calling, marketing and basic business management.



, Some states, like Ohio and Tennessee, require 1 or 2 years (respectively) of experience before you're even allowed to sit for the exam.But regardless of the rules in your jurisdiction, it's a good idea to start getting experience as soon as possible.


There is such a thing as an apprentice auctioneer license. This is generally a stepping stone (often required) in states that do require the experience before the exam. Exam fees currently sit at around a couple hundred dollars in most areas., In most areas, it's offered quarterly.Your state should have information on how to study for the test, like Texas' Green Book.But since you're already in the auctioneer network, you'll have plenty of other resources to hit up, too.


Certain states have reciprocity laws. That means that your license is good in the states that recognize your state's license, but not good in others. If you want a license in a state that doesn't work like this, you'll need to fulfill their requirements and take their exam., Once you've taken the exam and passed (if you fail, generally you can take it twice in the next year period), you can apply for your license! This generally just proves that you've done the work and you're a legitimate auctioneer. Congratulations! And, yes, this will cost another couple hundred bucks., Nearly every U.S. state has a professional organization for auctioneers. National organizations exist, too, and offer continuing education and other resources to members. The NAA is a great place to start. There are competitions and conferences you can attend, too.


Many organizations, including at state level, provide testing opportunities for auctioneers to prove their expertise. Becoming certified or accredited improves your credibility and professionalism as an auctioneer.

, It's difficult to become an overnight success as an auctioneer. Keep a regular job or stay with your current career until you have managed enough success to replace a regular salary. Most auctioneers start off part-time., Most auction companies are independent ventures -- people like you have started out as auctioneers and then opened up their own business. However, there are some ""houses"" that are chains and are quite huge. Just like any employer, some are better than others, but you'll never know until you try.


Try to find an auction company that specializes in your area (agriculture, antiques, etc.) and is willing to work with you and your schedule. Do they provide mentorship? What do they charge overhead? Will you be an employee or a contractor? These are things to consider when looking for employment.

, Auctioneers are often sought due to their expertise in certain areas. You'll need to be able to look at an item and roughly tell what condition it's in and what factors matter about it. If you overlook a scratch, you could be starting way too high. Here are the most common subtopics of auctioneering:


Learn about livestock and agriculture. Many auctions sell livestock and agricultural equipment.
Acquire knowledge about antiques. Auctions regularly include antique items, and it helps to know information about eras of history and historical items.
Auction off vehicles as an expert. Learn about makes, models, years, engines and unique trivia about vehicles.

Some states, like Tennessee again, have a specific license for public automobile auctioneers., You will be held highly responsible for the turnout at your auctions. In order to get bidders in the first place, you'll need to market your auctions with the right media at the right places and times and to the right people. If the auction happens and the products don't walk, your client will not be happy.


It's important to know your audience here. If you have an estate auction that is mostly Elvis memorabilia and thousands of vinyl records, that's totally different than an estate sale that's all 19th century modern art and fine china. The expanse of your network will be very, very important here.

, If you live in an area with a small population, you're obviously going to get more bites elsewhere. Consider networking throughout your entire region or even moving to an area that caters to your specialty (heavy into agriculture or just plain affluent, for starters). The more people you can reach, the more opportunities you'll have to build yourself.

, Use a mirror, record yourself, make bid calls aloud and use your skills in public. If you went to school for auctioneering, they'll get you started on this. Bid calling is an art, as are describing auction items and dealing with customers. Improve your skills by practicing them regularly.


Bid calling is obviously the most visible part of the auctioneer's job, but it's only a very small portion of it. While it does matter, you also have to be charismatic, a great marketer, and have good administration skills to boot.

, A good auctioneer is more than just someone who knows their product and can speak ridiculously fast and still maintain clarity. They're entertaining the entire room! An auctioneer that charms their audience can drive prices up 20%.Don't get the crowd buzzing and the auction is a bust.


If it wasn't clear, you'll be working on commission most of the time. So the more money you get your crowd to pay, the better off you'll be. So you gotta work it!
To a certain extent, you'll be coaxing your audience to pay more. People will automatically start to get hesitant as the prices rise -- it's your job to be persuasive and convince them (without them really knowing it) that they're making a good decision by upping the ante.

, A good auctioneer is often quite classy. You may be working with items that cost a pretty penny and your demeanor should match. Bidders are not ""the woman with the orange hat over there"" and you don't point at people for bids. You are working with ladies and gentlemen and your hand should always be an open palm.If you're on TV, there will be different protocol for that too -- you'll need to occasionally address your listeners that are just tuning in. Ramp up your charm, be ever-so-tactful, and wear a bright colored tie or top., In addition to all the prep work you'll have to do (working with clients, working with dealers, etc.) and manning the stand at the auction itself, you'll be sorting out every little detail that occurs that day. And there will be loads!


For starters, you'll be working for absentee bidders, handling reserve prices (sometimes the owner doesn't want to go too low -- and even then they might get upset), and working the crowd in between showcases. People will come to you with all their questions, so you have to be prepared with all the answers!

Take advantage of research programs.,
Network as much as possible.,

Know where to look.,
Know what to expect.,
Keep your skills up to date.",How to Become an Astrophysicist," The earlier you can start the learning process, the better off you'll be. Do as much as possible to learn about astrophysics as a subject. You should also learn about what to expect as you work your way to a career in the field.


Generally, astrophysicists can either be theoretical or observational. Observational astrophysicists study the physical processes of the universe, while theoretical astrophysicists use mathematical models and computer simulations to explain astrophysical phenomena.
Regardless of your specialization, you'll need to develop and explain theories about the workings of the universe, analyze related data, test hypotheses, and publish scientific papers for publication.;
, If you are still in middle school or high school, tailor the classes you take around subjects relating to the field of astrophysics. You may not be able to take any classes dealing directly with the field, but you should stock up on math and science courses to give you the sort of groundwork you'll need for a college astrophysics program.While all science classes can be helpful, physics and chemistry courses will be especially beneficial. You should also get as much experience with advanced mathematics as possible.
Keep your grade point average high and take advanced classes when possible. Doing so will make it easier to get accepted into a high-quality astrophysics program at the university level.

, Community classes and clubs generally don't get too deep into the field of astrophysics, but if you're just starting out, these resources are a great way to learn the basics of astronomy as early as possible. There are a range of possible opportunities to consider.


Look for astronomy clubs at school or within the community.
Purchase a membership at your nearest planetarium.
Attend free or cheap classes at a local library or community college.
Go to special astronomy-related events hosted by planetariums, universities, or other organizations.

, Ideally, you should look for a university with an undergraduate program in astrophysics. These programs can be rare, though, so you may need to pursue a degree in physics or astronomy, instead.


You could double major in both physics and astronomy, but doing so will increase the number of years you spend at the undergraduate level. Instead, consider majoring in one subject and minoring in the other.
Also consider taking computer science courses since these may help you develop the skills you'll need for astrophysics research.
A B.S. degree in physics or astronomy will only allow you to qualify for entry level positions. Instead of research positions, you can expect to find work as technicians, research assistants, or observatory assistants.

, While a Bachelor's degree will get your foot in the door, you will need a Master of Science degree in astrophysics, at minimum, if you want anything beyond an entry level job.Typically, a Master's degree will qualify you to work as a research assistant for a more prominent source or as a consultant.
If you want to advance as far into the field of astrophysics as possible, set your sights on a Doctorate degree instead of a Master's degree. The former will advance your career much further..

, If you want a high level job in the field of astrophysics, you will need a Ph.D. in the field. Look for a Doctorate program specifically tailored to the field of astrophysics instead of settling for a related field.


Expect to complete a lot of coursework in physics, astronomy, mathematics, computer science, and statistics. You will also need to complete original research and a dissertation.
Doctoral programs can take five years or more to complete. You may wish to join the work force while simultaneously working on earning your Ph.D.
Generally, you will need a Ph.D. if you want to work for a university as a teacher or researcher. You will also need this level of education to perform research for the federal government.
Most graduate programs will actually require you to concentrate in a sub-field of astrophysics, like cosmology or radio astronomy.

, During your undergraduate years, look for research programs, internships, and similar opportunities that only last for the summer.


Find out if the physics or astronomy department at your university can help place you with a fitting program. Some schools also have ""career services"" offices that can help, as well.
Check with major organizations for competitive research internships, too. Possible sources to consider include the National Science Foundation and NASA.

, Even after you earn your Ph.D., you will still need to spend time in temporary positions before landing a permanent job. Most postdoctoral research positions last for two to three years.


During this time, you will work with more experienced scientists in the field as they advance in their own specialties.
Initially, your work will be carefully supervised. As you gain more experience, however, you will usually have more independence.

, Since astrophysics is a competitive field, you will need to gain as much experience as possible and make as many contacts within the industry as you can. Make a good impression with everyone you work for and work with. These contacts may later recommend you for a competitive permanent position, and that recommendation could make the difference between acceptance and rejection.


Consider looking for opportunities outside of the country. Most research programs you'll find will be within the country, but if you really want to give yourself an edge over the competition, try not to limit yourself to staying within your country's borders as you gain formal work experience. Some research programs in other countries may only be open to native citizens of those countries, but oftentimes, they are open to international applicants, too.

, You will be involved with research no matter what career you choose as an astrophysicist. While some permanent positions focus strictly on research alone, others combine research with teaching. The former are usually easier to find, while the latter are mostly limited to universities.Research is often self-directed, but sometimes you will need to perform research within the confines of a larger collaboration.
Strict research positions tend to have flexible hours, while teaching positions have set hours.
In addition to formal teaching positions, you may also have opportunities to give public talks about new advancements and similar topics. If you work for a planetarium or similar organization, you may also teach the public informally from time to time.

, Since astrophysics is a fairly specialized field, you do have a somewhat narrow field of possible employers. In general, look for organizations that performs any work in the field of astrophysics. Positions tend to be limited, so you may need to search for quite a while before you find an opening.


Colleges and universities are among the most common employers of astrophysicists, followed by government agencies like NASA.
You can also find work at public and private research facilities, science centers, and planetariums.

, You'll usually spend most of your time in offices and laboratories. While there is room for growth in the field, there are a fairly limited number of positions, making the workforce a competitive one.


Based on statistics gathered by the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS), the median pay for astrophysicists as of May 2012 was around $106,360. If you work for the federal government, you may earn around $111,020. Private research facilities may pay around $104,650, while university jobs often pay around $81,180.Expected job growth between 2012 and 2022 is about average when compared with all other occupations, according the the BLS. In other words, employment is expected to grow by about 10 percent over that period of time.

, If you want to keep your job or advance further in the field, prepare to approach education as a life-long ambition. You'll need to keep up on regular changes and new theories in astrophysics as they arise.Rather than completing new degrees or certifications, continued education as a professional in the field will require you to participate in lectures, seminars, and conferences. As you advance in your own specialty, you may be asked to speak at some of these events. More often than not, however, you will interact at these events as active audience members.

You should be willing to fulfill this requirement before thinking about applying for the jobActive duty means that you will work full-time for the military. That means you can be deployed at any time.
Since the Navy operates hospitals all over the world, you may be reassigned as the Navy sees fit, sometimes in a different country.;
, Once you become a member of the Navy Medical Corps, your work will be very similar to that of a civilian doctor: you'll meet with patients, diagnose conditions, provide treatment, and attend conferences and lectures. The only difference is that your patients will be active and retired members of the armed forces and their families.There are numerous advantages to being a Navy doctor. You may have medical school paid for, be able to practice without worrying about insurance or overhead costs, have a guaranteed pool of patients, vacation time, and plenty of opportunity for promotion and advancement.Cons include consistent moving and relocation while you're on active duty, being away from family and friends, and a more limited choice of specialties than the civilian sector., Besides the willingness to serve 2 years on active duty, applicants must meet several other criteria to qualify for a position in the Navy.The applicant must be a U. S. citizen currently practicing medicine in the US.
The applicant must be a graduate of a medical school accredited by the American Medical Association (AMA) or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).
A recent graduate must obtain a medical license within a year of enlistment.
An applicant must be between the ages of 21 and 64. Candidates over 64 will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
A recruit must pass a physical and mental exam.

, Whether you're a college student just starting to think about a medical career, or a doctor that's been practicing for years, your first step to joining the Navy is contacting a recruiter. He can speak with you and let you know all your options for becoming part of the Navy Medical Corps.Click here to find the Navy recruiting office nearest to your location.

, If you're a college or high school student considering medical school, ask the recruiter what sort of financial assistance the Navy offers. You don't have to attend a military medical school to join the Navy. You can attend the medical school of your choice and can apply for financial assistance to complete your degree. Depending on what financial plan the Navy offer you, you may emerge debt-free from school. The Navy will expect you to serve a certain amount of time on active duty if you receive a financial package. There are numerous financial packages you may get, so the best thing to do is ask your recruiter which is best for you.One possible financial package is the Navy Health Professions Scholarship Program. It includes 100% tuition coverage for school, plus a monthly stipend for living expenses.
There is also the Navy Health Services Collegiate Program. This would provide from $157,000 to $269,000 for your education and living expenses.

, After you've contacted a Navy recruiter and set up a plan, the Navy typically asks nothing else of you until you complete your education.Your next steps are very much like any regular medical student. You have to apply to medical school, then graduate with your degree. After you do that, you can begin training for your career in the Navy.


Read Get Into Medical School and Survive Medical School for more detailed tips on finding the right medical school and successfully getting your degree.

, The Navy offers over 30 sub-fields for its doctors to specialize in. When you start attending medical school, begin considering a field you would be interested in. Then tailor your experience, like internships and rotations, to this sub-field. That way you can ensure that you are qualified for the specialty you're interested in. Click here for a complete list of specialties the Navy offers for doctors.


Specialties include typical civilian areas like neurology, family medicine, dermatology, pediatrics, and sports medicine, and military-based specialties like fleet Marine Corps medicine.

, After graduating medical school, you have to complete a residency. Residencies typically last a year or more and give you hands on training in a particular specialty. You can do your residency with the Navy or in a civilian hospital.You may have more choice of specialties if you do your residency in the civilian setting. The Navy also has programs to give financial assistance to residents, so as always, contact your recruiter and see what your options are.
Residencies within the Navy are excellent as well, but space may be limited and you might have to wait for one to open up., There is still plenty of opportunity for someone who didn't know they wanted to join the Navy when they were a student. Sometimes the decision to join the military is one that comes later in life. Some doctors who have been practicing for years decide to apply their skills to a different setting and join the armed forces. If you've already graduated medical school and are practicing, contact a recruiter.Practicing physicians usually get a sign on bonus and a high salary, depending on their level of experience and specialty. Recent sign on bonuses can be as high as $220,000-$400,000 if the applicant is highly qualified.
Doctors who have worked in the civilian field often enjoy the military because they don't have to worry about insurance or other financial matters. They feel more free to provide the care they think their patients need., Whether you begin your Navy career right after medical school, do a civilian residency first, or are already a licensed physician, you'll eventually have to attend Officer Development School. You'll learn about military discipline, etiquette, and development. It will involve both classroom work and physical training. At the end of the course, you'll be an officer and a doctor in the Navy.Officer Development School is a 5-week course that takes place in Newport, Rhode Island.
Classroom topics include Naval Leadership, Naval Administration, Naval Organization, Sea Power, Military Law, Military Indoctrination, Naval Warfare and Damage Control.
You must also pass a Physical Fitness Assessment. There is a 22% maximum body fat level for males and a 33% maximum for females. A test will include pullups, pushups, and a 1.5 miles run. It is recommended that you begin an exercise regimen before attending.

, After passing Officer Development School, you'll be given your first assignment in the Navy. You'll be sent to one of the several hundred medical facilities the Navy operates around the world. Based on your expertise and education, you could serve in a hospital, clinic, air base, surface ship, and others. Be sure to follow all orders and report for your assignment promptly."

, Specializing in a specific field of radiologic technology will give you a leg up in interviews and will make you a desirable candidate. You can specialize during your training or after you've gone on the job. Specialization requires more training and the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) certification in your field. Here are some fields that you can specialize in:


Mammography
Computer tomography (CT)
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Cellular imaging
Medical sonography
Medical imaging
Radiography

, To become a certified technologist, a student may be required to successfully pass the exams, as well as meet the Technical Standards and Essential Functions (TSEF). The exam may be given by your individual state or by the AART. It tests the following skills:Observation skills. The student must demonstrate the ability to assess and comprehend the diagnosis.
Communication skills. The student must learn verbal, non-verbal and written formats.
Motor skills. The student must execute basic movements to lift and move immobile patients.
Intellectual skills. The student must be able to make decisions, interpret, collect and integrate information.

, Most states require individuals to secure a license along with their certification. You should look into the requirements of your state, since they differ; some states simply use the ARRT exams for licensing, but others may require additional work to be done.Contact your state's health board for more information on what you need to do to become a radiology technician in your state.

, Internships are great for getting training in a field. An internship will allow you to receive first-hand knowledge of the daily routines. This may also be more feasible if you're having a hard time finding full-time employment at first.

, Read the job description and posting thoroughly before completing an application. Make sure that you meet the necessary qualifications before you apply for the position. After getting hired, enjoy the employment benefit package. Go online to reputable websites such as the American Society of Radiologic Technologists (ASRT) site to see what opportunities are out there.Answer all questions with clear and precise information using buzz words. Buzz words are the words the human resources department will initially scan for when checking an application.
If requested, submit all credentials such as a transcript, certification and references. Make a copy of paperwork for your file before submitting.
The benefits packages may include: a pension plan, tuition reimbursement, paid vacation, holidays and sick days and insurance coverage.

, Professional organizations keep members informed of new techniques, procedures, legislative acts, new licensure requirements and updates on conferences and continuing education programs.


These organizations will also help you network and meet other people in your field who could help you find future work.

, If you want to be the best radiologic technologist that you can be, then you can continue to develop the skills you need to excel at your job. Here are the some of the qualities that you should posses and improve:Being detail-orientied. You have to follow the exact instructions you need to get the correct images that will help to diagnose and treat your patients.
Science and mathematical skills. You must deepen your understanding of physiology, anatomy, and other sciences.
Technical skills. You must have a deep understanding of how to operate the complex machinery at your disposal.

, If you want to maintain your ARRT certified status, then you'll need to get 24 hours of continuing education every two years. This will help you brush up on your skills, learn new techniques, and to stay current in your field., As you become more experienced in your career, you may be asked to train or even to manage entry-level technologists. Make sure you know how to educate and manage others in a professional and helpful manner.

, Your job will require you to work closely with patients, many of whom will be under incredible stress or in extreme pain. They will need you to calm them down and to help them relax as you do your job. As you grow in your career, you will need to master small talk as well as the ability to make patients feel as calm and comfortable as possible.They will undoubtedly be nervous and they may ask you what you see on the machines. However, you cannot diagnose patients yourself or tell them what you see; you may notice a large tumor, but you must not show distress and keep telling the patients that only the doctors can diagnose the problems and that your job is just to operate the machine.

, You will need both physical and mental stamina to succeed at your job. Though the average work week for a radiology technician is 40 hours a week, your job may require you to work evenings, weekends, or to take on other on-call work, especially when you're starting out. You will need to stay physically strong because you may have to lift and move patients, and you will have to stay mentally tough because the job can get a bit repetitive and can also be emotionally draining, as working with potentially sick patients may take a toll on you.Though the job can be a bit mentally and physically draining, at the end of the day, you should feel proud that you're helping patients diagnose their problems and to get on the road to recovery.

, Though the position of radiologic technologist has less opportunities for clinical advancement, if you do want to advance, then you can move into several other fields that can offer a change of pace and in some cases, a higher salary. Here are the most common fields that experienced radiology technicians can enter into:


Education
Sales
Consulting

Consult a good lawyer.,
Research relevant cases.,
Assess your options.",How to Avoid a Draft1," Evading a mandatory military service is a crime and often carries serious consequences. In one recent case, an Australian national was arrested and jailed in Israel for draft evasion; she had lived there for four years as a teenager.Talk to a lawyer before you do anything. They can update you on the law and give you advice about your options.;
, Look into the files of recent service evaders with your lawyer. In the US, for example, there have been a number of high-profile cases in the last ten years of soldiers refusing to serve. Some tried to flee to Canadabut have mostly been deported, ending up in legal trouble.Although these men are legally deserters, not draft evaders, their stories can be helpful and give you a better sense of your options – and of the potential consequences of draft dodging.


Recently, Polish men have been moving to Britain in order to escape the draft in their country, which is punishable by three years in prison. They have been able to do so because of fairly open freedom of movement between countries in the European Union., You are about to take a very serious and potentially life-changing step. Examine all of your options with a lawyer. Know the latest case law. Be sure that you are making the right choice and that you have a plan for all possible outcomes.


Questions to consider include whether you have dual citizenship in a country not at war. It may be possible for you to go there. Are you gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or intersex? Many militaries do not let such people serve in the military.
Are you a member of a religious organization that is historically pacifist, like the Quakers, Mennonites, or Jehovah’s Witnesses? If so, you may qualify as a “conscientious objector” or someone who opposes war or violence by reason of religious belief.
Do you have any physical or mental conditions that could prevent you from being drafted? Document them. Do you have a mild case of asthma? Go to the doctor once a month to get it on record. Whatever your condition, document it as much as possible. You will need to present comprehensive documentation.

"
"
File a written application.,
Attend your interviews and hearing.,
Await the results of the informal investigation.",How to Avoid a Draft2," Conscientious objectors are excused from military service in many countries. In the US, they not only include members of pacifist churches like the Jehovah’s Witnesses, Quakers, Mennonites, and Amish but also anyone who claims, and can prove, to have a “firm, fixed and sincere objection to participation in war in any form or the bearing of arms, by reason of religious training and belief.” There are also two distinct classes: Class 1-O and Class 1-A-O. The first is for people who sincerely object to any participation in war whatsoever. The second group object to participation in war as combatants, but not to participation in a non-combatant role.

To start the process, you will have to file a formal application. You will have to document your views and prove to the investigators of your claim that you are not objecting simply to avoid service or out of expedience. You have to show that your reasons are based on sincere belief. Your investigators will judge your participation in a religious organization, your pattern of conduct, whether your beliefs were shaped by serious ethical or moral study, and other factors., You will most likely be interviewed as part of the review of your conscientious objector application. Very probably you will have to speak with a psychologist, a military chaplain (a pastor, rabbi, or imam depending on your religious affiliation), and finally an investigating officer in a hearing. They will be judging the sincerity of your beliefs and whether your claim is credible. Again, you will have to give detailed information about your beliefs and their basis as well as your religious life. You may also be able to have third parties testify on your behalf.Keep in mind that your interviews are not “privileged.” This means, for example, that they can ask confidential questions about you from a chaplain who knows you previously. In this case, you should request to be interviewed by a different chaplain., After the interviews, the investigating officer will file a report on your case. This usually consists of items like statements and other documents received during the hearing, summaries of witness testimony, conclusions about the basis of your objections, and recommendations for your classification as a conscientious objector. The whole file will then be reviewed by a military judge advocate, and sent on to whatever headquarters makes the final decision.Since the US now has a voluntary military and requires you to swear an oath at your induction into the service, becoming a conscientious objector is hard. Basically, you have to be able to prove that your views on war changed after you swore the military oath."
"
Judge the chances of your case.,
Choose a refuge country carefully.,
Make an application.",How to Avoid a Draft3," It is hard to obtain refugee status to evade a draft. International law is not clear on the matter – refugees from military service are not included in the Geneva conventions nor necessarily excluded.Rather, your case depends in part on your civil and legal status at home. Talk with a lawyer over the merits of your case, if you can, before taking the uncertain step of applying for refugee status.


The UN considers there to be five situations when refugee status is appropriate: if the punishment for objecting from conscience amounts to “persecution”; if you have objected to military acts that are atrocities or violate standards of international law; if you object to military service in conditions that amount to torture or inhumane treatment; if you are fleeing recruitment by a non-state group and the state is unable to protect you; or if you are a child resisting illegal recruitment., If you decide to pursue a refugee claim, be very careful with your choice of host country. You should file as a refugee in a country that will not send you back to your home country. For instance, the days of safely crossing the border to Canada as a US military objector are long over. While the legal landscape is not entirely clear, deserters and others can be arrested and deported to face trial under the terms of the current extradition treaty.Countries that don’t often deport US citizens include Ecuador, Russia, and Venezuela., The next step is to file a formal application seeking protection as a refugee. If you are outside of your target country, you will probably file as a refugee to the closest at the nearest embassy or consulate; if you are already inside the country or at a port of entry, you will apply as an asylum seeker. As part of your application you will also have to present proof of your claims of persecution.Make sure to consult an attorney at this stage, if possible. She can guide you through the sometimes complicated legal forms.
Keep in mind that the approval process will be lengthy. In Canada, for example, wait times can be as long as 36 months.You may not be able to work for part of this time, if you are allowed entry. In the United States, asylum applicants must wait 150 days before they can apply for work-status."
"
File for an exemption.,
Defer your service.,
Refuse to serve.",How to Avoid a Draft4," Most countries make certain exemptions from conscription. For example, religious students in Israel were until recently exempt from the draft.You are exempt from a future draft in the United States under the following conditions: you are from a family in which a parent or sibling has died or is missing in military action; your absence would cause your family economic hardship; you are a minister; you are in school to be a minister; you are an immigrant or dual citizen.Remember that the US does not currently have a draft. You can only file an exemption claim in the future, after getting orders to report, to the closest Selective Service office.Some countries, including the US until recently, prohibit homosexuals from serving. This is still the case in Turkey, where, however, you have to submit “proof” of your status by answering questions, providing pictures, or worse. Making use of this exemption can get you out of a draft, but can be traumatic and humiliating.Some countries also allow you to pay an exemption fee to get out of military service. In Turkey, this fee was recently lowered from 10,000 to 6,000 Euros. Still, the cost is so expensive that only well off families can afford it., If you are not exempt, you still may be able to put off entering the military. Many countries offer deferments for education, for example. According to US law, high school students may defer their service in any future draft until they graduate or reach the age of 20. College students may defer until the end of their term. You can defer your service until the end of your studies if you are becoming a minister.The law in the United States also provides for appeals to draft status. If, in the event of a future draft, you file to change your draft classification, you automatically get a deferral until your claim is processed., This is a final option. Just don’t do it. However, you will have to face harsh consequences for refusal. In the US, during wartime and peacetime drafts, people have been jailed for refusing to be inducted into the military. Muhammad Ali famously refused to be drafted to fight in the Vietnam War, for example, and he was indicted, sentenced to five years in prison, and stripped of his boxing titles. Under current law, men are required to register for selective service – for a future draft – and refusal to register is a criminal offense.In the United States, you can be prosecuted for refusing to register with Selective Service, though this has not happened since 1986.The government can also deny you federal student aid, employment with the government, or, if you are an eligible immigrant, US citizenship."

Purchase iron-on fusing tape (Stitch Witchery is one brand name) at a fabric or crafts store.,
Preheat the iron to the setting recommended on the fusing tape or interfacing.

,
Place the uniform or garment on an ironing board or table with the outside of the uniform or garment facing up.,
Cut the fusing tape to slightly smaller than the size of the patch.,
Remove the pin carefully and place the iron-on fusing tape on the uniform or garment and then the patch on top of it facing up, being careful to keep the patch in the same position.

,
Get a damp paper towel or damp white cloth (like an old t-shirt) to use as a pressing cloth.,
Press and hold the iron down on top of the press cloth for the length of time specified on the fusing tape directions, usually 15 to 30 seconds.,
Lift the press cloth off.,
Finished.

",How to Attach a Patch to a Uniform Using Iron on Fusing Tape," You can also buy a small piece of fusible interfacing to use instead of the fusing tape. 1⁄4 yard (0.2 m) should be enough for quite a few badges.;
,, Position the patch carefully making sure you know where you want it to go. Hold it in place with a straight pin or safety pin. Try on the uniform or garment to be sure the patch is correctly positioned. Put the uniform or garment back on the ironing board with the outside facing up.

, The slightly smaller part is important because you don't want to get the fusible stuff on the iron or press cloth.

,, Place the damp cloth or paper towel on top of the patch.

, If necessary lift the iron up and press it down again in an overlapping pattern to cover the whole patch. Usually the patch will be well-fused if the press cloth is dry where the iron was. Let the material cool for a minute or two.

, Check that the patch is well attached. If it is, the uniform or garment can now be laundered and dried and the patch should stay on fine.

Familiarize yourself with your weapon.,
Get comfortable adjusting windage, elevation and parallax.,
Practice good trigger control.,
Utilize proper breath control.,
Take wind movement around your target into account.,
Practice as often and as much with your sidearm as your primary weapon system.,
Learn to properly utilize cover and concealment.",How to Be a Sniper1," Everything becomes difficult under stress, which is exactly why a sniper must become intimately familiar with their weapon. Cleaning and maintaining your rifle of choice is only a portion of becoming familiar with it. You will also need to practice with it enough to learn what types of failures you may be able to expect and how to address them in a field situation. This can only be done by firing the weapon regularly and learning how it handles different situations.Many military snipers sleep with their weapons in field environments. The rifle has to feel like an extension of yourself in order to maximizing your effectiveness with the weapon.
Handling your weapon often will make leveling the rifle and capturing good sight picture a matter of muscle memory, allowing you to focus on your environment instead of your actions.
There are many types of rifles a sniper may use that include different firing mechanisms and ammunition, based on the situation and the sniper’s preference.;
, When using a rifle scope there are three adjustments you can make to help ensure your rounds impact the target. The windage adjusts your target’s impact point on the horizontal axis while the elevation will adjust it on vertical one. The parallax adjusts the reticle in your scope’s depth in relation to the target and is not a common adjustment in other forms of sport or competitive shooting.When firing, practice making adjustments to the parallax, windage and the elevation to gain a better understanding of how each adjustment affects the impact point of your round.
There are many different variations of rifle scopes that allow you to make adjustments in different ways and in different increments. Use one scope as your primary optic until you are as comfortable with it as you are with your weapon.

, At a distance, pulling a trigger can throw your round off course and result in missing your target. Instead, squeeze the trigger with slow steady pressure until it releases a round. Once the weapon fires, do not immediately release the trigger. Instead, hold it for a one count before letting go.Try counting down from five slowly as you squeeze the trigger to ensure you do not pull the trigger and shift the weapon.
Shifting a fraction of an inch at the point of the weapon can result in missing by inches or even feet at the target.

, Your breathing can also have a dramatic effect on the accuracy of your rounds at a distance. In order to fire accurately at long distances, you will need to learn to fire the weapon during the natural pause between exhaling a breath and inhaling a new one. This practice is referred to as “breath control.”Breath out slowly and squeeze the trigger in between breaths.
Firing during inhaling or exhaling could shift the weapon slightly, sending it off course.

, The windage setting on your rifle scope allows you to compensate for cross winds traveling from left to right or vice versa. However, snipers are often firing at distances that can make wind a bigger issue for concern. If the wind is blowing slightly where you are, but far stronger at the point of the target, it may throw off the round. Use binoculars to look for signs of strong wind around your target, and adjust your windage left or right to compensate.If the wind is blowing around you and the target in the same direction, you may need to adjust the windage further than usual to compensate for the wind the round will pass through on the way to the target.
Wind traveling in an opposing direction may require reducing your adjustment, as the wind traveling left to right at the target may negate some of the effect of wind traveling right to left around you.

, Snipers are trained to utilize cover to conceal their location from the enemy once in position, but getting to and from that position can be extremely dangerous. The nature of sniper rifles makes them less effective at close and medium range combat, due to long barrels, different firing mechanisms, and large optics in the way of your line of sight. Snipers carry sidearms, or pistols, to use in close quarters situations when their rifles would be less effective.You should become as familiar and effective with your sidearm as you are with your primary weapon, as it will be your first line of defense in close quarters combat.
Proper marksmanship fundamentals affect pistol accuracy as well as the rifle, but it may take more practice to get accustomed to firing a pistol under stress due to a lack of stability and shorter barrel.

, Cover and concealment are two different methods of protecting yourself from the enemy that are best when used together. Cover places actual objects between you and the enemy to stop enemy gunfire from reaching you. Concealment hides your presence from the enemy. When moving, stay conscious of things around you that may provide cover in the event of an enemy engagement. Wear dark or camouflaged clothing to aid in your concealment from the enemy.Common forms of concealment utilized by snipers include face paint, camouflage and even incorporating the fauna and plant life in the area by placing it on or attaching it to their clothing.
Proper concealment should stop incoming gunfire. Large rocks, buildings and thick trees could all serve as cover. However, car doors, drywall or plywood will not stop rounds and should not be utilized as cover.

Establish an environmental baseline.,
Take note of abnormal behavior.,
Avoid locking your focus on specific things.,
Try to predict upcoming events around you.,
Trust your gut.",How to Be a Sniper2," Being a sniper is not all about firing at long distance targets; snipers are often responsible for gathering reconnaissance and general operations beyond fortified front lines. Because of the danger of being alone or in small groups with very little support, it’s imperative that a sniper learn to quickly establish environmental norms for their situation. Be conscious of your environment and the sights, sounds and activities that should be normal so you can more readily identify things that aren’t.In a city, the environmental baseline would likely include the sounds of traffic, lots of people conversing, and crowded streets.
In a wooded area, the sounds of insects, wind in the trees and far off highways may create the baseline.
Pay attention to your surroundings and use previous experiences to inform you as to what to expect.

, Once you have determined what the environmental baseline is, you can begin to asses any abnormal behavior or circumstances in the area around you. If the insects in the forest suddenly stop making noise, or traffic in the city is suddenly interrupted it likely means there is something out of the ordinary going on. In day to day life, it’s normal to tell yourself that sound you heard was nothing to worry about, but as a sniper forward of enemy lines, you can’t afford to make such assumptions.The tendency to think abnormal things going on will work out fine is called the “normalcy bias” and it can prevent you from reacting to dangerous situations quickly enough.
If you notice something out of the ordinary, make note of it but don’t focus all of your attention on it.

, Combatting the normalcy bias requires an intense focus on your surroundings, but it’s important not to allow that focus to linger too long on any one thing. If you devote your full attention to one thing in your field of view, you may not notice other risks developing around you. Make note of things you notice, but continue to survey your surroundings for other threats. Focusing on one thing to the detriment of noticing others is referred to as “focus lock.”With your attention held by a possible target in front of you, you may not notice other threats forming behind you.
Like driving in a car, you don’t stare at the guard rail hoping not to hit it, but you maintain your awareness of it while looking at the road ahead of you.

, Use the expertise you develop from forming environmental baselines, combatting the normalcy bias and avoiding focus lock to begin to predict the behaviors of people around you. As you observe others, you will find that behavior often fits patterns. By identifying these patterns (such as taxi cabs stopping more frequently than other cars, people jogging when crossing busy streets instead of walking and so forth) you can begin to predict events around you. Once you can form an educated prediction of what should occur in the near future, you will be better prepared to identify risks if things change.By predicting the actions of those in your field of view, you will notice unusual behavior from individuals sooner than by strictly observing them.
The more you observe and predict, the better you will become at picking out unusual circumstances.

, As a sniper, you will often work in pairs or small groups with very little outside support. Sometimes, you or someone you are with may develop a “bad feeling” about a situation that may be difficult to articulate. Don’t simply disregard these feelings, as your body may be interpreting information you haven’t consciously considered yet. If you or your partner has a bad feeling about your location or situation, it’s often best to act on that feeling.You may have unconsciously noticed something that increases the risk factor of your current situation, but failed to consciously consider it.
Finding a new vantage point is always better than compromising the mission or losing your life because you disregarded your gut feeling.

"
Stay calm.,
Maintain focus on the objective at hand.,
Train your body for the rigors of combat.,
Distance yourself emotionally.,
Practice often and with intensity.",How to Be a Sniper3," The vast majority of a day in the life of sniper in the field is waiting. This time, often spent alone or with one other person, is often silent and in some cases even moving can compromise your position and put you and your team at risk. It is essential to stay calm as a sniper, whether its during movement to or from an objective, while waiting to conduct reconnaissance, or in the face of the enemy.Keeping a cool head will allow you to properly utilize your training and expertise to handle the situation at hand.
There are many stories of snipers being surrounded by enemies in combat situations that survived because of their ability to remain calm and concealed as the enemy passed.

, With all the waiting around one is apt to do as a sniper, it can be easy to lose sight of what you’re there to be doing. After three days of seeing nothing, your mind may begin to wander instead of remaining focused on your objective. Combat this loss of focus by frequently reminding yourself of your objectives and how important it is to your team’s safety that you stay attentive.Getting too comfortable and allowing your mind to drift is a form of complacency. Complacency kills in a combat zone, as you must always be aware of your surroundings.
Mission accomplishment is, and should always be, the number one priority of a sniper.

, Although there may be hours of waiting around, being a sniper also means moments of extreme physical stress. Because of this, physical fitness is paramount for a sniper. Covering ground quickly to put you and your team in a better position to achieve your objectives, or to get to an extraction point means having the cardiovascular strength to run quickly for extended periods of time. Carrying all of the gear necessary for your mission will also require physical strength. Developing a strong body will help you to adjust to stressful combat situations, recover from injuries, and aid team members if they are injured.Snipers must be among the most physically fit combatants on the battlefield.
Incorporate a good deal of running and some weight training into your workout regimen as a sniper.

, Being a sniper in a combat zone will likely mean having to make the decision to end a life. There is no universal strategy for coping with this choice, or the feelings that may arise as a result. However, distancing yourself from your target emotionally can help to lessen the emotional repercussions of killing another person in defense of your country.Chris Kyle, a highly decorated Navy sniper, often taught people to focus on the lives they were saving by engaging the enemy, rather than on the lives of the enemy that they were taking.
Although you may spend a significant amount of time observing your target, it’s important not to allow yourself to become attached to them.

, Being a sniper means long periods of inaction followed by infrequent and extremely intense moments of action. It can be difficult to predict how a person may react in a firefight, but you can minimize the chances that you will make a mistake by practicing every element of your craft frequently and with the same intensity you might in an actual firefight. This includes firing your weapon, exercising and learning new skills. By practicing as though you are in a combat situation, you will be better prepared to handle one when it arises.Just like playing sports, frequent practice can help you to do the things you need to do even when the situation around you is hectic.
By training how you would perform in a real scenario, you can help your body adjust to the stresses of combat ahead of time.

The conference creates a dedicated site each year for that year's conference, but you can reach it from the main website.The annual conference website provides dates and schedules, as well as a list of federal agencies and large corporations that will be attending or presenting at the conference.
You also can learn information about the conference itself and the opportunity it presents to veterans who own small businesses.
The conference has resources for veterans whose businesses are at all levels of development. Whether you are just starting out or have been in business for several years, you may be able to find resources at the conference that would benefit your business.
As the date of the conference draws near, the website offers more detail about the presentations and sessions offered as well as the presenters and other attendees.;
, On the conference's website, you'll find a detailed chart that lists the registration fees. These fees vary depending on the size of your business, whether your business is veteran-owned, and the date you register for the conference.Even if you aren't a veteran, and no owners of your business are, you still are welcome to attend the conference – although you'll have to pay higher registration fees.
The registration fee increases the longer you wait to register. You'll pay the least for your registration fees if you register as early as possible. The flip side of this is that you may not have as much information about the presentations and speakers offered.
Each person attending must pay a separate registration fee. You'll want to decide how many people from your business you want to attend so you can budget the costs of attending the conference.

, If you want to participate in the expo portion of the conference by setting up a booth for your business, you must pay additional registration fees and meet the conference's deadlines.For example, the exhibit booth fees for a veteran-owned small business at the 2016 convention were $1500, and you had to provide a logo and description of your business to the conference organizers by August 31.
If you plan to have a booth, you typically will want to bring people along to staff your booth so you have the freedom to network and attend sessions. Booth staff pay a significantly lower registration fee than regular attendees.
You also will have to plan your materials for the booth. The NVSBE provides an exhibitor guide that describes the complimentary resources that are provided by the conference to all exhibitors.
Any materials you need for your exhibit that aren't provided by the conference must be brought to the conference, as well as dismantled and removed promptly.

, After reading all the information about the conference on the website, you may decide you want to attend. You can quickly and easily complete your registration from the conference's website.When you click the ""register"" button, you'll get a basic form that asks how many people you want to register, and what type of registration you're requesting.
The registration fees are automatically calculated based on the date you begin the registration process.
Once you indicate your registration preferences, you'll be taken to another screen where you'll provide basic information about your business and the people who will be attending.

, After you begin registration, you'll reach a page where you can provide information about yourself and your business. If more than one person from your business will be attending, they must each log on individually to complete their own profiles.The first page requires you to enter basic contact information, as well as answer questions about whether you're a veteran and whether you require any disability accommodations.
You also have the option of providing a link to your LinkedIn profile or a brief personal biography.
Pay attention to the required fields. You typically must provide information in those fields before you can continue.
If you cannot complete the entire profile in one sitting, you have the option of saving the draft so you can come back to it later.
Once you've completed your profile, be prepared to pay your registration fees using a major credit or debit card.

, Each year, the conference will make arrangements with several hotels in addition to the one where the conference is taking place. By staying in one of these hotels, you can take advantage of discounted group rates.In addition to the official convention hotel, you typically will see another three or four hotels within a half-mile of the convention site listed.
These hotels typically are large city hotels with business-class amenities such as concierge service, in-room Wi-Fi, business facilities, and other recreational amenities.
Many of these hotels also have a number of shops and restaurants on site, and may offer free hotel shuttles to various local attractions.
The conference also may arrange for discounts on reservations at smaller hotels further away from the convention site. Contact the conference organizers if you're interested in these options.

, The earlier you register for the conference, the lower your registration fees will be. Another benefit to registering early is that you get your pick of rooms at the convention hotels before they sell out.This is especially true if you require accommodations for a disability. All hotels have handicap-accessible rooms, but they are limited in number.
As a general rule, you can expect that the convention hotels will be booked solid a few months before the conference begins.
You also should keep in mind that if you intend to stay additional nights, either before or after the convention, you may not be able to get the discounted rate for your entire stay.

, Particularly if you're flying to the conference, you'll want to sort out how you're going to get around ahead of time. The conference website has information on the public and private transportation options available in the city hosting the conference.If you're staying at one of the convention hotels and don't plan on doing much sight-seeing during the conference, transportation may be less of a priority. In this case, hotel shuttles and the occasional taxi may suffice.
However, if you're staying a bit further away from the convention, or bringing family along with you, review the public transportation options to determine if you'll need to rent a car.
If the conference is close enough that you plan to drive, you also want to evaluate the parking options available at the conference, and whether you need to purchase a parking pass in advance.

, The conference is held at a different location each year, typically a relatively large metropolitan area. If the conference is being held in a city you've never visited, you probably want to do a little research about the area.The location also may impact your transportation decisions. For example, if the conference is being held in New York City, there's probably no need for you to rent a car as public transportation is plentiful.
The average weather in the location also is an important consideration. The conference typically takes place in November, when weather patterns can differ dramatically across the United States.
You want to bring appropriate clothes for the weather, and the attire you choose for a conference in Florida will differ significantly from what you would wear at a conference in Minnesota.
If you anticipate doing a little sight-seeing or perhaps going out to dinner, you may want to look into popular restaurants, historical landmarks, or other tourist attractions in the area.

, The NVSBE offers a lot of different resources and opportunities to network with investors and other small business owners. You'll get more out of the conference if you analyze your business and determine which areas should be your main focus.For example, suppose you run a small business that machines parts used in many types of military equipment. You would want to focus on military procurement officers in attendance at the NVSBE.
Many diverse businesses attend the NVSBE, and there are numerous government agencies and large businesses that are looking to work with them. Go through the lists of corporate and government attendees to find the ones that most attract your interest.
Your business's development also should be a concern. For example, if you're just getting your business off the ground and are looking for start-up investors, you wouldn't want to waste your time at the conference speaking with someone who's looking for a business that has been established for at least five years.

, In addition to your basic business cards, you should create brochures about your business and what you have to offer. You also should create a brief pitch to use to sell your business to potential clients and procurement officers.You may already have business cards, but you should consider having new ones made for the conference that include your photo. This way people who've met hundreds of people at the conference and collected hundreds of business cards will be able to put a face with a name.
If your business has a particular icon or logo, make sure it's prominent on any printed materials you take with you to the conference.
Having a scripted and practiced pitch will allow you to make connections with other business owners more quickly.
Being able to briefly communicate your business's goals and what you have to offer also keeps you from wasting too much time.
If you're speaking with someone who is in a different industry or has no need for your services, you'll find this out immediately – rather than chit-chatting for 20 minutes only to discover that the two of you have nothing to offer each other.

, Each year, a number of government officers in charge of procuring contractors for government projects attend the NVSBE. You can find details about these procurement decision makers (PDMs) on the NVSBE website.Think of these opportunities as being similar to a job interview. If you look at the list of PDMs before the conference, you have the opportunity to learn more about them and the types of businesses they're looking for in advance.
You can then use your research to establish a deeper connection with the PDMs that could potentially benefit your business.
Your research also can give you an indication of your best angle of approach and how to target your pitch to that particular PDM.

, You can find a detailed agenda for the days of the conference on the NVSBE website. Mapping out your own schedule based on this agenda enables you to get the most out of the conference.You don't want to spend time during the conference trying to figure out what you want to do next. Typically conference agendas are tight, and you could wind up missing something that would have been of great benefit if you don't plan ahead of time.
Scheduling your meals also gives you a leg up because you can invite those with whom you've connected to join you. For example, if you've chosen a nearby restaurant for dinner one night and made reservations, you can invite someone along with minimal fuss.
Maintaining a schedule and knowing where you're going to go also creates a strong, positive impression at the convention. You want to look like someone who knows where you're going and what you're doing (even if you don't), not like the stereotypical bewildered and disorganized conference attendee.

Consider filing a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).",How to Apply for Military Family Leave1," You can request FMLA leave for up to 12 weeks if your spouse, parent, or child will be deployed on active duty to a foreign country. Your leave request must be for at least one of the seven allowed reasons, and the total leave for which you're eligible may depend on the reason.You may take up to 12 weeks of leave for military events and related activities including post-deployment activities, child care and school activities, counseling, or financial and legal arrangements.
If your spouse, parent, or child is called to duty with notice of seven days or less, you may take up to seven calendar days of leave to handle any issues related to that short-notice deployment.
If your spouse, parent, or child is on short-term, temporary leave from active duty for rest and recuperation, you may take up to five days of FMLA leave to be with him or her.;
, General FMLA guidelines allow employers to require you to give at least 30 days' notice if you plan to take time off using FMLA leave. However, in some circumstances you may not know about your need to take leave this far in advance, especially if your family member is deployed on short notice.Keep in mind that the regular FMLA rules apply to your request for military family leave.
You don't have to request all of your leave be taken at the same time. You can ask for intermittent leave within the same leave request, or request a reduced schedule rather than time completely off work.
The amount of leave to which you are entitled is a maximum during a single 12-month period.The 12 weeks you're allowed to request for military family leave is not in addition to regular FMLA leave.
For example, if you have already used six weeks of FMLA leave for your own serious health condition, you only have six weeks of leave available for qualifying exigency leave.

, If you are requesting leave for a qualifying exigency, your employer may require documentation of your relationship to the service member and details regarding his or her deployment.After you've notified your employer of your request for leave under the FMLA, you have 15 calendar days to supply any information required by your employer to certify your request.
If you don't provide sufficient information within 15 days, your employer may lawfully deny your request.
Your employer may request a copy of the military member's active duty orders or other military documentation indicating the military member's deployment.
You also may be required to provide additional documentation of the particular reason you're requesting leave, such as copies of bills for legal or financial arrangements, announcements of meetings or events, or appointment confirmation letters.
If you are meeting a third party, your employer may ask for contact information to confirm the reasons for the leave you've requested.

, Within five days of your request, or after you've provided the required information to certify your request, your employer must inform you of whether you are eligible to take leave under FMLA, and whether your request for leave has been approved.If your employer determines you aren't eligible for FMLA leave, the notice must specify the reasons you are ineligible.
If your request is approved, the notice will include the dates for which your leave has been approved.
FMLA leave is unpaid, but portions of your leave may include paid leave if your employer offers paid leave and requires you to exhaust any paid leave you've accrued before FMLA kicks in.
Keep in mind that while you're on leave you're still responsible for covering your health insurance premiums, if you have health insurance through your employer that is deducted from your paycheck.
Your leave notice will include instructions on how to calculate the amount you owe and how and when to pay your monthly premiums.

, If you believe your employer has wrongfully denied your right to FMLA leave, you can file an administrative complaint with the Wages and Hours Division of the DOL.You can call the Wages and Hours Division at 1-866-487-9243 between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday.

Locate a site's emergency routes and exits.,
Try to stay calm throughout the crisis.,
Evaluate your surroundings if you hear gunfire or see a shooter.,
Avoid running blindly at the sound of gunfire.,
Evacuate the area if you’re near an exit.,
Help others escape and stay calm if you're in a crowd.,
Hide out if evacuation isn’t possible.,
Call emergency services as soon as possible.,
Take defensive action as a last resort.",How to React to Gunfire1," You don't have to constantly assume that the worst will happen, but it's wise to notice the available routes and exits you could take in an emergency. Whether you're at an concert, restaurant, or a crowded city street, try to keep your bearings and know where you could run if necessary.Initial responses to an emergency are often instinctive, and knowing escape routes beforehand is especially helpful in a crowded situation.;
, Witnessing gunfire can be a frightening experience, but you must do your best to remain calm. Try to think clearly and strategically to find the safest position available. If you call emergency services or encounter law enforcement, staying calm will help you communicate any necessary information., When you first notice something is wrong, stop what you’re doing and drop anything you're holding. If you’re standing conspicuously near a shooter, drop down flat to the floor. If you can determine where the gunfire originated, run away in the opposite direction., Run away if you’re close to an exit, have a clear idea of where you’re heading, and can determine the direction where you heard shots. By running without thinking about where you’re going, you might head into the direction of the gunfire or attract the attention of the shooter., If an exit is close and you heard gunfire from an opposite direction, head straight for that exit and away from the building. Leave your belongings behind, do not attempt to move any wounded, and keep your hands visible so that emergency responders can see you’re unarmed.Avoid running to an exit down a hallway. If an exit is down a long hallway, you might run into the shooter en route, so try to find an alternate exit or hide in a room that locks instead.

, A densely crowded crisis situation can be chaotic and confusing, but cooperation in extreme situations offers the best chances of safe evacuation. As you make your way to safety, try to help others escape as calmly and quickly as possible.If you know the direction to safety, try to point the way to others.
If others are panicking, try to calm them and, if possible, give them direction. Say something like, ""Everything will be OK, but we have to stay calm and find cover. Let's head for the far side of this building away from the direction we heard gunshots.""

, If you can’t evacuate the area, try to stay out of sight and away from the shooter. If you’re indoors, find a room that locks, barricade the door, and turn off the lights. If you’re outside, try to find cover or a hiding spot, such as a parked car, patch of trees, brick wall, or other large, sturdy object., As soon as you’ve evacuated or secured a hiding spot, contact emergency services. If you’re in a group, have one person call to avoid tying up the emergency lines.Let them know your location, the number of people in your group, any injury information, and any information available about the shooter.

, Your priorities should be to flee or hide. If a shooter confronts you and your life is in imminent danger, defend yourself as a last resort. Try to disrupt or incapacitate the shooter by:Acting as aggressively as possible
Throwing objects
Using improvised weapons, such as a purse, belt, paperweight, or other nearby object

Provide the required evidence supporting your request.,
Receive your employer's decision.,
Contest any wrongful denial with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).",How to Apply for Military Family Leave2," You can request up to 26 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a seriously ill or injured family member who is a current service member or veteran. The service member's injury or illness generally must have been incurred in the line of duty, or while the person was on active duty.The definition of ""family member"" is expanded for military caregivers relative to the usual FMLA leave. While the FMLA generally only covers leave to care for your spouse, parents, or children, you also can request military leave to care for your ""next of kin,"" which includes other blood relatives such as siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and first cousins.
However, if you are requesting military caregiver leave under a next-of-kin designation, you must be able to prove that you are the only relative of the service member who qualifies for FMLA leave.
Your leave request must be to care for your family member while he or she is treated or recovers from a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty. The injury or illness also can be pre-existing if service in the line of duty exacerbated the condition.
An injury or illness generally is considered serious if it renders the service member medically unfit to perform the duties of his or her military office, rank, grade, or rating.
If your family member is a veteran, he or she must have been discharged within five years of your first leave request.

, While the FMLA allows you to take as many as 26 weeks, this leave is unpaid. Before you max out the leave available, evaluate exactly how much time you need to care for your family member.The FMLA allows 26 weeks within a single 12-month period. This 26 weeks is not in addition to any other leave, so if you've already taken FMLA leave you must consider that amount in your calculation of the amount of leave you have available.
As with other types of leave, you can request time off intermittently, or in the form of a reduced schedule. For example, if your family member has physical therapy for three hours every morning, you may want to work until lunch time and then take off in the afternoons.

, Under the FMLA, you're generally required to notify your employer at least 30 days before you need to take your leave. If you are unable to provide that much notice, you should be prepared to tell your employer why.When you make your leave request, you should state specifically that you are requesting military caregiver leave under the FMLA.
Outline the reasons for your request, and let your employer know that you are willing to supply any evidence needed to support your request.
Within five days of receipt of your request, your employer must notify you whether your leave is covered by the FMLA and provide a list of any documents required to certify your request.

, Your employer may request documentation proving your relationship to a covered service member and the reason for your leave, including evidence of the service member's serious injury or illness.If your employer requests supporting documentation, you have 15 calendar days to provide sufficient information or your employer may deny your request for leave.
Your employer may request contact information for the service member's authorized healthcare provider, the type of medical practice, and whether the practice is affiliated with the military.
You also may have to provide facts about the service member's condition, his or her diagnosis, the likely duration of the condition, and estimates of the time period and frequency of necessary treatments.
Your employer also may request proof of the service member's branch, rank, and unit assignment, as well as his or her date and type of separation in the case of veterans.

, Once your employer receives your request and any required documents to certify the reasons for your request, you will be notified within five days of whether your employer has granted or denied your request for leave.Keep in mind that you are not protected by FMLA if you take time off before your employer has approved your specific request. If you have to leave early or miss work before then, you must follow your employer's normal policies for calling out.
If your employer approves your request either in whole or in part, the notice will include the dates or times for which you've been approved to take FMLA leave.
If you have health insurance through your employer, the notice also may contain information on how to continue to pay your health insurance premium while you are on leave.
Your employer may require you to substitute your requested FMLA leave with any accrued paid leave. These amounts will be included in your notice.

, If your employer refuses to grant you leave under the FMLA and you believe your employer's reasons are false or inadequate, you can file an administrative complaint with the DOL's Wages and Hours Division.If you have questions or want to file a complaint, you can call the DOL's helpline from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern time Monday through Friday. The toll-free number is 1-866-487-9243.
You also can file a complaint in person by visiting the DOL office nearest you.
If you plan to file a complaint, make sure you have information ready, including the name and contact information of your employer, details about your leave request, and the stated reasons your employer denied your request.

Try to find a room that locks.,
Try to escape through the window if possible.,
If others are with you, stick together as a group.",How to React to Gunfire2," If you’re indoors and immediate evacuation isn’t possible, look for a nearby room with a door that locks. Barricade the door with the heaviest furniture in the room. Turn off the lights, silence your cell phone, and call emergency services as soon as safely possible.Don’t peek through or open the door to see what’s happening outside.
Don’t activate the fire alarm if you hear gunfire indoors.

, If the room is on the ground floor or has a fire escape, see if you can safely flee through the window. If window escape is not possible, find covered positions within the room, such as behind a copy machine or under a desk. Take cover and wait until law enforcement arrives., If you’re locked in a room with other people, take a count to keep track of each member of the group. Quietly make a group decision about what to do if the shooter enters the room, such as rushing at the shooter with improvised weapons while others shout and throw objects.When hiding with a group, spread out throughout your space. Huddling together can offer a shooter an easier target.

Drop, then quickly move to better cover.,
Hide and contact emergency services.,
Hide near the engine block when using a car as a barricade.",How to React to Gunfire3," If you’re in an open area, drop flat to the ground to evade gunfire as soon as you hear shots. Try to determine where the shots came from, and move out of the line of fire to the nearest available cover.Look for bushes, a brick wall, a ditch, or any other feature that puts you out of sight.
If there's no cover within a two to three second sprint from your location, drop to the ground and crawl to cover.

, Once you’ve found cover or a relatively secure place, hide there, stay down, and don’t move. Don’t raise your head or peek out to see what’s happening. If you have a cell phone, call emergency services when you believe you can safely do so., If you’re hiding inside a car, stay down, as windows obviously offer no protection. If you're using a car as cover from shooting, do your best to get away from the area where the gas/petrol tank is situated, which is usually just ahead of the rear axle. Try to hide behind the engine block by one of the front wheels.

, As soon as possible, you should tell your employer that you need to take FMLA leave. Don’t just say, “I need time off.” Your boss might not know that you are specifically requesting FMLA leave.


After you request the leave, your employer has five business days to check whether you qualify for FMLA leave.For this reason, it is important to be specific that you are requesting FMLA leave when you speak to your employer.

, Your employer might request that you “certify” why you need exigency leave. Your boss should provide you with a form to fill out. The form will generally request the following information:a copy of the military member’s active duty orders
a statement describing why you qualify for the exigency leave, including written supporting documentation

As such, Marines are expected to be able to prove their strength and endurance. Poolees must pass the Initial Strength Test (IST) at the beginning of their training and the Physical Fitness Test (PFT) at the end of their training to become Marines. Additionally, Marines are subjected to an annual test called the Combat Fitness Test (CFT). Knowing the passing standards for these tests can help you judge your physical ability before arriving at boot comp.;
, The IST takes place at the end of the initial three-day ""Receiving Phase"" of Marine boot camp. The three components of the IST are Pull-ups/Flexed-arm hangs, crunches, and a timed run.Pull-up/Flexed-arm hang: Men must be able to complete two full pull-ups to begin training. Women need to be able to hold a flexed-arm hang (starting in the ""up"" position of a pull-up and maintaining elbow flexion for as long as possible) for twelve seconds.
Crunches: Both men and women must be able to complete 44 full crunches (elbows or forearms to knees) in two minutes.
Timed run: Men must be able to run 1.5 miles (2.4 km) in 13:30, while women must be able to run the same 1.5 mile (2.4 km) course in 15 minutes.

, The exercises in the PFT are the same as in the IST, but the standards are more difficult. These standards assume a 17-26 year-old poolee - standards decrease slightly with age. See below:Pull-up/Flexed-arm hang: Men must be able to complete three full pull-ups. Women must be able to hold a flexed-arm hang for 15 seconds. Note that, although the Corps originally planned to extend the three pull-up requirement to women in 2014, this has been delayed.Crunches: Both men and women must be able to complete 50 full crunches in two minutes.
Timed run: Men must be able to run 3 miles (4.8 km) in 28 minutes, while women must be able to run 3 miles (4.8 km) in 31 minutes.

, Passing the CFT is an annual requirement for all Marines. The CFT tests the Marine's ability to apply his or her physical abilities in combat situations. The CFT has three components, each with a maximum score of 100 points. Thus, a perfect score in the CFT is 300 points. Minimum scores for each test vary based on the recruit's age and sex.Movement to combat: This is a timed 880-yard obstacle course that tests the Marine's speed and endurance. A maximum score is 2:45 for men and 3:23 for women.
Ammunition lift: The Marine must lift a 30-lb box of ammunition over his or her head (until his or her elbows lock) as many times as possible. A maximum score is 91 repetitions for men and 61 repetitions for women.
Maneuver under fire: This shuttle run incorporates a variety of combat tasks, including running, crawls, carries, throwing grenades, and more. A maximum score is 2:14 for men and 3:01 for women.

, Being able to just barely pass the minimum standards of the IST upon arrival at boot camp is not advisable. Recruits who scrape by the IST will have the hardest time adjusting to the intense physical demands of Marine life. In addition, they are more at risk for injury than other recruits and may be required to enroll in remedial strength and cardio courses. These things distract from the recruit's combat training and make it more difficult (but by no means impossible) for him or her to become a Marine. So, it's a smart idea to be able to pass the IST with ease and to be, at the very least, well on your way to passing the PFT by the time you arrive. Use the months before your ship date wisely!

, In addition to being able to pass the running portions of the IST and PFT, Marines are expected to be quick on their feet and to have high aerobic endurance so that they can hustle from task to task. Your running routine should be a combination of jogging, running and sprints in order to increase your quickness. As you run, be sure to breathe deeply, maintain a quick but reasonable pace, and maintain proper form. Your feet should make contact with the ground right in front of your heel - near the ball of your foot. Your point of contact should then ""roll"" forward, allowing you to push off with your toes.


Many recruits have success using a form interval training to increase their aerobic endurance and decrease their run times. Below is a sample interval training regimen from Military.com. Let's assume a goal pace of 6 minutes per mile, which equals 3 minutes per 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km), 90 seconds per 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km), etc.:Run 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km) at your goal pace.
Walk or jog 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) to rest.
Repeat the above two steps 4-6 times.
Run 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) at your goal pace.
Walk or jog 1⁄8 mile (0.2 km) to rest.
Repeat the above two steps 4-6 times.
Run 1⁄8 mile (0.2 km) at your goal pace.
Walk or jog 100 yards (91.4 m) to res.
Repeat the above two steps 4-6 times.


Aim to consistently perform your running regimen, whether it's interval training or single, long runs, 4-5 times per week.

, Marines are expected to be able to march and move through difficult terrain while carrying their gear with them. Make a habit of hiking - it's great exercise and will increase your endurance, toughen your feet, and develop your back, ankles, and other muscles for the outdoor activities that are part of Marine life. When you hike, take a heavy camping-style backpack. You may also want to place weights in it to better simulate the feeling of hiking around terrain with a 30-60 lb. pack containing munitions, clothing, gear, etc.

, Pull-ups and flexed-arm hangs are core components of the IST and PFT for men and women, respectively. Both exercises are feats of upper-body strength, using multiple muscle groups essential for combat effectiveness.


To perform full pull-ups, first grab onto the bar with your hands facing toward or away from you. Hang from the bar with your arms fully extended. Your knees can be straight or bent, but they cannot be bent past your waist. From the rest position, raise your chin until it is above the bar, then lower your body until your arms are completely straight, pause, and repeat.

In order to train for the pull-up test, you will want to purchase a pull-up bar or a membership to a gym with suitable pull-up equipment. If you're unable to do a pull-up, you may slowly build up your ability by using an assisted pull-up machine or asking a friend to spot you by grabbing your legs and supporting some of your body weight. Finally, you can make pull-ups easier by beginning at the top and lowering yourself down or by kicking your legs to increase momentum.
You may also want to strengthen your upper back, biceps, and triceps through strength-training exercises.


Women are required to pass a flexed arm hang test, rather than a pull-up test. They do, however, have the option to do pull-ups. Like men, women should build their back, bicep, and tricep strength by lifting weights, performing assisted pull-ups, and, of course, working on increasing their flexed-arm hang time.

, In addition to meeting the standards of the IST and PFT, Marines are expected to be good swimmers. If you have never learned to swim and properly balance yourself in the water, the Marine swimming tests will be quite difficult to pass. You should be able to swim over a mile without stopping. Try swimming 3 times per week for 45 minutes each day to increase lung capacity and build up your legs, shoulders and arms for endurance.


Marine swimming qualifications now come in three levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Every Marine must achieve Basic certification, which requires the Marine to shed his or her gear in the water in less than 10 seconds, jump off of a tower into the water and tread water for four minutes, and then pull his or her pack across the length of a 25-meter pool. These must be done in uniform, including boots.
Many public pools, schools and gyms offer swim classes. If you are unsure whether you are performing the crawl stroke or underwater swimming strokes correctly, take a class to improve your form.

, Core strength, as measured by crunches, is one of the core components of both the IST and the PFT. In addition, building your core is a vital step for avoiding injury to your back, which can result from intense exercise (especially while carrying heavy loads). Be sure to introduce a well-rounded ab routine into your weekly fitness plan - you'll want to work your obliques, lower abs, and hips frequently - every day, if you can. Sit-ups, crunches, planks, and hanging leg raises are great choices for increasing your ab strength


The crunch component of the IST and the PFT is, in a sense, a speed test - don't forget you have a time limit of two minutes to complete your crunches. Do your ab exercises as quickly as you can while maintaining proper form and control. You may want to use a stopwatch to record your time.
Core strength isn't just about your abs. Other good exercises for crucial, injury-preventing core strength are squats, lunges, and deadlifts. Use proper form with these exercises to avoid back strain.

, A proper diet is absolutely essential for building the muscle you'll need to meet your physical requirements as a Marine. Your diet should consist of healthy carbohydrates, protein and fats. Cut down (and aim to eliminate) sugars, excessively fatty foods, and preservatives from your diet. It's worth noting that Marines are expected to keep a healthy level of body fat - if they exceed certain standards for weight and body fat composition, they are enrolled in a weight loss program. Failure to pass this program can potentially result in discharge.When it comes to carbohydrates, try to get the majority of your carbs from leafy green vegetables, fruits, and healthy whole grains. Limit your starches like sliced bread and potatoes. Proteins should come from lean meats with proportions that are approximately the size of your palm. Healthy fats are found in nuts, eggs and vegetable oil and should be served in proportions approximately the size of a golf ball.
Upon arrival in boot camp, people who are deemed underweight for their size will be given weight boosting rations. People who are deemed overweight will be given a calorie restricted diet. Training for boot camp in advance can help you to gain or lose body weight so that you fit in your standard weight category.
While training for boot camp, eat 3 well-balanced meals per day, with a snack between breakfast and lunch and lunch and dinner. This will help your body to recover from training sessions and stay healthy. As you get closer to boot camp, try to eliminate the snacks, since they will not be part of boot camp.

, Hydration is an essential part of any workout routine. Since the workouts you'll undergo as a Marine may very well be the most intense you'll have to deal with in your life, it's a very smart idea to develop good hydration habits before boot camp. Drink plenty of water every day - more so if you exercise. Drink electrolyte drinks (like Gatorade, etc.) during intense endurance training to help refuel your body's supply of electrolytes, which are lost through sweat. In general, you should aim to drink 1 oz. of water for every 2 lbs. of body weight, or about 8-12 cups of water a day for large men.


Low fat milk and, depending on the sugar content, pure fruit juice are also healthy hydrating drinks.
Keep in mind that the two Marine Corps boot camps are located at Parris Island, South Carolina, and in San Diego, California. Both of these locations can be very hot, depending on the time of year, so hydration may become an even more important part of your workout than it was previously, especially if you're used to a more mild climate.

, If the Marine Corps' boot camp were solely about becoming physically fit, it would be difficult, but manageable for nearly all recruits with a willingness to work hard. What makes boot camp for Marines so incredibly demanding is that it also is an intense test of a recruit's abilities of intelligence, focus, and character - in short, their mental strength. Even athletic recruits sometimes wash out of boot camp because of the mental stress they're put under. Upon arrival at boot camp, be ready to immediately be thrust into a world where you are not entitled to the courtesy and respect you are accustomed to from civilian life. Get ready to be shouted at, insulted, disrespected, embarrassed, and otherwise treated like dirt.



Also, prepare to obey the very people who are shouting at you and insulting you at the drop of a hat, because any laziness or back-sass on your part will be met with harsh consequences.

, Marine boot camp is no place for personal luxuries. Recruits are expected to leave everything but the absolute essentials at home.


Below are the bare necessities recommended by Military.com for boot camp:Valid Driver's License or Photo ID
Approximately $10-20
The clothes on your back

, Marine Corps boot camp is an endeavor that lasts over three months. During this time, your contact with your friends and family back home will be very limited. Usually, recruits are given one phone call of about 30 seconds to notify their family that they have arrived safely soon after arriving. After this, phone use is very limited, if it is allowed all. Some DI's may give phone time as a reward, while others may not. To be conservative, plan on not using the phone until the last week of training, if at all, and plan on not seeing your loved ones until Family Day, which takes place the day before your graduation.


Your family and loved ones may send you letters, but even this comes with several stipulations. Letters should be completely plain and unadorned with no decorations or special envelopes and addressed to ""Rct. (Recruit) Last Name, First Name"". Make sure your family members understand not to specify a rank other than ""recruit"", not to send frilly or decorative envelopes, and to not send packages. These things will call undesirable attention to you.

, Marine Drill Instructors (or ""DI's"") have achieved a legendary status for their tough, confrontational instruction style. They are loud, mean, and in-your-face. However, they are fair - they will absolutely not ever coddle any single recruit or allow him or her any special mercy. Understand that, by pushing you to your limits, the DI is, in a sense, helping you. Marine Corps life isn't easy - as a Marine, you may even be called upon to give your life for the country. To be an effective Marine, you must be capable of making level-headed decisions in the middle of a battlefield. As tough as the DI's are, you may find eventually that you're glad they were able to instill Marine values of strength and discipline in you if you are ever involved in combat.


Even the slightest mistakes can warrant punishment. Merely looking at a DI incorrectly can get you a tongue lashing; a tiny mistake when cleaning your rifle can lead to what is called Incentive Physical Training (IPT), i.e. being ordered to do push-ups, mountain climbers, side straddle hops (AKA jumping jacks), leg lifts, etc. By holding you to incredibly exacting standards, the DI's help you gain the strength and attention to detail you'll need in the field.

, One of the very first things that happens to recruits at boot camp is for their hair to be altered to meet military specifications. Men are more or less shaved bald, while women receive short haircuts or have their hair tied in a bun. This is done for an important reason. Marines are expected to sacrifice their individuality for the benefit of the unit. This extends from the relatively simple - giving up a personal appearance that sets you apart from the group - to the profound - laying down your life for another. Be ready to set aside your ego when you step off the bus at boot camp. From that point forward, your country and your fellow Marines are your first priority, not yourself.

, Marine DI's will frequently subject recruits to various tasks and situations that are meant to break their spirits so that they can be rebuilt as perfect Marines. DI's constantly look for opportunities to stress, humiliate, and otherwise ""break down"" recruits. They may force them to complete tasks that are impossible, then punish them when they are unable to complete them. They may arbitrarily single out and pick on recruits for no reason. Their actions may seem unfair - they are, and they are meant to be! However cruel a DI's behavior may seem, remember that it's not personal - all recruits go through boot camp and have similar experiences. Here are just a few examples of ""head games"" from one former recruit, now an active duty Marine:A foot locker was left unlocked, so all the recruits were made to lock their locks together in several balls and throw these balls onto the floor. The recruits then had one minute to find and unlock their own personal lock. After they failed this impossible test, they were punished with insults and physical training.
After winning a drill competition, recruits were punished with physical training in a mud pit because they didn't win by a big enough margin.
Marines are not allowed to let their platoon's guidon (a special type of flag) touch the ground. While standing at attention, Marines are not allowed to move unless told to do so. A DI would throw the guidon at the ground in a show of disgust at his platoon's performance. When recruits broke ranks to dive and catch it, they were punished.

, A Marine's duties usually begin before sunrise. If you're not an early riser, you will probably want to begin adjusting your sleep schedule long before your ship date to ease the transition into your boot camp routine. Additionally, sleep deprivation is part of basic Marine training. For instance, during the defining test of recruit training called The Crucible, Marine recruits embark on a 54-hour mission on which they receive only about 4 hours of sleep.Sleep deprivation prepares the recruit for life in a combat zone, in which he or she may be asked at any moment to fight, whether he or she is well-rested or not.

, During boot camp, recruits learn to rely on each other and to hold each other up to high standards. Platoons frequently compete for trophies that earned for cumulative scores in marksmanship, academics, etc. Because the platoons are judged as a whole, the members of each platoon rely on each other to perform to the best of their ability. Remember, also, that platoons are often punished as a whole for the mistake of a single member, so it's in every recruit's interest to both hold his fellow recruits accountable for their actions and to be held accountable for his or her own actions.

Get dismissed from the squad.",How to March," There are two possible commands for standing at attention: ""Fall In"" is used to either assemble individuals into formation or return the marchers to their original lineup. ""Attention"" is a command given during rest position. You should respond to both commands by standing at attention.Bring your heels together evenly, with the toes slightly pointed outward to form a 45-degree angle between your feet.
Try to balance your weight across the entirety of both feet.
Don't lock your knees, but keep your legs straight.
Keep your shoulders square, your chest lifted, and your upper body level with your hips.
Hang your arms on both sides of your body without any stiffness. Your fingers should be slightly curled, with your thumbs touching your index finger's first joint on the side.
Keep your thumbs in a straight line with the seams of your pant legs, with your index fingers' first joints touching your pant legs.
Remain silent while standing at attention, and don't move or speak unless you are told to.
A variant on Standing at Attention is ""Snap to Attention."" In this stance, everyone must stand at Attention, but with expedited speed. The heels are also brought together quickly (hence the ""snap"" part of Snapping to Attention).;
, Parade Rest is a command given to marchers who are currently in the Position of Attention. This type of rest is also known as a ""rest position at the halt.""Do not enter Parade Rest until you are given the command.
On command, keep your right foot planted while moving your left foot approximately 10 inches to the left.
Keep your legs straight, but do not lock your knees. Balance your weight across the entirety of both feet, just as you did while standing at attention.
Place both hands behind you, at the small of your back. Keep the fingers of both hands extended and link your two thumbs together with your right palm facing outward.
Center both hands linked together in the middle of your back (also called ""centered on the belt"").
Keep your head and eyes straight ahead of you as you did while standing at attention.
Do not speak or move until you are told to do so.

, Standing at Ease is similar to the Parade Rest position, except you turn your head and eyes to directly face the person in charge of your formation. As with the Parade Rest position, you are not to move or speak unless directed to do so., The ""At Ease"" command is slightly different from the ""Stand at Ease"" command in that individuals are permitted to move slightly when told ""At Ease."" However, while standing At Ease, a marcher must still keep his right foot in place and remain silent unless directed to do otherwise., The last Rest Position at the Halt is the command ""Rest."" When given the Rest command, a marcher may move his arms, talk, smoke, or take a drink of water, unless he is given other directions. During the Rest position, each individual must still keep his right foot in place on the ground., There are five facing movements marchers are required to learn: Left FACE, Right FACE, Half Left FACE, Half Right FACE, and About FACE. Each of these movements is entered from the Position of Attention.Facing to the Flank - also known as Left/Right FACE. On command, slightly raise your right heel and left toe simultaneously to turn 90 degrees toward the direction you've been given. Keep your arms at the Position of Attention the entire time, and on count two bring your feet into Attention.
Facing to the Rear - also known as About FACE. Move your right toes about half a foot-length behind and slightly to the left of your left heel. On the count of two, turn to the right 180 degrees while keeping your arms in the Position of Attention the entire time.
Half Left and Half Right FACE are only executed in a situation where a 90-degree turn would not face the desired direction. It is usually used to face the flag to render honor, such as during reveille or retreat.

, The Hand Salute is executed when given the command, ""Present ARMS."" This command may be given while the marcher is stationary or while in motion. If the command is given during a march, only the individual in charge of your formation salutes and acknowledges a salute. If the formation is double-timing, you must come to Quick Time before saluting.If wearing headgear with a visor, on command you should raise your right hand sharply with the fingers and thumb extended and joined. Keep your palm down and touch the tip of your right forefinger to the rim of your visor just to the right of your right eye.
If wearing headgear without a visor or no headgear, the Hand Salute is the same, only you should touch the tip of your right forefinger to your forehead just to the right of your right eyebrow.
If you are wearing glasses and a visor-free headgear (or no head gear), the Hand Salute is the same, only you should touch the tip of your right forefinger to the part of your glasses where the frame's temple piece meets the right edge of your right eyebrow.
If you are given the command ""Order ARMS"" from a Hand Salute, return your hand quickly to your side and resume the Position of Attention.

, Even when learning the steps for an individual marcher, it's best to become acquainted with the basic marching information that the entire squad will be expected to know. This will help you with both your individual marching steps and with a group formation.


Any movements that you execute from the Halt command should be initiated with the Position of Attention.
All marching movements except Route Step March and At Ease March are executed while marching at Attention.
Marching at Attention combines the Position of Attention with the prescribed marching steps, performed simultaneously.
If performing steps executed from the Halt, every movement except Right Step begins on your left foot.
One step is considered the distance from one of your heels to the other.
All marching steps are carried out in Quick Time, meaning 120 steps per minute. The only exception is the 30-inch step, which you may be commanded to carry out in 180 steps per minute if given the command, ""Double Time, MARCH."", If you are performing the 30-inch step from a Halt, you will be given the command, ""Forward, MARCH."" It is a two-part movement. When given the command, ""Forward,"" shift your weight slightly to the right foot. On the ""MARCH"" command, step forward 30 inches, leading with your left foot. Continue to take 30-inch steps forward, alternating feet depending on which step you are on.Do not bend your elbows, and do not exaggerate your movements.
Let your arms swing in a natural motion. Aim for approximately nine inches ahead of you and six inches behind you as you swing your arms.
Keep your eyes and head facing forward.
Make sure your fingers remain curled, as in the Position of Attention.

, Before you are about to receive the Halt command, you will be given the preparatory command, either ""Squad"" or ""Platoon,"" while one of your feet strikes the ground. The final command, ""Halt,"" will be given the next time that foot strikes the ground.Bring your trailing foot alongside your lead foot.
Assume the Position of Attention.
Cease any further movement until you are given a command.

, The Change Step command is only given to a marcher who is out of step with everyone else in his formation, but it's an important command to learn if you hope to march with a formation. It will only be executed during a forward march with a 30-inch step.You will be given the command, ""Change Step, MARCH.""
""Change Step"" will be spoken while your right foot strikes the ground.
On ""MARCH,"" take one additional step with the left foot, then over one count, place your right toe near your left heel.
Step off again with your left foot.
Keep your arms swinging naturally, and try to match the step of everyone else in your formation.

, At Ease March is a rest movement that will be commanded during the 30-inch step. The command, ""At Ease,"" will be given when one of your feet strikes the ground. On the command, ""MARCH,"" you are no longer required to retain your cadence with your formation.Even though you are not required to keep marching in step, you must remain silent and maintain the approximate intervals and distance that you were performing in step.

, The Route Step March is executed identically to the At Ease March. The only difference is that in a Route Step March, you may drink from your canteen and talk with other marchers., If you are expected to march in place, you will be given the command ""Mark Time, MARCH."" The command will be given while one of your feet is striking the ground, usually during either a 30-inch step or 15-inch step forward. On the ""MARCH"" command, bring your trailing foot up alongside your leading foot and begin marching in place.Alternate raising each foot two inches off the ground.
Do not move your feet forward. Simply alternate feet while marching in place.
Keep your arms swinging naturally, as you would during a 30-inch step forward.
If you are given the follow-up command, ""Forward MARCH,"" take one more step in place on the ""MARCH"" command before you begin the forward 30-inch step.

, While marching in formation, it is important that you maintain the proper distance from the person marching in front of you. This is to ensure that everyone in formation keeps step and does not bump into anyone else.The proper distance between individuals while marching is one arm's length plus an additional six inches (approximately 36 to 40 inches total).

, Squads typically form in a linear formation. A squad may re-form in a column if each member in formation can identify his precise position, but this usually only occurs when equipment from each individual is left on the ground where he was in formation.The squad leader will stand in the Position of Attention and issue the command ""Fall In.""
On the command ""Fall In,"" you must double time to your position in the formation and follow the lead of the right flank man.
Stand in the Position of Attention, turn your head and eyes to the right, and raise your left arm the way your right flank man is standing.
Keep your left arm raised to shoulder level with the elbow locked, fingers and thumb extended and joined, and your palm facing down.
Take short steps either forward or backward to be in line with your right flank man.
Take short steps either left or right so that your shoulder is touching the fingertips of the individual to your right.
Once you are in place (called ""Normal Interval""), lower your arm to your side, turn your head and eyes to face forward, and resume the Position of Attention.

, When marching over short distances, you and your squad may be marched in a line formation moving forward. If marching over a longer distance, you and your squad may be marched in a column formation. If you are expected to form a column from a line formation, you will be given the command ""Right, FACE."", If you are in a column moving a short distance, you may be commanded to march to the flank. The command you will receive is ""Right (or Left) Flank, MARCH.""On the command of Right or Left Flank, the foot that is striking the ground is the direction you're expected to march towards.
On the ""MARCH"" command, take one more step, pivot 90 degrees on the ball of your lead foot to face the desired direction, and step off with the trailing foot toward the new direction.
As you begin marching in the new direction with your squad, glance out of the corner of your right eye and dress to the right to ensure you are properly in formation.

, Being dismissed from the squad releases you from the formation, but not from your duty day (unless otherwise instructed before the command ""DISMISSED""). You will be dismissed at Attention.If you are marching with arms, you will be given one of the following commands before being dismissed:


Inspection, ARMS
Ready, Port, ARMS
Order (Sling), ARMS
Any of these may be followed by the command, ""DISMISSED.""

This is especially true if you have limited or no experience as a writer. If you have lots of relevant experience and a great portfolio, you might be fine without a degree.


Think about the kind of writing you want to do when choosing your major. If you want to go into marketing, technical writing, or journalism, you should consider majoring in one of those specific fields. If you want to become a creative writer or you are unsure about what kind of writing you want to do, an English major is a good choice.
Choose a marketable minor also. You can either choose a second writing-related subject to give yourself more experience with different kinds of writing, or you can choose a subject that you think would be helpful to you in your dream job. For example, if you want to become a journalist, it might be helpful to study a foreign language that is commonly spoken in your area. If you want to work in marketing, you may want to consider a minor in communications.;
, No matter what kind of writing job you are looking for, you will need to be capable of writing content that is concise and grammatically correct. If you struggle with grammar, take classes online or at a local college to improve your skills.

, Many writing jobs may require you to edit other people's writing in addition to creating your own content, so it is important to be confident in your editorial abilities. There are several different types of editing, all of which require different slightly different skills.Developmental editing involves working with the author of a long document, such as a book or research paper, to suggest improvements that can be made to the structure and content.
Line editing involves editing a document for factual accuracy and consistency, as well as for grammar and style.
Copy editing involves the close reading of a document in order to correct grammatical and usage errors and to improve the overall readability of the text.
Proofreading involves reading through documents very closely to find typos and formatting errors.

, In addition to being able to use proper grammar, you will need to learn to tailor your writing to conform to the specific requirements of a style guide. Style guides provide rules on stylistic components such as capitalization, punctuation, and numerals. There are lots of different style guides, so it may not be possible to know them all, but being familiar with more than one can be very helpful.Common style guides include Chicago, APA, AP, and MLA. Many companies also have in-house style guides, which typically build off of one of the major style guides by adding industry-specific guidelines.
For some writing jobs, you may also be instructed to use a specific dictionary for any spelling or hyphenation questions you may have.
If you accept a writing job that does not require you to use a specific style guide or dictionary, make sure you are consistent with your stylistic choices. It may be helpful to choose a style guide by which you will adhere in the event that you are not given any direction.

, For some writing jobs you may be required to write highly descriptive and elaborate content, and for others you may need to write short and concise sentences. As a writer, it is important to be prepared to take on all kinds of different writing challenges.


Challenge yourself by writing many different kinds of pieces, such as news articles, press releases, creative stories, and technical guides.

, Whenever you are writing anything, you always need to think about who will be reading it. Writing for the needs of your audience will help you choose the appropriate vocabulary and style.Your audience will vary greatly depending on what kind of writing you will be doing. Think about how much knowledge the audience will have about the topic, what they need to learn from your writing, and why they are reading it in the first place. For example, if you are writing an entertaining blog post, your audience will likely be reading it because they enjoy it. Your writing style should be casual, conversational, and maybe even humorous. If, in contrast, you are writing a technical manual, your audience will be want to get information very quickly, so your writing style should be concise, informative, and unambiguous.
To help improve your ability to write for different audiences, try challenging yourself to write two or more pieces on the same topic for different audiences. For example, you could attempt to write an article about a political election for an audience that is highly knowledgeable about politics, and then try writing the same article for an audience that knows little to nothing about politics. While the basic facts will remain the same, your writing style will have to change dramatically to cater to these two very different audiences.

, If you're going to get a job involving the writing craft, you need to be a good writer, and the only way to do that is to practice! Try to write a little bit every day, and then consider going back to pieces you have written in the past to edit and revise. The more you write and edit, the better your skills will become.

, Do whatever you can to gain experience, either as a writer or in a writing-related industry. If you want to break into writing for newspapers, for example, taking a part-time job as a receptionist at a newspaper office could be a great first step.


Internships and volunteer work are also great ways to gain experience and build your resume, even if you don't get to spend all of your time writing.
For added experience, consider submitting articles or creative writing pieces that you have worked on for publication.

, This is not necessary if you are just starting out as a writer and are unsure about what career path you want to take, but if you know what kind of writing job you want, work on developing unique skills that will set you apart from other writers.Consider taking some classes to learn a specific writing-related skill, such as grant writing or search engine optimization. These are great resume builders that can help you land a writing job.
If you have professional experience or a degree in a non-writing field, you could have an excellent opportunity to cross-market yourself. For example, if you are highly knowledgeable about physics and you also have exceptional writing skills, you would be the perfect candidate to write or edit for a journal on physics.

, If you want someone to consider hiring you for a writing job, you need to have an extremely well-written resume that is both compelling and free from grammatical and spelling errors.


Make sure your resume is nicely formatted as well. You can find free online templates if you need help with formatting.
If you have never had a writing job before, consider creating a separate section on your resume that describes the various skills and experience you have as a writer.

, For most writing jobs, you will be asked to submit samples of your work. It's a good idea to have a large variety of samples prepared before you begin applying to jobs, so you can choose the ones that are most relevant to each specific job.


If you don't have any writing that you feel would be appropriate to submit as a sample, write something specifically for that purpose. For example, if you are applying for a marketing job, but you have never written ad copy before, do some research on your own and write a mock ad.
Having a website or blog can be very helpful in sharing samples of your work with prospective employers. Include a link to your site in any emails you send to inquire about job opportunities.Be prepared for writing tests as well. Some employers may want to see how you perform under time restrictions or how well you are able to write about a specific topic. Researching prospective employers thoroughly should help you prepare for these kinds of tests.

, As with all professions, you will have a much easier time finding a writing job if you leverage your connections with other professional writers.


Use professional networking websites like LinkedIn to connect with other writing professionals and post your resume.
Take advantage of any connections you may have made at school or at previous jobs and ask these people for advice on where to apply and how to get an interview.
Attend career fairs and conventions to meet people in your field. Even if the people you meet are not able to offer you a job, they may be able to connect you with people who are.

, Landing an internship with a magazine, newspaper, publishing company, or marketing agency is a great way to break into the writing world.You can find internships on major job boards like Monster or Craigslist. There are also job boards devoted solely to internships, like internshipprograms.com.
If you know of companies in your area that you would like to work for, don't be afraid to contact them to express your interest in an internship. They might be willing to take on a new intern even if they didn't have a position posted
If you're a high school or college student, check with your adviser or career services office for advice and assistance with finding an internship. Your school should also be able to explain to you whether or not your internship can earn you college credits.
Many unpaid internships will not require huge time commitments, which is great if you also need to hold down a paying job. Before you accept a full-time gig that doesn't pay, make sure you have a plan for how you will support yourself. If you don't, it may be best to keep looking for other opportunities.

, You may be able to make a living as a freelance writer if you are willing to commit yourself. As a freelancer, you will have the opportunity to create your own schedule and decide what kinds of jobs you want to accept, although you will not have the security of a regular paycheck or employee benefits.There are lots of job boards devoted to freelance writing jobs, including problogger.com, freelancewritinggigs.com and freelancewriting.com, just to name a few. You can also find freelance jobs on major job boards such as Craigslist.Start exploring all of the job boards you can find, and then narrow it down to the ones that have posts that are most relevant to your interests and experience level.
Be willing to start small and work your way up. The more experience you gain and the better your reputation is, the more you can expect to earn as a freelancer.
Look for long-term independent contractor jobs or clients who will be willing to give you work frequently. This will take some of the stress out of freelance work because you won't have to be looking for new clients all the time.
Make sure to only accept jobs that you are capable of completing on time. You don't want to develop a bad reputation by missing deadlines or submitting poor quality work.
Watch out for scams. You should never disclose any sensitive personal information to a prospective employer without verifying that the company is legitimate., Another way to become a writer is to work on a project independently and then submit it for publication. This can be risky because you will not get paid unless your writing is accepted for publication, so you may want to start by doing this on the side while working a regular job.A literary agent can represent you and help you sell your work to publishers.
Instead of writing an entire book and hoping it will be accepted, you can submit a book proposal, along with a few sample chapters, to agents or publishers.

Self-publishing is also an option, although there is no guarantee that your work will make you any money.

, If you'd like the security of a full-time job, it's definitely possible to find one that will put your writing skills to work, although you may have to be a bit flexible, especially if you have no experience. Even if your first full-time writing job is not your dream job, it will give you the experience that you need to advance in your field.


Regularly check job boards like Indeed and Craigslist for new posts, and don't limit yourself to jobs posted under the writing category. There may be jobs in other fields, such as marketing or technology, that actually require a lot of writing. Try using keywords like ""write"" or ""writer"" to filter jobs instead of filtering by category.
Almost all industries need writers, whether or not they advertise for positions using that language. For example, a lot of companies have in-house marketing departments that will hire writers to fill positions with titles like ""marketing assistant"" or ""communications specialist.""
Look for companies in your area that might need writers and editors. Good places to look include publishing companies, newspapers, magazines, and advertising agencies. Once you find them, check their website to see if there are any open positions. If not, you can still send an inquiry email to them, along with your resume and some writing samples.
If you have technical knowledge, don't forget to look for technical writer jobs. You may not find these kinds of jobs under the writing and editing section of the job board, so be sure to use the search functionality.
Landing an editing job can be a great first step towards your career goals, even if you really want to write. Don't neglect to use keywords like ""editor"" or ""proofreader"" when looking for these kinds of jobs online.
Don't give up. You may have a hard time finding your first writing job, but being persistent will pay off in the long run. If possible, try to get short-time freelance gigs to keep you busy and build your resume while you search for a full-time job.

, If you're looking for a rewarding career that involves writing, do not neglect to look into the field of grant writing. You will need strong research skills and the ability to meet deadlines in order to be successful in this career. Even if you don't plan on doing this kind of writing forever, it's a great way to gain experience.Grant writers are sometimes full-time employees, most often for nonprofit agencies. To find these kinds of opportunities, check major job boards, focusing on the nonprofit sections. You can also try researching particularly active nonprofit agencies in your area and reaching out to those who seem to apply for grants frequently.
Many grant writers are freelancers as well, so you will find job opportunities on sites like elance.com or flexjobs.com. You may also want to look into joining organizations such as the Grant Professionals Association, which helps to match grant writing professionals with clients.

, If you get the job, that's wonderful! Pat yourself on the back, and get right back to writing. Whether or not you got the job, you need to keep your skills sharp and constantly improving. Even if you can't get a full-time position in the writing craft, you can still make writing a money-making hobby if you can sell a book or find occasional freelance work.

Also consider the stability of your business if you're leasing or renting rather than owning the property.

, These organizations often use volunteers to stuff envelopes, but they may be willing to hire someone at a low rate to work with their donor list.

, More organizations are likely to hire seasonal work during their year-end sales and donation drives.

No longer are you limited to looking for a permanent or contract job on Web 1.0 style job sites like Monster or CareerBuilder. The new breed of freelancing and project-oriented sites let companies needing help describe their projects. Then freelancers and small businesses offer bids or ideas or proposals from which those buyers can choose.;
, If people regularly oooo and aaaaah over your Flickr pics, maybe you’re destined for photographic greatness or maybe just for a few extra dollars. It’s easier than ever to get your photos out in front of the public, which of course means a tremendous amount of competition, but also means it might be a convenient way for you to build up a secondary income stream. Where can you upload and market your photos? Try Fotolia, Dreamstime, Shutterstock, and Big Stock Photo.

, Despite the explosion of blogs, it’s hard to find good writers who can turn around a solidly-written post on an interesting topic quickly. GigaOM is always looking for bloggers with great content ideas and solid writing skills. How do you get noticed? Comment and link to blogging network sites. Write blog posts that are polished and not overly personal (although showing some personality is a plus).

, If you like the business side of things–selling advertising, hiring and managing employees, attracting investors–and have the stomach to go up against the likes of Weblogs, Inc., GigaOmniMedia, b5media, maybe you should make an entire business out of blogs. Don’t make the mistake of thinking you’ll get a lot of time to write yourself though.

, Just because the software is free doesn’t mean you can’t make money on it–just ask Red Hat, a well-known distributor of Linux that sports a market cap of more than four billion dollars. As a solo web worker, you might not want to jump in and compete with big companies offering Linux support, but how about offering support for web content management systems like WordPress or Drupal? After getting comfortable with your own installation, you can pretty easily jump into helping other people set them up and configure them.

, Who has time to go meet a personal coach at an office? And don’t the new generation of web workers need to be met by their coaches in the same way that they work: via email, IM, and VoIP? You could, of course, go through some life coaching certification program, but on the web, reputation is more important than credentials. I bet Tony Robbins isn’t certified as a life coach–and no one can argue with his success. For an example of someone building up their profile and business online as a coach, check out Pamela Slim of Ganas Consulting and the Escape from Cubicle Nation blog.

, Freelancers and small businesses desperately need help running their businesses, but they’re not about to hire a secretary to come sit in the family room and answer phone calls. As a virtual assistant, you might do anything from making travel reservations to handling expense reimbursements to paying bills to arranging for a dog sitter. And you do it all from your own home office, interacting with your clients online and by phone. You can make $20 and up an hour doing this sort of work, depending on your expertise.

, Elastic computing on AWS is so cool… and so incredibly primitive right now. Did you know that you can’t even count on your virtual hard drive on EC2 to store your data permanently? That’s why people are making money right now by offering services on top of AWS. Make it easier for people to use Amazon’s scalable web infrastructure like Enomaly has with elasticlive, a scalable web hosting platform built on AWS.

, If you blog for any length of time on a particular topic–parenting, mobile phones, or PCs, for example–you will likely be approached to do book or product reviews. You can get free stuff this way, but are you selling your soul? Is there any such thing as a free laptop? These are decisions you’ll have to make for yourself, because no one agrees upon what ethical rules apply to bloggers. Even less do people agree on services like PayPerPost that pay you to write reviews on your blog. Check out disclosure rules closely and see whether such a gig would meet your own personal standards or not.

, A half million Chinese now earn income by acquiring and selling World of Warcraft gold to gamers in other countries. If you’re not a young person living in China, this probably isn’t a viable option for you. But what’s intriguing about it is the opportunity to make real money working in a virtual economy. People are making real-world money in Second Life too.

Ask to try it for a limited duration.",How to Convince Your Boss to Let You Work from Home," If sleeping in or being able to come to work in your pajamas is the basis of your argument, give up now and keep hitting the office every day.


Point to value-added reasons to telecommute. Look especially for ways that telecommuting could benefit the company. Situations that may be enticing to a company is if you are constantly having to leave work to care for a sick child or parent and could remedy that interruption by working from home. Instead of having to leave and possibly leave your work at home, you could continue to work while caring for your child or parent.






Consider your position at work. Another bargaining chip may be if your job is productivity-based (your performance depends upon your work production) and you find that the surrounding environment to be clogged with disruptions. Finding a haven (at home) where you can have the room to think and produce without the loud, sustaining boom of machinery or the employee next door may increase your productivity level and work quality.
Explore aspects of your job you can use to save the company money. Examine your benefit structure to determine if you could swap certain benefits for the ability to work from home. For example, if your husband/wife has great health insurance and the insurance you receive from your company is subpar, consider trading that expense. Or you could use trade sick days or the prepaid gym membership (for example) as leverage. Before chipping away at any benefits, be sure you discuss your plans with your partner/spouse.;
, If you are a supervisor or a teacher that needs to be hands on with the employees/students, going virtual may not work. Examine your job to make sure you could perform all the duties remotely before approaching your boss.


Evaluate the main core of your duties. Do your primary duties surround production such as design, writing, computer analytics or sales? If your performance is measured by your individual production you may be a good candidate for telecommuting.
Do you have the equipment and space at home to telecommute? Are there specific pieces of equipment that are housed only at the office, or could you effectively perform every aspect of your job from home? If part of your job involves meeting with certain employees, with the introduction of online software tools like Skype and Go to Meeting, connecting with other employees shouldn’t be too difficult. Also, if you are going to maintain a level of professionalism, you can’t work from the dining room table--you will need a designated office space in your home.
Could your company’s infrastructure support a telecommuter? Is your company set up to accommodate your physical absence, but continued connection? Do employees already use Skype for meetings and are projects submitted electronically? You may have a harder time convincing your boss to let you telecommute if the entire company still functions on paper and in person.

, If you tend to slack off, deliver projects late and turn in a mediocre performance you may laughed right out of your boss’s office. However, if you have a proven track record with statistics to back up your reasons, you may have a shot.


Create a resume of your “highs” with the company. Dig back into the past few years (or months) and create a resume or list of your accomplishments and how those feats have positively impacted corporate growth.
Identify ways you’ve saved the company money. Money typically talks at any company so if you can add up how your presence has saved the company money (and if going virtual will save even more money), you will be even more valuable.






Have a list of facts and statistics to back up your position. Research both national and local telecommuting statistics such as using studies by other companies like Cisco. The company conducted a 2009 survey and found that telecommuting not only increased employee productivity, it saved the company $277 million a year in overhead costs and lost productivity.

, In order to make this work, you must have a bond and strong communication with everyone around you.


Does your boss “get you” and respect you as an employee? Does your boss trust your opinion and see you as an expert in your field or does he/she micromanage your work and second guesses what you do? Only if you have a relationship built on mutual respect and open communication will a telecommuting position work.






Do other employees understand your job? In some cases, if other employees are disconnected from you and/or do not understand your job jealously may form, which will not only impede what you are trying to do but will put pressure on your boss to eliminate the program. A well-connected employee who clearly demonstrates his/her contribution to the company will be able to maintain harmony at work even in his/her physical absence.

, Gather your facts, reasons and a description of the ideal scenario before making an appointment to talk. If you approach you boss in a friendly, easy manner, backed up with hard to ignore facts you’ll set yourself up for success.


Create a presentation packet that he/she can review. Generate a professional, comprehensive report backing up the reasons why you should work from home and most importantly, why it will be beneficial for the company.
Ask your boss if he/she has ever worked from home or has had a previous employee who telecommuted. Your boss may be a huge proponent of the idea and you may not even know it. Ask him/her questions about how he/she feels about the idea and any experiences he/she has had in the past.
Spin the idea so that it will provide a bigger benefit for the company. Although working from home will provide a huge benefit to you, your goal is to hit home the major positives your physical absence will have on the company and your boss’s position. Don't leave out the reason why you want to work from home, however accentuate the productivity level and money saving positives for the company.

, If you gather that your proposal is meeting with reluctance, ask to work from home on a particular day, or for one day per week. Use the trial day(s) to demonstrate to your boss and your colleagues that you will can communicate and be productive even out of the office. Check in with your managers frequently, and make sure to address any concerns they may have."

Figure out whether you can afford to work from home, especially if you are freelancing and just starting out.",How to Decide Whether Working at Home Is for You," Transitioning from a job onsite to one in your own home is a big transition that assumes a lot of responsibility. Ask yourself if you are prepared to make that big of a change in your life. You should be really sure that this is something you want to do before making such a big move.;
, You will need the support of your family if you do decide to go ahead with this endeavor. So make sure that everyone is in agreement with you before going ahead with it.

, If you slack off, the affect will be more substantial than if you were part of a team, and your income comes directly from you.

, Either way, you are the only adult in the home. Consequently, you need to decide whether you can handle being alone all day. If you are an extrovert or you enjoy being social, then the isolation that comes with working from home may not be something you can tolerate. If, on the other hand, you enjoy the quiet and are more productive when you are alone, working from home may be the ideal work situation for you.

, If you don't, then no one else will either. Taking yourself seriously means establishing work hours and treating them as such. You may have to filter your calls, tell family and friends not to disturb you when you are working, and decline invitations to be social during your established work hours. If you are finding that people are just not taking your work hours seriously, then you may have to be blunt and then live with the possibility of them becoming offended. That might be the price you have to pay in order to be taken seriously.

, The idea of working from home is very attractive, but if you make the transition but don't put in the effort, then you will fail. You have to be passionate about working from home, but you also have to be disciplined, organized and determined.

, Some people need a change of scene. When you work at home, you don't get that diversity. So ask yourself if you are prepared to give that up. Additionally, you need to be able to separate your work from your home life. You need to know when your work day ends and when your home life begins, especially if you have a family. Don't allow your work to consume you because the office is always there. Doing so may cause resentment in your personal life.

, You may have to sit down with your spouse and go over your finances to determine whether you have enough saved up to keep you afloat until your regular income kicks in or whether a single income will be enough in the interim.

Assure the parents that you are responsible and mature enough to look after their child(ren).",How to Talk to Parents When You Babysit Their Kids," This will help the parents get to know you better, and you can get to know what the family is like.;
, This is quite awkward, so be prepared. If they're paying you $3 an hour or less, feel free to talk to them about paying you more. The best time is to talk to them before they even leave, or right when you get the next request to sit. If you think that $3 is too low, tell them so, and tell them you'd like to go up to $5, but say you normally accept $5 or $6 (or whatever you normally accept). Set a limit you think is reasonable and stick to it. Make what you are looking for clear, but don't be nervous. The family you sit for works, too. They understand the limits you have to have.

, Before accepting a babysitting job there are a few things you should ask the parents:


How many children do you have?
What ages are the children?
What are their names?
Do you have any pets I should be aware of?
When will you need me to be there?
What time will you get home?
What rules do you have that I should know about?
When is bedtime?
What is the normal bedtime routine?
Where will you be?
When will you be home?
Do you have any questions for me?
In case of an emergency, can you write down the name and number of their doctor and where I can reach you?
Cell phone numbers of both parents.
Are the children allergic to anything?
Do the children have any medical conditions I should be aware of (asthma, epilepsy, hemophilia, etc)?
Are the children taking any medications?
What is the children's bedtime?
Do the children have any special routines before bedtime?
Are the children allowed to have friends over?
Where are the first aid items (Band-Aids, Neosporin, etc)?
Where can I locate a flashlight? Do you know of any other items I may need in case of a power outage in an electrical storm?
Do the children have a nap-time? If so, when is that, and how long do the children normally sleep?
Is there anything else I should know?
Is it okay if I use the stove or the oven to make a recipe?

, Let them know of any prior babysitting experience you have; this may reassure them that they are making the right choice by allowing you to babysit their child. If you have no prior experience, be honest and tell them that. Likely, they will appreciate your honesty and have high expectations for your first job.

Purchase the rights to royalties.,

Offer advertising space.,
Refer visitors to businesses you trust.,
Focus on your primary passive income stream first.,
Reinvest your passive income.,
Repackage your products.,
Hire someone else to manage existing income streams.",How to Create Multiple Passive Income Streams," One of the more common ways that people earn passive income is by buying and then renting out property. These can be homes, apartments, land, or even individual rooms within your home. To do so, you'll have to find a property to rent out, determine a fair rental price by looking at comparable properties in your area, and then act as a landlord for your renters. You can convert this income source into truly passive income by hiring a manager to act as a landlord for you. However, this may not be economically feasible until you have several rental properties., A silent partner is an inactive investor in a business. That is, they contribute capital to start the business, but don't actually make any business decisions and leave the management of the business up to the active partners. In turn, they receive a portion of the business's profits. In this way, you have the potential to earn regular, sizable payouts from simply making an initial investment.


Before investing, make sure that you have the utmost confidence in the active partners and the business.
Silent partners are liable for losses that the business sustains, but only up to the amount that they originally invested., Royalties are payments made for the use or sale of intellectual property, like a song, book, or trademarked product. These royalties are paid from the seller of the property to its creator. You can earn royalty payments either by creating the intellectual property yourself or by buying royalty rights from someone else. In the latter case, you can buy the rights for a lump sum and then receive regular royalty payments that will eventually return you your initial investment.Websites like TheRoyaltyExchange and SongVest hold auctions for these rights., Some stocks provide shareholders with regular payouts called dividends. For very large, old companies, these dividend payouts are made for consistent amounts and can amount to a substantial income if you own a large number of shares. Look for companies that are very established and have been paying dividends for a long period of time (more than 10 years). You should be able to find this information with a quick online search., With the foundation of a good website, you can build traffic (a flow of visitors to your site) that you can then convert into revenue sources later on. First, you have to get the traffic, so start by writing about what you know on your website or blog. If it is interesting, informative, and well written, you may gain consistent traffic to your site over time.You can earn more by charging a small fee for people to browse your site for information. If you have a lot of expert information to offer and the ability to add new information on a regular basis, people interested in what you have to say will pay to be able to access your website.

, Offer links on your website that lead visitors to products sold by online retailers to earn a small commission every time a visitor clicks on your link and makes a purchase. There are many online retailers that offer affiliate programs; look for those that offer the best commissions.For more, see how to start an affiliate marketing business.

, E-books are electronic files that can be downloaded and read on the computer much like paper-bound books. If you're an expert at something, you can create an e-book and offer it for sale on your website. You can also have your own affiliate program, allowing others to offer your e-book on their websites, and earning a small commission for each sale., If your website is popular, you can sell space to retailers who want the people who are visiting your site to see advertisements for products, movies, music--just about anything. If you publish an e-zine or send an e-newsletter to subscribers, you can also sell space in the documents.


Consider using advertising platforms like Google Adsense or LinkShare to gain revenue from ads on your website.Some advertisers pay ""per click,"" meaning that you make a small commission every time a visitor clicks on an advertisement and visits the advertiser's web site.

, You can negotiate an arrangement with business owners to pay a finder's fee for new customers that you refer through your website., It's difficult to grow your passive income into multiple streams if you don't already have one, solid stream. Focus all of your efforts on that one project first and help it grow as productive as possible. Then, you can take the money you've made and lessons you've learned from this passive income stream and put them into others.


In addition, once you've built a strong passive income stream, you can make even more money teaching others how you did it., Once you've started earning a good amount of passive income, you can reinvest that income to earn ever more. This income will then produce further income that you can also reinvest. This cycle produces ever-increasing income streams without any direct cost to you. For example, you could reinvest revenue from website advertising into more advertising that brings readers to your site. This increase in traffic would then further increase your ad revenue.This is also useful for dividends. Some brokers even offer automatic dividend reinvestment that save up dividends and purchase new shares of the stock when possible.

, If you've already created successful content on a blog or website, you can convert that information into another form and sell it. For example, you can compile what you've written into an ebook and sell it on one of the ebook markets like Amazon or Barnes and Nobles. Alternately, you can use it to create an online course to sell on a website like Udemy. Reworking your content can earn you additional income streams without requiring you to actually produce new content., If you've built up a couple of solid passive income streams and want to move on to others, consider hiring someone to manage them for you. Obviously, this will only work if your income from these streams exceeds the amount you would have to pay someone to manage them. However, this is the way to truly passive income, because with someone else managing it, you're literally earning money by doing nothing.


Examples of this include having a broker manage your dividend stocks, hiring a landlord to oversee your rental properties, or hiring other bloggers to write content for your website."

Create posters.,
Talk with people on your street; if your neighbour has a child you can offer to look after them during the day and after school hours .Spread the word, you can ask them to tell others.,
Wait a few days.,
The day before: go out to Walmart or your local department store and buy some small toys, plastic chairs, outdoor games, plastic cups and plates and some snacks in case the kids get hungry.

,
The big day: Wake up at least two hours before your drop-off time.,
Give each child a choice of activities that they can do, for example: drawing, painting, or even reading a story.,
Lunch time: ask the children if they are hungry.,
Afternoon: Let them play.,
Evening: See the children to their parents.,
Reward yourself for a good first day.",How to Work from Home (Baby Sitter)," You can post these at an elementary school, YMCA or even a church in your area. Make sure you write your phone number and address on your poster and to make several copies.;
,


This works better if you have a child of your own. This will help because if neighbors know that you have a child they will be more comfortable leaving their kid with you as well.

, By then people will have seen your poster and will start calling. (Once they call tell them what time you start babysitting, when pick-up time is and ask if their child has any food allergies or medical problems.)

,, Take this time to set-up and eat breakfast in case you don't have time after. Once the children arrive greet them and their parents. (If you want to give the kids a name tag that they can write their name on so you remember) Once parents leave you can offer the child breakfast if they have not eaten already; keep the food allergies in mind, buy snacks and food that are peanut free.

, You can even offer to play or teach them a game.

, Then give them a choice for lunch, e.g. pizza or a tuna sandwich (It helps if they can all agree on one food). Remember to keep their food allergies in mind before you ask.

, If you want let the children continue playing or take them to the park or on a walk so they can run around. Once home again you can let them have nap time or do something else until their parents come to pick-up.

, By now the children should be picked up. If the parent has to work late offer to walk their child home or keep then with you until parents arrive. (It helps to ask in the morning if the parents will be late to pick up the child at the end of the day).

, Now you can clean up, enjoy your night and get ready for the next day.

",How to Spot a Bad Babysitter," A babysitter who has gone to jail or has been guilty of crimes is probably someone you want to avoid.;
, A good babysitter is 12 or up. Anybody younger might not be mature enough. The age needed will also depend on how many kids, how old the kids are,how much experience they have, etc. The age is just a factor and sometimes younger teenagers are better than older people. For example, a 16 year old who has been babysitting for 3 years and gone to babysitter and CPR courses and has a good reputation will be better than a 21 year old who knows nothing about kids and doesn't pay attention to the kids.

, Babysitters should dress casual but appropriate. Avoid a babysitter with sagging pants or anything very loose, baggy, cleavage showing, midriff, ripped up, bad hygiene, clothes with inappropriate sayings on them, anything too revealing, and just plain not dressed for the occasion.

, If they treat them badly, it's a bad sign.

, Ask them how it went. If they had a bad experience, it's a bad sign.

, The kids are the ones who are with the babysitter the entire time. If they kids throw a fit about having them as a babysitter, it's not a good sign.

, Babysitters who show up late are a bad sign, because they lack responsibility. If they, however, call ahead of time and give you a good reason, he/she is probably not lying unless he/she is known for lying.

, If they have been babysitting for a while, then asking around is a good way to decide if they are trustworthy.

, This is a sign they didn't take care of the child's needs.

, It is not uncommon for children to occasionally get minor injuries. However, any serious or frequent injuries that happened because the babysitter was not watching the child is a bad sign.

, A babysitter that breaks the rules and/or does not enforce them is a bad babysitter.

, They are a bad babysitter.

, This shows they lack maturity.

, A babysitter should always be watching kids under the age of 5 and older kids should always be in reasonable distance away from them.

, A babysitter should understand and respect your request. If the babysitter does things their way while you're gone is a bad babysitter.

, If they hit your kids, use bad words, sexually assault, or anything else you wouldn't want your child exposed to is a bad babysitter.

, If you are very concerned about this babysitter, hide a video camera in the house. Have it record everything while you are gone.

, If they have taken any, ask them if you can see their certificate. They are more trustworthy.

You will not only be well-equipped for babysitting but also win the approval of parents, who will feel better about leaving their children with you.


Use a search engine to search for ""Red Cross Babysitters Training,"" ""Safe Sitter"", and other babysitting courses in your area. ""Safe Sitter"" is recommended because it not only gives you medical training but also includes a wide variety of important information. They present you with a certificate, safety kit, and a manual that you can refer to.

, Be sure that it is unique but simple enough that people will easily remember it. You can also create business cards so that you can easily present them to people. It is recommended that you type them so that it reflects professionalism.

, Ensuring that you are comfortable with the age is essential so that you may perform well. For instance, you may feel that younger children are difficult to care for, or you may think that you are too close in age to your clients. In those cases, it is important to acknowledge your discomfort and reject those jobs. If you have selected an age range but wish to alter it, remember that you have the right to make changes.

, Be certain that you charge an appropriate amount of money so that your clients are more likely to hire you. The price can depend upon the location, your expertise, and the child's age. The range should fall between five to twenty dollars.


It is recommended that you charge similar prices to other local babysitters with the same amount of experience.
If you have many competitors, you could consider slightly lowering the cost so that people are more likely to hire you.

, It is important that you create early plans and obtain important information ahead of time, such as food allergies or necessary medications for the children. Furthermore, be sure that one of your parents will be home in case of an emergency. It is essential that you understand how to handle various situations, such as choking, break ins, fires, natural disasters, or hazards in the client's home. It is unsafe to babysit without knowledge of handling an emergency.

, Post fliers or make business cards. Use bright colors to get the parents' attention.


Be sure to include ages you will babysit, your phone number, and days or hours you would be available. Do not give out your address or full name yet! Some people may be looking for you for the wrong reasons!
Once you have printed all of those off, it's time to start advertising. Paste your fliers in the neighborhood or at your school, library, and so on, or hand them out to neighbors.
Consider creative ways to get your name known. Use blogs, cards, flyers, your logo on Valentine's Day candy, etc.
Don't over-advertise; pestering clients and potential clients is not professional.

, Stay active by offering your services to parents of children you know.

, This includes how to discipline the child, basic food and eating habits, and rules.

, Don't talk on the phone while the baby is playing. Watch them and babysit with care. This is exactly why you got the job, to watch the kids!

, This is to be sure you can receive the right contact in case you need to update the parents on any situation, minor or major.

, This is always good to know so that you can put these things out of reach of the child, who may look around.

, Make them feel you are someone they can trust. This doesn't mean the kid does what ever she or he wants, be a little strict but not too strict! Play with them.

,
Watch TV, read a book, or do something else quiet until the parents get home.",How to Babysit a Kid for the Entire Day," If it's a baby or toddler,make sure food is either mashed or cut up into bite sized, non-rounded pieces. Don't feed them anything sugary or with too many simple carbs. This will make them very hyper for a few hours, and they will be hungry in only two or three hours.;
, Kids five or older may want to go off on their own. This is fine, but kids under five should be supervised at all times.Take them outside if the weather is nice.Some games to play:


All kids 2-8: Jump rope, tag, ball, and pretend, are all great games for both boys and girls.Going to the park a park with a playground is also a great idea.
Girls:2-8: Dress up and house are great games to play. Coloring is a great activity.
Boys 2-8: Trucks,cars,and building blocks are great for boys this age. Most boys will also like to wrestle, but don't let them. They could seriously hurt themselves.
All kids 9 and up: Try a board game, races, a chapter book, or just taking a walk.

, Some good meals are:


A PB&J sandwich with juice and some kind of fruit or vegetable.
Chicken fingers and applesauce.
Pizza or hot dogs(Only on occasion.Too often and kids will become unhealthy.)

, Most kids 5 or older don't take naps, but babies and toddlers will. Rock them, change their diapers if they still wear one, and set them down. Kids vary in the amount of sleep they are used to, so make sure to ask the parents about the routine before you babysit.


When they wake up, change the diaper if it is a baby or toddler and if they went.

, Make sure the craft is safe and appropriate. They could also just color or draw.

, Most parents have restrictions on TV; make sure you obey their rules.

, Some parents will have dinner set up for you. Make sure you know where the kids are. Let younger kids help a little with preparations such as getting things out or stirring something. Make sure the toddler or baby has a bib.

,, If it's dark or the weather's cold, play a board game, read a book, or do a craft. Now is not the time to get them hyper; it is too close too bedtime and they won't sleep.

, Older kids usually take showers and don't need to be supervised. Kids under 5 should never be left alone in a tub. Make sure the water isn't too hot or too cold. Ask the parents what the norms in the house are and what they're comfortable with, when it comes to both supervision of bath time and the children being undressed.

, If the parents have a set bedtime routine, keep it that way. Make them use the bathroom too.

, Read them a story if they want. Get one or two stuffed animals if you want.

, Parents will appreciate this a lot. Just don't go in the parent's room or home office. Do the dishes, clean up downstairs or sweep and mop the kitchen. Just make sure you're not too loud!

,, Don't do anything loud or wake the kids up. Be careful not to fall asleep.

Get Some Training!,
Figure Out A Schedule!,
Advertise!,
Interact with the Kids!!,
Treat Your Clients Well!!,
Don't Be Afraid to Charge More!",How to Start a Babysitting Agency,"


You can get some babysitting training from Girl Scouts or your local YMCA and get CPR and first aid certified from your local Red Cross.But first make sure you are old enough to care for others kids.
Having a license keeps parents feeling less worried and can help you get $3-$5 more per hour than if you had no training. You will learn A LOT and your CPR skills might actually come in handy.;
, Figure out when you're available to do some babysitting. As a quality babysitter, you can plan your own hours. But do not be too stubborn or you may end up with no jobs. Keep track of your engagements, keep a small pocket planner or calendar.

, Create flyers and put them on local bulletin boards and around local areas like middle or elementary schools. Advertise in your towns newspaper. You can even use Internet sites to advertise but ask your parents about that one. Create some business cards to pass out whenever there is an opportunity. Always be reasonable and talk to a client before agreeing to take a job. You can ask your family members to talk to their co-workers who have young kids. Soon the word will get around that you are babysitting!!

, Most babysitters watch TV while halfheartedly supervising the kids. Don't do this. Instead, interact with the kids and get a babysitting bag- a fun colored bag filled with stickers, weird paints, and games to bring with you wherever you go. Also play fun interacting games with the kids! You'll soon be the favorite babysitter of all the kids you care for, and parents will usually choose their kids' favorite babysitter as a more permanent (and better-paid) caretaker!

, Treat your clients well: remember kid's birthdays and write Christmas cards for families. These niceties will pay off- families will often give you a few hours' pay as a Christmas gift, and you will often receive sizable gift certificates for your birthday.

,!Don't be afraid to request a raise- if you have families lining up to have you as their babysitter, then you have the flexibility to charge top dollar!

Get a big bag.,
Know your audience.,
Add books to the bag.,
Bring some toys.,
Try movies.,
Add in extras.,
After you've packed your bag, remember to take it with you each time.","How to Put Things Into a Babysitting ""Fun Bag"""," The bag needs to be easy to carry or wear, as well as having sufficient space to carry the fun items you want to take with you. Suitable bags include a backpack or a drawstring bag.


Given that the bag may need to carry a fair weight, choose one that is sturdy and strong.
Look for a bag with pockets or holders. These can be handy compartments for dividing the different items up, while still being able to find them easily.;
, Before you choose the items to add to the bag, be guided by the children you'll be babysitting. Know their ages, personal likes and dislikes, hobbies/interests and what sorts of things they already have in the house. Also ask their parents if there are things that the children are not allowed to do or play with.


If you are bringing food, be aware that this can be a very touchy subject. If the children are on a special diet mom and dad think matters, don't even try to foist your food onto the kids or there may be trouble. Be alert for allergies and weight-related issues and obey the parent's instructions. If the parents are happy for you to bring candies, be reasonable and only bring a few; this isn't an excuse to sugar-fuel the kids!

, Depending on the ages of the kids, put different books into the bag. Being able to read and show books the kids haven't seen in their own collection will keep them entertained and interested.


Children under 1 would enjoy baby board books with rhythm and short stories. Books that you can touch and feel are also great!
For example,1-4 year olds would enjoy Dr.Suess, 5-7 year olds would enjoy early reader books, 8+ year olds would like good chapter books.

, While there are going to be toys already at the place, new toys can be exciting and will keep the children interested for the visit thanks to the novelty. You may need to ask the parents first, to be sure that the toy isn't one the children already own.


Babies would enjoy rattles and anything that shakes. They would also like mobiles or activity gyms, activity quilts, plush toys, or bright baby toys. Toys that squeak such as play cubes or soft balls are other toys for babies.
Toddlers (1-3 year olds) would like baby dolls, bubbles, any toy that is colorful and looks real, or pretend vehicles designed for toddlers.
Girls 4-8 would probably like dress up and makeover things. Some crafts that are not to detailed but more than coloring work as well. Bring over some simple card and board games designed for this age.
9+ is a bit more trickery but most of the time kids that age like Bingo and other classic board games. They also like friends and girls will probably like more sophisticated crafts that are detailed. Children this age also love age-appropriate video games, bring a few over, though you should be sure they do not spend more than an hour of your babysitting time playing them.
Tomboys would like footballs and soccer balls.
Toddler boys would probably enjoy Duplos. 4-8 year olds might like car toys, trucks, etc.
Apps on your iPad might prove fun for the kids if they haven't seen your games or educational apps yet.

, Bring along an age-appropriate movie, either a DVD or one on your electronic device. Check the rating and always ask the parents if it's okay to show the movie.


For ages 1-3:Choose ones for this age group. For three year olds, bring over Dora or Paw Patrol. For ages 1-2 try Baby Einstein.
For ages 4-8:Disney Princess movies are popular for girls in this age group.Boys would like Cars,All dogs to heaven, etc.
For ages 9+:Classic ones like Lion King are usually ok for kids 9+.

, For things every kid will enjoy, stuff for forts usually entertains everyone. Bring an old sheet or two, and some comfy cushions. Of course, you could also check with the parents to see if they have bulkier things like cushions and pillows that they don't mind you using to build a fort.


Puppets are often enjoyed by children of all ages, especially if you're entertaining and funny when putting on a show with the puppets. Try finger puppets for 2-4 year olds and simple hand puppets for children birth-age 1.
Stickers are a great addition. They're light, fun to play with and can be used to make amazing collages, pictures and personal books.
Dress ups can be fun. Throw in a few funny pieces of clothing and clown wig for a fun game.

, After a few times, you'll get used to what to put in the bag (and what to leave out), as well as rotating the items to prevent boredom if you babysit the same kids regularly. Enjoy the experience and share your ideas with others, to help them make great fun bags too.

You may be able to babysit in a more casual sense, without getting into those details.

, Make a large list of activities and games that you do to keep the kids active and happy.

Stop all active and outdoors activities an hour before bedtime.,

Get the child's pajamas on or have them do so twenty or thirty minutes before bed.,
If their parents don't mind, or haven't instructed you not to, allow the child to have a small, non-sugar snack.Keep the snack small, it’s just something so that the child won't come complaining of hunger to you later.,

, Especially if the kid is three or younger, they will probably just crash once a calming activity is done. With the older kids, however, you may have to take a bit of time to slowly coax them to sleep.

, Have them take a shower if they were playing outside, or if the parents have specifically asked them to.

, Don't turn on the TV or a movie; this will only make it harder to get them up to bed.

, Have them climb into bed under the covers so they are ready to sleep. Then, read him/her stories, keeping your tone with the story. (If Mr. Bear is angry, use a real or fake angry voice.)

, Make sure that any lights that need to be on are on, and all closets and beds are check for monsters if that is part of the child's normal routine. Reassure them that their parents will be home soon, and that they need to sleep now. Be calm and collective, and don't shout.

Take a babysitting class that includes CPR.





;
, Find out what the going rate is and figure out if it's right for you, depending on the finances of the family, your experience, how old you are, etc. If the family is underpaying you, don't be afraid to speak up. ""Mrs. Jones, if you don't mind, I normally earn $____. Is that all right with you?""

, What did they do to make the experience enjoyable? Babysitting isn't an excuse to sit in someone's house watching TV and raiding their fridge. It's about interacting with the children and ensuring they're having a good time before bedtime. What things could you take along for activities and what activities could you do with the children? Working this out in advance will make the event much more enjoyable.


Babysit according to age needs. The age of the child makes a huge difference. While a school-age child will be mostly independent, a toddler will need you to help them and will want more attention. Babies are totally reliant on you, need you for everything so make sure you're focused and prepared. Never leave a baby or infant alone, even for a minute!







, Pack age-appropriate movies, toys, games, books, entertainment for yourself, game consoles for the children and some food yourself.

Bring a kit for yourself containing essential necessities like a small meal, snack, drink, lotion, lip balm, a first aid kit, some money, a cellphone, a list of emergency contact information, a book or iPod, and whatever you might need to survive a night at the baby's house.

, You'll need:

Phone numbers. Make sure you have both of the parents or legal guardians' cellphone numbers and all emergency contacts. Also make sure they have your number and you have your cellphone with you at all times, switched on.






Notification about allergies. If any of the kids have diseases or allergies, know where their medicine, inhalers, and etc. are.






Understanding what security system is in place. Know how to use the alarm system (if they have one). When you get there, after talking to the parents, lock the doors, and windows.






Make sure you know the important things to do for a child. For example, find out when they must be in bed, when they should eat, and when they should be bathed. You will want to know if they take a medicine, and if so, when and how often. Don't be afraid to ask. Children most likely cannot be trusted on such things.

, Any of the following can be fun:


Waitress ( restaurant), when having meals.
Board games.
Hide and seek.
Find different games for different age groups. Any appropriate games you can find online that sound fun.
Try to find a fun way to clean the house with everyone's help. Try sponge skating, its putting sponges on your feet and cleaning the floor. Or pretend you are a princess and you're dancing with prince mop.
Little kids love to play pretend and dress up, so bring costume items like hats and tutus.
Have a coloring contest, bring coloring books and crayons.
Make a life size board game with cardboard and be the game pieces.

, If the parents want you to prepare meals, do so within your ability.


See further How to cook while babysitting.

, Have a contest to see if they can get their bath done (optional), teeth brushed, pajamas on, and in bed in a certain amount of time. If they get it done they get a reward, like watching some television for a few minutes, or they get a coloring book, or a big sticker.

, Most of all, remember to have fun! Kids will sense that you are enjoying it and will join in the spirit. Equally, they also sense frustration or boredom and will play up to these feelings!

, Not all children are the same, so the child you babysit may develop slower than others. Some kids need a lot of help even on what seems (to you) a simple job.

Be aware that not all children have the same skills, even when compared to their peers. Also, remember that things you may deem as simple or easy most likely are not simple or easy for a child. Avoid letting young children pour their own drinks or cut their own food, for example, because messes will most likely result from this.
Listen to what the child has to say, and be understanding. Don't force your own ideas or opinions on them. Let them develop their own personalities.

, Be ready to call the police first, then the parents. Keep the kids and yourself in any of the following if a break in occurs:

Upstairs, in a room, with door locked and a chair ( or any strong object) against the door.






In a closet, locked and be very quiet.






In the parent's room, or any room with a bed you can hide under.






If you become very scared, stay on the line with the emergency line. Or kids become scared, have them talk to the parents on the phone, or have them play a game on any portable device, just keep them and yourself calm. Tell the kids to be very quiet.







, Put up flyers, put an ad in the local newspaper, or even just start off with word of mouth. ""By the way, Mrs. Smith, if you ever need me to stop by to take care of Jenny if you want to go out, I'm available."" Get your parents to tell their friends or your neighbors that you are looking for a babysitting job.

, If you're looking for a weekly job, the parents will usually ask you a few questions, watch you interact with their child(ren), etc. Make sure you're prepared: If you have long hair, tie it back, and dangle earrings probably aren't such a great idea either. Babies and some toddlers love to pull things. It's a good idea to wear clothes that you aren't going to be upset about if the clothes get a tiny paint stain and/or etc.; kids are kids and accidents happen. Also, make sure you're prepared to talk about your past experience, personality, etc.

Hot dogs and grapes, for instance, should be cut into small bits rather than served whole., Every parent has a certain way they do things. Sometimes it’s not enough to just say, “Give the kids dinner at 7:00.” Sometimes you have to include more in-depth information about your particular methods. Share the specifics of your childcare system with your overnight babysitter.For instance, part of your system might be to tuck your kid in at night, pulling the blankets up to their chin, rather than just saying “Goodnight” and switching off the light.

Include feeding schedules in your notes and directions so that they get the care they need, too., If for some reason your babysitter needs to go out (for instance, to pick up supplies or drop your child off somewhere) they should be able to leave the house safely and securely. Give your overnight babysitter a set of keys for all the inside and outside doors and show them the door that each key corresponds to so that they are adequately prepared.A set of keys for all doors inside the house is important, too, since kids sometimes accidentally lock themselves into bedrooms or other rooms.

, If your overnight babysitter doesn’t have money, they won’t be able to pick up extra formula or diapers, should they become necessary. Plan on leaving about $50 with your sitter per night they’ll be staying over.In other words, if your overnight babysitter stays for three nights, give them at least $150.

",How to Make Babysitting Fun," Before you baby-sit, take time to reminisce on the things you loved to do as a child, the games you played, the shows you watched and what made you laugh. Pack some things you could do together with the child like favorite books, markers or a kickball.;
, Some ideas could be: watch a movie or show you enjoyed as a child, play with play-doh, paint, draw and create, use your imagination for pretend games, play traditional games like Hide and Seek and Red light Green light. Children love to laugh so feel free to be as silly as you like!

, Children are often easily impressed; use your skills to entertain the child. Maybe you know how to make a few paper origami shapes, or know random facts about space. You will have fun as you see the child take an interest in your passions and idolize you for your talent.

, If you don't have an account, then just search online for ideas like, ""Babysitting Crafts Pinterest"".

, Bring along your own craft materials so that it all seems new and exciting to them. Let them keep their creations once made, they'll love that.


Refer to craft books. There are many books like, ""365 things to make and do"" that you can flip through and pick out fun crafts to make and do, with or for the children.

, Be bold, colorful, and bright. This will give the children the sense that you are fun to spend time with.

, Every child loves it when older people are nice to them.

, If you have a room in your house you don't go into, such as a family room, loft, or basement, clean it up and make it fun! Some things you can make are:


Dollhouses. Along with some homemade yarn dolls, or even ones you would like to donate!
A fishing game. Cut out pieces of paper shaped like fish, color them, and glue paper clips to them. Take some sticks, tie some string around it so it looks like a fishing pole, and tie a paper clip at the end. Then take a bowl and decorate it and put the ""fish"" in it.
Mini clay settings. Use oven bake clay to make settings like farms, cities, and towns.
Sponge Jenga. Instead of wooden blocks, cut up sponges and stack them.
Bottle bowling. Take two liter bottles (6 or 10) and paint them. Then take a rubber bouncy ball, small enough to fit in one hand, and bowl away. Or, you can use oven bake clay for mini bowling.
Take an old entertainment center and make it a play kitchen! Search online for images, ""DIY kids kitchen"".

, Or you can buy a set. Whenever a child is good, let them pick out a prize. Or start a ticket system. Depending how much you babysit, each week pick a ticket and the ticket with the child's name on it gets to pick out a prize. They will get a ticket when they are good.

, Talk calmly to children and listen to what they have to say to minimize bad behavior. Use distraction to stop their negative actions and bring things back to being fun again.

,


Read bedtime stories. If you babysit the child when they go to bed, read them a story and make them a small snack like toast or a banana.
Make brushing their teeth fun by singing a song.

,, You can be fun, but remember, everything comes with a price. Just watch over them while you can and make sure they do what they are supposed to do, and you could get recommended by the parents of whom you are babysitting for.

Find a bag.,
Fill it with crafts.,
Find some games.,
Put in dolls or action-figures.,
Throw in some books and DVDs.,
Purchase some snacks that parents have said are OK.,
Find a first aid kit.,
Pack something for yourself.",How to Make a Babysitting Kit," Get a brightly colored bag, or a plain canvas one that kids could decorate themselves. A backpack, tote, or a sling bag will work fine.;
, Some kids like crafts more than others, but it is always good to have a backup project. These kids may already have their own crafts at their house, and if they'd prefer to use those instead of yours, you can. Whatever you bring along will interest them, so bring some of these along just in case:


Paper bags to make puppets
Googly eyes, cotton balls or pom-poms of different colors and sizes
Construction paper of different colors, plain paper, coloring books
Stencils, crayons, colored pencils, markers, pencils, etc.
Finger paint.
Glue or glue sticks, tape, stapler, safety scissors
A few adult t-shirts you don't mind getting dirty (glue or paint can spill, and you don't want that to happen on kids' clothing)

, Board games or card games can keep kids entertained for hours. Put in some of your childhood games or bring some of these along:


(for younger kids) Candy Land, Yahtzee, Uno, Apples to Apples, twister, Simon swipe, Hullabaloo by cranium
(for older kids) Clue, Battleship, Bop-It!, Scrabble, BananaGrams
Puzzles
Deck of cards

, Even though the kids may already have their own dolls they love to play with, bring some along to give them a pleasant surprise, or even have a play date with all of the dolls!


Teddy Bears
Dolls like American Girl, Baby Alive, etc.
Transformers, cars, trucks, superheros, etc.

, When in doubt, get the popcorn rolling and pop in a DVD, or read the kids a couple of stories in a big fort you made. There are so many classic children's literature and amazing movies to show to kids, so here are some suggestions you can easily rent from your library.

, Kids love a yummy treat, and babies do, too. Buy some gum, cookies, animal crackers, or a dry cereal for kids to munch on. Run them by parents to make sure that kids are not allergic to these and that they are allowed to have them.

, This isn't the ""fun"" part of the 'fun' bag, but it's one hundred percent needed. It should be in the front zipper of your backpack, an easy to get to place when you need it quick for emergencies. You can find a small, inexpensive first aid kit at any drugstore, or make one yourself. Make sure it contains Band-Aids, first aid cream, gauze and gauze scissors, and a throw away ice pack.

, When the kids go to bed or finish watching a movie, you should have something to entertain yourself with as well. Bring a book or some homework or your phone to play some games on while the children are busy, but make sure you are always watching them.

Gather all your supplies: Things you may need are: Pencils/pens, paper, markers, crayons, stickers, or you could always type it on a computer.,
Start by writing your name and any basic info.,
You can also include past experiences with kids.,
You may want to include mini cards with the flyer with your name, age and number so parents can remember.

,
Once you're done with the info, decorate the flyer!",How to Make a Babysitter Flyer,";
, For example:


Babysitter available! I'm 14, and I love caring for kids. My name is Stacey and I have completed the Red Cross Babysitting course. I'm available after school, and weekends. Call @ 865-1234.
Make sure to include a picture and contact information.

, For ex:


I have a younger brother/sister who is 3 and care for him when our parents aren't home. This will help parent know that you are mature and can be trusted with kids.

,, Nothing catches a parents attention like colors.

Tell the children what activities/games/toys you have for them.",How to Play With Kids While Babysitting1," Ask them what they want to do first, or if they want to do something else. There's no need forcing a child to do a certain activity if they already have their mind set on something.

"
"
Sit down with the nanny in a quiet and calm environment, if possible.,
Be upfront with the nanny.,
Tell the nanny that what he or she did that was amazing.,
Understand that there may still be money that needs to exchange hands.,
Allow for goodbyes to be said.",How to Let a Nanny Go Nicely1," Try to schedule this so both of you will have plenty of uninterrupted time to go through any important information.;
, Begin by explaining the circumstances as best you can. Explain the reasoning for the split in as much detail is needed. Be it a financial situation, a move, or any kind of family issue, let the nanny know why this is happening.

, Let them know what really worked and what didn't. It might help them at their newer job!

, Ask the nanny about their policies. Some of them may have some kind of a fee involved, but this is unlikely. Make sure that all accounts that can be paid are paid, and have a system in mind to pay off whatever remains. Run this by your nanny and get it approved.

, Do this if your children are attached to your nanny, or the nanny wishes to accept goodbyes.

"
"
When children don't know what they want to do, ask them to show you their toys.,
Have the child pick up each toy they have and tell you a little about it.,
Make sure to clean up!",How to Play With Kids While Babysitting2," Maybe together you can find something fun to do.;
, This might speed up the process of finding the right toy to play with and even if it doesn't, it will at least kill a bit of time and keep the child from being bored for a little while. You might find that the child will want you to play too, but don't be offended or surprised if they find the toy they need and forget you're there entirely.

, No parent likes to come home to a mess, and if you don't clean up, they will probably think that you aren't responsible. To make the process of cleaning up more fun, make a game out of picking up the toys.

"
"
Remember the image you project.,
If the kids are scared of monsters, take a spray bottle and fill with water.,
Have an activity where the child can build something and then destroy it.",How to Play With Kids While Babysitting3," This is a job and the parents are your employers. Wear clothing that is modest, clean, and appropriate for the activities you will be doing with the children.

, Tell the kid that it is a special spray that will shoo away the monsters and get the kid to spray the water across the room. Make sure that the water bottle setting is on mist. If you can't use the spray bottle for some reason, take some glitter with you to the babysitting job and claim that it is pixie dust and if you sprinkle it over their favourite stuffed animal/doll/toy, then the stuffed animal/doll/toy will keep all of the monsters away. Just make sure that you clean up the glitter after you sprinkle it on the stuffed animal/doll/toy.

, For example, build something out of soft blocks or small square sponges and let them knock it down. You could also get them to build something out of Play-Doh or putty and then let them crush it. You'll keep the kids happy for hours playing like that.

Set rules before you play a game.,
Get them to make a skit for you to watch.,
Play Freeze Dance!,
Play Statues.,
Play Sardines.,
Play the Snail Game.,
Create a menu for a restaurant, food court, or ice cream shop.,
Play Daddy/Mommy.,
Play Spaceship.,
Organize a fun art activity.,
When playing games make sure that the games are the right age limit or that they don't have an age limit.",How to Play With Kids While Babysitting4," If you're playing outside, make sure that all the children play only in the designated playing area (their backyard, a safe park etc.) and as far away from all streets as possible. If you're playing inside, make sure that no children go outside, that they are playing safely and not playing dangerously (putting a coin in an electrical outlet if they are playing telephone booth for example) and that they stay out of all of the off-limits rooms, such as their parent's room. If you're playing with a child younger than four, stay with the child/children at all times while you're playing the game (especially if the child is younger than four), and be aware of where the child/children are the entire time you're babysitting.

, This is a good thing to get them to plan while you prepare lunch, or change a baby's diaper, or put a little one to bed. Most kids really enjoy this! Make sure that even if the play is extremely boring, look like you're having fun watching the skit! Most of the time, though, the kids come up with some great plays. Before you leave the kids alone, make it clear that they can only stick to a certain area (like the playroom or a bedroom) so that they aren't looking for prop ideas in other rooms and that should prevent the children from getting into lots of mischief.

, Take turns being the person in charge of the music, and turn the music on and off. When it's off, stop. When it comes back on, dance! You can also play this game just by moving around, if you don't want to dance.

, Pick one person to be ""It"". Everyone else moves around (dancing, jumping, or just walking) and when ""It"" says ""Statues!"" everyone freezes in whatever position they were in (if someone's arm is up, it stays up, or if someone's in a running position, they stay in that position). ""It"" walks around trying to make one person after another laugh or move. Whoever laughs first is ""It"" next!

, Sardines is the opposite of hide-and-go-seek. ""It"" hides in a space big enough all the children playing to hide, while the rest of the children count. When everyone is finished counting they all look for ""It"". When someone finds ""It"", they join him/her in hiding. The last person who finds ""It"" is ""It"" next! ""It"" or not, they'll have fun!


If you're playing with a child 4 years old or younger, always have the child with you. If you or the child is ""It"", have the child hide with you. When you're looking for ""It"", look with the young child.

, Using some sidewalk chalk, make a snail shape on the ground (the snail head is optional). Give each player a different color piece of chalk. The first player takes the stick or small rock and throws it onto a square of the snail. That player then walks on all of the squares of the snail starting at the snail's head and going around until they get into the middle of the snail's body, but the player jumps over the square with the stick/rock on it. If the player steps on all of the squares without losing her balance and without stepping on a line, she gets to write the first letter of her name in any one of the squares that she chooses. Then its the next player's turn, only now that player has to skip the square with the rock/stick in it and also the square with the first player's initial in it. Every time a player gets around the entire snail without stepping on the square with the stick in it, without stepping on a line, and without stepping in squares with their opponent's initials, they get to pick a square to put their initial in. Players are allowed to step in squares that have their initial, but not in squares that have an opponent's initial. The game continues until all of the squares are filled up. The player with the most amount of squares filled with her initial wins.


Place: Outside, on a driveway (or some open place where the chalk you use can be washed away by the rain. Not on a covered porch or similar place.)
To make the game a bit easier, change the rules so a person can write their first initial in a square if they make it around the snail without losing their balance and without stepping on a square with an opponent's initial. This is instead of without losing their balance, without stepping on a square with an opponent's initial, AND without stepping on a line.

, Make one on your computer or just neatly make one by hand. Make fake money and give an equal amount to each child. When you play the game, ask the children what they want to 'eat/drink', how much they want, and so on. Then take turns being the Ice Cream Man!

, Have one child go to the pillow or chair in the center of the room and close their eyes. Everyone else goes to the center of the room and everyone say together ""Don't wake Daddy (or Mommy if the player is a girl)!"" After they shout all the players walk around ""Daddy/Mommy"" in a circle not making a noise. When ""Daddy/Mommy"" hears someone make a noise, he/she says ""Bring bring bring"" then he/she counts to 5 out loud. When ""Daddy/Mommy"" starts saying ""bring bring bring"", the other children all run to their pillows around the room and pretend to be asleep. Once the ""Daddy/Mommy"" is done counting to 5 he/she opens their eyes to see if anyone is still running to a pillow or not looking like they are asleep. If someone is not doing what he or she should be doing (""sleeping"" on a pillow) then the ""Daddy/Mommy"" calls their name and they are the new ""Daddy/Mommy"".

, Pick a table to play with. Get under the table and pretend that it is your spaceship. When you get out of the spaceship, pretend you got out onto planet Dance, and that everyone is a professional dancer. Then go back in the ship and go somewhere else like Jump planet (get everyone to jump around), Laugh planet (everyone must laugh non-stop) and so on. Get each kid to take turns choosing a planet to go to. This can be a really fun game.

, Have each child you are babysitting go out to the yard and pick their favorite leaf (because of this step, this activity works best in fall). Take colored pencils and paper and put the leaf under the paper. Then lightly use the edge of a colored pencil to draw over the leaf, until the pattern of the leaf shows. Then cut the leaves out and glue them to a piece of paper! Look at all the pretty leaves!

, You wouldn't want the younger children not doing anything while the older kids are engaged in their games or vise versa. Try playing games/doing activities like bingo or even coloring as these activities are appropriate for all ages.

When going to the child's house, look presentable.,
When you get to their house, ring the doorbell once, then wait patiently and with a smile.

,
Greet them with a bubbly smile, and wait for them to invite you in.,

When the mom and dad say they're ready to go, say something like, ""See you at 11!",How to Make a Good Impression on Babysitting Parents," Wear an appropriate outfit, not something you might wear to a friend's house. Comb your hair, brush your teeth, and put on a nice body spray, or deodorant. This will give the parents the impression that you take care of yourself. (Which is hopefully true!) Be sure to avoid shorts shorter than a few inches above the knee, very tight clothing, anything badly ripped, and miss matched clothes.;
,, Say something like, ""You have a lovely home."" Or compliment the mother's clothing.

, Wait patiently for the parents instructions about what the kid can eat, or their bedtime, then nod with a look that says, ""Yes, yes of course.""

Avoid mommy thumb.,
Improve your hip and back flexibility.,
Do not carry the baby on your hip.",How to Lift and Carry a Baby," It is tempting to bend your back to pick up a baby, especially if you are picking the baby up from a lower surface. Bend at your knees to move to a lower level before you lift the baby. Bending at your knees shifts your weight and takes some of the pressure of of your back.Bending at the knees is particularly important if you have recently given birth. Your legs are much stronger than your back.
Your feet and knees should be at least shoulder-width apart when you lift.
If you have to squat to pick up the baby, stick your buttocks out and keep your back as flat as possible.;
, Slide your hand under the baby's head and place your other hand under the baby's bottom. Once you have a good grip, scoop the baby up and bring him or her to your chest.Always bring the baby close to your chest before you lift.Head support is critical for newborns because their neck muscles are not developed.Rely on your palms instead of your wrists to lift. Lifting a baby can put a strain on your wrist.Keep your thumbs close to your hand. Large gaps between your thumb and the rest of your hand will put a strain on the tendons that control your thumb.
Babies typically can keep their head up with minimal support around three or four months of age., This technique is good if you are lifting the baby from the ground. Place one foot next the baby and lower yourself down to one knee. Make sure the baby is close to your knee on the floor. Slide the baby from your knee to your mid-thigh and lift the baby onto your opposite thigh. Put both of your forearms under the baby and bring the baby close to your chest.Keep your back straight and your head facing forward as you do this technique.
To protect your back, make sure your buttocks is pushed out as you bend.

, Use this technique if you need to turn while you are lifting the baby. Lift the baby as you usually would and hold the baby close to your body. Turn your lead foot 90 degrees in the direction that you want to move. Bring your other foot to where your lead foot is.Move your feet instead of twisting your body. You can hurt your back if you turn your upper body instead of changing the position of your feet.
Try not to turn too quickly. Pivot at a slow,controlled pace.

, Rest the baby's head on your chest and slide your hand from the baby's bottom to support the baby's neck. Move your baby's head to the crook of your arm and then place your other hand on the baby's bottom. Once the baby is cradled in one arm, you can use your other arm to interact and play with the baby.Support your baby's neck as you get your baby settled into the cradle position.
Cradling is ideal for holding a newborn baby.

, Rest the baby on your chest and shoulder. Place one hand on the baby's bottom and support the baby's head and neck with your other hand.Keep your back straight and your abdominal muscles tight as you are holding the baby.


This position allows the baby to look over your shoulder and hear your heartbeat.
Alternate the shoulder that you carry the baby on. This can prevent overuse injuries.
Use your entire arm as you hold the baby. Your forearm is comprised of small muscles that may not be used to carrying a baby.
Keep your wrist straight and use your elbow and shoulder muscles to carry the baby.Avoid pointing your wrists and fingers towards the floor as you carry your baby.

, A baby sling is a fabric, one-shouldered carrier that is a safe option for carrying your baby.Make sure that your baby's face is not covered by your body or the sling when you carry your baby this way. Your baby may have difficulty breathing if his or her face is covered.Bend at your knees if you pick something while holding your baby in the sling.
You can alternate the shoulder that your sling is on to help with alignment issues and from tiring one of your shoulders out.
Always read the instructions when you use a sling. There is a weight minimum for using the sling.

, Carrying the baby on the front of your body allows you to keep the baby close to your body and evenly distribute the weight of the baby. Cinch the carrier around your waist and shoulders.Make sure the baby is facing you instead of facing outwards.Facing the baby outwards puts pressure on the baby's spinal curves and hips. This can result on developmental issues for your baby in the future.
Facing the baby towards you will also protect your spine. If your baby is facing outwards, more pressure is put on your spine and back.

, You do not have to support the head and neck of older babies when you pick them up. Get close to the baby and squat down to pick the baby up. Reach under the baby's armpit and lift the baby towards you.Try not to hook your thumbs under the baby's armpits. Keep your fingers together and cup your hands instead. This will help protect your wrists.You can use this same technique to put the baby down as well.

, Hold the baby's back against your chest. Put one hand around the baby's waist and use your other hand to support the baby's bottom. This position allows your baby to look around.You can use a variation of this position to soothe your baby if he or she is upset.


Put your left arm over the baby's left shoulder and hold the baby's right thigh. The baby should have one arm on each side of your arm and his or head should be near your elbow. Your hands should meet near the baby's crotch area.You can gently bounce in this position as well to soothe your baby.

, Older babies enjoy being held on an adult's shoulders. Hold the baby facing your chest and allow the baby's arms to drape over your shoulders.You can use one or two hands depending on how heavy the baby is and if you need a free hand.


Keep your back straight when you hold the baby up to your shoulder. Arching your back can result in a back strain., If your baby is able to support his or her own head and neck and the hips and legs open naturally, you can begin to carry the baby on your back using a baby carrier. This position allows you to be close to your baby and have a lot of mobility. Center the baby in the carrier and tighten the shoulder straps. The baby should feel snug against your body, but still be able to move.The heavier the baby, the tighter the straps need to be.
When you are first learning to use the baby carrier, practice over a bed for safety purposes. It may also be helpful to have another person help you.
Always read the weight requirements and instructions before you use the baby carrier.
Your baby should be ready for back carrying at about 6 months of age.

, If the car seat is in one of of the outside seats, put one leg into your car and face the car seat to put the baby in and out of the car seat. This position takes some of the pressure off of your back. If the car seat is in the middle seat, get in the car and face the car seat to lift your baby into the seat.It can be hard to do this if your baby is moving a lot or you are in a rush, but try to be in a good position the majority of the time.
The worst thing you can do is keep both of your feet on the ground and twist your entire body to place the baby in the car seat. You can injure your shoulders, knees, back, wrists, and neck.

, As your baby becomes heavier, you may begin to feel a strain on your shoulders, neck, and back. Look for carriers with wide, padded straps and a waistband. The waistband helps support the baby's weight and takes the pressure off of your shoulders.Choose baby carriers that are made from soft fabrics and are easy to clean.
Try on different baby carriers before you purchase one., The proper technique for lifting and carrying a baby can be overwhelming, and it can be easy to forget all of the steps involved. However, there a a few key points that will always apply. The BACK acronym is a quick way to remember the most important things to keep you safe.B is for keeping your back straight.
A is for avoiding twisting to lift or carry the baby.
C is for keeping the baby close to your body.
K is for keeping your movements smooth.

, New mothers and people who lift infants often experience inflammation near the thumb and wrist. This condition is called mommy thumb (i.e. De Quervain's tendinitis). If you have pain or swelling around your thumb, a sticking sensation, or difficulty pinching or grasping something with your thumb, you may have mommy thumb.


Apply ice or a cold compress to your wrist to alleviate symptoms.
Use your palms instead of relying on your wrist to lift your baby. Cradle the baby with your forearm and fingers and relax your fingers as you hold the baby.
See a physician if icing or resting your thumb and wrist does not alleviate the symptoms.

, Hip and back injuries are common among new parents. Restoring your hip and back flexibility will help you prevent injuries. Stretching and light yoga are good ways to get more flexible.If you are a new mother, talk to your doctor before you begin exercising again. Make sure that it is safe for you to begin exercising and discuss what type of exercises are safe and realistic for you.
Even some light stretching while your baby is taking a nap will be beneficial.

, Carrying your baby on one hip is convenient and allows you to do other things with your free hand. However, balancing the baby on your hip puts a strain on your back and hips on one side if you body.Hip carrying can result in pelvic pain and alignment (e.g. back, hip, and pelvis) issues.Alternate hips and hold the baby with both arms if you carry the baby on your hip.
If you do carry the baby on your hip, try not to stick your hip out. Stand as upright as possible and keep your back straight. Use your bicep to hold the baby instead of your wrist and forearms."
"
Realize that it isn't about age but maturity.,
If you feel that they are reasonably mature, how do they interact with kids?,
Would they be able to deal with emergency situations?,
If you feel that your child is ready, and if they are eager and willing, enroll them in a babysitting course and a CPR/First Aid course.,
If you are still unsure, have them become a mother's helper first.

",How to Know When Your Child is Old Enough to Babysit," Some ten year-olds can babysit very well, while other sixteen year-olds aren't ready. This doesn't mean that your nine-year-old can start babysitting, it means that they should have the maturity of an adult before they start.


How to tell if they are mature enough: Do they do their homework responsibly and have good grades? Do they take responsibility for their actions? Do they learn from their mistakes? Can they communicate effectively with peers, children, and adults? Can they follow instructions well and complete them on time? Are they patient and respectful? Can they take constructive criticism? The answer to all of these questions should be a resounding yes. Although it is about maturity, your child should be about thirteen before watching others' children for the sole reason that parents will not be comfortable having anybody younger than that watch their children.
Try to assess their maturity from an impersonal point of view. Would you feel comfortable having them babysit? Do you feel that your child would act honorably without anybody watching?;
, If your child has younger siblings, he or she should treat them well and with respect. If he cannot care for his sibling(s) he shouldn't attempt to care for others' children. Is your child comfortable with kids? Can he or she face a dirty diaper, a scraped knee, or a temper tantrum?


Think back to the days of when you were a new parent. Do you feel that your child has all of the necessary skills to take care of kids of many ages?

, Would they know what to do during a fire, power outage, natural disaster, or if a child was seriously hurt? Make sure that they know all local emergency numbers, and quiz them on up-to-date information regarding natural disasters, fires, and any other emergency situations that may be more common where you live. Would your child know how to deal with an intoxicated parent or report an abusive situation?

, Many of these courses are affiliated with the Red Cross or YMCA. Make sure that your child is comfortable with all of the information that they learn during the babysitting course.


Make sure that they know adult, child and infant CPR and how to give the Heimlich to all of these ages. They should be knowledgeable in first aid and emergency procedures as well.

",How to Have Fun with Your Babysitter," Do your best to complete your assignments in order to have more time to play. Ask your babysitter for help if necessary, but make sure that you do most of the work by yourself.

Keep children under age 5 within eyesight at all times.,
Keep them close.,
Avoid leaving a child alone in a hot car should you go somewhere.,
Avoid answering the door or the phone unless it is the parents.,
Supervise children if they are swimming or taking a bath.,
Avoid allowing children, even older ones, to go anywhere by themselves, unless the parents are 100 percent okay with it.,
Be aware of all choking hazards.,
Make sure children are not messing with things that could injure themselves or others.,
Know basic first aid before you even start babysitting.,
Make sure children are not fighting with each other.",How to Keep Kids Safe While Babysitting," If they start to go off in another direction, be sure that you follow them, or ask them where they are going, and be prepared to stop them if they are going someplace they aren't supposed to be going to. If a child is over age 5, allow them to stay inside the house, but only in rooms they know aren't off limits to them. If they go outside (make sure the parents allow this), limit them to within eyesight of you only.


If a child is in another room, be sure that you don't have any TV or stereos up extremely loud, where you won't hear if they need something or if they are crying.;
, If you are at a public place with a lot of people, then be sure that you keep them close to you. Allow them to explore a little if you are at a place such as the park, but always make sure you can see them and know where they are.


Before the parents leave, ask them if you are allowed to go anywhere in public. If they say no, then be sure that you respect their wishes, even if the children really want to go, as the parents definitely said no for a reason, whatever that reason may be.

, If you leave the child in the car and someone finds them, and you, then it is possible for you to face criminal charges. Even if you think you'll only be somewhere for a minute, and the child doesn't want to go in, take them with you, as it is for their own safety.

, If it is another person that the parents are expecting, the parents may have a code word or something similar that they use. Ask the parents beforehand what the code may be if they say that they are expecting someone, and if they do not have a code they will use, ask them for a clear way to identify the person.


If you suspect that there is a dangerous person on the property, then make sure that you and all of the children stay inside and that youcontact emergency services immediately.

, It is possible for even older children to drown. Use the bathroom and do other necessary things you may need to do before you allow them in the pool.


Again, check with the parents before they leave if the children are allowed to swim. If they say no, it is important that you respect their wishes, as once again, the parents said no for a reason.

, If the child sets up something with a friend while you are there that the parents did not know about, although it may not be ideal, you may have to call the parents. They can approve or deny the child hanging out with their friend. If the parents already said no friends before you left, then you yourself can tell the child no.

, Children under the age of 5 are at the greatest risk for choking, although any child of any age can choke. To prevent this, make sure food is cut up into small pieces, and that you closely monitor the child if they are playing with a toy that is labeled as a choking hazard.

, Be sure that the parents have the medicine cabinet clearly off limits, as well as any sharp tools such as knives. If you see the child about to grab something that can be harmful, immediately stop them. If you know that they have swallowed any pills or medicine, then be sure that you contact the poison control center immediately, as they will have information for what you need to do.

, This is important, because even if you need to call an ambulance, if you provide basic first aid, that can be the difference between life and death, if the child has a severe injury or illness.


It is also reccomended that you learn CPR before a babysitting job, as this can be important if the child is choking, or stops breathing for another reason, you can potentially save their lives. This, along with basic first aid, can be learned at a class. Usually you can find classes in your area by doing an online search.

, If they are fighting and get too rough, injury can result. Therefore, discourage any wrestling, or play fighting between the children. If they are actually fighting and getting physical, then seperate them immediately.

Decide if you want a career in childcare.,
Contact the proper department in your state.,
Pass background checks.,
Pass an inspection.,
Apply for a license through your state.",How to Get a Babysitting License3," Becoming a state licensed childcare provider is more than just “babysitting.” It means that you are a small business owner responsible for the health, happiness, and development of small children.Before seeking a childcare license, ask yourself the following questions:


Do I enjoy working with children?
Am I knowledgeable about child development or willing to learn?
Am I ready to be a small business owner?

, In each state, there is a department that handles the licensing of childcare providers. Each state will have different specific requirements for gaining your childcare license (such as age and education requirements), so it is important to contact your state before you take any steps.


In Illinois, this is either the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS), or the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).
In California, this is the Department of Social Services (CDSS).
In Missouri, this is the Department of Health and Senior Services.

, Once you are sure that you meet the age and education requirements in your state, you will need to pass a criminal background check through your state agency. They will also ensure that you do not appear on the national or state–level sex offender registries (SORS), or within the Child Abuse and Neglect Tracking System (CANTS).Each state is different, but you may be disqualified if you have been convicted of a felony.
You will likewise be disqualified if you have been convicted of a sex crime, are listed in any sex offender registry, or have been convicted of child abuse or neglect.
Additionally, they will look into your driving record and general criminal history.

, The next step in becoming a licensed childcare provider in your state is for the location to pass an inspection. Whether you plan to open a daycare center or to care for children in your home, an inspector will need to come out and ensure that you meet all the standard health and safety requirements. Once again, these will vary by state, so it is imperative for you to check with your local government agency.Contact your local agency to procure a list of safety requirements, and make any adjustments, before requesting an inspection.
For example, some states require you to have a fence around a swimming pool.

, After you have met the age and education requirements, passed the appropriate background checks, and passed the home/facility inspection, you are eligible to apply for a license in your state. Once again, you will need to contact the appropriate department in your given state and follow the particulars of your state’s procedures.

Ask for referrals.,
Try a directory.,
Consider an agency.,
Post an ad (or respond to someone else's).,
Follow agency/directory protocol, if using one.,
Start with email, messages, or a phone call.,
Be clear about your expectations.,
Meet in person.,
Introduce them to your kids.,
Agree to terms.,
Keep an open mind for the first few sitting sessions.",How to Find a Babysitter Online," One of the best ways to find a sitter you trust is to ask people whose opinions you respect. If you have a wide circle of local friends or relatives who are parents, try posting on your social media accounts or sending a group email asking for referrals. You may even find a family who is open to nanny-sharing.;
, There are a range of nanny and caregiving directories available online, including Sittercity.com and Care.com. These provide a platform for connecting potential sitters with potential employers. While they all operate a little differently and some cost money while others do not, they tend to give you the option to look through a range of qualified sitters so that you can compare profiles, experience, rates, and personalities.


Some such sites work just as directories, connecting sitters and employers, while others are more like agencies and require participation in the ongoing employment situation. Be sure to read the FAQ and Terms of Service before you sign up for a service so you know exactly what you're getting.

, Going a step further than a directory, some services create an ongoing relationship with their sitters and families. These companies tend to be locally operated, so try searching in your area for websites of local options.


Many of these agencies get involved in actual payment of the sitter/nanny as well, acting as a go-between to handle taxes, schedules, etc. This likely means your sitter will walk away with less money per hour than what you're actually paying to the agency. However, the upside is that you can be sure scheduling, financial, and legal issues are taken care of by people with experience.
Another benefit of agencies is that they tend to have lots of sitters on their service. If you need a last-minute option, calling up an agency can help you get connected quickly with someone suitable (particularly if you already have an existing relationship with the agency in general).

, An option for the more ""DIY"" parent is to post your own ad on a classified ad site, like Craigslist. Many of these sites offer a ""child care"" section that will include postings from parents seeking sitters, sitters seeking employment, and daycares offering open spaces.


Any time you post personal information online, it pays to be safe and cautious. If you contact a potential sitter or are contacted by one, do your due diligence. Spend time emailing about their experience, check their references, and meet in person for a thorough interview, before you leave them alone in the sitters' care.

, Many agencies and sitter services have a set approach to matching families and sitters. If you're using such a service as your go-between, follow their rules and procedures. Many of the following steps may be handled differently, depending on their policies.

, Once you find a potential sitter you're interested in, start with some contact to find out quickly whether it's a good match, before you meet. You may or may not choose to address wages at this point, but it's definitely important to touch base on schedules, expectations, experience, and references.


Find out what kind of commitment they can make to the job, and be sure it matches your needs. There's no point in pursuing the situation further if you need a full-time nanny and they only have a few hours a week free, or if you only need a Saturday night sitter and they want a full-time job.
Don't forget that you need to actually like your sitter, too. Being a great babysitter involves more than just showing up and collecting an agreed-upon paycheck. You want to ""click"" with your sitter, and be confident that they'll take an approach with your children that works for you.

, In initial contact and further meetings, give the potential sitter a good idea of what you want from them. Make sure you address any big concerns you have when it comes to parenting and childcare. For example, if you're going to require your sitter to cook fresh meals from scratch every day, let them know that's a requirement. If you have a particular parenting or discipline style, talk about it early, to make sure it's something they can adopt consistently, too.

, If communication has gone well so far and you feel like you might have found a good sitter, try to meet in person before you need them to actually take care of your kids. During this meeting, be kind and friendly, but do take it seriously; treat it like an interview for both of you. You should ask questions about their experience, goals, and interests, and you should also be open to them asking you about your kids and family.


A great sitter will be just as interested in finding out about your family norms and kids' habits and hobbies as they will be in selling their services to you.

, A good sitter should be interested in your children and consider their wellbeing paramount. If everything has clicked so far in your interactions, then it's time to have them meet the kids. Be present when they do, particularly if they're younger children.


If your kids are young, nervous, or shy, try to create a situation where you can all play together for a few minutes, before the kids get comfortable with the new sitter. It's unfair both to the child and to the sitter to just introduce them and leave; your kid will feel uncomfortable, and your sitter won't have a good sense of how you interact with your kids. They can learn your household norms better by seeing you interact for a while.

, If you do decide to hire the sitter, let them know! Make them an offer on wage and schedule (if you haven't already). This should be exciting for both of you, so add a little humanity in the mix by showing your enthusiasm and warmth. But do make your terms/rates clear, and get confirmation from them that they want the job given those terms.


Be sure to address issues like tax withholding, benefits (or lack thereof), and any minimum guarantee of hours, from the get-go. You don't want to get to the next tax deadline only to find out that you were hoping to keep payments off the taxman's radar, but they've been declaring them. On that note, know that it's best to make any sitting relationship ""official"" and pay the necessary taxes, particularly if it's an on-going or long-term arrangement; not doing so may come back to bite you, with big penalties, in the long run.

, Obviously, if your sitter do anything that makes you doubt their qualifications or mistrust them, then it's a good idea to discuss it and if necessary terminate the employment; your kids' safety is paramount. However, if things are a little slow to start with because your sitter and kids are still getting to know each other, don't take that as a sign of failure. Keep an open mind for a little while, as they get to know each other, and let the relationship build naturally.


If you need to, you can always revive your search and look for a replacement, but give your first hire a fair chance to show what they can do and get comfortable in the role, before you decide to move on.

While it is unlikely that your city representatives are going to be willing to post your desire for a babysitting job on the front page, they may be able to refer you to message boards or community chatrooms, where you can present your information, pay rate, and the services you offer.

, Mobile phone apps are similar to Care.com and other babysitting sites, but with the convenience of a cell phone. These apps allow you to stay up-to-date with local needs, and will give you an edge over other babysitters relying upon word-of-mouth or print advertisements alone.There are many apps for babysitting, the most common of which is UrbanSitter. SitterCity also has a mobile app, as well as Care.com. Other apps include Sitter and CluckCluck, all of which allow you to show your availability and search for open positions.
If you use several different apps, make sure you check in with each of them regularly. Failing to respond to a babysitting request quickly could mean losing a new client or frustrating a continuing client.

Make a fun bag.",How to Entertain Kids when You Are Babysitting2," In the fun bag you could have candy (if they are allowed), movies (check with parents first as they may only allow their kids to watch a certain age rating), coloring pages, stickers, books, games, and crafts, as well as various things for you when the kids go to sleep. Consider the age of the children you are babysitting, as very young children will appreciate different things from older children.;

Try playing games that you think children might find exciting.,
Play fun, age appropriate games.,
Play the ""Do not laugh"" game.,
Let the kids be the babysitter!,
Make up a song or a story together.,
Keep all of the kids active.",How to Entertain Kids when You Are Babysitting3," Ask them what they like playing first- some children may not like things that are suggested to play.

, Older children about age 10 may enjoy board games or things that are not as energetic as the games that younger kids may like. Don't do anything that is too old for the kids because you want parents to want you to come back.


When playing with the kids, be sure to not be rough with them, especially when you have a younger age group. This may turn them off and somebody could get hurt.
Musical chairs is a fun game appropriate for all ages. Just make sure the chairs are small enough for the kids.

, Sit the kids down into a semi-circle and make funny faces. Whoever laughs first has to make silly faces with you. The last person not to laugh wins! Give all the kids a small prize, like a colorful band-aid or a half of a cookie.

, Have the kids ""feed you lunch"" by having them give you an already prepared snack, like fruit snacks and a juice box. Then let them decide the game you play next or what their snack is.

, A great game to play is called step one step two. You make up the first part of the song/story, then the next person makes up the second part of the story and so on.

, If you have a lot of children, play freeze tag, or a team game where everyone needs to be involved.

Make cards.,
Make a bracelet or necklace.,
Make or buy play-dough.",How to Entertain Kids when You Are Babysitting4," Cards can be painted, drawn or made using decoupage, stickers, etc.

, Measure the child's neck or wrist. Measure out the string and tape the end of the string to a paper plate. Start beading. When you are finished, remove the string and tie the two ends together.

, If you have a recipe that doesn't involve cooking on the stove, you can have the kids help make it. If you don't have the materials needed for play-dough, you can make something called Oobleck with simply water and cornstarch. This is especially good because it doesn't involve dangerous, hot ovens or sharp objects. Do this outside of course, as it is extremely messy, but that's the fun of it! Oobleck is a solid and a liquid. It is really fun.

"
"
Do some basic cooking or food preparation.,
Tell them that they get to pick what they want to eat.,
If you can make play items edible, it's good.",How to Entertain Kids when You Are Babysitting5," Kids often love to do things for themselves, especially if it means a snack. Let them pour or stir their own drinks, make their own peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, or help you make cookies. This helps pass the time while teaching them skills, and they will feel more involved and grown up instead of you taking over everything.


Many things that adults think of as drudgery is fun for young children. Find ways to let them help you and make them feel important. Thank them for helping.

, Give them options to choose from. They can help prepare too.


If you give the kids snacks, serve them a way that's a little fancier than you'd normally expect.

, Some finger painting and play dough recipes are edible. For example, vanilla yogurt with food coloring can make for interesting, edible paint. And no-bake cookies are delicious and easy!

Take the kids outside.,
Pretend you're on an adventure!",How to Entertain Kids when You Are Babysitting6," Hide and Seek and Tag are always options! Ride bikes, go to the park, walk the dog, anything outdoors will run their energy out! Make sure to be very careful because the outdoors also has many hazards. Put bug-spray and sunblock on them, and dress them for appropriate weather. Make sure that they don't have any allergies though, whether it's to the sun tan lotion and bug-spray or and allergy to bees or other outdoor things.

, Pretend you are lost in the woods, and need food and water, and the children are the heroes.

Talk to your parents about babysitting siblings.,
Ask your extended family if they need a babysitter.,
Ask family friends and neighbors if they need help.,
Tell your church or community center.,
Practice babysitting and gather references.",How to Find a Babysitter Job2," If you have a younger sibling, you can ask your parents for the chance to watch your sibling to gain experience. You can start out small, watching your sibling for an hour or two and gradually work your way up to an afternoon or evening.Demonstrate responsibility by helping your parents with sibling-related tasks, like changing diapers, putting lunch together, or playing.
If possible, start out watching a sibling before moving on to watching a stranger’s children. Doing so will give you a chance to build up your confidence and skill.

, If you have no younger siblings or are ready to move on to more babysitting jobs, ask your aunts, uncles, and cousins if you can help them with their kids. To start, you can watch them for free, but it is also reasonable to request a fee for your time and work. To show you are responsible enough to watch your family’s children, try tagging along on a shopping trip or fun outing and helping with the children with your aunt or uncle nearby first. Then, if they see you doing well, you can move on to watching children on your own.
Talk about payment beforehand to avoid any awkward mix-ups, and ask your family what they think a fair price would be.

, After your extended family, ask family friends and neighbors if they could use a babysitter. The next step in babysitting is branching out to friends of your family.


Determine what your time is worth, and firmly (but kindly) relay this information to the parents for whom you are babysitting. You can charge $7 per hour, plus an additional $2 per hour per child, for instance, or you can charge a flat fee of $8-$10.
Family friends are sure to be familiar with you, but a neighbor might not immediately be comfortable. In this case, offer to help them out for a few days with supervision. If they like how you help with supervision, you can move on to unsupervised jobs.

, Your church or community center might know of someone who needs a babysitter, so let them know you are available to work.


Churches and community groups can be great resources for people looking for babysitting or nannying jobs, as people often go to both as a way to find help. If you are not affiliated with a particular church, don’t fret; a community center or social club may be just as helpful.

, Once you have started babysitting for people you are familiar with, babysit as often as you are able. This will help you develop the skills necessary to successfully care for children, and will help you feel calmer when dealing with unexpected or new situations.If you babysit for someone and they are pleased with your work, ask to use them as a reference. If they agree, make sure you use a phone number or email address they feel comfortable being contacted through.
Include at least one reference on any flyers you give out, and any online presence you create. This will lend you an air of credibility that others might not have.

"
"
Create a flyer.,
Choose 3-4 posting locations, to start.,
Hand out your flyer at community events.,
Cultivate an online presence.",How to Find a Babysitter Job3," Type up your information, such as your name, experience, and email, and create a flyer to post or hand out. A flyer should be simple and clean, with a clear, straight font. You can use color, if you’d like, but avoid using all capital letters, or using too many photos, as this can make you seem young and inexperienced.Your flyer does not need to take up a full page. Instead, create a flyer that takes up half a page. Half a page will still stand out on a bulletin board, but will not overwhelm and cover up other postings.
Create a flyer that has small tabs to rip off. That way, people can quickly and easily get a hold of your contact information.

, You might be tempted to post your flyers everywhere you can, but hold off at first, and choose 3-4 locations. If you post in too many places, you can quickly become overwhelmed by calls and emails. Make sure you revisit your postings regularly to determine if you have chosen a good location, and to see whether or not your flyers are being used.


Place your flyer at a grocery store you frequent, your school bulletin board, your community center bulletin board, or ask local businesses if you can place your flyers in their window.
If several weeks have passed and you have not gotten any calls, begin branching out and posting your information in more locations. Try to check back every 2 weeks to determine whether or not someone has taken your tags.

, Visit local events and hand your flyers out to families you encounter. Strike up a conversation, smile, and be polite. Be prepared to answer questions about your experience, background, and availability.If you have not yet decided on a definite price for your services, you should do so immediately. Your pay rate is likely to be one of the first questions parents ask you, so make sure you have an answer ready.

, You can create a simple website to refer people to, or you can just have a Facebook page dedicated to babysitting. Having an online presence will allow prospective clients to learn a little bit about you before hiring you.To start out, you do not need an expensive, professional site. You can use Wordpress or Blogger to display your information.
Protect yourself if you create a website. Do not post personal information such as your address or phone number. Instead, link to your email address, and focus on your skills and experience.

Ask the parent(s) about the what toys the baby has, how they are usually entertained, and so on.,
Give the baby a toy.,
Give the baby something interesting to look at.,
Have them explore their five senses: touch, sight, taste, hearing, and smell.,
When they gurgle at you, gurgle back!,
Play a few simple games.,
Put on a puppet show.,
Read baby a story or cute poem.,
Stay positive.",How to Entertain a Baby While Babysitting," This will really help you out when trying to figure out what to do to entertain them.;
, The toy should be one of the toys the baby already has. If it's a toy that you brought, make sure that you washed it thoroughly ahead of time and that it is not too small to play with. If the baby starts sucking on the toy don't be grossed out or alarmed, as this is a way for the baby to further explore the toy will their sense of taste. Here are a few good toys to bring for the baby if you are bringing toys:


rattles
small stuffed animals/stuffed dolls/stuffed puppets (as long as the toys is not too small and that the toy isn't a dollar store one as if the baby is teething, he/she may break pieces off of the toys and swallow it)
water toys like funnels and rubber ducks (it's best not to let baby suck on these toys, and while near the water when playing will the toys, keep a firm grip on the baby and do not let the baby fall in or put the baby in intentionally)

, Try bringing a picture book or a kid-friendly magazine like National Geographic Kids or Chirp so that you can show the baby the pictures in the magazine/book. You can also simply change baby's surroundings a bit. Do this by taking a bit of a walk inside or outside the house, letting them look out the window, or turning on the T.V, changing it to a kid-friendly channel like Treehouse, or TVO Kids. You can also let them study your face if they haven't seen you before or if they haven't seen you often. If they are familiar with you, try making funny faces (like 'fish' faces, sticking your tongue out and so on) at them and see if you get a reaction.

, For touch, tickle them, rub different textured things (like felt, faux fur, a soft fabric and so on) against their skin, blow gently on their skin, and walk your fingers up their arms and legs. For sight, show them pictures from kid-friendly magazines and picture books, change their surroundings, and make funny faces (see previous step for more). For hearing, make different sounds/noises (ring a bell, tap your fingernail against something, and so on), whistle and make clucking noises with your tongue, and simply talk to them using different tones and pitches. For taste, let them suck on their thumbs and toys (see step 2 for a little more on this), and possibly give them a new flavour of baby food or something like that. For smell, bring a few mildly smelly things with you (flowers are ideal) and let them smell them (don't let them suck on it though!).

, This can be quite entertaining for both the baby, and you! Also, if they say something that sounds like it could be developed into a word (for example, if they say 'ma, mama, da, or dada' say, 'daddy', or 'mommy'.)

, You can try to think of more games, but here are a few suggestions:


Peek-A-Boo--- First, hide your face with your hands. Say, ""Where am I? Where is *insert your name here*?"" Then, remove your hands and say, ""Peek-A-Boo! Here I am!"" Put a happy, excited expression on your face as you remove your hands. Do this a few more times. As baby becomes familiar with the game, gently take baby's hands, and put them over their face without touching their hands to their face. Then say, ""Where are you? Where is *insert baby's name here*?"" Then, remove their hands from their face and say, ""Peek-A-Boo! There you are!"" This game is a really fun and exciting game for babies.
I Spy Junior--- First, say ""I Spy with my little eye..."" name the thing that you are thinking of, and then describe the object. For example, if your item is baby's bib and it is pink with a purple giraffe on it, say ""I Spy with my little eye, baby's pink bib with a purple giraffe!"" You could also say, ""I Spy with my little eye, baby's bib! It is pink, and it has a purple giraffe on it!"" If you can pick up the object, pick the object up and show it to them. Then say, ""Here is the *insert object's name here*!"" If you can't pick it up, walk over to the object and say, ""This is the *insert object name here*!"" Then describe it telling baby what colour it is, what the texture is like, and other interesting and important little details.
Bouncing On Knee Games--- Sit down, and hold baby on your lap. Make sure that baby is in a sitting position. Then, bounce your knee up and down, but don't bounce it too much. While bouncing baby, recite a cute nursery rhyme or make up your own rhyme.

, Use some finger puppets, dollar store puppets, or even homemade ones. You can also use oragami figurines to put on the show. Try having baby as one of the characters! Give the character baby's name and make sure that the character is the main character and that the character is very kind and has a nice personality. Have fun with the show and try to make baby giggle and smile.

, Baby may not be able to understand the story/poem because of how young they are, but the baby will enjoy hearing your voice and will still have fun.

, If you are positive and have fun, baby will most likely have fun with you!

Read together.,
Teach the kids a song.,
Have a dance party.,
Pick a movie appropriate for the age group you're babysitting.,
Make a tent.,
Have a girly activity session.",How to Entertain Kids when You Are Babysitting7," Some kids enjoy reading, while others don't. Find a good book or ask the kids what they want you to read to them. Download some nice background music on your iPod. A good website to get this music from is Incompetech.com. Play the music in the background while reading. This will also work for acting out something or for putting on a talent show. Adding background music will really set the mood!

, Old MacDonald had a farm, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Baa Baa Black Sheep, Happy Birthday or the ABC song are good. Bring along a kiddie music CD or download some kid music onto your iPod, and play it. Kids love dancing, singing, and music.

, Little kids love to sing and dance, so play some music that's age appropriate and let them jump and sing and dance.

, Pop some popcorn and put the popcorn in individual bowls for each child (if they are young). Give each child a ticket awhile before the movie. Be the ticket-taker at the door to the room, and give each child a bowl of popcorn. Then turn off the lights and start the movie!

, Use chairs and big blankets. Fill the inside with pillows and blankets. After it's made, you can tell (or read!) stories. If it's possible, make it over a TV, so the TV is inside, and you have a movie theater! If the children are 4 or older (and less likely to make a mess), pop some popcorn to get the great movie atmosphere!

, Babysitting all girls can be fun. You can do hair, make-up, nails, tea parties, etc. Be sure to get permission from parents before doing any make-up, nails or anything messy.

If the kids seem shy or scared, ask them about the house.,
If a child feels unwell, and the parents aren't available, consider the situation.,
Deal with naughtiness with care and consideration.,
Aim to make ensuring the kids have a good time your ultimate goal.",How to Entertain Kids when You Are Babysitting8," If they still don't do anything, then wait a little and make silly faces. If you can get them to laugh at you, soon they will trust and accept you more.


If a child is afraid of a monster hiding in their closet, make a ""monster spray"" using water in a spray bottle (bring one with you). Before bedtime, spray the child's room with the monster spray so they won't be afraid of the ""monster"".

, Do they have a slight tummy ache or are they bleeding? If they are bleeding or anything as bad, take them to A&E, whereas, if they have a slight tummy ache, tuck them into bed and read them stories, or draw with them.

, Treat the kids with respect. Expect good behavior and ignore minor misbehavior, which ought to be enough to make it stop.


Keep the kids entertained by offering reward for good behavior and help. Make them feel good by rewarding, but not too much. (Bring a little prize or treat for the end. If the kids were well behaved, then they can have the treat.)
Use time out as a last resort, only if the children are really misbehaving. It can be useful if they are being a danger to themselves or someone else. However, it is normally to be avoided because that is what they will remember the most from your visit and might be reluctant in wanting you to return.

, That way, you'll get a great review and you'll be asked back.


Clean up most of the house after the kids have gone to bed. The parents will really appreciate it. But don't reorganize things a different way, or change something completely. This might make the parents confused or mad if they can't find something.

"
"
Ask them nicely.,
Be serious.,
Wear them out.,
Use magical potions.,
Give them a warm drink before bed, with the parent's approval if you're babysitting, like hot cocoa or warm milk.,
Read them a bedtime story, give them a back rub, sing a lullaby.,
If the child is afraid of monsters or something of the like, bring a spray bottle of water and say, ""It's Monster Go-Away Spray!,
Get a nightlight.",How to Encourage Kids to Go to Sleep when Babysitting," If you are mean to them, obviously they're not going to want to listen to you. From their eyes, you're the bad guy. If you stay on their good side by being nice to them, they're more likely to listen to you.;
, Sometimes kids have a hard time figuring out if you're serious or just fooling around. Make sure they understand that when you say 'Bed time,' you mean business.

, Run around, do jumping jacks, go outside, anything. If they're tired, they'll go to sleep.

, Okay, maybe we know they're not magical, but the kids don't. Try mixing apple juice and orange juice, calling it, 'sleepy medicine', and all of a sudden, the kids are very tired. You don't even have to stick with 'potions', other foods work too.

, The best warm milk recipe calls for one cup of milk, a dusting of cinnamon sugar, and some vanilla flavoring. It's a zesty and delicious treat!

, This creates a relaxing environment that calms them down and gets them ready for sleep.

, It's my secret potion! So you have to promise NEVER to tell anyone!"" Goodnight!

, If the child is scared, they're not going to go to sleep. A simple nightlight will fix the problem in a jiffy.

Have good hygiene.,
Wear clothes that you feel comfortable in.,
Wear some nice sneakers.,
Have a simple hairstyle.,
Have natural or subtle makeup.,
Have subtle nails.,
Accessorize.,
Say good morning Mr/ Mrs/sir/ma'am and remember please and thank you all the time.,
Finished!",How to Dress for a Babysitting Interview," Take a shower, use deodorant, wash your face, brush your hair, floss, and brush your teeth right before you leave. Don't do anything overly complicated; the parents you're babysitting for will not care how large your pores are or how exfoliated you are.;
, A good idea is just to wear a pastel-colored jeans and cute t-shirt with something childish on it like Mickey Mouse. If this doesn't work for you wear a nice dress- knee high or longer -and pair it with a belt. Do not have anything offensive or controversial on your clothes, such as political views, curse words, or a band that is known for profanity.


Pretend you're going to school, where you have a dress code. This means no short necklines, no holes, etc.

, Not the ones you use for gym class, but your favorite Vans or Nike's. If you want, just wear a pair of black flats. If it is very cold, wear some boots or if you have wear Uggs. For a summery look, with a dress wear flat sandals or short heeled wedges.

, Have a ponytail, braid, bun, or just leave it down.

, You want to give the faint appearance of makeup, or none at all. If you choose to have none, just wash your face well and use any cover-up if needed.

For subtle makeup: Start with concealer- not foundation, because foundation is cakey. Next, apply a light blush to the apples of your cheeks and blend it in. Apply primer to your eyelids then apply a brown eyeliner to your eyes and a white to your waterline to give a wide awake affect. After apply your eye shadow. Go for pastel shades in brown or core maroon and make sure to blend it in. Then apply your favorite tinted lip balm.







, Paint them clear or go for a french manicure with NO extensions. If you have short nails just keep with dark nude colors; it gives them more length. Also, try painting a white tip on them to make them look longer.

, Wear a watch, some stud earrings, a nice scarf, and maybe a belt. Make sure to take out any nose, lip, or eyebrow piercings you have. Use basic colors such brown, black and navy.

, Have good posture- put your shoulders back and feel good with how you look.

, With all this you should look brilliant. Remember to smile!

Ask other babysitters you know.,

, They have a rate calculator. Just type in your area code and they'll tell you about how much you should get paid by the hour.

, After all, they are an adult, and they ARE paying you to watch the most important thing in their lives. They probably have a good idea what you should be paid; don't you think?

, Some good starting price points are:


$7.50 an hour for 0-2 year olds.
$6 an hour for 3-5 year olds.
$5.50 an hour for ages 6 and up.

Be honest if you already have plans.,
Keep your excuses simple if you choose to make them up.,
Indicate whether you'd be interested in babysitting for them in the future.,
Be polite if you'd rather not babysit for the family again.",How to Decline a Babysitting Job," Parents understand that you have a life outside of babysitting, and they won't be upset if you have another activity at the same time. If you truly have plans, whether it's hanging out with a friend, going to soccer practice, or studying for an important test the next day, be honest and tell them as soon as possible. You can tell them what your plans are if that makes you feel better about denying the job, but you don't have to go in detail about what you're doing. For example, you could say something like:

""Sorry, I already have plans that day""
""Sorry, I have plans with a friend that night""
""Sorry, I have a basketball game at that time""
""Sorry, I'm babysitting for another family that night"";
, Sometimes you may not actually have plans, but just don't feel like babysitting that day, in which case you may have to make up an excuse as to why you can't babysit. If you choose to do this, keep your excuses simple so you don't get caught up in an elaborate lie later on. For example, if you say ""Sorry, I'm going out to see a movie with my friends that night"", parents might ask you about how the movie was the next time you're at their house just to make polite conversation. It's better to keep things simple and vague by just saying ""Sorry, I have plans that day"". This way, parents won't ever ask you about your 'plans' as they don't want to seem nosy.

, Sometimes if you deny babysitting jobs from the same family a few times (even if you're legitimately busy), the family might think that you don't want to continue to babysit for them and stop asking you. If you enjoy babysitting for the family and would accept their jobs in the future if you weren't busy, acknowledge this by saying things like:

""Hopefully it'll work out next time"".
""Hopefully I'll be available next time"".

, Sometimes the kids you babysit are just too much of a handful, or you didn't enjoy yourself and would rather not come back to babysit for that family. It's completely fine to decline their offer as long as you're polite about it. You don't have to be completely honest and tell them you didn't like their kids - you can use some more polite excuses to convey that you'd rather not come back.

For example, if you've only babysat the kids once, you could say things like:

""I'm sorry, I just don't think the kids and I are a good match.""
""Actually, I'm not so sure I want to babysit kids who are {insert the kid's age here}. I'm just more comfortable with kids who are {older/younger} than they are.""
""I don't think this is going to work because of {insert reason here}"". Your reasoning could be things like travel time, or the hours they want you to babysit for (ie. if they stay out quite late at night).


If you've babysat for a family many times but don't want to keep babysitting for them again, the above excuses may be a bit harder to use depending on your situation. If those don't fit, you could say something like: ""I'm pretty busy at the moment. I don't think I'll be able to babysit for a while"", or ""Unfortunately I don't have the time to babysit anymore"", or ""I need to focus on school, so I won't be able to babysit anymore.""

, In case something should happen to you, you want to have your own emergency contacts on hand in an easy-to-find place. Put your cell phone and the names and phone numbers of your emergency contacts in a quick, easy-to-locate spot like an outer compartment of your bag.You may want to remove these items from your bag and put them on a main table once you arrive at the house where you’re babysitting. Make it part of your ritual to do this as well as return them to your bag before you leave.

, This can come in handy in multiple scenarios. If a power outage occurs, you’ll still have a light source on hand. Also you may need to take a pet out to relieve itself after dark.

If it’s the first time you’re babysitting at that house, have the parents take you on a tour of the property. Find out where the children are allowed and not allowed to be.


For instance, is there a fire escape, or an exterior door that doesn’t open which you should know about? Also find out where the fire extinguishers are located.Try asking, “How should I lock the windows and doors while you’re gone? Is there a security system I should know about?”
Note where any potentially hazardous areas are, such as ponds or outside machinery.

You may need this information if any of the kids get lost., Get the contact information for at least two neighbors or relatives in case there is an emergency and you can’t get ahold of the parents. Write down the phone numbers for emergency services and poison control.Ask if you should contact 911 and/or a family doctor or pediatrician if there is an emergency., If there are pets in the household, find out if you are supposed to feed them. If so, note the feeding time, as well as the type and amount of food you should give them. If the pets are dogs, ask if they will need to be let outside and how you should go about doing that.


For instance, is the yard fenced in? Does the dog need to be on a collar and leash, and if so where are those kept?
Make sure to write down who the parents would like you to call if there is an emergency involving a family pet. For instance, should you call the pet’s veterinarian or a specific emergency vet?

, Find out if the kids have any known food or drug allergies. If so, write them down. Get permission to use over-the-counter ointment or lotion in case of minor cuts or scrapes. If the child has been sick or has a chronic condition such as asthma or diabetes, get the schedule of any medication and dosages they need to take.


For medications, ask what time it was last given, what time the next dose should be given, and the amount you should give the child., Ask the parents before they leave what rules you should know about. Ask a couple of questions to get them thinking about what the kids might ask you for that they aren’t allowed to have.Try asking, “For example, are the kids not allowed to play certain electronic devices? Are there TV shows that are off-limits that they might be asking me about?”

, If your charges are younger than grade school age, they may have specific naptimes. If you’ll be staying into the night, write down those bedtimes also. Ask if there are any routines you should know about before bedtime, such as teeth brushing and putting on a nightlight.Try asking, “Do the kids normally read or chat in their rooms after bedtime, or should it be all quiet and lights out?”

, Ask what the kids should be given for food and drink. Find out if snacks and meals should occur at exact times, and if the children should be eating outside of those times if they say they’re hungry. Note any special instructions, such as if their vegetables should be finished before getting any dessert., Do the parents have any advice on what you should do if a child is crying or colicky? How would they like you to handle any misbehavior? Are there any other special instructions you should know?, You can get simple items at a dollar store, such as crayons, stickers, coloring books and colored paper. If you pack scissors for any crafts, make sure that they are kid-friendly pairs. You may want to get a couple of different crayon sizes.


For example, toddlers like play dough, playing with water, and drawing with large crayons.Preschoolers enjoy coloring, puzzles, and blowing bubbles.Grade school age children enjoy games, crafts, and many of the things younger kids like as well.

, This can be used as rewards for good behavior. Depending on the age of the kids you’re babysitting, you can include play money as ""reward bucks."" The kids can spend it to play with an item from the box.


Infants won’t understand the concept of rewarding good behavior, but you can still include items for them to play with. They like bright-colored toys they can hold and make noise with, and soft items to feel such as plush toys. They also like to be read to from books with colorful images., Many kids like movies, so it’s good to include a couple of kid-friendly flicks in your bag. Just make sure to get permission from the parents first before putting on the TV or popping a movie in., Hand puppets can be great entertainment for kids of all ages. Furthermore, since you will have a flashlight in your bag, you can put on a show with real and shadow puppets., Kids’ card games are ideal because they don’t take up much room in your bag, and they can be fun for many ages. You can also pack puzzles with large pieces. Make and bring a list of game ideas that can be played with little or no props, such as picture charades.

Maintain good hygiene.",How to Dress for a Babysitting Job," Dress in something that you can move around in and you don't mind getting messy, such as a T-shirt and jeans. Kids are always finding new adventures, and it's likely you'll be cleaning up after many messes., Bring sunglasses and sun lotion for summer babysitting jobs in case you go outside. Carry a coat, hats and gloves with you in the colder seasons.

, Choose a pair of shoes that are easy to slip on and off, and make sure the shoes are lightweight to avoid potential damage if a toddler decides to throw one of them. It's also a good idea to bring tennis shoes if you plan on going outside.

, Wearing a modest T-shirt or blouse with casual jeans will allow you to move comfortably all while looking professionally casual. Darker colored clothing often looks professional and tends to hide stains well., Kids often enjoy messy activities such as arts and crafts, and they also tend to spill easily. It's likely that you might get paint, glue or dirt on your clothes, so having back-up clothing on hand to change into would be ideal., Leaving your dangling earrings, necklaces, and bracelets at home is safer for the kids, ensuring there is nothing for the child or baby to pull off and potentially choke on. Besides, you don't want your favorite beaded necklace broken or children pulling on your bracelet., Take out any piercings before your babysitting job or hide them as best you can along with your tattoos. Kids may find you unapproachable if you have too many visible tattoos whereas babies love to grab things and might decide to yank on your piercing., If you feel the need to wear makeup, keep it simple so you look like you're going to work and not out to a party. Don't overdo it by wearing tons of eye liner, lipstick or blush.

, Choose a professional-looking hairstyle that won't get in your way while you work. With longer hairstyles, wearing your hair up in a ponytail looks professional and ensures you will be able to move around with minimal distraction from your hair.


If you have dyed hair in bright colors such as red, blue, green, etc., put it up in a ponytail for the first couple babysitting jobs so parents and kids can get used to it slowly.
Try pinning your hair back in a barrette if your hair is too short to tie up.

, This means nothing revealing such as booty shorts, belly shirts, low-cut shirts, skirts or low-rise pants. Avoid looking unprofessional and pass on the yoga pants and leggings., Don't wear T-shirts with racial or sexual comments on them, or tasteless words or pictures such as clothing that advertises alcohol. You wouldn't want the children you babysit repeating any inappropriate words or phrases., Even though your favorite pair of jeans might have holes in the knees, it's important to remember that you're dressing for a job. Skip the ripped jeans and choose an outfit that doesn't look sloppy.

, Make sure that your clothes are clean, you have showered, have clean hands, trimmed fingernails and well-groomed hair. Be clean, but don't wear heavy fragrances that kids might be sensitive to."

Don't nag your parents over and over again.,
If they say yes, make sure you show that you appreciate their co-operation and generosity.,
If they say no, offer to ""mothersit"".,
Start babysitting!",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Babysit," Your parents wouldn't let you cook without knowing how to, would they? No, they wouldn't, so why should they let you babysit if you don't know what you're doing? Look up different articles about babysitting and what to do and what not to do, this way, if your parent asks you a question such as what would do if the child wouldn't stop crying, you have an answer.;
, If they say ""We told you, we don't want you to babysit,"" say it will be good to know what to do for the future.

, Make a pros and cons chart of babysitting (make sure you have more pros than cons!) and show it to your parents. If after or during the talk they say no, don't get mad and start yelling. This just increases their opinion that you aren't mature enough to babysit.

, Clean your room, do the laundry, feed your pets, etc. This will show you how responsible you are, and that you are old enough to start having a job of your own. Maturity is the key.

, The more you pester them, the less likely they are to ever give you what you want. Bring it up a few weeks later. Give them a talk on why you think you are ready for the job, what safety precautions you will take (for instance, getting them to meet your clients first) etc. If you are nervous about talking about it to their faces, make a power point presentation to do the speaking for you.

, A 'thank you' goes a long way, but you could always buy them a small gift to show how pleased you are that they've let you take on this new responsibility.If you are only babysitting for your siblings you can tell your mom that you don't need to get paid. This will show how considerate you are for not getting paid. It can only be one time if your mom and dad agrees but I think it's the nice thing to do.

, If they're still saying no, you can ""mothersit,"" or babysit while the mother is still there. This is for moms who are busy and don't have enough time for their baby. Find a mom interested in your service, and have your parent come with you to supervise. This way they'll see what it will be like for you: use all your skills and try not to ask for help - just pretend your parents aren't there.

, Be sure to do a good job, so you can prove to your parents that you deserve this responsibility, and don't forget to have fun!

Follow up with homeowners who express an interest in your services, and that you are interested in sitting for.",How to Become a House Sitter," You do not necessarily need experience house sitting, but you will need to provide homeowners with a short list of 3 to 4 people who will vouch for your character, trustworthiness and responsibility. It helps also if you have any experience with pet sitting or housekeeping.;
, Calculate what you think an average month's rent might be at the type of house you are interested in sitting for, and prepare to use that amount as a deposit. Not all homeowners request security deposits, but many do and, even if they don't, offering a deposit is a great way to attract homeowners and multiply your options. It further establishes your trustworthiness as a house sitter.

, You will use this to find sitting jobs.


Begin with a strong headline. It should be unique, attention-grabbing (though not overboard) and should highlight what you feel are your strongest assets. For example, a good headline would read something like, ""Compulsively clean pet lover seeking an opportunity to make some new animal friends and experience life on the beautiful Santa Barbara coastline.""
Explain why you want to be a house sitter, as well as what qualities you have that make you think you would be a good fit for the job.
Give details about past experiences you've had that you feel qualify you to house sit for a stranger. Even if you've never been a house sitter, chances are you've been in situations that required the skills of a sitter.

Muffins. Ask the children if they want chocolate chip, orange, cranberry, or blueberry and make some muffins. They'll be sure to love them.
Waffles. Make some waffles with fruit. If you know how, make waffles in a certain shape (e.g. their initial, a basic shape). You could also make pancakes.

Determine the minimum wage in your area.,
Assess the prevailing rate for babysitting services in your area.,
Adjust your rate based on the number of children cared for.,
Adjust your rate based on the ages of the children cared for.,
Factor in any additional costs for each babysitting job.,
Keep your experience and reputation in mind when setting a price.,
Clarify your hourly rate with the client before performing the work.",How to Charge for Babysitting," It isn't required by law that a babysitter be paid above the minimum wage, but knowing the minimum wage might give you a good idea of where to start. A babysitting arrangement may feel casual and informal, you still deserve to be paid what you're worth. Remember of course that babysitting is a job, and you don't want to undervalue yourself anyway.;
, If you know others who babysit in your area, ask them how much they charge. By doing this, you can determine the ""going rate"" for babysitting in your area, which will help you price your own services. Whether you set your rates a bit higher or lower than the prevailing rate will depend on various factors such as experience.

, After deciding on a basic hourly rate for babysitting based on the prevailing rate, you can adjust it down or up based on other factors. Consider charging an additional amount per hour based on headcount. Caring for 4 children will generally be more taxing than caring for 1, and your rate should reflect this.

, Another variable that can affect your price is age. You may decide that teenagers require less effort to care for than infants or toddlers, for example. Charging a slightly higher rate for watching infants and toddlers would then be a good strategy for adjusting your babysitting rate.

, A common cost incurred when babysitting is the cost of the fuel to drive to each client's home. In general, this cost should already be accounted for in your basic hourly rate. However, if a client requires you to drive a long way you can raise your rate accordingly. You can also consider raising your rate to accommodate rising fuel prices.

, If you have little babysitting experience and cannot secure good references, you will not be able to charge as much. As you gain experience, ask regular clients if you can use them as a reference. This will improve your perceived reliability and allow you to charge a higher hourly rate.

, After determining your pricing structure, do not be shy about working your price out with the client beforehand. You want to avoid surprising clients with your price at the end of the job, and you also want to be able to decline clients who simply refuse to pay you a fair amount.

, Wear decent clothes, and make sure your hair is combed through. A fancy outfit is not necessary, just something that looks nice. Looking nice will usually give the parents a better impression of you as a person.

, Even if you are babysitting for kids who are known to misbehave constantly, walk into the job showing confidence, that you are ready to take on the challenge.

, If you show up early, even if it is just by that little amount of time, the parents will likely see that you care about the job and the kid(s) that you are going to babysit. Avoid showing up too early, as the parents will likely be nowhere near prepared if you show up an hour early., This will definitely show the parents that you not only care about the kids safety, but you care about the safety of everyone in general.

It may also be a good idea to double check if you know about any medical conditions the kids may have. Double check if and when they have to take medication, how much should be given, and what to do should a complication arise.

, Sometimes, the parents may leave food for you to prepare dinner, lunch, or even breakfast. If they do, be sure that you cook what they asked you to cook, and only that. Even if the kids want something different, avoid giving into them, and cook what you were asked to cook."

If you're around this age (15 or younger) it's best to babysit an older kid about 10 years old and upward, children that can do most things for themselves. And it's best around this age to make sure the child can entertain themselves, as they may not be keen to interact with you.
If you're 16 or older, you should be able to babysit younger children. You must be comfortable handling small children. You should have more responsibility at this age.
No matter what the age of the child, don't leave any child alone. You are there to take care of them, no matter what.;
, When you're ready to go in the babysitting business, don't be afraid to ask questions about the child you will be caring for; always be prepared.

, Bring an emergency checklist just in case the parents don't have one. Show the parents these things, as it helps to reassure them.

, Explain that you will be strict about bedtime and not viewing unacceptable websites, etc.

, Include things that are within the child's interests. Consider bringing a small prize for each child at the end if they're good, such as a sticker sheet or small toy). A sample list could be: crayons and coloring pages, Play Doh, a movie, board games, a cookie recipe, etc.

, Just act in much the same way that you would if they were your own sisters and brothers and do your best to calm them down. Give a timeout if they're really misbehaving, or call the parents for advice.

, Close the doors to rooms you don't want the children in. Look for hazards such as matches, hanging electrical cords, medications or other things children can get hurt with or get into trouble with.


Check with the parents or guardians for any last minute phone numbers and contact details.

, Every child acts a certain way when parents aren't around.

, Instead of laying back on the couch watching some TV, play with the kids. It's more fun if the babysitter actually plays ""House"" or ""Dolls"" or whatever the game may be. If you have a smart phone, download a couple of educational apps and interact that way. The parents will appreciate it later!

, Be positive, patient, and never yell. If the kids are acting up, warn them that they won't get a special prize at the end of the day. If you're happy, the kids most likely will be, too!

, Take the kids out to play. They can play tag and games like that. Try to play with them, too. The kids can play games like basketball and soccer with you.


Make sure the kids wear sunblock approved by the parents.
If you have permission from the parents, maybe take the kids out for a walk with the dog(s) or take them out to ride their bike(s) at the park.

, Check the cabinets and cook a snack or meal, as required. Make easy food, such as chicken nuggets or mac and cheese. Make sure to include veggies with the meal. Green beans or corn, for example.


Give the kids a small snack if babysitting throughout the day, such as fruit or fruit chews.
For dinner, give the kids something the parents have planned or asked you to prepare. For dessert, give them something like ice cream.

, Maybe watch TV, such as Nick Jr., Disney Jr., or PBS. You could also put on a favorite movie. Or, have arts and crafts time.

, The best babysitters enjoy being around younger children.

, If you know what to do in case of a fire, as well as basic first aid and lifesaving techniques, you and our clients will feel more confident about how you'd cope in an emergency situation.

, If you're sure of yourself, your charges will be sure too.

, Can you keep a cool head in an emergency?

, Expert babysitters know the basics for feeding, dressing, diapering, bathing, and being playful with children of different ages. Template:Larger image

, This means you don't snoop around, spend hours on the phone, or eat out of the house or home.

, Babysitting is a job. As with any business arrangement, you should set the financial details up front. Find out what the going rate for babysitters in your neighborhood. Your rate should be in the same range--more for looking after more kids or if you have lots of experience, less if you are new at the job. Discuss the rate with the client--before you accept the job.

, Your babysitting checklist should have:

,,,,
*9-1-1 may take care of all three (see related articles).

,
Address and phone number of where the parents are going.
When the parents expect to get to their destination and when they expect to leave.
What time they think they'll return home.
Whether they are expecting any phone calls or visitors.
How/if they would like you to answer the door and phone if anyone calls.

, Any food allergies or restrictions?
Medication: Never give any medication unless the parents have given you instructions. If a child has an epi-pen (for severe allergic reactions) the parent should train you in how to use it.
Bedtime: When? Is there a special bedtime routine?
Bath time: Never, ever leave a child alone in a bathtub!

,
Emergency supplies: flashlights, first aid, and cleaning products.
Appliances: Make sure you know how to work the can opener, stove, oven microwave, high chair, heat or air conditioning.

Learn CPR and the Heimlich maneuver and put it on your resume.",How to Convince a Customer You Are a Good Babysitter," Of course, it doesn't have to be anything near special. Get a program on your computer (Microsoft Word works great) where you can type text. Choose a serious font like Times New Roman or Arial. Then, write ""Your Name's Resume"" and begin typing all of your strong points. Did you take a babysitting class when you were twelve? Write it down. Do you have three younger sisters who you have to babysit all of the time? Write it down. This will help for any of those real hard ones who want to make sure their child is in the right hands.;
, Some adults like to have people they call ""adult-helpers."" This is different from babysitting. When babysitting, you have to be responsible for the kid and manage all other household responsibilities. When being an ""adult-helper"" you have to watch the kid--but while the adult is home, like gardening or working on an important document. This a wonderful way to practice sitting--and, if something was to happen, the parent would be right there!

, If you don't love kids, it will show. Kids need care, snacks, love, happiness...and if you are a sitter (and lets face it, some of us are) who comes, plasters a fake smile on for the kids and parents, then when the parents leave plops themselves on the sofa for a nice TV marathon of The Cosby Show, you will not be asked to sit again. Kids have opinions, and the fact is: If they don't like you, the parents don't like you, therefore you will never get asked to sit again.

, If the parents bring up the money topic before you are asked to sit, start with keeping your mouth shut. See what they have to say. Do not complain or argue. Usually, the parents are very legitimate when discussing money. If the parents are cheap, consider this: They are just one family. You don't have to expect to get all of your money from them. They will trust you and be thankful you're so agreeable in the whole situation.

, These are life-saving procedures and can be very handy. Put them on your resume, and when those hard parents peer through their spectacles at your resume, they will be glad to know their child will be in safe hands.

Decide exactly what you expect out of a sitter.,
Compile a list of prospective sitters.,
Contact potential house sitters.,
Ask each candidate (even those from house sitting services) for a detailed resume and/or qualifications list.,
Ask for references.,
Check references.,
Paying your house sitter.,
Conduct interviews with the remaining candidates.,
Prep your house sitter (leave contact info, location, etc).,
Check up.,
Follow up.",How to Choose a House Sitter," You should have specific job duties in mind before attempting to find a sitter, as it is important that you match your needs with the sitter's capabilities. For example, if you have 2 large dogs that need to be walked twice a day and a full garden that must be tended, you will need to specify those tasks when scouting for house sitters.;
, Use a reliable website to find potential matches. Contacting neighbours and friends for references works as well. Find candidates for the house sitting job through a variety of resources. Be sure to include specifics about the job in all of your solicitations.

, Whether it’s through a messaging portal on a website or texting/calling, take the first steps to contacting your house sitter. Ask them preliminary questions such as their location and availability., Select candidates who have the qualifications you desire.

, Home owners have to entrust a lot to a house sitter! Good references can definitely sway someone to hire one house sitter over another., Get a list of references from each potential house sitter you have selected, then call each referee to verify the candidate's information. Call your house sitter’s references! The main purpose of having a house sitter is preventing burglaries so it’s important that your house sitter is trustworthy. It is very important that your house sitter doesn’t commit theft themselves - having multiple references ensures that your house sitter is reliable. Take candidates whose references do not check out off your list.

, Figuring out a wage for your house sitter can be tricky. In some cases, house sitters won’t receive pay at all in exchange for free rent, utilities and food. house sitters should definitely be paid if they are providing housekeeping and pet care services., If all the above steps have gone well, meet your house sitter to interview them! This is the most important step - you never want to see your house sitter for the first time right before you leave and decide then that they are not the right fit for you.

Try posing questions like “What would you do if…” to get a sense of their competency in problem solving.






Explain every aspect of the house sitting job in detail to each interviewee. Verify that those duties are acceptable and manageable to interviewees.
Allow potential house sitters to interact with your pets (if applicable), to see if you feel it is a good match.
Gauge the interviewee's reactions to your tasks list and questions, and choose the sitter you feel most comfortable with, and who most suits the job.

, On the day of your departure, make sure that your house sitter is well-prepared. Be sure to leave the following items:

Emergency contact information
Pet care instructions and location of food (if necessary)
Where cleaning supplies are stored (if housekeeping is expected)

, If your trip is extended, consider texting or calling your house sitter to ensure that everything is fine in your house., Upon your return, make sure that all your valuables are in place and everything is well kept. If your house sitter went above and beyond in their duties (e.g. cleaning when it is not needed) you might want to compensate them for these extra services or offer to write a good reference."
"
Discuss the price and details of the job before showing up.,
Show up 10-15 minutes early to talk with the parents.,
Dress and act professionally.,
Get CPR/First Aid certified.,
Follow the parent's rules, not the child's.,
Leave the house in the same condition as when you arrived.,
Ask the parents to recommend you to friends.",How to Be the Best Babysitter1," This shows a parent that you are engaged, intelligent, and responsible. While you don't want to grill the parents over the phone, you do want to know a little bit about the kids you'll be watching before you say yes. The basics you need to cover include:


How old are the kids?
How many kids are you watching?
How long will you be babysitting?
How much will you be paid an hour?;
, Ask 2-3 thoughtful, detailed questions about the kids before taking the job. Not only does this show parts that you are punctual, it lets you see how the kids behave with their parents and get a feel for any behavior you'll have to control. Get some information from the parents about the child, including:


What are their favorite things to do?
Do they have any dietary restrictions or preferences?
What time is bedtime?
What things are off-limits (games, places in the house, etc.).
Who do I contact in case of emergencies?

, While you don't want to be dressed up, you should have a clean shirt and pants and show up on time. Remember that, for some parents, leaving their children with a stranger is a stressful event. Make it easier on the parents by exuding professionalism and confidence.


Avoid talking about babysitting ""horror stories"" or saying that you ""prefer a different age."" Don't give the parents any reason to doubt your ability.
Nice pants, like jeans and a clean shirt, should suffice., Knowing that you will be able to handle an emergency will put you and the parents at ease when you're alone with the child. These classes are usually $100 and certification lasts for 2 years.Bring a copy of this certification with you. Most parents won't ask for it, but it is good to have in your backpack or purse if they do.

, If the parents want the kid in bed by a certain time or don't want them watching TV, follow their rules. Some children will try to convince you that ""they break that rule all the time,"" that their parents ""don't really care,"" or that you heard the rule wrong. Stay firm and consistent -- the parents are paying you, not the child.


Put the child to bed at the right hour. Even if they ""won't fall asleep"" they should be in bed when you promised.Kids tell their parents everything. If you slipped them a piece of candy they weren't supposed to have, chances are it will get back to them.

, If a child spills their dinner on the kitchen floor it is your responsibility to clean it up, While you are not a maid and should not clean the house unnecessarily, you need to make sure everything is tidy before leaving. Some tasks all babysitters must do include:


Cleaning up dishes.
Tidying up toys.
Folding blankets or clothes and putting them in the laundry basket.
Cleaning up any messes or spills made on your watch., Having positive word of mouth around the neighborhood is often the best way to get new jobs and boost your reputation. If the parents seem happy with your job or invite you back again, give them a card with your contact info and politely ask them to share it with friends.


For example: ""Thank you so much for the opportunity! If you know anyone else that needs a sitter, please give them my information.""

"
"
Know that the first hour is often the hardest with young children.,
Get to know the child personally.,
Let the child lead activities.,
Have several ""emergency"" games up your sleeves.,
Go outside, get moving, and be active.,
Let yourself be silly and playful.,
Give the child your undivided attention.,
Keep kids well fed with nutritious food.,
Remember that downtime breeds problems.",How to Be the Best Babysitter2," Kids age 6 and under will sometimes react negatively when their parents leave. Understand that they are worried, scared, and feel like they are all alone, and use this knowledge to guide your actions. Don't worry if the kid is quiet, cries a lot, or has a temper in the first hour -- they will usually calm down when they get comfortable with you.


Reassure the child that their parents will be back and that you are there to have fun together.
Have an activity ready right when you arrive to distract the child from their woes, like cards or a board game., Know what games they play, what movies/TV shows they love, their favorite class at school, etc. Knowing small facts about them, like their age or their dog's name, makes the kid feel important. If they collect action figures, ask if you can see the collection. If they love to make art, ask if they will draw a portrait of you. Taking the time to get to know a child will make the night go smoothly for both of you.


Don't talk down to children with baby voices or pats on the head. Make them feel like a friend and you'll be surprised how much respect you earn.
Like adults, all kids are different -- you can't expect them all to love the same games or activities, so you need to adapt to be the best babysitter.

, The kids you watch are on their ""home-court."" They know all of the fun games, have their own routines, and will naturally gravitate towards things they like to do. Unless they are extremely shy, most kids will want to start playing immediately. As long as you think the activity is safe, go with the flow.

, Whether the kid just gets bored or is too shy to take the lead, there are plenty of times when you are expected to bring the entertainment. The best babysitters are ready with a game or activity at a moment’s notice:



Paper Mache is a great craft that only requires newspaper and glue.
Simple card games like Go Fish, Old Maid, and War will pass the time quickly.
Bring over simple paints, popsicle sticks, glitter, paper, etc. for homemade crafts.
Bring over games or toys from your own childhood, as most kids love getting to play with new things.

, Think of activities that burn a lot of energy, as this will tire kids out and keep them from running wild at bedtime. While some kids can spend hours playing imaginary ""Cops & Robbers,"" other kids will need some convincing to get outside. Try playing tag, going for a bike ride, or taking the child to a playground to get their blood pumping.


If you are indoors, start a dance party. Try ""Indoor Olympics,"" complete with push-up contests, running-in-place marathons, and homemade medals., Kids love it when adults are willing to get goofy and have some fun. While you always need to be responsible, babysitting should be fun. Don't be so serious that you can't have a water balloon battle in the backyard, do crazy impressions or skits, or play a game of hide-and-seek.


Being silly is often the best way to coax a shy child out of their shell.
When you're having fun, the chances are good that the kids are having fun too., Put your phone away and interact with the child. The best babysitters are like older siblings to a child -- they are responsible, but they are also willing to play. If the child senses that you don't want to be with them they will act out to get attention or sit around acting bored. Both scenarios will get you in trouble when the parents come home and keep you from being the best babysitter.


If something happens to the child and you are distracted or not paying attention you may be legally responsible for damages., Hungry kids will get cranky, and hopping a kid up on sugar can cause problems for everyone. If the parents don't provide you with specific food for the meals then try to create decent, well-balanced meals. Talk to the kids about what they like and provide snacks, like carrots and peanut butter or pretzels, every 1-2 hours to keep kids well fed.


Ask about dietary restrictions or food preferences before the parents leave.
Learn a few simple recipes, like pancakes, chicken, and cheese pizza, that you can whip out instantly in times of need.
While you want the child to be happy, this does not mean you should bow to their every whim and give them candy for meals. Try making deals, like, ""you get a piece of candy/dessert it you eat all of the vegetables,"" if they are difficult.

, Most issues with children occur when they have nothing to do. As a result, they decide to act out or make a scene to get attention, or start to think about missing their parents and get sad. Try to limit downtime whenever possible, keeping the kid moving from one activity to the next. If you are in doubt, put on a movie to occupy the child for another 1-2 hours.

"
"
Remember that a child's safety is your number one priority.,
Set your boundaries early and remain consistent.,
Don't get emotional or angry when they misbehave.,
Reward good behavior instead of punishing bad behavior whenever possible.,
Ask the parents what they do to discipline their children.,
Focus on building respect, not authority.,
Be honest, but polite, with the parents when they return.",How to Be the Best Babysitter3," You are being paid by the parents to keep their child safe, and you need to remember this no matter how bad a kid's behavior gets. You may have to be strict, make unpopular decisions, and forget about being fun for a while. It is worth it, however, to keep the child safe.


When in doubt about an activity's safety opt to do something else.
You can't always be the ""cool"" babysitter. Safety comes first., If you are going outside, tell the kids how far they can go and stick to your measurements. The second you see a child break your rules, make a comment and fix the behavior. The more you let little things slip the more kids believe your rules don't mean anything, which will make it much harder enforce bigger rules.


It is always easier to lighten up than become more strict., This may cause a child to get defensive or angry in response. Instead, bend down to eye level and talk to them with a clear, firm tone. Let them know why their behavior was wrong and that you are disappointed in their actions.You don't have to be angry to enforce rules. The first one to two times something unexpected happens, politely remind the child ""we made a deal about that, remember?""
If you are willing to quickly explain the reasoning to your rule you often get more respect -- ""if you go that far way, I can't see you to help if you get hurt.""

, Study after study has shown that positive reinforcement (rewarding good behavior) has a greater effect than negative reinforcement (punishing bad behavior). If they eat all of their vegetables, for example, you might give them a little extra dessert. If you see them sharing with a sibling, praise them for their generosity. This makes a child feel good, and they are more likely to repeat their good behavior in the future.Beware of over-rewarding kids. A simple ""thank you so much!"" or ""that was very big of you"" should suffice more often than not. The best babysitters don't resort to bribery for good behavior.

, Most often this is some variation or ""time-out"" or ""no-dessert,"" but some parents are very against some forms of punishment. Make sure you find out how the parents deal with bad behavior, as the child will likely be more receptive to you if they are familiar with the consequences of their actions.


Be polite with your request: ""I don't expect any problems from Mikey, but if something does happen is there a way you would like me to handle it?"" This allows the parent the option to say either, ""do whatever you think is appropriate"" or give you specifics.

, If you can get a child to respect you then they will become a breeze to deal with. That said, earning respect is easier said than done. Let a misbehaving child know that you are there to listen to them and help them with problems, but that they need to respect you back in order for you to help. Respect is built a variety of ways, but important things to remember include:


Think about the child's interests, not your own.
Keep your promises, good and bad. If you threaten a punishment and someone breaks a rule, you have to go through with it.
Listen to a child as they misbehave -- they will often give you clues about their issues that can help you calm them down., If the child was a dream, let them know. Don't be afraid to tell the parents if the kids were a handful, though. While you don't want to be mean towards their child, you should note any troubling behavior and tell the parents how you handled it.


If the kid is constantly causing problems, you may need to write a list of issues to show the parents. Do not let a kid bully you because you won't talk to their parents."

Find a good family!,
Make sure you're working with children the right age!,
Learn to cook.,
Know how to appropriately discipline.,
Interact with the children!,
Discuss daily with the parents.,
Remember -- they're your kids now, too!",How to Be a Good Nanny," This is the most important step, and often the most difficult. Even though it seems easy enough, finding a family to nanny can be a quite a trial. You have to remember to pick a family whose values are not in conflict to your own (are they very religious, while you're less so? do they smoke/drink too much or often for your liking?) and one who will treat you like a partner, not a subordinate.;
, Not everyone will be able to work with infants, or toddlers, or teenagers. There are distinct differences between child age groups, each with different needs, and you may find that you simply work better with one or two, but can't quite grasp the entire scope.

, Working with children often involves preparing simple meals and snacks, so a basic knowledge of cooking is required to be a competent nanny. It's also a good idea to cook with your children, if they're the right age, as it can be a fun project for you and for them!

, Children will often make a bad decision or two and, as a nanny, it is your job to enact the appropriate disciplinary measures. Remember that no child is bad -- they just don't know how to do the right thing, and need your help to learn how. Start with warnings. Warn them once, letting them know what will happen if they don't follow directions. Warn them again, more forcefully, and tell them that the next time they disobey they will get their punishment. Finally, enact the punishment -- for the younger children, time-outs are a good option, as well as removing an item if it is causing the problem. Make sure the time-outs/loss of an item are for just as long as the severity of the disobedience. For the older children, losing privileges or ""time-outs"" in their room are good options as well.

, Play with them. Do activities relevant to their interests. Find something fun and creative that also helps them learn. Go out for walks, to the park, or to a museum. Get them active, then go home and read a book. Help them with things that are difficult. Make sure, with any child any age, to talk to them in their language.

, Your employers will want to know what the children have been up to, so be sure to tell them all their child's/children's accomplishments, all the fun you had, and any rough spots. Give them some insight into how their kids are during the day, outside of the parental scope.

, Love them. Be proud of them. Give them a reason to look forward to your visits. Make sure they know that, even if you put them in time-out or take away their T.V. privilege, you still care about them and want the best for them. Help them learn things, coach them through the difficult parts, and celebrate their successes. Be silly with them and talk to them like they're people, because they understand much more than many people think.

Set them up with some colouring.,
Get out the LEGO or dolls or toy cars - whatever takes their fancy.,
Ask them about films and books.,
Bake with them.,
Play dress-up.,
Help them with their homework.,
If allowed, let them watch their favourite programmes on TV.,
Don't forget to feed them.,
Offer them drinks regularly.,
Ensure that medication is given if necessary.,
Don't let them forget their hygiene.,
Discipline them if they are naughty.,
Ensure they get their rest.",How to Babysit when You Hate Kids," Put on that encouraging voice - ""Why don't you draw something for me?"" and give them paper and pencils. They should be able to do this without too much assistance needed on your part, so you can while away a bit of time on your phone or reading until they tire of this. 

Pick the supplies carefully. It is probably best to avoid giving them glitter or paint, unless you want a massive tidy-up on your hands.;
, You do not need to join in with them if you think that this will be too tedious. ""I bet you can't build a tower as big as me with LEGO,"" you could say with a smile. If there is more than one kid, you could challenge them to a race or competition, something that will allow them to compete with each other and leave you be., If they are interested, you could put on a film, assuming the parents of the children allow this. Alternatively, you could settle them down for quiet reading before bed, or if you can cope, offer to read them a short story. You could even make one up, if you have the patience to do so., This step is for if you really want to go the extra mile. If you enjoy baking in your spare time, then this might be something you can tolerate doing with the kids, and they will love you because they get to eat it afterwards., Kids often love playing dress-up, and because their clothes are tiny, you already have an excuse out of joining in. Let them parade in princess or pirate costumes, take photos, do their makeup for them. This will likely buy you popularity points with them, but you don't have to do a thing!, You might hate school as much as they do, but their work will be easy compared to yours, so your mind won't be all that strained, but for them a large part of their evening is gone, which means that bedtime will come sooner. There's no downside., This should keep them quiet and happy, which is a first. And you might even get nostalgic over what they're watching. Make sure that everything they watch is age appropriate., No matter how much you hate children, you must give them something to eat. You should ensure that this is prepared safely and is something that they will enjoy so that they don't leave anything on their plates. Some good meal ideas are shown below. This is not necessary if they have already eaten. If they ask for a snack, give them something remotely healthy. Offer them a mini-cookie if they eat an apple, for example.

Sausages and beans. You could serve on a piece of toast, or even make a face with the ingredients if you want to impress them.
Fish fingers, chips, and peas. It is important to include a form of vegetable, and you must ensure they eat them all. Offer a extra five minutes before bed if they eat it all.
Salad. A viable healthy option, though it probably won't make you too popular in their books. Try a fruit salad for a relatively healthy but tastier approach.

, Kids are sometimes too little to reach the countertops and make themselves drinks, so you have to be on alert for signs of thirst. Don't give them soda, as this will not only make them more thirsty, but will also send them up the walls for the rest of the evening. You could ask them to help you make them a milkshake, or warm them up some milk and a banana before bedtime., Many young people take regular medicine each evening, and you should not neglect this if you are caring for them. Offer them a drink to swallow any tablets with, ask when they last took their tablet, ensure their inhalers are used., Ask their parents' preferences on baths or showers, ask that they wash their hands before eating, and oversee their brushing and flossing. Make sure that there are always spare changes of clothes to hand, and that their pyjamas are fresh., This can be done in many ways, but make sure you follow the parents' norms for how they handle misbehaviour. The options may include:

Sending them to bed early. This is the ultimate gem. You can't force them to sleep, but sending a kid to their room is the equivalent of putting an adult in jail. Well, not really, but their evening will be compromised, and this is a great way of putting them in their place.
Don't let them have any pudding. Pudding is a great way of bribing kids, and so can also be taken away to condition their behaviour.
Threaten to call their parents. This should shut them up - they may well keep pushing their luck, so only threaten this if you'd be willing to see it through. There's nothing worse as a young person than the thought of getting in trouble with their mum and dad, so use this to your advantage.
Confiscate screens. Oh, the horror - no iPad or phone for the naughty little girls and boys. Be warned that this will seriously lessen their opinion of you.
Put them on the naughty step for a while. While they are there, make special fuss of the other children if there is more than one.

, No responsible babysitter would have the children awake past the bedtime specified by their parents. Follow their bedtime routines as accurately as possible, even if this means having to read them a story or help them get into their PJs. And think: the sooner they are snoozing, the sooner you get peace at last!"

Have the older kids help you monitor the youngers ones.",How to Babysit Multiple Children," At a minimum, learn their ages and genders. A 12-year-old girl, 7-year-old boy, and 3-year-old girl, for example, will all have different interests, different dietary needs, different things they are allowed to do at home, and different bedtimes. Knowing these things will help you plan out activities appropriate for everyone.


You could ask the parents something like, “So you have 2 little boys that are 4 and 10. Do they have the same bedtime or is it okay for the older boy to stay up a little later?” Or “do they share similar interests? What do they like to do most of the time?”
During your first conversation with parents, don’t fret about how to ask questions to get the information you need. Parents will most likely be expecting you to ask these questions and may even offer the information without prompting.
If you feel awkward asking in the moment, simply review the information the parents gave you and then ask your questions afterward.;
, Children are much more likely to be comfortable and behave properly if they are already familiar with you. If you can, try to visit with them for an hour or two a day or so before babysitting. This will also help you get a feel for their individual personalities and how they respond to you and each other.If you can’t meet with them a few days beforehand, see if it’s possible for you to come over an hour or so before you are set to babysit. This way the kids can spend some time with you with the buffer of their parents to make them feel safer.

, Many parents will go over bedtimes, dietary habits, allergies, medicines, and dos and don’ts for their children when you arrive. For example, many children have a set bedtime and a routine beforehand, or certain idiosyncrasies like having to have a particular bowl for dinner. Knowing these things will not only help the child feel more comfortable but also help you feel more concrete in directing them if they try to question you or start complaining.Be sure to ask questions if you still feel unsure when discussing these things with a parent.
You can also make a list to go back over later in case you forget anything.
Remember, if you feel a parent is asking for more than you’re comfortable with, you can always turn down the job., Though you are likely to have your own ideas and way of managing behavioral problems, it’s always best to first ask a parent what to do if their child is acting up. Chances are they will tell you before you even get to this question. However, keep in mind that children act in different ways for different people, and any problems they have when their parents are around may be different than what they do with you. So make sure you are clear on rules and expectations for disciplining their children.


Asking about discipline can feel awkward, almost like you're assuming the children will do something wrong but don't worry! A simple ""just in case, is there any particular way you'd like me to handle behavioral issues? Anything, in particular, I should expect?"" avoids assumptions and gives the parents a chance to explain their approaches to discipline., You should get the emergency contact information from the parents. For example, if you can’t reach the parents on their cell phones, can you call the place they are going or someone else to help you? The parents should have a list of numbers for you before they leave.


Before you start babysitting it’s also good to know the first aid basics like how to do CPR or the heimlich maneuver - just make sure you are familiar with the procedures appropriate for the age group you’re watching.

, This is especially good for younger children who may need to work off excess energy. Whether going to a park or just to the backyard, there are plenty of outdoor activities that you can do together. Try visiting a playground, taking a walk, or even kicking a soccer ball around. Just make sure you check with the parents before taking the children to a park or anywhere else.


Be sure you pay very close attention to the kids when you are outside! It can be easy for them to wander off, especially in a park with lots of other children. Try to make sure you keep them in sight at all times and do a regular headcount.

, These can be done outside or inside and are another great way to burn off energy. Try something like Red Light/Green Light, Simon Says, Tag, or Hide and Seek to get everyone involved. Letting kids take the lead in Simon Says or Red Light/Green Light is also a great way to keep them interested., Let the kids plan it out with some direction. You can also have them direct you as you get materials together and start building. This is a great way to engage everyone and let the kids be creative. You won’t need to purchase any excess materials, all you need is pillows and blankets. Of course, you are free to use any other building material like cardboard boxes, towels, couches, and tables. Just make sure you know what you are allowed to use and that you clean everything up afterward.

, Like building a fort, creating an obstacle course is a great way to get everyone working together. Young kids also often like competition, so having them compete against each other or against you will help them engage and be interested in the activity. All you need for this is the same material you need for a fort - pillows, couches, and blankets. Just make sure you have the extra space and anything the kids can hurt themselves with is moved away.Try putting down some tape for a “balance beam,” or to mark off spots where they have to jump from one area to another. You can also have them crawl under tables or through boxes, throw crumpled paper into laundry baskets, or even try walking backward. Get creative! For even more space, try doing this outside.

, This can be easy or difficult depending on how old the kids are and how much time you want to put in. You can use anything in the household or bring your own material for the kids. Ideally, you want it to be easy enough for them to understand, yet challenging enough to keep them interested. For younger kids, you can use pictures instead of written clues, and for older kids, you can try simple riddles.


Write things like “find one gray and white sock,” or “bring me two red pens.”
For riddles, try something like “I’m tall when I’m young and short when I’m old,” for a candle/pencil.
Make sure to include some prizes at the end for motivation. These can be anything from stickers to candy.

, If you don’t want the kids running all over the place and potentially screaming, try a calmer activity like arts and crafts. Most kids love to draw and color, so bringing an assortment of pens, colored pencils, crayons, and stock paper can go a long way. You can also bring a couple of coloring books.


If you know the kids’ interests, you can bring coloring books of things they like. For example, a coloring book on Disney’s Frozen or one of cars.
You can also search online for coloring material. The Disney website, for example, has a number of crafts and coloring projects based on their movies. Most of these are free for printing, however, some websites will require you to pay or join to get the material.

, Most children love sing-alongs, and if you get up and dance they are likely to move right along with you. You can even let them help you decide on a playlist, that way you are sure to have the music they like.


If you have enough people, you can even turn the dance party into a game of musical chairs.

, These are great for varying age groups. If you have a mix of ages, the older kids can help the younger ones play or you can split into teams. This is also a great way to keep everyone at one table or area so you can watch them.


Easy board games like Hungry, Hungry Hippos, Sorry, Uno, or Connect Four are great for all ages. Games like Clue, Pictionary, Monopoly, or Battleship work well for older children.

, This works as both a group and individual activity. A few markers or crayons and some sheets of paper are all you need. You can also purchase coloring books cheaply from somewhere like Toys R’ Us or Target. This is a good way to keep one of the children still so you can monitor them while you do something else with the other child., There are a variety of puzzle books for kids of all ages. You can have simple mazes for children or something harder like Sudoku for older children. If neither of these works, there are also dot-to-dot books, trivia books, and even origami books. These are great for children to work on alone or with each other.

, Even if they can't read yet, some children are happy to sit looking at a picture book. For older kids, letting them read a book, magazine, or comic book is a good way to make sure they’re happy while you are doing something else. Also, depending on the variation in ages, you can have the older children read to the younger ones.

, Not only can children build whatever they want with these, but there are also specific instructions to make things like buildings, cars, or flying crafts. If you don't want to use LEGO, you can also try building with K’nex or Lincoln Logs.


If there aren’t any of these materials in the home, try looking somewhere like eBay or a secondhand store to get them cheaper.
If you can’t purchase these materials yourself and are regularly watching a child or children who you think would enjoy them, try discussing buying these with the parents. They may be willing to pay for them.

, If you’ve brought a toy or a snack for one of the children, you should have the same (or a more appropriate equivalent) for all of them. If you don’t, you may run into discipline problems.If a child insists that one of the other children got more or something better, have that child divide the items and then let the other child have first pick. This will usually appease both children and make sure it’s still fair all around.

, You don’t want conflicts to escalate. Having activities for each of the children to do will make it easier to keep them occupied in this case. If discipline is necessary, review the parents' instructions or use your best judgment.


Try placing the children at opposite ends of the room or in different rooms where you can monitor both. You can either give them a quiet activity like drawing to do alone or simply have them sit quietly for 5-10 minutes. You can even have them write an apology for what they did wrong.
You should always make sure to explain to a child calmly what they did wrong and why they are being punished.

, Since children's’ needs can vary widely from age to age, you may often find yourself being pulled in different directions at once. Keep your cool. The older children may get frustrated with the younger children due to their differences in cognitive ability, and you have to set the example for the right way to treat them.Always calmly answer any questions that arise to the best of your ability - younger kids ask a lot.
You also shouldn’t rush through activities if the younger kids are taking a while. If the older children become frustrated, either have them move onto something else or ask them to help you with the younger kids instead.

, If each of the children is doing a different activity, try to move yourself somewhere where you can watch them both. If this isn't possible, try to at least move them into the same room. For example, if one child wants to play a video game in the game room and another child wants to color, see if you can have the one child color in the game room.

, Give them some responsibilities by clarifying that they are older and thus more capable and responsible. It’s likely that they're used to doing this as they may be older siblings anyways, or used to being with younger children. Also, most little kids look up to their siblings or older ones and will want to do what they are doing.


Try to ask them for help rather than simply telling them to help. Simply say, “Hey, could you help him/her with their drawing?” or “Could you please help me run the kids through this activity?”

Think about what your babysitters did for you as a child: Did you ever have a really good babysitter, who made your life so much fun, so you didn't want them to ever leave?,
Get to know the child: Ask the parent what the child does in their spare time.,
Think of something you can add to every time you babysit: If there is something you can bring every time you babysit, like a storybook, a collage, or a picture.,
The magic bag: Have something to do with magic, where you can bring your crafts.,
Keep things as simple as possible: Children do not like lots of rules, or plans, this just complicates things.

,

, Do they like trains? Princesses? or maybe even art? Use this to assemble games, crafts and activities around their favourite topic. One thing you can do is go to the dollar store, they have amazing crafts for one or two dollars.

, This is something the child can look forward to, and they can be reminded of all the fun things you did with them each time they see it. Try a storybook, where you and the child can write a stories of your own. This helps the child with literature, and creativity.

, This makes the games even more fun, and the child wants to behave more, in case the ""magic"" goes away. Try a magic bag with crafts, a magic wand, or magic potions (scented water in a pretty bottle).

,, A time-out is perfect, and you can adjust the level of punishment by how long you let them sit!
, Don't even say ""shut up"", ""stupid"", ""crap"", etc."

Write down important phone numbers.,
Ask about rules for yourself.,

Treat the children with respect.,
Be ready for falsehoods.,
Be prepared for injuries.",How to Babysit Older Kids," Let them choose from a variety of age-appropriate activities. Older kids need different things to do than younger kids. A young kid may like to color but an older kid may prefer movies and video games. Ask the child what they’d like to do for the evening. You usually need to prepare these activities in advance.


If the children want to watch movies make sure you know which ones they’re allowed to watch. Some parents are very particular about the movies their kids watch.
If the children want to play video games make sure to clear it with the parents first.;
, Choose something age appropriate. Children between the ages of five and ten might enjoy using watercolor paints or cutting out shapes, but older children will find this boring. Alternatively, they might enjoy making a book from scratch or learning how to use specialty art tools like oil pastels.


Gather your tools in advance. Don’t rely on the parents to have everything you need in their house.
Be positive when making crafts with older children. Older children can be sensitive and may not take criticism well.

, Before they leave, ask the parents if there’s a park nearby that you can take the children to. Bring some kicking or catching balls, bubbles, or jump ropes. If you wear the children out it will be easier to convince them to go to bed later. However, be sure you can handle watching them outside. Don’t let them wander off unsupervised.


Bring a picnic dinner if you’re planning on staying at the park for a long time. It will be a fun change of routine for the children.
Outdoor activities are better for smaller groups of children because it’s easier keep track of them all. If you’re babysitting three or more children, stay inside.

, Ask the child if they have any favorite board games they’d like to play. Similarly, you could bring two or three of your own board games and let the child pick their favorite. Popular board games include Twister, Monopoly, and Pictionary.


Twister is an excellent option for high-energy children as it will wear them out quickly.
If any arguments break out during the board game remain calm and positive. Try to redirect the children’s attention to playing the game.

, Ask the parents in advance if you can order pizza for the night. While waiting for the pizza to arrive, play games to see who gets to pick the movie. For example, you could ask them to answer trivia questions. Whoever answers the most questions correctly gets to choose the movie.


If possible, have three or four movies for the children to choose from. It will be easier to clear four movies with the parents and may prevent long arguments among the children.
Make sure the parents leave you money for the pizza.

, What time do they normally eat dinner, and what should you serve them? What time do they go to bed? Do they need to take a bath before bed? This is important information that parents may forget to tell you.Bring a notepad to write down their responses. Otherwise, you may forget important details.

, The parents may forget whether or not you know about their child’s food allergy, especially if they have more than one child. Make sure to ask your parents if there’s anything their child can’t eat or touch. Find out if they have any medication or an epi-pen on hand in case of an attack.If you don’t know how to use an epi-pen, ask the parent to show you how. This is critical information that you may need.
If necessary, ask the parents to write a detailed procedure on what to do if the child has an allergy attack.

, Record both parents’ phone numbers in case of an emergency. If the child has a lot of health issues they may also have a physician’s private number. If so, ask for that as well. Make sure you’re familiar with the emergency number for your area.If you don’t have a cell phone, ask if you can use their landline in an emergency. However, if they don’t have a landline, one of the parents should leave their cell phone with you.
Ask if the children are allowed to use the phone.

, What movies can you show the children? What food are you allowed to eat in the fridge? Is there any food that’s being saved for later? Would they mind if you watched TV after the children went to sleep? Make sure you have a clear idea of their expectations for you. Otherwise, you may annoy them and they won’t call you next time they need a babysitter.Make sure you know how to use the television before the parents leave, especially if you plan on watching TV with the children.

, If you ask the parents for guidelines in advance you can back up these limits with parental authority. Just like younger kids, older kids need clear rules. For example, they might still have an early bedtime. You have to resist the urge to give in to their pleas and be firm about your rules.If the child has trouble cooperating turn your instructions into a game. For example, you could challenge them to get ready for bed in under five minutes.

, Older children appreciate being treated like adults. For example, give them a choice whenever you can. This will show the child that you respect their opinions. Similarly, stay calm and positive when talking to the child. This will encourage them to stay calm and positive as well.


Don’t interrupt the child when they’re talking. If you do they’ll feel like you don’t respect what they have to say.
Never lose your cool. If you freak out the child may lose all respect for you.

, Some older kids like to trick babysitters. For example, they may try to convince you that they’re allowed to play outside with their friends unsupervised. Firmly tell them that you know they’re not allowed and to stop asking. Of course, it helps to have asked the parents about these limitations in advance, but when in doubt say no.If they persist with their falsehood, tell them you’ll call their parents for permission.
If you catch the child lying don’t take it personally. Stay positive and friendly.

, If the worst happens remember to keep calm. Children take cues from the authority figures in their lives; if you freak out, they’ll freak out. Refer to the list of emergency numbers that the parents gave you to figure out who to call.If the child is in immediate danger, help them before you call the parents. The child’s safety comes first.
If the situation requires it, you may need to move to another location. Keep the children with you at all times by holding their hands.

The average hourly rate for babysitting in the US is $12.75/hr. This rate can vary depending on geographic location, the number of children being cared for, and the years of experience of the babysitter., Before babysitting make sure you have contact information for the parents, a secondary emergency contact, as well as important emergency numbers readily available. You should also be aware of any relevant medical information about the children.For example, do they have any allergies or special dietary requirements. They may need to carry an EpiPen with them for bee stings or other allergies.
You should also know where to find things in the house. For example, you should know where a first aid kit is located.

, It is important to know the timeline and structure of the children’s daily routine while you are babysitting them. Children like and respond well to routine and structure. You should try to follow their structure for mealtimes, naps, baths, and bedtime.You may also want to be aware of other behaviours, interests, or routines specific to the child you are babysitting. For example, is there a certain toy or blanket that the child needs to have in order to go to sleep?

, You should be aware of and enforce any rules set by the parents. This could include how much computer or screen time the child is allowed to have at night, the child's set bedtime, the types of snacks and treats that are permitted, etc.You should also learn about their preferred discipline tactics. Ask ahead of time if they have tips or certain strategies that their child responds well to, such as a time out, if the child is misbehaving.

You should always be watching them and aware of where they are at all times.Some incidents are bound to happen and small scrapes and bumps are common for kids, but they shouldn’t be happening constantly and should be handled responsibly.

, If parents give you specific directions for how to go about doing certain things, such as feeding, bathing, and bedtime routines you should do as directed. For example, if they give instructions on what the kids should eat for dinner, you should stick to the options they provide.


Usually they are giving detailed instructions because this is how they want things done or they are the best options for you as a babysitter.

, A good babysitter won’t just supervise the children. You should interact and play with them as well. The more engaged you are with their games and activities the more fun they will have and you can build a positive connection with them., In order to ensure the children have a fun time and don’t get bored, it is a good idea to have some pre-planned activities and games.For example, you could plan a fun craft to create with the kids.

, The more you are able to fit with a family’s schedule and are okay with taking on additional time the more likely you will be hired back.For example, if parents aren’t sure of the exact time that they will be home and you are flexible to stay between a time range (i.e. they will be home at some point between 9:30 and 11:00pm), that can be very helpful.

, It is reassuring to the parents when you are able to tell them what you and the kids were up to while they were out. This shows that you were actively engaged and paying attention to the children.You can also provide feedback on their child’s behaviour, whether positive or negative.

Remain calm.,

Enforce time out.",How to Babysit Kids That Are Difficult to Deal With," Everyone has different parenting styles and sometimes you’ll come across children who are used to an environment with fewer rules than you’re comfortable with. To help the difficult child adapt to the rules in your babysitting environment, it’s wise to thoroughly explain your rules, age permitting.


Depending on the age of the child, try sitting them down and saying something like “One rule is that you keep your hands to yourself at all times because I don’t want you to hurt anyone, or get hurt by anyone.” This works well if the child is old enough to understand cause and effect, typically adequate for children ages 5-10. A 2-year-old for example, may not understand why they aren't allowed to do something, but can understand the word ""no."";
, After you’ve explained your rules and the reasoning behind them, have the child assist you in making a rule chart that you can refer to when they start to act out. If the child is old enough to read, have them recite the rule they are breaking whenever they misbehave.Grab some construction paper and markers and have them help you write out a numbered list of the rules. Bring the chart with you whenever you babysit and put it somewhere visible to the child. When they break one of the rules, stop them and say “Tommy, remember rule number 3? What does it say?” Point to the rule on your chart and have them recite why it is off limits.

, After you’ve explained what is expected from them and why it’s expected, tell the child what kind of repercussion will occur if one of your rules is broken.You can say something like “If you put your hands on someone else, you will be sent to time out.” Or ""If you throw a tantrum, you will not be allowed to watch TV.""
Some sample punishments are taking away desserts, taking away a particular privilege (time with electronics), stopping whatever activity they are doing (don’t allow them to finish their craft), or taking away TV time or time playing outside.
If the child is older, say 11-13, more effective punishments might include something like taking away their cell phone, tablet, or favorite video game.

, The first time you allow a rule to be broken without the consequence you promised would follow, the child learns they can get away with acting out. Handling difficult children is all about consistency.


If your rule chart says that talking back to adults will result in not being able to watch TV; you MUST turn off the TV. Even if you were in the middle of a show that you actually liked, the consequence must be followed through, or the difficult child won’t take any of your rules seriously.

, You don’t want the child to only associate you with rules and consequences, or they could begin resenting your presence. Try bringing a toy, treat, or new activity with you to each babysitting session. This will create excitement for your time together and can be used as another tool for maintaining the rules.Explain to the child that you’re not obligated to bring gifts or fun things to do, and if they misbehave, you will stop. For example, bake some cookies to bring with you. Before letting Tommy have one, look him in the eyes and say “I like to bring goodies for you, but I don’t have to. These cookies are only for when you’re behaving nicely. If you break a rule, you won’t get any, and I won’t bring anything next time. Do you understand?”, If you’re struggling with a child, the first person you should tell is the parent. It may not be easy for everyone to hear that their child is considered difficult to deal with, but keeping open communication is essential when babysitting. Some kids act completely different for their babysitter than they do for their parents. If the parents don’t know you’re having trouble, they can’t do anything to help fix the issue.


If Tommy had a tantrum over eating his lunch and threw his plate at you, try telling the parent something like “Tommy had a pretty good day today, but I have to be honest with you, he behaved very poorly at lunch. In response to that behavior, he had to sit in time out for 5 minutes.”If the child is older; you might be surprised what ""version"" of the day's events they tell their parents later. To combat feeling like it's your word against theirs, try to tell the parents of any issues as soon as they happen. A quick phone call or text immediately afterwards ensures you won't forget, and the parents are kept up to date with an accurate account of the situation.

, Good advice from the parents of the difficult child can be your best asset in combating unruly behavior. Politely explain to the parents that you are experiencing severe difficulty babysitting their kid, and ask them how they handle similar situations at home. Consistency between you and the parents will create a stable environment for the child and help curb negative behaviors.


Try starting the conversation with something like “I absolutely love babysitting Tommy, but I am having difficulties with a few things I was hoping you could help me with. He seems to throw frequent tantrums, how do you handle these at home?”
You can also try saying “I think it would really help Tommy if we were on the same page. When he acts out, what consequence do you give him?”
In the event the parents of the misbehaved kid don’t have any tips, ask your friends who have children how they handle tantrums and whatever other behaviors you’re trying to deal with. Chances are you’re not alone, someone you know has dealt with similar issues and will be able to give you some ideas that worked for them.

, Now that the parents are aware of the issues and have told you how they handle bad behavior at home try your best to combine their rules and consequences with your ground rules. Your goal is to create as much consistency as possible, even if they have a rule you didn’t consider.For instance, you may not care if the child runs in the house instead of walking. But if the parents tell you that is a rule implemented at their house, you should add it to your rule chart.
If the child is older; you may not think anything of letting them watch Cartoon Network, only to find out their parents have forbidden certain programs. Always adapt what is, and isn't allowed while you're babysitting to what the parents do at home.

, You may be very frustrated, but it is crucial that you never take your frustrations out on the child. Remember always to stay calm. When you feel yourself getting upset, stop and take a deep breath. Remind yourself that they are the child, and you are the adult who is in control of the situation.

, Assuming no safety issues, walk away for a few minutes so that you can continue calming down, while the kid defuses their anger. Once they learn that tantrums don’t result in the kind of attention they want, they will stop using that as a tactic.

, Tell them that tantrums don’t result in whatever it is they want and try to distract them with something else. Perhaps there is a song you can sing that helps calm them down. Maybe an individual familiar object, like their favorite blanket, helps to sooth them. Whatever distraction you use, don’t give in to whatever sparked the tantrum in the first place.


If you’re babysitting the child and their siblings, they might be able to help calm the delicate child down as well.

, For younger children, if the tantrum is just getting out of control, time out is needed. Designate a spot in the house, whether it be a corner, hallway, or particular chair, to be the ""time out spot."" The general rule for timeouts is to implement 1 minute per 1 year of age. So, if Tommy is five years old, he sits in time out for 5 minutes.


If they won't stay on their own, sit with them and make them stay for the entire time.
Older kids can throw tantrums too, but the time out chair may be far too juvenile for them. For an older unruly child who is getting out of control, it is best to try sending them to their room, or a separate room of the house until they calm down. Tell them they need to sit in that room until they settle down and are ready to come back out and listen. This gives you both a chance to cool off before they return.

Look for child-care, CPR, and first-aid classes in your area so that you are well-prepared and qualified for your first babysitting job. These can often be found at Red Cross, YMCA, and other community centers. You can also read books that cover the subject and answer many common questions about how to handle infants and children in many of the common situations.;
, Being in a home while a parent is there will give you a chance to practice and gain experience you can advertise. Helping out with your own siblings is excellent practice, too.

, As a babysitter, you are likely working for yourself (rather than a company) and therefore, have to make and maintain your own schedule. Although it may seem old-fashioned, fill out a calendar with all your free days and times, so that when a parent calls to schedule you for babysitting you know exactly when you are available.


Creating a color-coding system may be helpful in organizing your ‘busy’ days on the calendar.
Update your schedule frequently so that you don’t accidentally double-book yourself.

, Although some parents have a specific rate in mind when they hire a babysitter, many rely on the sitter to provide their hourly wage. There are two options for selecting a rate: being paid a flat rate per hour, or being paid per child. The former is better for small families while the latter is best if you plan on watching more than two children at once.


Flat rate hourly wages typically range from $7-$12 per hour, but can be significantly more or less depending on the household.
Per child wages range from $4-$6 per child, per hour. However, to get a better idea of the competition and to see what is suitable for the conditions, get an overview of what others in your area are charging for a family the size of the family you are sitting for.

, You will also need personalized information for each child (such as allergy information), but you should have one generalized list of ""worst-case-scenario"" phone numbers. You may want to include:


Poison control
Police station
Fire department
Nurse hotline
A trusted person who has had children (like an aunt or parent) to contact in case of a minor case of confusion
Any other relevant numbers

, If you're new to babysitting, you'll need to let people know you're interested. Word of mouth is often the easiest way to land a job. Talk to your neighbors, people from your church, or families at your school who have young kids. Ask friends who are babysitters if they know of any openings. If you have an older sibling who is moving on to another job, contact their clients.


It's always best to babysit for someone you know or someone you've heard about from a friend. If you're new to babysitting, you may choose to only babysit for those you know.
If word of mouth doesn't work, consider advertising in your neighborhood. You can put flyers in people's doors or send out an email if your neighborhood provides a list of residents. If you decide to advertise, check with your parents first. They need to know anytime you put out personal information.
Put together a résumé outlining any specific skills and experience you can offer. For example, if you took a babysitting course, put it on your résumé. List any experience you have had caring for kids — even if it's younger brothers, sisters, or cousins. Have you taken a first-aid course in school? Do you drive? These are all things to put on your résumé. Before you start, you also need to know how often or how much you want to work and what you plan to charge.

, It's hard enough to find parents who are looking for babysitters. The next step - perhaps the hardest - is to make yourself seem worthy of the job. It's easier said than done. Now it's time to set up interviews so you can get to know the parents and their children.


Just as you'll be finding out if the job sounds good, the parents will be looking to learn as much as possible about you. Tell them about yourself, your family, your school, and why you want to babysit.
Be prepared with a list of questions so you know what's expected of you. Write them down so you don't forget to ask anything. The answers you get to questions like these will help you decide if it's the right job for you.
If you've interviewed the family and met the kids but still want to learn more, suggest another visit so you can spend more time with the kids. Most parents will be happy that you want to find out as much as you can.

, Before you go, know what you're comfortable with and what you're not. You need to feel in control. If you're unsure about a job, it's better to wait for the next one. Your safety is as important as the safety of the kids you'll be watching. If this is a first babysitting job, make sure you feel comfortable about the family. Trust your instincts, and don't feel like you have to accept the job on the spot. Tell the family you need to talk it over with your parents before committing to the job. When you know what you want and what to expect, babysitting is a better experience for both you and the kids.


If you don't feel like you have the skills to look after a newborn, don't take the job.
If you're allergic to certain animals, you may need to turn down a job if the family has pets.

,


Do you enjoy spending time with children?
Are you prepared to take care of kids?
Do you have an awareness of young children's needs?
Have you taken a babysitting course?
Do you have experience taking care of younger siblings or relatives?
What can you offer to the kids and their families?
Do you want to babysit occasionally or find a regular babysitting position?
If income is a concern, will the hours and payment meet your needs?
How many kids will you be taking care of?
What are their ages? The amount of care needed differs with age.
Do the kids have any special needs? Special diets?
Does the family have pets? A pool?
What are the hours you're expected to work?
What are you allowed to do in the home (e.g., use their computer, help yourself to food and snacks or bring your own)?
If you have your license, are you expected to drive the kids?

, When you arrive on site for the job, start by getting all the information about the parents’ whereabouts for when they leave. Write down their full names and phone numbers, the address(es) of their destination(s), and their estimated time of arrival back at the house, and an emergency contact. Also take down any information on the child, such as allergies (or other health information). This list will need to be longer and more detailed for longer time periods.


Have the parents show you the location of first aid supplies and medications.
Get a list of medications that each child may need to take, or is able to take in case of injury or illness (such as Tylenol for growing pains or a headache).
Write down the child/children’s schedule. Most families have a general (or sometimes more specific) timetable of events in a child’s day. This typically includes meal times, the times for certain chores/homework periods, and bedtime. Getting this written down in advance will mean that the child (if they’re older) won’t be able to pull the wool over your eyes once their parents are gone.

, Each household you work in will be slightly different, and it is important to find out what activities are allowed in each. Ask about television/video game/computer time, when/where the child may be allowed to play outside, if their friends are allowed over, and any areas of the house that may be off-limits. These rules may vary from child to child in the same household depending on age, so be sure to specify.

, Depending on how long you’ll be babysitting, you may have to feed the child/children a meal or two. Ask the parents about what foods they prefer you cook and serve, and what foods are appropriate for snack time. Clarify about any foods that aren’t allowed; these are typically candy and dessert-related goodies that the kids might ask for when their parents aren’t supervising.

, It is fairly likely that at some point in time, a child you are watching will misbehave. Rather than guessing and either punishing them too little or too much, ask the parents what they typically do for small misbehaviors. Many times this includes having privileges revoked or being put on ‘time-out’. A parent could also say that you are not to punish them, and instead should report all misbehaviors to them. , Babysitting is as much a job as it is an opportunity to enjoy the company of children. The kids will be more receptive to you and your rules if they like you, and they’ll grow to like you faster if you try to develop a relationship with them. Talk with them, ask them questions, and joke around in order to develop a good relationship.

, Although your job is to watch over the children, you should be interacting with them as much as possible by playing with them. Play will vary based on their ages; if you’re watching an infant you may be doing nothing more than making faces and holding up toys. Get creative with the things you come up with for the children to do to keep them interested and out of trouble. Make-believe games are great fun.


Be an entertainer. Parents love babysitters who help kids have fun and learn while still reinforcing rules and keeping discipline. Ask kids to show you their favorite toys. Find out from parents and other babysitters what games kids of different ages like to play. Get the kids outdoors if you can.
Playing with toys, board games, and activity-based games are all good options for older children. Ask what their favorite thing to do is. You can also bring a few of your favorite games and toys from when you were their age.
Monopoly
Life
Candyland
Uno
Card games

, Kids like stories, and they'll be impressed by even the worst storytellers. Come equipped with obscure fairy tales they probably haven't heard, like ""The Shoemaker and the Elves"" or ""The Twelve Dancing Princesses."" You can even use stories as rewards.

, If you’re spending a long time watching the children, you can do projects together that are enjoyable for everyone. Consider doing an arts and crafts project or cooking/baking a new recipe (or an old favorite) together. Boxed mixes of brownies, cookies, and cakes taste delicious. Having a finished product will feel productive, pass the time, and give the kids something to be proud of., Simple games like tag and hide and seek get kids active and help them stay fit (a big topic these days). Dancing with them is great exercise, too!

, Kids aren't as good at regulating their time as adults are, and often forget to perform basic bodily necessities. Check once every hour or so to see if they need to go to the bathroom, need water to drink, are tired, or are hungry. Most of the time they won’t think to tell you these things on their own, so always be sure to ask.

, Assuming the parents gave you a basic outline of daily activities, you should be sure you are keeping up with it. Make sure you are feeding the kid(s) at proper meal times, giving them naps, having them do their homework on schedule, etc., If there is time watch a movie with the kids. I suggest you watch a movie towards the end to settle the children down before their parents arrive.

Tarzan
Finding Nemo
Avengers
Barbie Dolls
Cinderella

, Play tag or something to get the children's energy out before their parents get home. Make sure to Calm the children down afterwards.

Tag
Duck, Duck Goose
Hide And Seek

, Make up a simple handshake with the children., No matter what the circumstances are, your job as a babysitter is to watch the kids in their home - so you shouldn’t need to leave them. Make sure you never leave the kids alone in the house. Being in a different room is fine, but running up to the store for ingredients or taking a walk without them is out of the question. This applies even for older children, unless the parents gave you explicit directions stating that they could be home alone for a small period of time.

, Unless the kids have friends who were pre-planned on coming over, no one should enter the home at any point during your stay. You should not have people - friends or family - coming over to spend time hanging out while you should be working. It can be tempting to invite a friend over late at night while the kids are asleep, but even this is off limits.

, With cell-phones, tablets, and laptops more prevalent now than ever, it can be easy to get caught up texting friends or scrolling through Facebook. Just like many jobs - your electronics should be turned off or used only in case of emergency. You are being paid to watch the kids, not to talk to friends.

, Kids will often ask to just watch movies or TV, and while these may be appropriate in short allotments, several hours of them becomes laziness. If the parents haven’t set an electronics maximum, try to keep it at two hours or less. The kids will enjoy having someone to play with, and the parents won’t think that you’re lazy or slacking on the job., Peek out of the peephole or window (do not open the door) first before answering the door. The person at the door may be a stranger. Ask the parents if they are expecting anyone before they leave.

, Although it is sometimes forgotten, a major part of babysitting is cleaning up after the kids. You may not have much of a mess to deal with, but if you cooked or did a project, be sure to put everything back in its place. The parents will appreciate coming home to a clean house and will be more likely to re-hire you again in the future.


Always clean up after yourself. If You and the children make a mess pick it up after you make it. Don't wait until the end to pick everything up. What if the Parents come home unexpectedly. You would want some of it to be clean.
Play cleaning games with the kid. Say whoever picks up the most wins or makeup a silly game that includes cleaning.
Usually there is a mess when you get there, pick it up. Everyone appreciates it when they come home to a house cleaner then they had it.

, It's tempting to be the ""cool"" babysitter who lets kids get away with things parents never allow. Remember, you're not their parents, so you don't really have much say in how the house rules go. You can't be a child's friend all the time.


Know when to say no and when it's OK to let something small go like letting kids stay up 15 minutes past bedtime on occasion.
Kids will challenge you. Pushing boundaries to see how much they can get away with is a normal way kids (even toddlers) learn and figure out where they stand. But even though kids try to fight rules, they actually need and thrive best on structure and limits. So check in with parents to find out what the rules are, then follow them, even if you don't agree with them! Not only will this help keep things consistent for the kids, you'll gain their respect and trust.
The best babysitters think of the job as a responsibility first, with having fun, or earning money) second. Few things are as rewarding as knowing you've earned a child's trust and affection.

, It is better to be safe than sorry, and most likely the parents will appreciate your concern.

, It will make you feel more safe while babysitting.


Get all relevant information regarding emergencies before the parents/guardians leave. This could be emergency numbers, where the main ""Home"" phone is kept, where a spare door key is. Try not to come off as nosy, and the adult(s) will realize that you are just attempting to help. In this way you can be sure of what to do in an emergency and get the children out. In the event of an emergency, such as a fire, drop everything and get the child or children and yourself out of the house. Do not reenter the house, do not let go of the children and call your country`s emergency number as soon as possible.

,, You should know how to bottle-feed, spoon feed, and keep children safe in the kitchen.


Feed the children healthy food. It is not good babysitting to just allow the children to eat whatever. Tell them before they get crackers they have to eat a piece of fruit.These things include Apples, carrots, grapes, and oranges.

Be sure the child doesn't have something they are not allowed to have (such as a cookie or ice cream) too often.



, Be prepared for a lot of whining and problems. For older kids, you need to know the difference between real problems and stall tactics. For babies, you have to be sure the sleep environment is safe. Here are tips for making bedtime easier.


Give warning before sending kids to bed. You may want to let them stay up 10-15 minutes past what their parents allow- just be sure they know it's a special treat. Other than that, be firm with when it's time to go to sleep.
Know bedtime routines. End-of-day routines help kids wind down and signal their bodies that it's time for sleep. Ask parents what they usually do before bedtime. Maybe they have rules like no TV or computer time for an hour before bedtime. If they typically read, talk quietly, or listen to music before bed, follow the same routine.
Go through the basics. Take a child to the bathroom (or put on a nighttime diaper). Help the child brush their teeth. Find out from parents what else is necessary before the kid hops under the covers.
Always put babies (and children) to bed in their designated sleep space (be it a bed, crib, bassinet, etc.) This is especially important for babies, who can be injured if their sleep space isn't how it should be.
Be sure to lay babies on their back when putting them to sleep. It helps reduce the risk of suffocation.
Before you put the child in the crib, take out all padding along the sides of the crib. Infants should not sleep with anyone else, so don't lie down with a baby who is falling asleep. Don't let babies spend a lot of time sleeping in swing seats or car seats.
Give the child any comfort items, such as pacifiers, stuffed animals, or blankets, that they usually sleep with. Do not give stuffed animals and similar to babies.
If a child calls you/wakes up, wait a minute before going in. They may fall back asleep on their own.
If a baby can't go back to sleep, stroke them gently on the arms or belly. If the baby uses a pacifier, that can also help. Find out what calming tactics the parents use.
Avoid turning on bright lights, talking, playing, etc. once a child is in bed.
Remind the child that it's time to be quiet and sleep. Be firm about that final ""goodnight"" and tell a child, ""Sleep well!""

, Allow her to become settled with you by holding her until the parents leave. This will comfort both the baby and the parents.

, Change her if required, talk to her, comfort her, most one year olds would enjoy music, trying playing soft music, light beats, pick her up and try light moves, see if she enjoys this. Some babies like to move or dance by themselves, encourage them, but stay close by just in case she loose balance!

, Give her a fun toy to play with like, a stuffed teddy bear, a puzzle but beware she is only a year old and small pieces can become a choking hazard. Try peak-a-boo, with your hands or even a book. Make sure to keep her interested. Let her explore a play area on her own, while you are close by to watch.

, She might be used to eating every 2 or 3 hours. Find out how much and how often from the parents, and don't wait for her to get too hungry as this might end up in tantrums or persistent crying. When she gets hungry, feed her something from the list you made of what she likes. Feed her carefully with a spoon. Don't forget about her formula or milk either.

, This will give you a little break. Make sure it is a fun and educational channel. But do not leave it on for very long. Try toys, simple games and naps instead of television.

, Hunger? Irritation? Lack of attention from your part? Try distracting her with a stroll outside, or even inside the house, try naming different objects, see what catches her attention, try music and dance. If none of this helps and you have absolutely no idea, contact the parents and ask to them about anything they usually do that calms her down.

, Leave the door open a little so you can hear if she wakes up.

, Clean up the kitchen if it's messy. Pick up any toys and books that are scattered about. Make sure the bathroom is clean and the floor isn't covered with puddles. The parents will really appreciate not having to clean up after their babysitter goes home. After all, that's why they hired you.

, Did she have a delayed reaction to a loud noise, or no reaction at all? Was she alert and responsive to you, as she should be? Be sure to tell them how much you enjoyed taking care of their daughter and that you hope they will call on you again.

Use this time to get instructions from the parents, discuss your responsibilities, and take a tour of the home. Also ask the parents about any house rules and about the child's routine.Ask about the child's eating schedule, bedtime, and preferred activities.
Locate the first aid supplies and ask about any areas of the house that are off limits for the child.
Ask if you are allowed to have visitors or use the television and computer.;
, Anything can happen while you are babysitting. It is important for you to easily be able to contact someone if something goes wrong. Get the name and phone number for the parents and another adult in case the parents are not available. Also write down the address where you are babysitting in case you need to call emergency services.In case the child swallows something poisonous, the number to the poison control center is 1-800-222-1222.This is a 24/7 number.

, Once the parents leave, make sure you lock all of the doors and windows. You should also close all of the blinds, especially if you are babysitting at night.Close the doors to any areas that the child should not go in as well., Toddlers are very active and anything can happen when you turn your back. Do not allow the child to play near closets, chests, medicine cabinets, or any storage locations. Check with the parents before you take the child outside to play. If the child is allowed to play outside, keep him or her away from traffic and in designated safe areas.Also keep the child away from stairs and electrical outlets.
Be aware of any small toy pieces or particles on the floor that the child may pick up and put in his or her mouth.

, A 1 year old will probably need a diaper change while you are babysitting. It is important that you change the child regularly so he or she does not get a diaper rash. Check the diaper before and after a nap or when the child eats. A wet diaper will likely feel heavy, and you will definitely be able to smell a poopy diaper. Gather all of your supplies (e.g. clean diaper, baby wipes, damp washcloth, dry washcloth, diaper ointment, changing pad) before you get started.Place the child on the changing table and remove the dirty diaper. Wipe the child from front to back with the damp washcloth or baby wipe.
Pat the child dry with a clean, dry washcloth and put a thin layer of diaper ointment if the parents have asked you to.
Open the new diaper, lift the child's legs, and slide the diaper under him or her. Place the front part of the diaper between the child's legs and onto his or her belly. Then fasten the adhesive strips from the back of the diaper to the front of the diaper.
Wash your hands after you are finished changing the diaper.

, Ask the parents what kind of food the child likes to eat and how well the child can chew and feed him/herself. Most toddlers like finger foods that can be easily picked up, and they are not very good at using utensils yet. Cut the food into bite size pieces before giving it to the child. Make sure the child is sitting down during meal time. You do not want the child to choke.Most toddlers eat 3 meals a day and few snacks in between. Check with the parents to determine the child's feeding schedule.

, Good activities for a 1 year old include: building with and knocking down blocks, playing with soft stuffed animals, playing hide and seek, and playing with any toys that can be pushed or pulled (e.g. tool sets, telephones, dish sets).Children this age can also draw with large crayons.You may have to hold the paper down while the child draws.


Ask the parents what the child's favorite toys and activities are.
Whatever you play with the child, never take your eyes of of him or her.
Children get bored easily, so you will probably have to do multiple activities while you are babysitting.

, Ask the parents the child's bedtime and usual nighttime routine. The child may not want to go to bed, but it is best to keep his or her typical schedule.. You may give the child some warm milk or read a story before putting the child to bed. Check on the child periodically while he or she is sleeping. Do not listen to the TV too loudly or talk on the phone just because the child is sleeping. You need to be able to hear if the child makes a noise or begins to cry.If the child begins to cry, wait a minute and see if he or she stops. If the crying does not stop, go check on the child. You may have to comfort and/or hold the child until he or she goes back to sleep.
Check on the child every 30 minutes., Some parents may not be comfortable with you bathing the child. Check with the parents before they leave to make sure it is alright. Fill the bath tub with about four or five inches of lukewarm water. Apply a small amount of soap to the child's body and then rinse the child off. Use a washcloth to clean the child's face. Do not get soap in the child's face or eyes. Once you are finished, dry the child off, put on a fresh diaper, and dress the child.Never leave the child alone in the tub.
If the child has bath toys, allow him or her to play with them during bath time.
Smile and talk to the child as you bathe him or her.

, Keeping the child occupied and happy can help prevent temper tantrums, but the child may have one anyways. If the 1 year old throws a temper tantrum stay calm and never argue with the child. If he or she is on the ground kicking and rolling around, try to keep the child safe and from damaging anything. Although it may be tempting, do not leave the child alone in a room during the tantrum.Once the tantrum is over, comfort and hold the child and try to engage the child with a fun activity.

, A 1 year old may cry when his or her parents leave. This is normal, and the child will probably stop once he or she gets comfortable. Remind the child that his or parents will be coming back later and try to distract the child with a toy or a snack.Continue to stay calm and comfort the child. Your demeanor will help the child feel safe and comfortable.

, Small children sometimes like to hit other people. If the 1 year old hits you, firmly tell the child to stop. You can also put the child in time out for 1 minute as a punishment. If the child does not stop, let the parents know about the behavior when they return.Never hit or physically punish the child.

, Once the parents return, give them a report of how the babysitting went. Tell them about meal time and bedtime. Let them know the activities that you did with the child and the child's reaction to the different activities.It is important to be detailed because the child is unable to let the parents know how things with.


Always be honest with the parents about how everything went.

Share the work load.,
Ask the parent(s) questions.,
Always keep your eyes on the child if he/she is young.,
Have games for the kids and get involved with them.,
Get the child (or children) to bed.,
When the child falls asleep, don't be tempted to snoop around the house.,
At the end of the night make sure to tell the parents how your night went to reassure them.

",How to Babysit As a Teenager," If you think the amount of work is too much for you, ask the parents of the child (or children) if you can have a friend over (the parents would most likely be more comfortable with two girls babysitting rather than a girl and guy);
, This will make the parent feel that you are responsible enough to look after their child because you want to know how to care for their child and you understand that each child has different needs and remedies.

, If they are eight or older they will want some privacy but make sure to check up on them often.

, This will distract them and keep them from getting into trouble. Try playing tag, catch, or Hide The Object (one person hides an object the other tries to find it. This is a safer alternative to Hide-and-Seek) for kids 5-7. For babies, play Peek-A-Boo and tickle them. For toddlers (kids 2-4), play tag, catch with a foam ball, or build an obstacle course and try to complete it with the child. For kids eight and up, play board games and possibly multi-player video games (if you are allowed to and feel comfortable with it).

, If the child has a set bedtime, tire them out that day, but about an hour or so before bedtime wind them down and get them into their pajamas. Do some quiet activities like reading a bedtime story, having a glass of water or warm milk, or listening to quiet, gentle music, perhaps lullabies.

, You never know when the parents may find out about your snooping. Keep within your limits in the home.

"
Know the child's needs.,
Ask the parents to compile a list of emergency call numbers.,
Pack some activities and maybe some snacks.,
Bring your cell phone.,
If you can't cook for lunch, fix them a sandwich or a hot pocket cut in half, a pudding cup, chocolate milk and a cheese stick.

,
Be smart.,
Be responsible.,
Order out for some pizza or whatever s/he wants.

,
Let them bake their own special cake for mommy and daddy, they will find that interesting.",How to Babysit Children 3 to 6 Years Old," Find out all you need to know about the child before starting the role. For example, find out what health issues the child might have, such as allergies, asthma, epilepsy, anger management issues, etc. Also find out all the things the child likes and ways that the parents use to distract the child. Write down the important information. Other things to find out include:


Expected bedtime
Bedtime story favorites
Snacks allowed; meals required (including dietary preferences)
Food likes and dislikes
Diaper needs or toileting issues
Fears the child might have
Visitor policy
Faith observance
Always be prepared for any allergic reactions - what procedures are required to perform if this happens?;
, Have this in sight near the telephone during the babysitting. In particular, have the parent's cell phone contact details readily available.

, Always ask if it is okay to bring along your own toys, games and snacks. Some parents may prefer that you only use what is in the house. If they do let you bring things, the novelty factor can make it easier to care for the children.

, This is useful for emergencies but also for texting any questions that aren't urgent but might be concerning you, such as where to find a pacifier, etc. You can also use the phone's alarm to remind you of bedtime for the children.

,, At this age, they will want to act older so tell them that you trust them enough to help tell you were things are, or help wash the dishes that will make you like friends.

, Don't do everything for them. Let them help make lunch or dinner. They will be creative in their own way so don't be afraid to get messy.

,, Also, let them help make their parents bed and straighten up their room.

"
Get some applications.,
Meet the candidates.,
Watch the babysitter interact with your kids before you decide to employ them.,
Introduce the children to the babysitter.,
Set the ground rules.,
Decide what you want the sitter to do.,
Get organised.,
Get the children settled before you leave.,
Call the sitter just before the children should go to bed.,
Talk to the sitter before they go home.,
Make sure the babysitter gets home safely.",How to Hire a Student to Babysit," If you don't already know the person you want to hire, you'll need to get a few recommendations or applications.



Ask around. Ask your friends, neighbours, parents at the school gate or friends from any community-based pastimes if they know anyone who would be available to babysit your children. This is undoubtedly the best way to get a student babysitter as you'll be happy to trust a character reference that comes from someone that you yourself trust.
Put up some fliers. On the fliers give a brief outline of what you will expect the babysitter to do, the hours in question and the number, ages/grades and special requirements of any of the children they will be looking after. Specify a minimum age and experience, if any. Leave your first name and number or email address and ask them to get in touch if they are interested.

Youth clubs, sports clubs etc. are particularly good places to put up such fliers as you're more likely to attract the attention of teens who are already involved in child coaching or working alongside younger children, which is ideal.


You probably have an idea of what age limit you want to set when choosing a babysitter. If you're unsure, ask friends with more experience of teenagers and check the local legal requirement. Generally, teenagers under the age of 16 or 17 are still too young to be solely responsible for a group of children. That age will depend on the isolation of your house, whether or not your neighbourhood is a safe one, the proximity to someone who will help if there is a problem, the duration of the time spent babysitting and the individual's maturity.;
, You've rounded up two or three students and you want to know who to employ. Call them individually or have them visit your house for a few minutes one afternoon. Don't get too hot and heavy when it comes to questions. Simple scenarios or ""what if..."" questions will give you a good idea of how grounded and mature they are. Ask if they have any experience with children of a similar age to yours and ask for references from anyone they previously babysat for or, failing that, a sports coach or teacher. Remember to ask their referee about their patience, liking for kids and reliability.


If you haven't much experience with teenagers, ask a friend who does to stay in the house with you while you meet them and give you their opinion of what the kids are like afterwards.
Look for qualities such as honesty, a genuine fondness for children, patience, confidence, maturity, openness and practicality. The last thing you want is someone who is easily led, someone who is overly confident in their own abilities or too timid to do a thing.

, Have the babysitter call around to your house for interview and let them spend five minutes with the children they'll be minding before you get down to questions. They'll get an idea of how well they get on with the children, the children will feel more secure when they meet the babysitter again and you'll get a good idea of whether or not the student in question is the right person for you and your family.

, It is very important that an atmosphere of respect towards the babysitter is fostered from the start. Correct any cheekiness and show the right behaviour by example. This will save innumerable problems for the sitter later in the evening.

, Be realistic about what the babysitter will achieve and prioritise the most important rules and parts of the children's nighttime routine. Explicitly state what is forbidden in your household, including physical discipline, profanities etc.


Demonstrate the correct forms of discipline. Basic time outs and verbal correction with a lower tone are realistic. Do not ask the impossible. Specify that if things get out of control, he/she can call your on your mobile phone or call into a neighbour whose consent you have already got.
Make it clear what the sitter can and cannot do. What can they discipline for? What rooms can they go into? What must they absolutely not do?
Write or type out a list of the most important rules and stick it to the fridge.

, Will the sitter do homework, give them a snack, read them a bedtime story or let them watch a movie? When the children are asleep, would you like the sitter to clear the table, wash the dishes, make the kids' lunches for the next day or do some ironing? Let the babysitter know and make sure they know where everything they'll need is.

, Make sure the babysitter can concentrate on the kids and not all the little details which they may or may not remember.


Get snacks organised beforehand. This is very important if your children follow a particular diet or if there are any allergies. If the sitter will prepare the food, make sure you have everything they need laid out on a tray or in one cupboard/fridge. Let them know what the children should eat and what portions your children need. Make sure the food is quick to prepare and does not require much skill; on the first night your sitter will need to keep all their attention on the children.
Make sure there is a back up plan. Tell a trusted neighbour that you'll have a babysitter tonight so you'd appreciate if they'd keep an eye on the house. Give the babysitter your number and keep your phone switched on and with you all evening. Make sure your babysitter knows the local emergency numbers, including that of the GP.

, For the first night it might be best to give them a snack and settle them in front of a film before you go whilst the sitter is settling in.

, Speak to older children for a few minutes, using a calm tone to encourage them to enter rest mode. This will give you peace of mind and help the sitter convince mischievous children that Mom will know if they don't do what they're told!

, Find out about any problems that cropped up and work out how they might handle them if the same thing happened again. Check on the kids yourself before paying the sitter.

, Giving them a lift shows your gratitude and also means you're more likely to become friendly with them, resulting in greater employee loyalty and greater honesty, ensuring you'll find out about any minor problems which can be nipped in the bud.

Laugh in response.;
, You can do things such as dancing, clapping, or other gestures to make your baby laugh. Use a hand puppet.

Engage in conversations with students.,
Ask questions.,
Be flexible.,
Display student work.,
Consider special strategies for teaching various subjects.",How to Be the Best Fourth Grade Teacher1," Try to avoid lecturing to your students. They often have short attention spans and need a little help to remain in the present teaching moment. Encourage their input when you are teaching. This will help them participate more in their own education and will make them more confident about speaking up in class.


Try to participate in conversations with your students even when you are not specifically teaching them. Allowing students to get to know you and showing them that you want to get to know them too makes them feel more comfortable in your class.;
, Try to make your students think as much as possible. Ask them questions about their life; ask them questions about the world around them; ask them questions about the things you read in class. The more questions you ask, the more they'll be forced to think about the topic and come up with their own answers.

, Different students learn in different ways. It's important to acknowledge this and to allow for a certain amount of flexibility in your daily schedule. If students are clearly interested in a certain topic, spend a little more time on it than you had initially planned. If an activity you planned isn't going over well, switch to something else. Always try to choose the option that keeps the students as engaged as possible. Unplanned active learning is better than forcing students into an activity that isn't holding their interest.

, Students will be more engaged on a daily basis if they feel valued and rewarded. Make it a point to prominently display some of their artwork or other projects in your classroom so that they know you value what they do.This will help them feel proud of their accomplishments and want to continue the level of work that helped them get there.

, Each subject is different and requires different methods of teaching. The longer you teach 4th grade, the more you'll figure out what works for you. But here are a couple of tips dealing with various subjects:


English. 4th grade English involves a lot of vocabulary and spelling practice, in addition to reading and writing. One of the best ways to help improve students vocabulary and spelling is through good old fashioned worksheets and spelling tests.Social studies. A lot of what is learned in 4th grade social studies classes has to do with historical events, dates, people, and places. These topics can be hard to remember, so sometimes it can be helpful to show interesting educational videos that help students put a face with the name.
Science. Science should be hands-on whenever possible to help students learn. Make students create a science project, make them draw out the phases of mitosis, or make them do anything else that gets them involved in the process.

Many babies laugh out loud for the first time at 3-4 months of age.
Babies will laugh in response to bright colors, toys, and other people's laughter.

, Peekaboo can be important for object permanence development in infants six months and older.


Object permanence is when the baby recognizes that objects and events still exist even when they can't be seen or heard.
Playing peekaboo is a great way to exercise this cognitive development.
It can also be a great way for younger kids to play with a younger sibling or relative.

, It should be one of their toys such as a teething ring or a ball they can grab.


Allow the baby to examine the toy for a minute or two. Let them touch it and grab at it to explore.
After a few minutes, cover the object with a cloth. If a baby has object permanence, they will be able to pull the cloth off and find the object.
Pull the cloth off and smile. This will often make the baby laugh or giggle, as you have made the object re-appear.

, Start by smiling at your baby and talking to him in a sweet voice.


Cover your face with your hands and say ""Where's Mommy?"" or ""Where's _____?
Pop back out and say ""Peekaboo! I see you!""
Keep your voice happy and stay smiling.
Remember, the goal is to get the baby to laugh and not scare the baby.

, This is a great way for a brother or sister to connect with a younger sibling.

Start the game by saying the first line.,
Continue with the poem.,
Finish the poem.,
Repeat as many times as your baby is amused.",How to Make a Baby Laugh3," This may be better for older babies that can mimic your body movements and some simple words.Even younger babies may get a huge kick out of this game.

Use games as a means of learning.,
Use rewards as incentives.,
Do a show and tell activity with your students.",How to Be the Best Fourth Grade Teacher2," Everyone gets bored eventually during lecture-style learning moments. And elementary school children have a much shorter attention span than most older students, so this is not an effective teaching method to employ with 4th graders. Try employing games in your classroom to boost students' energy levels and to improve their active involvement in the learning process.


There are many examples of educational games that you can find on the internet. Find some that you think your students will be interested in and adapt them to your particular topic/subject if necessary. As you use the games in class, you'll figure out what works and what doesn't. Then you can adjust the activities for the next time so that they are better suited for your specific teaching style and subject matter. Here are some helpful websites that have in-class games appropriate for 4th grade students:

www.learninggamesforkids.comwww.funbrain.comwww.abcya.comwww.knowledgeadventure.comwww.education.comwww.vocabulary.co.ilwww.jumpstart.com, Unfortunately, many 4th grade students have yet to discover the joy of learning for learning's sake. Try implementing a system of rewards that will motivate your students to stay on task and to complete projects satisfactorily.


Note: Try to provide incentives for input activities (things that students put time into like reading and homework) rather than on output results (like grades and scores).This will be more effective because students can control how much time they spend on activities, but they may struggle more with achieving certain grade levels. So if you assign incentives based on something students feel is largely out of their control, like what grade they get on a project or assignment, they may become flustered with the incentive program and give up trying to achieve the incentives altogether.

, Most 4th grade students learn best by having hands on experience within the learning process. Ask your students to bring in an object they have in their house that relates to the topic you are currently studying. This will make them think about the subject matter and apply it to their own life in order to find a suitable item to bring to class.


For example, if you're discussing Native American history, try to find an authentic arrowhead and show it to your class. Then ask your students to bring something from their own house that is related to Native American history in some way. They could bring a leather vest, a beaded purse, a toy horse, a picture of a hunting bow, or any other object related to the topic.

"
"
Be direct.,
Show examples.,
Go over the directions twice.,
Allow your students time to ask questions.",How to Be the Best Fourth Grade Teacher3," Make sure that you provide clear, direct instructions when you are assigning a certain task to students. Don't assume that they'll read between the lines or infer something that you don't explicitly state. Tell them exactly what you want them to do and how you expect them to do it.

, Students can have many different learning styles. Some are visual learners, while others learn by doing. Whatever the case, you will have a variety of learning styles in your classroom and it is important to cater to them all. One of the easiest ways to do this is by showing examples to help your students practice whatever skill is being taught. Teaching them the skill, then showing them how to implement it is an effective way to make the skill stick.


For example, if you are teaching your 4th grade students about multiplying fractions, it is important to teach them the problem solving method and then go over multiple examples with them. You can do this through worksheets in addition to problems on the board so that they have several ways to practice and learn the skill.

, Sometimes kids don't understand the directions the first time around. And realistically, it's always possible that kids will become distracted and missed what you said the first time altogether. So, make sure they are paying attention and repeat the directions a second time.

, After giving your instructions, make sure that you provide enough time for your students to ask questions. That way, if something is unclear to them, they have time to ask for clarification.

Go to the library.,
Provide ample in-class reading time.,
Read a book as a class.,
Make students practice.",How to Be the Best Fourth Grade Teacher4," The library is a great place to help students develop an interest in reading and learning. Allow them several trips to the library every week so that they can pick out their books, return old books, and just spend some time reading.

, Let students have class time to just sit and read their books. You can decide if they have to read books just from the library or if they can bring books from home to read during this time. But the most important thing is to get students interested in reading and to give them time to do it in class. This will show them that reading is an important skill and will help them to develop stronger reading abilities over time.

, Reading a book as a class can be a fun experience that everyone looks forward to each day. The students can discuss the book with each other since they are all reading the same book at the same time. This will also help improve their listening comprehension skills because they are practicing listening to something that is fun and doesn't feel like work to them, but will still build these listening skills so they can apply it to their schoolwork.

, Studies have shown that children learn to read and write by reading and writing.So it is essential to give them time to practice these crucial skills in class and encourage them to reinforce these skills with homework and reading assignments.

"

Make a schedule and stick to it.,
Consider pacing and stamina.It is important to think about how long students can sit still, how long students should go between snacks, how long certain activities should take, etc.,
Schedule time for movement.",How to Be the Best Fourth Grade Teacher5," Students thrive when they are given routines to follow. Knowing what they will do each day at a certain time allows them a sense of stability that helps them to feel more comfortable in your classroom.

, Planning too much of one activity can mean drastically decreased productivity. It is often helpful to schedule a short snack break or recess to break up longer periods of required concentration. If you keep these things in mind, you'll be better prepared to structure effective lessons that work to balance active participation with periods of sitting and listening.

, Students need to be able to move around throughout the day. Getting their blood circulating with active movement can greatly increase their ability to concentrate and to stay energized as they work.


Try building movement into your lessons. For example, structure your math lesson so that students must move from table to table to solve the problems."

They usually teach you what the job entails, as well as help you to develop the skills necessary to succeed in the field, such as how to conduct image consultations.Some workshops and courses offer a certificate upon completion, which can be a nice addition to your resume.
If you can’t find a workshop or course in your area, many online schools offer courses in the field, which can be a convenient alternative.;
, If you’re planning to attend or are currently studying at a college, chances are good that your school doesn’t offer a degree program in image consultancy. However, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t available courses that can help prepare you for your career. Majoring in Communications, Marketing, or other related fields can teach you a variety of skills that will help you as an image consultant.Taking art classes can also help you as image consultant because it can help you better understand color theory, which will come in handy when you’re helping clients choose the most flattering shades for their hair, makeup, and clothing.
Psychology courses can help you develop skills for a career as an image consultant because you’ll learn how to interpret clients’ behavior and emotions so you can help them feel better about themselves.
Fashion merchandising classes are a good idea if you’re thinking about a career as an image consultant because it can help you develop a better understanding of fashion and style.

, You probably won’t be able to land a job as an image consultant right away, but there are opportunities in related fields that can help give you valuable experience. You can develop some of the skills necessary to be a successful image consultant by working as a personal shopper or stylist at a department store, a beauty consultant at a makeup counter, or a hair stylist. Even working as a sales associate in clothing store can help prepare you.Many people who become image consultants start on a part-time basis, so they have a reliable income while they’re working to build a client base.

, It’s common for image consultants to choose a particular type of service to provide. You might decide to specialize in fashion and style consulting, and help clients build a flattering wardrobe, as well as provide makeup and hair tips. You may choose to focus on etiquette and communication skills to help clients project a more confident, polished image. However, you may prefer to give advice on all facets of a person’s image, providing style, etiquette, and communications assistance to help individuals become the complete package.You can also choose to specialize in certain types of clients, such as job seekers, executives, beauty pageant contestants, singles, or cancer survivors.
Some image consultants choose to work exclusively with corporate clients instead of individuals, so they provide advice regarding employee uniforms, communications and body language for sales teams, and multicultural etiquette., While an image consultant needs to have knowledge of fashion, makeup, hair, and other image related topics, you may not have the necessary skills to help your clients actually make changes. For example, you might be able to help a client choose a new hair color and style, but you may not have the training to actually do the cut and color work. That’s why it’s important to develop partnerships with makeup artists, hair stylists, and personal trainers, who you can refer your clients to. In turn, these partners can recommend you to individuals who are interested in a complete makeover.You may also want to develop partnerships with dietitians, cosmetic surgeons, dentists, and vocal coaches.
It’s important to find partners whose skills you really trust, so it’s best to work with individuals who you have personal experience with. For example, if you have a hair stylist who’s always given you great cuts, ask her or him if s/he would like to partner with you.

, You need experience working with individuals to convince clients that you’re qualified to help revamp their image. Start by offering friends and family free makeovers. For example, if you have a friend who’s going to a school reunion, take her shopping for new clothes and provide tips for her makeup and hair. Make sure to take before and after photos of all of your makeovers too.If you don’t have enough friends and family members who are interested in makeovers, consider offering your services to local charities, such as a homeless shelter where individuals might need tips preparing for job interviews.

, Prospective clients aren’t just going to take your word for it when you tell them that you can successfully help them improve their image; they’re going to want to see visual proof. That’s why a portfolio of your successful makeovers is a must when you’re trying to get clients. Even if you’ve only given free makeovers, before and after photos show potential clients what kind of results they can expect.Make sure that your portfolio has high quality photos. If possible, take them with a digital camera instead of the one on your phone.
Pay attention to the lighting in your photos. You want prospective clients to be able to see all of the details in your makeovers.
It’s a good idea to have both a physical portfolio that you can bring to meetings with clients, and a digital version that you can send to potential clients who may not be willing to commit to a meeting.

, While it’s not a necessity, being certified as an image consultant can give you credibility that makes prospective clients feel more comfortable. The Association of Image Consultants International (AICI) offers certification that informs clients that you’ve achieved a certain level of knowledge in the field and are committed to staying on top of new trends and developments. Becoming certified means that you can include the ""AICI CIC"" designation after your name on your resume, website, business cards, and other promotional materials.To become AICI certified, you’re required to submit a portfolio which includes client evaluations and proof that you’ve performed 30 hours of work in the image field, along with other documentation.
You also must sit for the AICI CIC Exam, which tests your knowledge of topics in the image field.

, When it comes to starting any kind of business, an online presence is a must because most prospective clients will start their search online. Create a website that contains contact information, your portfolio, bio, and client testimonials if possible. You should also establish Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media accounts to help promote your image consultancy business.It’s a good idea to start a blog that focuses on image consultancy issues and tips. It can help you seem like an authority in the field.

, While a lot of people search for businesses online, some connections are still made by word of mouth. That’s why it’s a good idea to have business cards that you can pass out to potential clients. You might meet them at your other job, so it helps to have a card with all your contact info to pass on. You should also give some cards to your strategic partners, so they can give them to potential clients.Include your website and social media account information on your cards, so potential clients can check you out online.

Don't be condescending, but don't be too serious.,
Know your audience.,
If they do something bad, guilt them.,
Start out stricter.,
They will figure out your faults.",How to Be an Outstanding Teacher," If you start, in a syrupy sweet voice, say, ""that's right honey! Good job!"" to middle schoolers, you don't want to know the mocking you'll get. If you get in there and start with, ""I don't allow nonsense in this classroom. So don't even think about trying anything,"" because that's a lot of what makes kids ""try stuff."" they defy authority because they want attention.;
, If you've got pre-k, use that syrupy voice. You get elementary, be the fun teacher. You get middle school, try to be on their level. This sounds weird, but with 5th grade and above, use the word, ""crap"" once in a while. Every teacher I know who said it got credit. Not too much though. If you get high school, really help them individually. Tell embarrassing stories about yourself. It makes you look confident and cool.

, Example: let's say you let them talk for awhile after a test and someone starts yelling. Instead of scolding them, which will just make them assume that gets them attention which is what they want, you could say, ""Not cool. I was giving you guys a privilege and (child's name), you don't seem to find enough for you, so you can go out in the hall and yell until you are ready to take what you can get."". If that's not your style, just, in the middle of a lesson quite nonchalantly saying, ""out."" you'll probably get, ""what!?"" so repeat yourself.

, If you start off as that teacher who let's everyone do what they want, they'll love you. Until you snap and become the really unnecessarily mean teacher. Just let them ease into comfort. Carry out your threats. Don't threaten to take away recess three times a week if you never do or will.

, You cannot hide to them how they can get around your rules, so make them not have to use that. Point it out to them that you know what they are trying to do (if you do.) say things that show your imperfection. Say you know the lesson is boring. Let them know you aren't just a robot programmed to gab on and on. Be yourself. Children say some profane and vulgar things behind adults backs, so don't feel like you have to put on an act.

Have Empathy.,
Develop a Positive Mental Attitude.,
'Grow' your Verbal Skills.,
Show Respect.,
Remember that your students are Individuals.,
Know that teaching is a noble profession.",How to Be an Inspirational Teacher," Probably the greatest quality a teacher can have. Creating empathy is about bonding with your students. Cry with them, laugh with them. Try to be on their wavelength. Get to know their emotions and understand their feelings. Young people are easily stressed and sometimes under great pressure, but all you might see is anger, aggression, bad attitude or impatience. At this time you need to be compassionate and understand some bad stuff is going on in their lives. Search for the real person underneath and when you find them they will open up to you.;
, Teachers are human like anyone else; however, the stresses of working with young people especially those with attitudinal and behavioural problems can sometimes be immense. This is the time you need to be strong. To keep a smile on your face when things get tough. To see the bright side of things. To seek to find the positive in every negative situation. To be philosophical. Why? Because your attitude is contagious. You have the choice to bring a light into your classroom or cast a shadow.

, Every great teacher is a great orator. If you can keep your students focused and interested just by talking to them then you are doing a great job. When was the last time you spoke about something and you could hear a pin drop? 'Just talking to them' means using passion, emotion, great eye contact, animated body language, voice modulation and feeling. Talk with conviction. Believe in what you say. Take your students on a wonderful journey every day.

, Respect every human being that is in your classroom. Talk to them like you would talk to your closest friends. No one is more important in this world than anyone else. A great inspirational teacher is a human being who respects everyone no matter their attitude, colour, religion, creed or country. Every one of your students has a place on this earth. You can help them make a positive impact on it too. You have the power to change their lives. The Law of Reciprocity (you reap what you sow) will ensure that the respect you give out will come back to you a hundredfold.

, Know your students inside and out. Do not pick on reward/punishment for all students, because they are all different individuals. Talk to your students and be involved in their lives. Use different teaching styles and strategies within the classroom, because everyone learns differently. Have options for big projects or presentations within your class. Most importantly, let your students be creative, do not limit them. Also, do not judge them. Do not have your own thoughts about them before they walk in your room, or after they leave. Look for the deeper meaning behind actions, instead of getting angry or upset.

, The day a teacher realizes that they have been given a great gift - the power to change lives, is the day an inspirational teacher is born. You have a choice either to believe you are a mediocre teacher teaching a boring subject to boring kids. Or, a human being helping other human beings to realize their full potential and go on and make a positive difference in their world. Your beliefs create your world.

Plan your lessons carefully.,
Plan for a variety of learning styles.,
Create a sense of order.,
Use a starter task.,
Share your learning objectives with your pupils.,
Give clear success criteria for tasks.,
Use a variety of assessment methods - teacher assessment is great, but don't neglect peer and self-assessment.

,
Give the lesson pace - motivate pupils and move them on.,
Praise, praise, praise!,
Ask pupils what they have learned at the end, and listen to them.

",How to Be an Excellent Teacher," Start with what you want them to learn, not what you want them to do. Lessons should always have a central learning objective, and any activities you plan should be focused on achieving this aim. So start with, ""I want the children to learn that..."" and then decide what they will do.;
, One simple way to think about this is VAK. You can (very crudely) divide learning styles into three parts: Visual learners who learn by seeing, auditory learners who learn by listening, and kinesthetic learners who make associations by doing something. Have something for everyone in your lesson.

, Decide upon classroom routines and stick to them. Do you want children to line up outside or come straight in to your classroom? Where should their bags and coats go? Do you want them to stand behind their chairs before they leave? Once you have established the routine, stick to it! Children appreciate this more than you think - especially children with special needs. Autistic children, blind children, children with behavioral challenges, et cetera, will all do better if they know what is supposed to happen.

, Get pupils used to the idea that there will be a 5 minute task for them to do straight away when they come in to your classroom. Make it fun and stimulating, with a time limit to not let it drag on.

, They must be very clear about what you want them to learn. Write the learning objective on the board in child friendly language. Refer to it throughout the lesson and return to it at the end. Learning objectives should be framed in language like: ""Our Learning objective is to... discover how, explore, learn, revise, reflect on, think about, discuss, develop...""

, Children want to know exactly what you want them to do, and how they will be assessed! Ideally the success criteria should rise from the learning objectives in the lessons building up to the task - that way there are no surprises. The children should actually be able to work out what the success criteria are! Sometimes it is appropriate to let students nominate their own success criteria.

,, Put time limits on activities and watch for the ""fidget factor"". If your pupils are bored, change the activity type. Switch between learning styles to keep everyone on their toes! Remember that kids like to be challenged - they don't want to be patronized with easy stuff - give them something to get their teeth into.

, Tell the children what they are doing right - praise them for it and try your best to minimize the attention you give to unwanted behaviour. Kids like to know when they are doing what you want.

Be sincere.,
Show interest in your students’ activities.,
Be passionate.,
Laugh with your students.,
Create a welcoming environment.,
Be consistent.,
Approach students on their level.,
Set high expectations.,
Show them respect.,
Leave them alone.",How to Be Loved by Kindergarten Students," It’s important to be genuine in your desire to have a good relationship with your students. Kindergarten students, like all young children, can detect insincerity and it will make them feel distrustful.Hopefully you’re genuinely excited about teaching kindergarten. If so, share that genuine excitement with your students when you speak with them one-on-one by telling them how excited you are to see them. For example, when a student comes through the door in the morning, say, “It’s so great to see you again!”
Don’t be afraid to tell your students you’re having a bad day. The kids will pick up on your attitude anyway, so you should clearly communicate to them why you might not seem excited on a particular day. The kids will appreciate your sincerity and it will make them feel close to you. For example, if you’ve recently lost a loved one don’t hide it from your students. Instead, share it with them in an age-appropriate way by saying, for example, “My mother recently passed so I’m feeling sad today.”;
, Whether it’s something they learn in class or an extracurricular activity they’re excited about, you should show interest in you kindergarteners’ lives by asking them questions and getting excited about their excitement.If your students know that you’re excited about and interested in their lives, they will share things will you more often, which will foster a close relationship.
Show and tell is a good opportunity to show interest in your students’ lives. You should also ask them about their weekend or summer plans. For example, you might ask, “What adventures did you have this weekend?”
Try to learn at least one thing or activity that each of your students’ is interested in. Ask them about it on a regular basis. Do some research on the topic on your own so you can share in your students’ interest. For example, if one your students likes to fish, learn a little bit about fishing so you can have a conversation about it.

, Not only do students learn better when their teachers are passionate, they also like passionate teachers more. If you’re passionate and excited about a topic you’re teaching, your kindergarteners will feel passionate and excited too.Make learning fun! Try dressing up as a character when you’re teaching a particular historical period. For example, if you’re teaching your students about the discovery of electricity, dress up like Ben Franklin and bring a kite into the classroom.
Passion is especially important with lessons that require a lot of concentration. If your students get bored with a math lesson, find a way to explain how math is what allows spaceships to go to the moon and smartphones to display all of the games kids love to play., Kindergarteners love to laugh and they will feel closer to you if you get make them laugh on a regular basis. Try to incorporate humor into every lesson.Smile often when you interact with your students. Kindergarteners will mimic the facial expressions they see, so if you’re smiling and laughing they will likely smile and laugh with you.
If the workbooks you use don’t have much humor in them, make your own handouts that incorporate cartoon characters or funny jokes that the kids will recognize.
Laughing with your students is also a good teaching opportunity. Kindergarteners will laugh at just about anything, and sometimes they laugh at things that shouldn’t laughed at. Teaching your students the boundaries of laughter will make them like you and may also help protect some of your students from being laughed at or bullied.

, If your kindergarteners don’t feel comfortable in your classroom they won’t feel comfortable around you. Set up you classroom so your students feel at home. Make it warm and inviting.Have fun, upbeat music playing when your kindergarteners arrive in the morning. This will make them feel safe and comfortable right from the get-go.
Keep a classroom pet, such as a gerbil, or at least a stuffed animal. Your kindergarteners will enjoy taking care of the pet with you. If you have a stuffed animal, your kindergarteners will appreciate being able to squeeze it when they’re having a bad day.
Trying setting up a bulletin board for your students to use to share their events and ideas. Kindergarteners love to share their experiences with others—but they need a outlet to do so. A bulletin board gives them an outlet to write about their upcoming trip or their uncle who visited from out of town over the weekend.
Create special bags for each of your students on the first day of class. Write the students’ names on the bags and fill them supplies like a journal with the student’s name on it and different colored markers.
Keep supplies organized so the kids can find them easily. Your kindergarteners will feel more secure knowing where everything is. Label plastic tubs with “markers,” “paints,” “paper,” and other supplies.

, If your kindergarteners can rely on you, they will find it easier to like you. Your kindergarteners will feel more open and willing to like you if you are reliable and provide a stable classroom environment.If you say you’re going to do something, do it. If you tell your students that tomorrow will be a special “all day art” day, don’t forget to pick up art supplies before class.
Support your students consistently. If you’re warm and supportive of a student one day but give them the cold shoulder the next day, the student will likely come to distrust you.
Have a daily schedule and stick to it as much as possible. Kindergarteners feel safe and comfortable with routines. Let them know ahead of time what the day will look like and stick with the plan.

, Kindergarteners come to school with a wide range of knowledge and skills. Make time to help students who are struggling with specific material.If a student is having a hard time with math, let them know that it’s OK to be behind other students. Listen to the students concerns, acknowledge their frustration, and be patient. For example, you might say to the student, “Everyone learns at their own pace. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better about this subject?”
If a student has mental or emotional difficulties, don’t ostracize them. Talk to the student’s parents or a school counselor to find out how best to help the student while still including them in group activities.

, Kindergarteners will thrive if you challenge them and give the opportunity to rise to the occasion. They will like and respect you if you hold them to their highest potential instead of letting them off the hook when they fall short.If you assign homework, tell your students they’re expected to get it in by a particular date. If a student misses the deadline, don’t shame them, but tell them you believe that they can do better. Don’t forget to ask them how you can help them get their homework in on time the next time.
Make sure you set attainable goals. Remember, they’re kindergarteners! You want to challenge them so they strive hard, but you don’t want to set goals that will inevitably leave them feeling disappointed. For example, if you’re teaching your students vocabulary, ask them to learn two new words each week and use them in a sentence. Don’t ask them to learn twenty new words.

, You're the adult and your students will naturally look up to you and show you respect. It’s important that you respect your students as well. Respect shows your students that they are individual people who are worthy of respect and responsible for their own behavior.If a student has a fear of talking in class, don’t force them to talk. It may be that the student is just shy and needs encouragement; or it may be that the student really doesn’t like talking in class. Talk to the student and respect their choices.
If a student acts out in class or bullies another student, hold the child responsible. Make them know that you respect them too much to let them get away with acting in harmful ways. For example, you might say, “When you bully someone you make them hurt inside. I don’t think you really want to hurt anyone, so let’s try an activity where tomorrow you tell the student you bullied something good about them.”

, As a teacher, one of your greatest responsibilities is looking after your kids and helping them. However, sometimes kids need to figure things out on their own. Letting your kindergarteners struggle to come up with their own answers sometimes can help them develop a healthy sense of self-worth and independence.If a child is struggling with a math problem, don’t jump in right away and tell them how to do it. Let their wheels turn for a while and only help them if they really get stuck.
If two students get into a verbal conflict, don’t feel the need to immediately jump in. See how they handle the situation. If they resolve it on their own, praise them for showing good judgment. Of course, if the conflict is physical you should step in right away so no one gets hurt.

Know your subject area.,
Make lesson plans.,
Teach what you came to teach.,
Asses student comprehension.",How to Be a Tutor1," Aim to teach the subjects you know best. You are more likely to get hired to help someone with their essays and reading comprehension if you are an English Major, for instance. If you are hired to teach something you are not an expert in, get to know it.If you are teaching something you have a strong personal knowledge of but have never learned in school, such as your own first language, take some time to study academic literature, lesson plans, and the rules your student must learn.
If you are teaching your favorite thing, understand that your student may be struggling to understand it and may therefore not share your enthusiasm.;
, Plan out each session ahead of time. Each lesson should include review of the previous lesson, introduction of a learning objective, and activities to help students practice applying what they have learned.Start with easier material, and make sure the student understands it before you move on.
Let them do the parts they seem to understand without interfering.
Move in to support them when they struggle with more difficult tasks.
Guide students towards answers, but do not give them before the student has worked them out on their own.
If a lesson doesn't go as planned, re-plan. Repeat tasks and take new angles on material that is harder for your student to learn.

, Don't try to cover everything that comes up during class. Do not try to correct every mistake that your student makes. You can quickly overwhelm a student with information. Instead, take note of mistakes, but focus on your lesson goals.If you are teaching English or a second language, never correct your student's grammar while they speak. Instead, model correct language usage.

, Ask your student to demonstrate what they have learned with you. Give quizzes, ask for verbal summaries, and check their work. You can also ask to be shown current test scores and completed class work to see if your student is demonstrating their knowledge outside of tutoring sessions.If a student does not seem to be absorbing the material, go back and re-explain from a different angle. Try starting further back, so your student can build up to the new material.
If your student is getting teary, frustrated, or seems blocked, switch activities or give them a break.

Build a personal relationship with your students.,
Personalize the lesson.,
Come energetic and upbeat.",How to Be a Tutor2," Students learn more effectively when they feel a friendly connection with their tutor. Build this rapport by greeting your student with a friendly smile, asking how they are doing, and truly listening to their answer. Take everything they say seriously, and respond thoughtfully.This doesn't mean that you should chat through your whole session. It just means that you should show interest in your student as a person, and let them see you as a person as well.

, Once you know your student better, you can tailor lessons to their interests and abilities. Start out by asking your student what they know about the subject. Listen for gaps—this is where you'll begin to fill in material they'll need to know.Involve your student's interests in your lesson. For instance, if your student is really excited about a sports team, you can use that team's financial struggles as the basis for your math lesson.
If you notice your student responds better to certain kinds of teaching, such as talking, reading, or hands-on practice, you can modify your lesson plans to favor this.

, Come in every day and make it very clear that you want to be there, you want to teach them the subject at hand, and that you know they can learn the material. Have confidence in yourself as a tutor, and have confidence in them that they will learn grow during the session.


Make sure you thoroughly understand the material your student is learning even if it is not obviously interesting. If you pay attention to how something works, you will gain interest in it.

Get hired by a tutoring company.,
Consider tutoring online.,
Advertise yourself independently.,
Figure out how much to charge.",How to Be a Tutor3," Tutoring companies can set you up with regular clients or with a small group. They will take a portion of the students' fees, but they may also pay wages and may be able to charge more per hour based on reputation. Some tutoring companies have a center with classrooms or cubicles, while others will send you on home visits.


Consider test prep tutoring. If you don't mind covering highly standardized material, you can find regular work as a standardized test prep tutor. Many companies specialize in preparing students for tests like the SATs, ACT, TOEFL, and other tests.
Look on job boards for tutoring company advertisements.

, Many students are looking for tutoring in subjects that are less available where they live. This includes students abroad, students in rural areas, homeschooled students, and students who can't easily leave the house.


Look on job boards or google ""online tutoring"" to find companies that will let you advertise your services.

, Make a profile on websites that showcase tutors. Make a flier advertising what you are willing to teach—be specific! If you say you can take any age and any subject, you'll sound unfocused. Say what ages you have experience with, what subjects you have tutored, and what metro area you are willing to work in. Include your contact information!


You might say ""Tutor: Elementary English-French-History-Creative Writing. I have three years of experience as a TA and tutor for 3-5th graders. I am up to date on student learning standards in this range. I'm also great at making learning fun.""
Contact local schools to offer tutoring services.
If you're in school, get in touch with your campus Writing Center or Learning Lab and ask about tutoring opportunities. Most schools hire student tutors to work with their peers.
Contact friends you know who are teachers or who know people who might be potential clients of yours.

, Tutors in different areas charge wildly different rates. Ask other tutors who do more or less what you want to do what they charge. Ask multiple people to get a clear sense. Check places where tutors in your area advertise as well.You may charge more for extra experience or expertise in a subject. For instance, if you graduated college with a degree in computer science, you should charge more than a self-taught high school student.
You don't necessarily have to advertise your rate. You can wait for your clients to make an offer, but you should have a rate in your head that you won't go below.

Communicate with parents and teachers.,
Use incentives.,
Give your students opportunities to move.,
Get experience with kids.",How to Be a Tutor4," If you have been hired by a family, your student's parent likely have specific learning goals for their children. They may be able to communicate with you what the concepts are that their child has been struggling with. If you are working for a school, speak with the subject or classroom teacher and get informed on what the classroom is working on, what the student is struggling with, and things the teacher things your student might respond to. Stay in communication with the parents and teacher of your student, so that you call update one another on milestones and roadblocks.If you are working for elementary and secondary students, keep up with the learning standards of their grade. You can usually find out what the Learning Standards are for each grade on the school district website.

, Some students will be motivated to do well just by a desire to please their parents, their teacher, you, or themselves. Others will need some encouragement. Praise good work to encourage them, and give a little praise for good effort as well.Smaller students respond well to stickers that signify the completion of a lesson or a task.
Older students might enjoy greater responsibility or a change of routine. You might tutor them outside for one session if they achieve a certain improvement in their grade, for instance.
Some students will be incentivized if you let them set the learning goals for each lesson with you.
Some students want you to be in control of their learning, but will feel rewarded if you explain what they have learned and how that has affected what you are going to teach them next.

, Children, especially small children, need to move. Transition activities every 15-20 minutes, and provide movement breaks and a few minutes for free play every 45 minutes or when needed. If you only tutor your student for half an hour or so, you can just give them breaks as needed. If they need to move but your time is limited, try switching locations or give your students a short but intense physical movement break.Offer regular opportunities for dancing, jumping on a trampoline, running around the yard, or doing some quick pushups.
Let the student cue you when they need to move. They may ask to get a glass of water, to go to the bathroom, or to get something to show you from their room.
Watch for squirming, kicking, head-in-hands—this could mean a student has physical energy that is distracting them.
Some students may prefer to work standing up or sitting on the floor.

, One way you can gain experience is by volunteering as a tutor. Contact local schools or family friends and volunteer to take on short-term tutoring projects. Get in touch with your local library-they may have a volunteer program for reading buddies or some other low-key tutoring experience.


Set up a language exchange with someone who speaks a language you are learning. You can take turns tutoring one another.

Introduce yourself to both the parent and student.,
Find out what kind of learner the child is (visual, auditory, kinesthetic or a combination of these) and teach according to how they learn (e.g: visual learners like diagrams and charts, auditory learners benefit from discussion and word games, and kinesthetic ones need movement and hands on experiences to remember ideas and concepts).

,
Start by checking what level the child is at with their writing by giving them a few activities (e.g: for English - a description of the last dream they had, a list of pro/cons about having school uniforms, or an essay structure for an analysis of three major themes in a novel).

,
When the child brings you a school assignment, go through the criteria sheet with a highlighter.,
Don't do the assignment for them!,
Make sure that the parent and student are both aware that the grades they receive at school might not always indicate how much they have progressed.,
You'll often find yourself putting in the extra hours for students.",How to Be a Successful Tutor," Make sure you are confident and welcoming, making both people feel comfortable with your services. It is important to communicate expectations and goals at the very beginning of your job, so that everyone's voice is being heard. Allow the child and parent to have a discussion with you about the areas in which the child experiences struggles or successes. For example, they may have a fantastic vocabulary, but have difficulty with sentence structure.;
,,, This way, both you and your student know exactly what the teacher is looking for.

, I know this sounds pretty obvious, but some students can often become dependent on their tutor or parent to do their work for them out of fear of making mistakes. Make sure you are gradually doing less and less work for the child. Tutoring/teaching is all about allowing the student to become a life-long learner who can sustain their own independent learning practice.

, If the student started working with you when they were receiving mainly low grades, it is unfair to expect instantly high grades after only a few tutoring sessions. This being said, always make sure your student receives praise for the progress they are making, and allow them to reflect on their own learning practice.

, That comes with the profession. So, if you want to get paid for everything you do, you should probably find yourself an office job in a big soul-destroying company. Teaching/tutoring is about providing help wherever and whenever it is needed; even if you don't always get some sort of financial reward. It's a good idea to share a professional email with your student for editing and feedback purposes. This could even be the parent's email address.

If you do not have a high school diploma, you can obtain a high school equivalency credential by taking the GED exam.Sign up for test-prep classes through your local community college or technical college to prepare you for the GED exam.
The GED Testing Service also offers low-cost and free practice tests and tutorials online.;
, Once you have your GED, you can either obtain an associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree in ECE to become a preschool teacher. However, many public schools require that their teachers have a bachelor’s degree or higher in ECE to be a preschool teacher.Teachers in private schools or daycare settings may only be required to have an associate’s degree in ECE. A certificate is also a typical requirement to be a preschool teacher in private schools.Preschool teachers working in public school programs, like Head Start, may only be required to have an associate’s degree and experience working with children. However, most have a bachelor’s degree in ECE., Certification for preschool teachers in public schools includes passing state certification exams after the completion of a bachelor’s degree. In order to earn the Child Development Associate (CDA) certificate, a candidate must have a high school diploma or equivalent, have completed 480 hours of experience working with children, and 120 hours or more of formal education.Some states accept the National Child Care Association’s Certified Childcare Professional credential if a candidate does not hold a college degree, or has a college degree in a field unrelated to childhood education. Look into your state’s requirements for teaching preschool children., To maintain your CDA certification, you will need to continue your education. If you work in a private school setting or a childcare center, you will need to keep your first aid certification up-to-date, demonstrate active teaching practice, and have a membership in an approved organization for childcare professionals.Public school preschool teachers are required to participate in professional development hours during each renewal period to maintain their certification., You can gain the necessary experience to work with children by babysitting, tutoring, and by working at a day care or as an assistant in a preschool program. Offer to babysit or tutor friends', family members', or neighbors' children. You can also find babysitting and tutoring jobs through Internet job sites, like Craigslist or Indeed.Try contacting schools in your area to see if tutoring opportunities are available.
Preschool programs usually require teaching assistants to have either an associate's degree, or be in the process of completing a bachelor's degree.

, Apply for jobs at public, private, and charter schools. Make sure to check the qualifications before you apply. Most public schools and charter schools require teachers to hold a bachelor's degree and have the CDA certificate. On the other hand, private schools may only require you to have an associate's degree, as well as certification.

, Attend back-to-school job fairs for pre-k and elementary school teachers. You can search for local job fairs by visiting your local school district office, or by visiting school's websites. School websites sometimes post job openings and dates for upcoming job fairs.You can also contact your local chamber of commerce to obtain a list of preschools in your area.
You can also visit the websites of the biggest companies in your city. These companies sometimes offer daycare facilities to their employees, and may have job openings.

, Monster, Indeed, and Glassdoor are just a few examples of websites that regularly post preschool teaching jobs. You can also register with an employment agency that specializes in finding jobs for people in the educational sector, for example Earlychildhoodteacher.org., Write a two to three sentence personal summary at the top of your resume that briefly outlines who you are, your experience, and your goals. The next section should outline your academic qualifications, i.e., your degrees and certifications. Then, state each employer with a list that outlines your duties and responsibilities. After your work experience section, list key skills and competencies, like communication skills, creativity, organizational skills, and patience, for example.Ask for recommendations from previous jobs. Ask the parents of children you have either babysat or tutored for a personal recommendation. You can also ask the head teacher or leader of a daycare program or preschool you worked at for a professional recommendation., Common questions that an interviewer might ask are: ""Can you tell me about yourself?"" ""If I were to walk into your classroom during a math or reading activity, what would I see?"" ""What are some of your positive guidance strategies?"" ""How will you communicate with families? and ""What makes you the best candidate?""Write-up and memorize your answers to these questions, then practice in front of the mirror.
Some interviews might have multiple rounds. If you are called in for a second interview, you might have to demonstrate how you work with children, or come up with a sample lesson plan.

, A preschool classroom needs to be engaging, organized, fun, and safe. Divide the classroom into centers, and organize the children by groups. This way the children can rotate between centers.You can paste pictures, letters, and numbers on the walls. Also, post signs denoting the name of each center.


Some examples of classroom centers are writing, math, science, arts and crafts, reading, building, and free playing centers. Try to avoid putting active centers, like arts and crafts, next to more quiet centers, like reading centers.Also, label the groups by colors so that the children can easily remember which group they belong to.

, Keep your lesson plans simple and structured. They should cater to the age group you are teaching. Effective preschool lesson plans are ones that involve the children in various, fun activities. For example, familiarize the children with the ABC’s by asking them to act out the animal the letter starts with. If it is the letter C, ask children to act or imitate a cat.Each state has their own guidelines and requirements for creating a preschool curriculum. You can find these guidelines in your state's Department of Education website. However, the basic requirements are that you create a curriculum that provides age-appropriate enrichment, development, and proficiency., Routines help children feel safe and comfortable. They will know what to expect every day, which provides a sense of comfort. A routine will also help you to be organized and stay on task. Therefore, establish a morning routine, as well as an afternoon routine. The time you spend on one activity might change from one day to the next, but the order of the activities and what you do during the activity should stay the same.For example, the morning could consist of circle time and story time, while the afternoon consists of lunch, nap time, and centers.
Each day can have a different routine, but try to keep it minimal. For example, three different routines for the whole week.

, Maintain good relationships with your coworkers by communicating with them frequently about important information and concerns. Be open and honest about who you are, and try to find common interests between you and your coworkers.


For example, perhaps you and a coworker both have a dog. This could be a common point of interest that might develop you and your coworker's relationship.
Try inviting your coworker out to lunch. If they decline, don't take it personally.

Encourage your students.,
Establish boundaries for you and your students to follow outside of the classroom.",How to Be a Successful Teacher," For teachers, few experiences are less enjoyable than staying up late the night before a class, preparing the readings or assignments that your students will complete the next day. Keep your work organized, and plan each lesson ahead of time.It helps to have written lesson plans. At the beginning of each week, write down your lesson plan for each class you will teach.
Do your class preparation (writing assignments and quizzes, preparing videos, etc.) at the beginning of the week as well.
Monthly calendars are often helpful for a “big picture” approach. Preparing a detailed calendar a month or two in advance will help you schedule the various segments of the course you’re teaching.
If you’re teaching at the high school or college level, consider sharing the calendar with your students (even if the calendar will change slightly as the course develops).;
, Many inexperienced teachers find themselves quickly bogged down in grading seemingly endless papers and tests. To avoid this, figure out when during the week you have time to grade, and break the total amount of weekly grading down into manageable pieces.It helps to use a timer when grading. For example, give yourself 15 minutes to grade each essay, and 5 minutes to grade each quiz.

, While you do not need to always use the newest, most trendy teaching technique or teach from your students’ favorite website, it will help both you and your students if you use some technology in the classroom.Students quickly become tired of repetitive class structures and lectures. Using technology could mean:


Create a Powerpoint or Prezi to convey information.
Show your students a short, relevant film or video that will spark classroom discussion.
There are even phone-based learning apps that instructors can incorporate into new lessons.

, This will allow you to accommodate different learning styles. Although you, as a teacher, may have a favorite way of teaching your students, consider that various students may learn better through other methods, including verbal instruction, reading texts, conversation, and hands-on experience. Experiment with different teaching techniques:


Skip the lecture, and instead help your students learn with an active group activity.
Bring in tangible objects, related to the lesson, that your students can interact with and learn from.
In discussions, provide a mixture of abstract thoughts and practical examples.
Take your students on a field trip—even in college!

, Part of the pleasure of teaching students is that, along with sparking their curiosity to learn, you can remind yourself of the pleasure of learning as well. You can allow your teaching to maintain your own academic and personal interests in the subject matter of your classes.If you’re permitted, make small changes to your teaching materials and assignments each year; this will keep the material fresh for you and make it more enjoyable for your students.

, It’s important to show your students that there are specific guidelines that they need to follow in your classroom. Clearly state these policies on your syllabus, and expect your students to follow the policies. For example, consider:


Will you allow students to use their cell phones while in class?
Can students take notes on a laptop computer or tablet?
How many times can a student arrive late before they lose points?
Although some of these may be school-wide policies that you have no control over, you should still enforce and follow through on them.

, While teachers should not be seen as authoritarian, it’s important that you do act with authority. Show that you are effectively leading the class by explaining the daily class schedule ahead of time, and keeping the class focused on the lesson.


Be clear that when you are speaking, all student conversation needs to stop.
Don’t hesitate to call out individual students; say something like, “Please don’t speak over me, and raise your hand if you have a question.”
Politely but firmly insist that students put away their phones, and computers as well, if your students are browsing the internet rather than taking notes.

, The way you dress and act plays a large roll in how you are seen by your students. Both men and women—especially teachers in their 20s—should dress professionally.


Wear a jacket, a shirt and tie; wear a dress or skirt to look more professional and, consequently, more authoritative.

, This should be a standard part of your lesson planning. It’s better to plan too many activities for any given class period than too few. If you have an extra activity, save it for a day when you get through your lesson more quickly than anticipated.


Aim for each activity to take about 25 minutes. This will give you a rough estimate of how many activities you can plan in a class period. If you have a 50 minute class period, plan on two major activities.
Have your students complete a quiz and then participate in a group discussion. Or, for younger students, ask them to complete a hands-on activity in a group, then individually write a summary of what they learned.
Don’t plan to improvise or change plans in the middle of class.

, One of the most challenging parts of teaching—especially for new teachers—is showing confidence in front of a classroom full of strangers. Even if you don’t feel confident at first, fake it—students usually can’t tell the difference, and your classroom successes will turn into genuine confidence soon enough.


Use occasional humor in the classroom. Humor can often show confidence; it makes you look like you are in control of a situation if you can inject occasional humor.Show confidence by your physical presence. Don’t huddle in a corner of the classroom. During every class period, stand up, move around, gesture with your arms, and write on the whiteboard. These motions will make you appear confident and dynamic.

, Students enjoy and expect feedback from their teachers; it shows that you are personally evaluating their work, and that you have firm standards in place.When grading a student’s essay, try leaving four or five comments on the body of the essay, and then a three to four sentence paragraph at the end, where you detail the major successes and failures of the essay.
Give your students verbal feedback in class. Encourage their comments, and gently push them to develop more complex ideas and solutions.

,


Your student will, in turn, have a greater respect for you if it’s clear that you know his or her name and care about his or her education.

, Showing your students respect and kindness should be a guiding principle when you engage with your students.


This is true in all settings in which you communicate with students: in the classroom, in your office hours, over email, or in any other manner.
Listen when they speak and do not speak over a student.

, It can be easy for teachers to forget that their students have a life outside of the class & required homework. However, you need to remember that many students have busy schedules and complicated personal lives.


If students claim to have had a health problem or family emergency, evaluate their claim with objectivity.

, Many students see their teachers primarily as disciplinarians; they view a teacher as someone who punishes them for doing poorly on an assignment or for speaking out of turn in class.Contrary to this, through your own enthusiasm for the class topic and the materials that you are teaching, you should encourage and inspire your students to learn about the class topic.


Praise students individually and collectively for their work.
Find aspects of the class work that each student engages with, and encourage the students to develop their own interests within the class.

, Many inexperienced teachers plan to befriend their students, and to treat them like friends outside the classroom. This can lead to encounters that may appear unprofessional, and a lack of a formal relationship between you and your students.

#* Make it clear to students how they can contact you. For example, give them your email address, but avoid handing out your cell phone number.

Be clear with your students about how long it will take for you to reply to their emails. Will you try to reply within the same hour, or within a 24-hour period?
Avoid meeting with students off campus. If you must, meet at a coffee shop; avoid meeting in places that serve alcohol, as it could send a misleading message.

If you don’t approach teaching with the right skill set and attitude, you will not enjoy the job, and have difficulty getting work.Enjoy being around children. Teaching young kids isn’t for everyone, so you’ll need to be prepared to spend your whole day with them. Children aren't always the clearest at explaining themselves. You will need to be a good listener, and able to understand their perspective and what they are trying to say.
Have good organizational and time management skills. These are important not only for governing yourself, but also helping to pass them on to your students.
Be attentive. Especially when working with young children, you need to be able to pay attention and predict dangerous situations, keeping an eye out for their safety.
You will need imagination and creativity to get in touch with your students, and make them want to learn.
If you have additional skill in an outside area of knowledge, like music, art, or sport, that will give you another advantage in applying for jobs and reaching your students.;
, Primary schools around the world are usually divided into several stages based on age that follow national and local curriculum standards. You’ve probably already decided what ages you are most comfortable working with, but it is good to know when you start looking and applying for jobs., All teachers need an undergraduate degree from an accredited higher education provider in your country of residence. If you want to teach at the primary school level, majoring in Education or getting a bachelor of education degree (BEd) is the best program for when you start school.You can certainly study other subjects in college. Degrees in specific subject areas that you will cover as a teacher, like English, science, or mathematics, will increase your chances of being selected for postgraduate courses. Application committees will examine other degrees to see if they are relevant to teaching primary-age students.

, Before you start a teacher training program, you may need to take a fitness exam. If you have a learning disability, this is a good place to list it or find out, as most programs will be able to adjust the learning and examination style to account for this., Most countries around the world require additional certification before becoming a teacher for any grade. Requirements and programs for certification vary as depending on where you live, so make sure you are familiar with national and regional laws. If you aren’t certified, or in the process of getting certified, schools won’t hire you.


In the United States, each state controls requirements for teacher certification, and those will vary depending on the state. In each case, the state will expect you to demonstrate an understanding of the state’s subject material standards, as well as best practices for teaching young children.In the United Kingdom, Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) is necessary to be hired as a teacher. In Scotland, the same rank is referred to as a Teaching Qualification (TQ). The easiest way to get QTS is to get a BEd or BA/BSc with QTS. If you did not do that in college, you will need a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE). You can receive this through a graduate school, School-Centered Initial Teacher Training (SCITT), or the Teach First programme., Once you have finished coursework, you will need to pass a government issued skills tests in your subject area. In addition to testing your knowledge of the subject matter, you will also be asked questions that deal with the teaching profession, as well as analyze real information you will encounter in the classroom., Before you enter teacher training, you will need some time in the classroom. There really is no substitute for time in the classroom when preparing for a teacher career. Most degree or certificate programs will provide experience as part of their training, and every bit you can get before starting will make you a more attractive candidate.


One good way to get some classroom experience is to volunteer in local schools. In addition to showing your desire to become a teacher, it can also give you additional experiences to reference when you apply for a job. Talk to your local school and see if they will let you shadow a teacher, or volunteer as an unofficial classroom assistant.If you can’t get to a school to volunteer, there are other areas you can work with young children that will give you good experiences you can translate to the classroom. These include mentoring, summer play and camps, Scouting, and Sunday schools., Once you know what kind of job you would like to have, you will need to get hired by a school. Teaching positions are advertised in the usual places, including in the local papers and online job sites. In addition, you can also learn about job openings through word of mouth.If you are interested in working in a particular school district, their website would be a good place to look for specific openings they might have.
The more flexible you can be with your location, the more jobs will be open to you. To maximize your chances, you will need to be willing to move to a variety of places to land a primary school teaching job.
If you achieved QTS through a SCITT program, chances are the school was training you for a specific position, so you are probably likely to get that job, at least as a career-starter.
Because of the higher staff turnover, there will likely be more jobs available in inner city schools.

, Before getting hired you will need to interview with people at the school. Think of it as an opportunity to explain your strengths as a candidate, and how your training and experience will make you a good teacher. With a little preparation, you can be prepared to give good answers to questions interviewers will likely give you.Your interview will probably cover trends and issues in the teaching profession. Make sure you are familiar with the big issues and some of the key buzz words. Research the school you are interviewing at ahead of time to see if there are certain issues important to them, and make sure to mention them while talking to the school.
This is a good opportunity to talk about your past classroom experiences. You don’t want to just list them. Instead, be prepared to explain specific instances that were helpful in developing your philosophy in the classroom, or making you want to become a primary school teacher.
Look for things you like about the school, and find opportunities to bring them up. Even a simple idea like “I really like what you are doing with classroom development, I think it’s a really good idea” can be helpful. It shows that you know something about the school, and tells the interviewers that you would be a good fit for them., Getting hired and starting with a class is just the beginning of your training as a teacher. Most teachers are encouraged to get additional training. This will help them see new trends in educational theory and practice, as well as new programs and technology to help students learn.If you are a newly qualified teacher, that is you only recently passed your exams, you will serve a probationary period. This will involve monitoring and support, and a designated tutor who will help to identify areas for improvement. Following these suggestions will make you a better instructor to your students, and a better colleague to other teachers.
Schools will likely highlight and offer continuing professional development classes based on the position you hold, or any positions you wish to rise to. These classes will usually take place at your school on designated teacher training days, or on off-site training centers.

, In the United States, your teacher certification will regularly come up for renewal. There are a variety of state and federal requirements involving continuing education and professional development in order to maintain your certification. Keep an eye on what you need to do, and make sure you keep up with the standards., You probably got into teaching primary school because you have a passion for working with younger children as they start their education. Make sure your students know that you are there to help them, and that they can approach you with any question or problem.While you will need to enforce discipline, you should ignore silly advice such as “don’t smile until Christmas.” Let your students see your energy and enthusiasm for learning, and they may learn to love it with you., As you create assignments and discipline your class, make sure everyone is clear about what is expected. That way there aren’t any surprises when you give out grades or punishment, and students can learn good behaviors.Make sure you explain your rules and expectations on the first day, and review during the first week. You can even send those rules and expectations home to parents so they are also clear on what you are expecting from the class.Just remember that this is your class. Your students will probably come from a variety of backgrounds and have had many different teachers with different rules before you. That’s fine, but you don’t have to follow those rules if you don’t want to.

, Primary school can be a difficult time for students because not only are they learning new academic material, but they are also learning real organizational skills. Many of them will not know what to do. Take time during class to show students how to organize their materials and keep their desk clean., Teaching is a job that only gets easier with experience. The best resource you will have for resolving student issues are those who have been through it before. Compare notes on individual students, behavioral issues, assignments, projects, or anything else that might improve the classroom experience for both you and your students.You should familiarize yourself with the teachers your students have had in the years before you. Those instructors will have additional insight into behavior, strengths, and weaknesses.
This is also important because the other teachers are your colleagues, the people you will see not just every day, but every school year as well. Having a good relationship with them will make it easier and more fun to come in every day.

, Discipline will be an important part of your day when dealing with school children. Make sure you know and are familiar with your school’s guidelines for dealing with disruptive or unruly students.In most cases, you will be able to deal with discipline issues yourself rather than get administrators involved. This will be tough at first, but can get easier as you see the same kinds of problems, and figure out the best ways to deal with them.

, Your students’ parents will have a strong influence on their ability to do well in school. In addition, they may well know the most about their child’s learning abilities, and other parts of the kid’s personality that you won’t always pick up in the classroom. Getting along well with parents will make your job easier.Regular parent-teacher conferences can be an important part of keeping parents involved with their student’s well being, and giving you an insight into your student’s home life. Instead of just telling the parents about how they are doing in school, make sure you ask about what kids have said about the class, or if there are particular thoughts the parents might have about their child’s progress.Look for regular opportunities to get parents involved with their children. Ask for volunteers for the classroom. It can even be something as simple as standing outside the door when parents arrive for drop-off and pick-up to chat with them briefly, or inviting them into the classroom for a minute after school to see some of their child’s work.

, Not every lesson will be great, and not every student will get all the material perfectly. As a new teacher, you will need experience to guide you for the best ways to reach as many of your students as possible. Don’t let your own self-worth and confidence suffer because of a few bad days.It can also be helpful to remember that you will have successes every day as well. Make sure you take note of them, and reward yourself when they happen.

The better your GPA is, the more college options will be available to you. However, the most important thing is simply for you to graduate successfully.If Home Economics is offered at your high school, be sure to take it.
Other courses that may help you, include: sociology, health, family and consumer studies, and chemistry.;
, There are a number of schools in the United States and Canada that offer majors in family and consumer sciences or home economics. An undergraduate degree in family and consumer science is the best background for becoming a home economics teacher.In the US, these include: Ball State University, Antelope Valley College, Baylor University, and many others.In Canada, these include: University of Prince Edward Island, Carleton University, and others.Select the best school for you by speaking to current students and professors, looking at op-to-date course catalogs and reading about classes, and considering the cost of tuition (and availability of financial aid).

, A four-year degree with a major in home economics, family and consumer sciences, or other majors such as psychology, sociology, or nutrition sciences are good choices in order to be a home economics teacher. Alternatively, you can look for undergraduate teaching programs that offer specializations in home economics at the secondary school level.Before selecting an undergraduate program, visit several campuses to find the right one for you.
Speak to the chair of each department you are considering to get a feel for the program. Inquire about the job placement rates for graduates of each program.
You will need to check to make sure that the teaching program is approved by your state or province to be eligible for state certification.

, A major milestone on the road to becoming a home economics teacher is to earn your bachelor’s degree. In order to do this, you will need to be organized and driven throughout all four years of college. You will need to balance your studies with your social life, and do well on assignments and exams. If you stay focused, you will successfully earn your undergraduate degree.


Consider a minor in a related field, such as psychology, sociology, or nutrition sciences.
Seek out extra-curricular opportunities, such as volunteering with a local high school or working as a research assistant for a university professor.

, In most states and provinces, you will need to earn a teaching certification in addition to your bachelor’s degree. Search for the teacher certification requirements in your state or province to know how you should proceed.


You can research the requirements for US teachers by state on the UK College of Education site.You can research the requirements for Canadian teachers on the Canada Education Network site., If your undergraduate degree was in education, you may have already gained certification. In some locations, you may only need to pass a series of exams to gain certification. In other locations, you may need to enroll in a certification program. In areas that are very short on teachers (such as low-income regions), certification requirements may be waived.Keep in mind that you may someday want to change locations.
Furthermore, certifications that go beyond the bare minimum may make you a more attractive job candidate.

, Once you have determined the requirements for your region, take the necessary steps to achieve them.These steps may include:


Paying the required tuition and/or fees.
Attending class.
Studying and completing assignments.
Passing necessary exams.

, If you would like to teach at the university level, further education will be required. Even if you intend to teach at the high school level, additional education may be desirable. Consider pursuing a Master’s degree or Ph.D. in family and consumer science.Often times, teachers will continue to pursue further education through night school while they teach.

, As part of your professional development, you can join a professional association for home economics teachers. These associations can provide you with support and also help you stay up to date in the latest news and trends in the field of home economics education. Membership in such an organization can provide you with information about job openings, opportunities for continuing education, and eligibility to participate in Home Economics conferences and conventions.


These include state or province-based organizations, such as HETAC (Home Economics Teacher Association of California) or OHEA (Ontario Home Economics Association).
This also includes national organizations, such as AAFCS (the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences).
Perform an internet search for organizations in your area and complete an online application.

, The final step in becoming in a home economics teacher is to find a job. Look in your local newspapers, school district websites, and state teacher certification boards for information on job openings in your area. Don’t forget to also check with your friends who are teachers and colleagues at teacher’s college who can also provide you with information about teaching job openings in home economics or family and consumer science., Review each job call very carefully, and begin putting together the necessary materials. Often this will include things like: a cover letter, a resume (or cv), teaching evaluations (if you have experience teaching), sample teaching materials, and letters of recommendation. Tailor your materials to suit each individual job call, and submit each packet of materials before each closing date.


If you move to the next level, you will likely participate in a phone interview, and then an in-person interview.

Have a unique character.,
Ask for a class opinion.,
Be flexible.,
Make the work you give to students fun.,
Stay in fashion.,
Keep in mind that your students cannot remember everything.,
Know how to console your students.,
Show your passion!,
Earn their respect with discipline.",How to Be a Popular Teacher," This normally only works if you're new, but if you stick to a certain personality that may be mean/angry etc. You will gain respect for it, as long as you're not unjust or act like you're better than your students.;
, Have a discussion with your class about what could make class more interesting, and what would help them. Remember that while you are in charge, everything you do is to try to teach them; so if they complain about something as a group, it's worth looking into. The same things normally come up like listening to music, participation, and eating in class. Listen to their suggestions and compromise.

, Listen to your students! You'll be amazed how much they'll respect you when you do. But don't let the kids rule you, and be careful not to rule them. Remember that, though they are younger, you are all equals. Of course they'll want to take advantage of these fun things, but you still want to maintain control. Do not be overly strict; don't tell them that you'll hold them in after the bell, because it's not only your time, but their time. Remember that your class is most likely not the most important thing to them, and don't act as such. They have busy lives, just like you.

, Any subject can be interesting if done through a game or puzzles. Never waste the students' time by giving busy work. Make sure that your assignment is actually going to teach them something or help them apply class principles in real life. Busy work is a hassle for everyone. Moreover, they will see it it as pointless for you teach something not relevant to the subject you are teaching. No matter what you teach, but especially for math, make sure that you give examples for every type of problem you expect your students to complete.

, While still dressing appropriately for your age and maintaining decorum, keep in touch with fashion to help the students relate to you more. Discussing what's new in trends with your students will give you a better feel for where they're coming from as well.

, Make sure to remind them about things when necessary.

, Be someone who can give advice on solving the students' dilemma. Give respect, and never humiliate a student in front of the class unless the context is a very clear joke. Remember, humiliation offends far more people than just the student in question. Don't draw sticks or cards with student's names on them - this serves no purpose other than to humiliate them. Teach the material, and if they know, they will raise their hands. If they don't, it's your job to show them, so you should just tell them the answers on the sheet or work.

, Stay interested and involved with your work, remember why you became a teacher in the beginning. Your love of a subject and excitement for it can influence your pupils greatly.

, It will be difficult for them to respect you if you cannot keep a handle on your classroom. Once you have shown them you can handle the group, it will be easier to be relaxed and fun with them. Don't be the 'cool' teacher that lets their students get away with murder!

",How to Be a History Professor," Everything has a history and people do scholarly works on that part of the history. Some good examples are :


History of Cooking
History of Mathematics
History of Painting
History of Ceramics
History of Musics;
, For example, to teach the history of music, one should be well familiar with music (though perhaps not as much as an accomplished musician).

, If you are working on the art of painting, as a hobby you can start study history of painting to apply for teaching.


Have a brief study of history of painting from cave paintings to Greeks and Romans,
Ancient Hindi, Chines, Japanese paintings,
Africans and native Americans paintings
Painting in Middle Ages Europe, stained glass painting and story telling of churches, Mosaic paintings of Islamic cultures, Middle Eastern miniatures and Mongols of India,
Emergence of perspective and renaissance painting.
Continue until you get to present time abstraction, graphical arts, digital arts and so on.
This takes a couple of volume that one might enjoy during his spare time in few months.

,,,, If reached to this point, you are ready to go ahead for becoming a teacher in that field.

, Gradually, you become convinced that without using flashcards and dedicating more commitment you cannot progress much. As a future teacher of history you cannot refrain using the main tools of academic works.

,, Social dynamism of human is woven together from the threads and strings which look diverse at the first sight, but not at the reality. Wars and natural disasters hinder the arts and kings and rulers can encourage and help them to flourish. That might take you to a new decision.

,


Note that you might bypass the previous steps if from the beginning your desire is study of general history. Hence, put yourself in the crucible of test.

, You might have your own philosophical ideological taste to select from a range of general history books, but the one recommended here is one of the most read and readable.

, This book is available on different formats, even free PDF and also in audio forms that you can listen on your MP3 device while driving or travelling to school or work. Best is to use both format.

, You should be able to tell, by heart, a movie that you have seen to a friend or a member of family. You should remember all the details and do not skip over them.

, Students of these subjects expect their teachers not to use notes and be talkative. You can start as an assistant.


For having any job that deals with younger people you need a clean police check.

, One cannot teach by memorizing. You should study all the time such that in the classroom students only get the overflow of your boiling knowledge.

, He creates and delivers in the arena.

, Study part of the Will Durant's that you like most. Select certain period of time and certain geopolitical entity of that period. Study that part with few chapters from important references available in public or school library. Write down some six seven thousand about that events. You should be able to remember relations of people and events and the roots and aftermaths of those events.

, Parallel to flashcards you need to use vastly mind maps for your own study and when you are teaching.

, Most of the modern teaching of history consists of social history and social analysis of events. Modern history does not look to events as separate adventures of certain kings, rulers and characters. In contrast, it studies history as a living evolving social phenomenon. Therefore, you need to have a minimum familiarity with sociology and its terminology per se. Then you can use it into your historical intellectualism.

, Gradually you feel that you recognise yourself in a strange way more knowledgeable than average.

, Go into a large university library and look in shelves of history books with thousands of tomes and volumes of works done by your predecessors and see if you will be able to add a page a chapter or a volume to them.

, Typically, this means you have to graduate from a college or university. In addition, you may need a degree to teach at college level. A degree in History will demonstrate your commitment to the field and dedication to academic work. Your school might require that you pass certain curriculum in teacher training, besides your degree in History

Set your ego aside.,

Don't view requests for help negatively.,
Learn to trust others.,

Say ""Thank You.""",How to Delegate," A big mental road block to delegation is that ""If you want something done right, then do it yourself."" You're not the only person in the world who can do it right. You may be the only person who can do it right at this very moment, but if you take the time to train someone, they'll probably be able to do it right, too. Who knows - they might even do it faster or better than you and this is something you need to not only accept, but invite.


Think logically and realistically - can you do this work by yourself? Will you have to work yourself to death to balance this work and your normal responsibilities? If so, you should probably be prepared to delegate some of your work. Don't feel ashamed or incompetent because you need help with something - you're actually being a more effective worker by getting help when you need it.;
, If you're reluctant to delegate work, you may have a minor case of martyr syndrome - you're probably overwhelmed, and you often wonder why people don't ever offer to help. Be honest with yourself - when they do, do you turn them down, just to be polite? Do you quietly wonder why they didn't insist? Do you feel that, if your positions were reversed, you'd probably help them in a heartbeat? If you answered ""yes,"" you need to work on taking control of your situation. Get the help you need - don't wait for it to come to you, because it might not.


Many people are quite oblivious to what others are going through, and there's not much you can do to change them. Let go of any frustration you might have over people not offering a helping hand; remember that it's ultimately your job to communicate your needs.

, Lots of folks are uncomfortable with asking for help. You may feel guilty, like you're burdening others, or shameful, because you think (for some reason) that you're supposed be able to handle everything on your own.

, If you're afraid of delegating because you don't think anyone can do as good of a job as you can, remember two things: First, that almost anyone can get good at something with enough practice, and second, that you're probably not as universally talented as you think you are. When you delegate work, you're not just freeing time up for yourself - you're also giving your helper a chance to practice a new skill or tackle a new kind of assignment. Be patient - with enough time, your helper will probably be able to do the delegated work about as well as you could have. Unless the work you plan to delegate is very important, it's probably alright for your helper to learn how to do well over time. If the work is very important, think twice before delegating it!


Even if you are the best at doing the work you plan to delegate, realize that delegating work allows you to do other things with your time. If you're the best person in the office at the relatively monotonous task of assembling hard drives, but you've got an important presentation you need to prepare for, it's O.K. to give the task to an intern. It's much better for you to give difficult, complex tasks priority - don't feel bad about delegating simple, repetitive tasks when you have more important things to do.

, The first step is the hardest, but it's the most crucial. You've got to take the plunge and ask someone to help you (or, if you're the boss, tell someone to help you.) Don't feel bad about this - as long as you're polite, kind, and gracious, you're not being rude simply for asking (or telling) someone to help. Try be gracious and considerate while simultaneously maintaining the seriousness of your request.


If you're unsure of how, specifically, you should ask someone to do some work for you, try keeping things short and sweet. Say something like, ""Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? I was wondering if you could help me assemble the big stack of hard drives we just got. I can't do it because I'm out of the office today. Can you help me out?"" Don't pressure your helper, but be sure that s/he knows his or her help is needed.

Ask and you shall (probably) receive. Don't be afraid to delegate because you may be seen as rude or imposing. Look at it this way - how do you feel when people ask you to do something? Are you hurt and offended? Or are you (usually) perfectly willing to help? Probably the latter!

, Sometimes, people aren't going to be able to help you - it's sad, but true. This can be for a variety of reasons - the most common is that the person you ask is already very busy with his or her own work. Don't take this too personally - just because someone can't (or won't) do something for you at the moment doesn't mean s/he hates you. It usually just means that the s/he is either busy or lazy - nothing more.


If you're refused, consider your options - usually, you can politely but firmly insist that you really need this person to help (which will work especially well if you're a boss or someone else with authority), you can try asking someone else, or you can do the work yourself. If you really need help, don't be afraid to try options one and/or two!

, This is the key to not becoming a nightmare of a micro-manager. Set clear standards for what kind of results you're looking for, and show the person how you do it, but tell them that they can do it any way they want, as long as it's done well and it's completed on time.


This is also smart because it spares your time and your nerves. You want to be using the time that you've freed up to do something more important, not constantly worrying about how your helper is progressing.

, You should almost always set aside a little time to teach your helper how to do the task you've delegated to him or her, even if it's a fairly simple one. Remember that processes that seem straightforward and simple to you might not be so simple to someone who's never dealt with them before. Be ready not only to walk your helper through the work you've delegated to him or her, but also to patiently field the questions that s/he will probably have.


Consider the time you spend training a helper to be a wise long-term investment. By spending a little time teaching your helper to do a task correctly, you save time in the future that might have otherwise been spent correcting his or her mistakes.

, You may have resources available that are necessary to complete the task but the person given the task may not be able to access them. Things like password protected data, specialized equipment, and certain tools can be vital to the completion of this task, so make sure your helper has whatever s/he needs to succeed.

, When your helper is helping you, s/he isn't doing his or her normal responsibilities. Don't forget that, like you, your helper likely has a tight schedule. Ask yourself - what work will they set aside or delegate in order to complete your task? Be sure you know the answer to this question when you delegate a task to someone.

, The person to whom you delegate will make mistakes while s/he is learning how to do a new task. It's part of the learning process. Plan for it. Don't delegate a task assuming the person will execute it perfectly until they have a proven track record. If a project doesn't turn out the way you wanted it to because your partner wasn't able to do a completely new task you delegated to him or her perfectly, it's your fault, not his or hers. Be a resource for your helper and delegated work can be a learning experience for him or her, rather than something to dread.


When you train someone to do something, you're making an investment. At first, it'll slow you down, but in the long run, it'll increase productivity by leaps and bound, for you've approached the whole thing with a positive and realistic attitude.

, Implement backup plans and stand ready to jump in if things go wrong. Know what will happen if a benchmark or deadline is missed. Obstacles and unexpected challenges pop up all the time, whether you're at work or at home - even technology fails sometimes. Let your delegate trust in the fact that, if something comes up, you will understand and help him or her to meet that deadline - don't just throw them under the bus at the first whiff of trouble.


Doing this is also smart in a selfish sense - If your delegate fears that s/he will be blamed, far more time will be spent in covering his or her own rear than in actually completing the task.

, Delegating tasks to someone else is necessary if you are to take on more and more responsibility. However, it's counterproductive when you delegate a task, let your helper work hard on it, and then take all the credit for yourself. Recognize and praise the efforts of others on your behalf.


Make sure that whenever you're complimented for a job you received help on, you mention your helper by name.

, When someone does something for you, it is important to thank him or her, acknowledge the importance of his or her help, and let the helper know s/he is appreciated. Otherwise, you'll appear ungrateful, even if you're not. Remember that people can't read your mind. People are more likely to offer to help again if they feel appreciated.


Be gracious. A simple heartfelt acknowledgement like, ""I couldn't have done it without you!"" can go a long way. If the work that this person did for you was substantial, you may even want to buy him or her a meal, a drink, a thank you card, or a small present.

Learn the content.,
Be aware of different learning styles.,
Regularly assess student progress.,
Motivate your students.",How to Be a Great Fifth Grade Teacher1," Although you most likely know how to use and apply 5th grade level content, you will need to become an expert in order to teach it. Furthermore, you must be aware of the learning standards and objectives for your state, district, and school. Most states follow the Common Core curriculum, which outlines subject matter and skill sets for math and English language arts. You will also probably teach science and social studies.


Teach algebraic thinking, fractions, measurement and data, and geometry in math. Teach inferencing, themes, compare and contrast, story structures and point of view in English Language Arts. Teach social studies and science using the Common Core standards for reading under English language arts.;
, All people learn differently. Most people can describe themselves as either visual, auditory, reading/writing, or kinesthetic learners. Remember to consider all learning styles when you plan your lessons.Use pictures, graphic organizers, and maps for visual learners.
Incorporate class discussions and the use of mnemonics for auditory learners.
Assign and written assignments and readings for readers or writers.
Include physical and hands on activities for kinesthetic learners.

, You must constantly ask yourself if students are absorbing what you are teaching them. Assessments can be formal or informal and should always be aligned to your teaching goals.Informally assess students with comprehension questions, classwork, homework, and group discussions. These assessments allow the teacher to gauge student progress. They also help teachers decide if a topic needs to be reviewed or if changes need to be made to future lessons.
Formally assess students using tests, quizzes, projects, or presentations. These types of assessments usually make up a larger portion of student grades, but they don’t have to. Remember that formal assessments should reflect what has been taught over the course of a unit.

, Try to remember when you were a kid; even better, remember when you were a fifth grader. Learning math or history out of a textbook probably wasn't memorable to you. Incorporate fun activities into learning. Make connections to real life with campaigns or debates.
Offer incentives for exemplary participation in class activities.
Use songs or poems to transition between topics.

"
"
Vary how you present information.,
Keep a light touch.,
Practice often.,
Encourage critical thinking.,
Vary your study place.,
Get feedback from students.",How to Be a Science Tutor1," The more ways you present a topic, the more chances your student will have to resonate with the information you offer. Try working problems, discussing prominent scientists in the field you are tutoring, and allowing the student to connect to different aspects of your topic. This makes the topic more engaging and digestible for students., Science can sometimes be pretty technical and tedious. Introduce a bit of humor and fun to the lesson. Make jokes about your subject matter, even if they are nerdy science jokes. You can also use flash cards or other systems to create fast paced quiz games.An example of a chemistry joke might be “You know why I don’t trust atoms? Because I heard they make up everything!”

, Your students will need to have frequent opportunities to work through science problems and concepts. Allow them to work through an idea from start to finish, and then give them constructive feedback about their process. Make sure that you explain the concepts involved when correcting them, and ask them to explain the concepts back to you., Allow your students to talk more than you do. If you are tutoring multiple students, give them a chance to discuss problems with each other. Any time a question, or answer, is given, allow the students to reflect on the science concepts behind the question.For example, if you are covering material related to the shape of a water molecule, you might ask the students to consider why it is a different shape from another three atom molecule, such as carbon dioxide. Rather than telling them the answer right off, prompt them to think about the electrons on oxygen. You might say “What is it about oxygen that would push the hydrogens closer to each other, giving water a bent geometry?”

, A change of scenery from time to time will give your tutoring sessions a natural, relaxed feel. Get out of the classroom and go to science exhibits, or do your own experiments that are relevant to the topic you are tutoring. This breaks the monotony of the classroom.For example, if you are teaching a chemistry lesson, you might go outside and demonstrate how some household chemicals react.
Pay particular attention to how each student acts in each study place. Some students may need more structured environments, while others need a more casual space.

, Your students will be able to tell you if they are learning well or not. Listen to what they have to say. If they seem hesitant to speak up, provide a survey for them. The survey questions should prompt them to tell you what you are doing well, and what you could improve on.Try to make your survey anonymous and say something like “I need your feedback to make sure that I’m meeting your needs.”
An example survey question might be “How comfortable are you speaking about the material we cover in a tutoring session?”

"
"
Strategically organize the classroom.,
Establish rules.,
Be consistent.,
Build rapport with your students.,
Stay in touch with parents or guardians.,
Have high expectations.",How to Be a Great Fifth Grade Teacher2," You may not get to choose the size of the room or the type of furniture, but you can often move things around. Make sure you and the students have space to walk around the room. This is especially important if you have students with behavioral problems. You need to have access to all areas of the room so that you can be close by should a problem arise.


Change the seating in the classroom for different activities. For example, desks should be in rows if you are giving a test because you want to eliminate distractions. For class discussions, however, it is better for students to sit in a circle so that they can easily make eye contact with their peers.
Remember that fifth graders are transitioning into puberty, so students may vary in size. Be mindful of this when you arrange your seating.

, Class rules often vary depending on the community you teach in and your years of experience. Some teachers make rules with their students, while others bring rules to the class. In either case, the rules should be few in number, simple, and make sense to the teacher and students.Some students say that they don’t like rules, but children become uncomfortable when chaos impedes learning. Remember that you are responsible for the safety and learning of all students, regardless of the opinion of some individuals.
Rules should be broad enough to cover many situations and specific enough for you to know when a rule has been broken. A set of class rules might look like:

Raise your hand to speak or leave your seat.
Respect the teacher and classmates.
Participate in class activities.
Keep your hands and body to yourself.



, A class runs smoothly when students know what to expect. As a teacher, you are an important adult in a student’s life. The more consistent you are, the safer they will feel at school. Students should be able to see that if a rule is broken, a consequence is given every single time. If not, students will know that they can get away with certain things, and you run the risk of losing control of the class. Consequences can be established with your administration, fellow teachers, or parents. They may include a call home, an extra homework assignment, a deduction in grades, or community service. Consequences should generally match the severity of the action. Talk to your administrators and learn about your students to see what kinds of consequences will be effective.

, It is important that your students trust and respect you. This happens by getting to know your students as people and establishing a positive academic relationship. Establish rapport with students by learning their names, talking to them about topics they are interested in, and sharing your own stories. Don’t force it. Any connection you make should be genuine.

, Students benefit from knowing that their teacher is in communication with adults at home. A strong link between home and school will help children develop as people and as learners. Call parents when students are having trouble in class. Parents should know what is going on in the classroom. Often parents will support you by helping their child with schoolwork or establishing consequences for poor behavior.
Make positive phone calls too. Children and parents need to feel encouraged, especially if there have been challenges in the past. Students and parents alike will appreciate a positive call home.

, Set behavioral and academic expectations of your students, and consistently reinforce them in the classroom. Although your students are children, expect them to behave appropriately and work hard. Most students will rise to the occasion.


Studies show that we often have low expectations of students with disabilities, students with behavioral problems, low income students, and students of color. Remember to treat your students equally when it comes to what you expect of their behavior and schoolwork."

Maintain a calendar of important events.,
Keep a filing system for the classroom.,
Create a filing system for yourself.,
Manage your time.",How to Be a Great Fifth Grade Teacher3," A calendar will help you plan your classes and units so that you cover all of the required material by the end of the year. It will also help you keep track of meetings, due dates, and any other administrative tasks. Consider keeping a classroom calendar that includes holidays and events that students need to know about. You and your class may also want to include student birthdays on this calendar.

, Students will need to use folders, notebooks, textbooks, and other materials on a daily basis. Decide on how you will organize such materials and where they will be placed around the room. Many teachers like to keep things color-coded by subject and assign numbers for each students.
Remember that space may be limited. Consider using cubbies and shelves to store student materials.

, Teachers handle a great deal of paperwork, including lesson plans, worksheets, student work, and general school announcements. Create a filing system at school (and at home, if necessary) for the many papers you will be handling. Consider organizing lessons and grades on the computer. There are many online tools that help you track student grades. Your school may even have its own website for grades and student assignments.
Accordion folders, crates, and bins are all helpful for managing papers. Consider using unconventional tools like mason jars and old suitcases to organize other materials.

, Being a teacher can feel like a 24-hour job. Between administrative duties, calling parents, lesson planning, grading, and actually teaching, your time can go by very quickly. Prioritize your tasks and set aside time for each one during the week. Don’t forget to schedule time for yourself too!

Graduate high school.,
Obtain a college degree.,
Complete a tutor certification.,
Start with your area of specialty.,
Look for openings in related areas.,
Gauge what students need.,
Compare job options.",How to Be a Science Tutor2," To be a successful tutor, you will need a background in science. High school is designed to lay the foundation of several different subjects, including the sciences. A high school diploma is also an important stepping stone to higher education.If you did not graduate high school, you can obtain a graduate equivalency degree, or GED.

, With a college degree, you can specialize in a particular science in a way that high school does not offer. Major in physics, chemistry, biology, or another science program. You also have the option to get a teaching degree with a science concentration., A tutor certification is important for getting hired on to some tutoring companies or school boards. There are multiple certifying organizations such as the National Tutoring Association, and the American Tutoring Association.Tutoring certifications usually require that you pass an exam. Usually a fee is involved, and there may be classes offered to prepare you for the exam. You should look at the guidelines given by the certifying body that you wish to be affiliated with.

, People often choose tutors because the tutor is a specialist in their field. Having the experience and knowledge beyond that of the average person will allow you to structure your teachings with direction and purpose. Look for tutoring jobs in the field(s) that you specialize or have degrees in.For example, if you have a degree in chemistry and research experience in biochemistry, then tutoring in biochemistry would be a great option for you.

, If you are struggling to find a need for tutors in your specialty, you can branch out to closely related topics. This opens up more opportunities for you to tutor, and will enhance your skills on topics related to your specialty. Advertise yourself as a tutor in several different, but closely related subjects.


If your specialty is biochemistry, you could advertise yourself as a tutor in chemistry, biology, and biochemistry.

, Ultimately, what you teach will be governed by what students need to learn. If you are having difficulty finding students in need of your tutoring services, ask some students what topics they need assistance in. It may be outside your area of expertise, but you could possibly still offer assistance.


Many students need help in mathematics for example. Even though math is not in the title of a biochemistry major, you will need to complete several chemistry courses that require relatively strong math skills to acquire your degree. So offering assistance to students in basic math courses would not be out of the question.

, Different tutoring jobs come with different pay and benefit packages. Sometimes, you can be hired as a tutor by the local board of education and be paid a set rate. Alternatively, you could tutor as a private tutor and set your own schedule and rates. Tutoring agencies also offer a good way to connect with students and keep steady work.

"
"
Go to school at the level that you wish to tutor.,
Take courses on the subjects that you want to tutor.,
Complete tutor training.,
Be aware of interactions with your students.",How to Be a Science Tutor3," Many students choose to apply themselves as tutors in a class that they find enjoyable or easy. They elect to tutor other students in that particular subject. This is generally contained within a particular school or institution, and is a good way for the tutoring student to make some extra money.Sometimes the tutor may not remain in the same school, but will remain in the same district. For example, a high school student might tutor a middle school student in introductory science.
For example, a student of one college or high school would rarely ever be a tutor at another.

, It is important that you understand the course that you are tutoring. Most places require that you have taken the course you wish to tutor. Usually, you must have earned an A- or better in the course. Sometimes, a lower grade will be accepted if the professor recommends you.Sometimes you can tutor for a class that you tested out of, for example, introduction to chemistry.

, Most institutions have a specific training course that you must complete before being instated as tutor. This is to ensure that you can properly communicate information to your fellow students. After completing the training, you will generally be listed in the institution’s tutoring center where students will come for study help., As a fellow student and a tutor, your interactions with the people you tutor can sometimes be tricky. You might often run into a student who doesn’t recognize your authority on the subject because you are a student. You should also recognize that, to some degree, you hold a position of power over your fellow students. Be careful not to abuse this position, such as asking for favors in return for tutoring.

Note the difference between imitation and slavish or mindless devotion.,
Study the person you admire.,
See if it is possible to meet the person if you don't already know them.,
Get to know the person better.,
Be shameless in your imitation of people you admire.,
Keep practicing until it works for you.,
Keep it all in perspective.",How to Imitate a Person You Admire," This article is firmly about imitating character traits for your personal improvement. In other words, you are not trying to ""become"" the person you admire and you are not creating a shrine of fan, hero or celebrity worship to this person. The imitation referred to here is about being attracted to qualities that an admirable person has that you'd like to polish up within yourself, admiring in that person what you want to do or be more of yourself. It's likely that you're attracted to your role models precisely because they have qualities that you harbor undernourished within yourself and seeing the prominent display of these qualities in action in another sparks your desire to do the same. Through concentration on the behavior, beliefs, opinions and values of people you admire, you'll gain amazing insights into successful approaches to life, business, studies, work, etc.


Imitation is about character building and refinement; you remain essentially you and your own creativity and sense of self derive completely from within––you're simply seeking to improve those elements of your character that you believe important by focusing on how others have developed these aspects of themselves.
Do not confuse imitating others with lack of thinking for yourself. To think that would be to misunderstand the purpose of imitating the character traits of a person you admire. Indeed, you demonstrate that you are thinking for yourself by your ability to pick and choose the things you admire and believe in in others rather than simply allowing yourself to be in complete awe or dislike of another person.
Bear in mind all the time that this is about hitching your star to proven strategies, traits and approaches revealed through others in the belief that these elements may well work for you too.;
, You will only imitate someone successfully if you become their student. People who are too busy judging others and feeling jealousy, annoyance or regret about another person's success and achievements are unable to learn from that person because their own negativity stands in the way. Cease judging the person and start observing their approaches objectively, to identify the things they do, say and think that make such an impact on you (and on the world).


If this person is someone well known, read autobiographies, articles that discuss the person's successes and books or articles written by this person about topics they're expert in.
If you know the person or you have a chance to view them on-screen or to hear them by audio, observe or listen to them regularly. Spend as much time as needed on this––taking care to pay close attention––until you're sure you've learned enough information about the things you want.
Some of the things you might concentrate on include the other person's appearance (for example, how they dress, style their hair, carry themselves, etc); their manner of speaking and interacting (intonation, pauses, listening skills, responding with humor, etc.); typical ways they behave both under pressure (calm, reflectively, etc.) and in general (positive, friendly, caring, trusting, etc.); their posture and body language (typically assertive, powerful and reassuring if you've chosen a role model with great qualities), and so forth.

, Perhaps they're giving a seminar, a conference or delivering a speech somewhere. If it's business related, see if there are tour or networking opportunities where you can get to meet them in person. Perhaps it's someone in your workplace or social sphere that you've not yet actually had the chance to meet. In that case, arrange an occasion where you can meet up, over coffee or a chat perhaps. When asking to meet them, don't be afraid to explain to them that you'd like to get to know them better because you admire them for (insert reasons here). This isn't just flattery; it provides them with feedback that they're doing something positive for others and they may even see this as an opportunity to actively involve themselves in helping you to grow.


You might also take the chance to stop them when you happen upon them in everyday life. You could be outside the office, cafeteria, classroom, anywhere by chance. Don't let the occasion slip by––smile and say a greeting and ask them if they have a moment.

, If you've got an opportunity to get to know the person you admire better, then seize the chance. Getting to know the person will enable you to learn more about the type of person they are and their style. If you're nervous, push beyond those nerves and say hello, comment on something they've done that has impacted you or ask them a quick question seeking advice. Help them to realize that you're genuinely interested in what they're doing by expressing your admiration for them or for the things they do, perhaps citing one or two examples. Be straight up and tell them that you'd like to get to know them a bit better. For further ideas on how to start a conversation with someone you barely know or feel overwhelmed by, see:


How to start a conversation with a stranger
How to start a conversation when you have nothing to talk about

How to start a conversation with someone on the train, bus or subway.

, They've got the qualities you aspire to and believe in, so don't be afraid to try on their qualities for fit. You are honoring their living legacy and you're helping yourself by emulating their successes. Use what you've learned to start imitating the other person's traits, style, application, etc. Choose from the traits you most admire (such as business style, clarity in facial expressions, reassuring hand gestures or posture, application to a project, the way they talk, etc.) Start putting these elements you've noted into actual practice in your own life.


Start with the traits and approaches that you find easiest to imitate initially and work your way up to harder ones. Don't neglect to push yourself beyond your current boundaries though. Novelty is always scary but it's definitely worth overcoming the fear to see just how far you can change your way of thinking and acting by adapting other people's successful approaches.
Avoid feeling that imitation is a cop-out. Douglas Adams once summed up our reticence to learn from others most succinctly: ""Human beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so."" Be open to using this unique talent of ours. By overcoming your foibles about imitating another, you improve your own chances of being more successful.

, Concentrate hard on the trait, habit or approach that you wish to emulate in this admired person and put it into practice regularly until it is near enough perfect. If you fail to adapt it or put it into practice, keep trying until it falls into place for you.


Obviously, you'll be adapting as you're adopting. This is natural and to be expected; you are still you and everything you adopt must be tailored to that reality. And at times, you'll find what it just doesn't work for you. That's okay too––at least you tried.

, The idea of imitation in this article has been focused on locking onto the good traits and practices that work for you. The opposite extreme is to hero worship this person and to cease applying your common sense and sense of perspective in your emulation of their traits and actions. Remember that every person you admire is as human as yourself and has the same frailties. Avoid patterning your entire life and beliefs on this person or you risk ending up disappointed, hurt and possibly even devastated when that person fails to live up to your expectations. Since this is pretty much inevitable, be prepared for finding out things that dismay you as much as things that compel you. That's a sign your admired person is as human as you and experiences struggles too.


Cherry pick the admirable elements, discard what doesn't propel your own sense of self forward and continue to develop all sides of yourself in a well-rounded and honest way. This is about learning and improving, not about substituting personal responsibility through pretense.

If you are still in high school, consider taking a full four years of math, including algebra, geometry, and either trigonometry, pre-calculus, or calculus. You should also take physics and chemistry.
Learn communication skills through English classes and other language classes.
You should also consider taking computer classes, mechanical drawing classes, machine shop, and college preparatory classes.;
, While it is not strictly necessary, it is strongly recommended that you obtain a four-year Bachelor's degree at a Coast Guard approved training academy or college.You can usually become captain of a supply boat or inland waterway vessel simply by starting as a deckhand on a boat and working your way through the ranks. If you want to captain a deep-water vessel, however, you will usually need formal education.
Get a degree in the field of marine transportation, marine engineering, maritime operations and technology, marine engineering system, or marine engineering and shipyard management.

, Regardless of whether you have formal education or not, there are certain skills you will need to study and practice if you want to be a good captain.


Study topics dealing with navigational software, facilities management software, marine communication system operations, and the structure of mechanical ship equipment.
You also need to build up good coordination and good communication skills.

, Before you can obtain a captain's license, you must have a minimum total of 360 days worth of sea-time over the past five years. A ""day"" in this context refers to a period of four consecutive hours.If this sea-time is spent under another captain's command, you will need to have this captain sign your license application when the time comes.
Note that this sea-time does not necessarily need to provide you with experience directly related to being a captain. For instance, you could be a maid or deckhand on a cruise ship and the hours would still count.

, Even though you only need 360 days of sea-time to get your license, if you want an actual job as a captain, you will usually need at least three to four years of professional experience. This experience should be directly related to the operations and management of a ship.


If you get your Bachelor's degree from a Coast Guard academy, you will often have the opportunity to serve as a deck officer aboard a ship through the U.S. Strategic Sealift Officer Program (a.k.a. the Merchant Marine Reserve), the Coast Guard Reserve, or the Naval Reserve.
If you do not go through a Coast Guard academy or if none of these programs sound appealing to you, you should get an entry-level job aboard a standard cruise ship or merchant ship and work your way up through the ranks. Even if you go this route, you will usually need to work as a deck officer before that company or another company will be willing to hire you as a captain.

, You will need to obtain and fill out an application for your captain's license through the U.S. Coast Guard. This license is more formally known as a Merchant Mariner Credential (MMC).


You need to fill out the application completely and accurately.
Note that you will need to submit documentation of your sea-time experience with your application.
You can submit your application and any supporting documents in person at a local Regional Exam Center (REC) or send it in to the REC through the mail.

, In addition to the application itself, you will need to submit three letters of recommendation. These letters need to address your character.


It helps if the references are related to the maritime industry. That way, they can address both your character and your proficiency with a boat.
References from licensed captains, commercial fishermen, or others who own and operate their own boats are generally best.
These character reference letters should also be notarized.

, Once you submit your application and your character references, you will need to pass a physical exam and drug test. You also need to have CPR and First Aid certification.


Expect to go through a background check and fingerprinting, as well.
You will also need to show your Social Security card at to the official at the licensing office when you turn in your application.
While it is not always necessary, you may also need to obtain a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA). You will need to obtain this credential card if you want to captain any vessel that could be considered a security risk., There is no driving test when you apply for your captain's license, but there is a written test that you need to pass.


This exam will usually consist of 60 multiple choice questions about deck and safety procedures, 20 questions on general navigation, 10 navigation problem scenarios, and 30 multiple choice questions on the general rules associate with operating a boat in shared waters

, The standard fee as of 2014 is $255. You will need to pay this fee when you turn in your application and complete the test.


The cost of evaluation is $100 and the cost of examination is another $110. The remaining $45 covers the cost of insurance., After you submit your application, fee, and all related documents, the REC will process the application in its electronic database. From there, your application will be sent to the National Maritime Center (NMC) for review.Once the NMC gets your application, the officials there will review your professional qualifications and medical history. Your overall safety and suitability will also be evaluated.
If your application is approved, your license and credential will be printed and mailed to you.

, Finding work as a captain can seem difficult at first, but the overall job growth for all maritime careers is expected to grow faster than the average for all careers through 2020.Job growth should grow fastest along inland river routes, coasts, and the Great Lakes.
As of 2011, the average salary for ship and boat captains was approximately $71,760.

, The easiest way to look for work as a boat captain is to network through the professional contacts you made while gaining your initial training and experience.


Contact maritime companies you have worked for in the past and ask about current job openings.
Get in touch with the captains of any independently-owned ships or boats you worked on and ask if they can put you in touch with any professional contacts.
Go down to the docks and mingle with the captains and deck officers there. Ask about job leads.
Look for online job ads. There are some websites, like http://www.boatcaptainsonline.com/, that are designed specifically for those looking for work as boat captains.

, If you want to improve your odds of getting work or keeping your job, you should consider taking continuing education courses through a maritime academy.


These courses can help you learn new skills and new technologies related to the industry.
These classes can also help prepare you for re-certification exams.

Of course, some rules that apply to your kids may not apply to you — you may not have homework to finish or a 9 pm curfew — but it’s important to show them a good example of how to conduct yourself. Your children will be modelling your behavior and it’s important to show them whatever you want to see from them.


If you tell them to be kind, then don’t let them see you bad-mouthing a waitress.
If you tell them to have good manners, then don’t talk with your mouth full.
If you tell them to keep their room clean, then keep your room clean as well.
If you’re always asking your children to eat healthier foods, let them see you choosing a salad over fries once in a while.;
, Don’t put pressure on yourself to be a flawless parent who never makes a single mistake. That’s impossible. Things go wrong, and sometimes, your temper will flare up or you’ll say or do something that you will regret That’s perfectly natural. The most important thing is that you acknowledge the behavior and apologize for it instead of pretending that nothing ever happened. If you misbehave and try to brush it under the rug, then your children will get the message that they’ll be able to do the same.


If you’ve done something wrong, sit your child down, look him in the eyes, and show that you’re really sorry. Make sure your child knows that you mean it, so that he understands how to apologize when he’s done something wrong, too.

, Your children don’t have to see you as the person who has all the answers. In fact, you can help them out more by showing them that you do have to struggle to find the right answer in certain situations by thinking aloud and inviting them into the process with you. When a tough situation arises, you can weigh the pros and cons with your children, and show them what goes into a decision-making process. This will show them that you’re human and that when you say “no,” you’re not just saying it categorically, but because you’ve put a lot of thought into it. However, you have to be careful not to take this idea too far; you don't want to end up having to explain your reasoning to your child every single time, or that may get exhausting and will lose its power.


For example, you can say something like, “I wish I could let you play with your friends right now, but I want you to finish your science project first. Remember the last time you stayed up late finishing a project and how upsetting that was? I want you to get in the habit of doing your work first before having fun.”
Whenever you do explain your reasoning to your kids, make sure they're actually listening because they're interested and not just because they keep asking why, why, why to get on your case.

, Another must for any parent who wants to be a good role model is to back up what you say. If you tell your child she won’t be able to go to the mall with her friends if she doesn’t finish her homework, then you’ve got to stick to your guns, or you’ll be seen as a pushover. Though it can be difficult, you can’t let your children’s apologies, emotional pleas, or cries of, “But everyone else’s mom is letting him go!” sway you from your rules and ideas. Of course, you should always listen to your children and never make rules without thinking about them first, but once you make a mandate or a rule, then you’ve got to stick to it if you earn your child’s respect.


If your children see that you don’t stick to your word, then they’ll think it’s okay for them to not stick to their words when it comes to saying they’ll do their chores or come home at a certain hour.
If you say you’ll pick your kids up at a certain hour, make sure to be there. If you’re late, apologize profusely. You don’t want them feeling like they can’t depend on you.

, If you want to be a good role model for your children, then you have to treat everyone around you with respect, from handymen to your neighbors. You can’t tell your children to be kind to everyone and then let them see you mad-mouthing your friend, yelling at a telemarketer, or just being snippy with a cashier. You also have to be kind to your children instead of being mean or inconsiderate to them, because they will definitely take that behavior to heart.If they see you being rude to a waitress, for example, they will model this behavior and will think it’s acceptable.
Even if you have a conflict with one of your peers or co-workers, don’t let your siblings hear too much about it, especially if you’re getting angry. You don’t want them to think that it’s okay to gossip about people.

, Another thing you have to do to be a good role model for your kids is to be consistent in the way you keep order in the household. If you have a rule that your children can’t play with their friends until they’ve done their homework, then you have to enforce it every time, instead of making exceptions based on how badly your children want to play with their friends. If you say that your kids have to finish their vegetables before getting to dessert, then don’t give up on that rule because your kid has started crying. If you make a lot of exceptions, then your children will be confused and will think it’s okay to not be consistent in their own behavior, too.That said, there will be occasional times when you have to bend the rules and make exceptions, if the situation really calls for it. This is okay, too, and will teach your children not to have a black-and-white view on things. For example, if your daughter is going to her junior prom, it may be okay to let her stay out an extra hour or two past curfew, but only because it’s a special occasion.
If you have a partner, it’s important to be a united front. You don’t want to play bad cop, good cop with your partner and have your kids think that you and your partner won’t give the same answers to their questions.

, Your relationship with your partner, if you have one, may be one of the most important relationships for your child to see. Though no relationship is perfect, you should show your children that two people can work together to love each other, compromise, and grow as individuals and as a couple. You may not think your behavior affects your children, especially when they’re small, but they’ll model the relationship behavior they see when they are old enough to have relationships of their own.


Sometimes, you may get mad and raise your voice. If that happens, you don’t have to pretend like everything is fine. If you know your children heard it, you can explain that things got a little out of control but that you’re not proud of the behavior.

, Of course, it can be nearly impossible not to play favorites when you’re teaching a class with a student who is always falling asleep or texting sitting next to another student who is hanging on to your every word. When it comes time to give grades, students will be properly evaluated, but when you’re interacting with your students in the classroom, you’ll have to do the best you can to hide your biases so that you can foster a positive classroom environment.


Try to call on all students equally, and not to make a point of praising the high-achieving students too much, or the other students will feel left out.
If you are short with a student who hasn’t been impressing you, then he won’t be motivated to change.

, This one is pretty straight forward. If you tell your students not to be late to class, don’t be late to class. If you have a no-cell phone policy, keep your phone off during class. If you tell your kids they can’t eat in the classroom, don’t chow down half a sandwich in the middle of a presentation. If you fall into this kind of behavior, your students will think of you as a hypocrite and will lose respect for you. What’s more, you’ll be modeling behavior that suggests it’s okay for your students to break the rules.


If you’ve broken one of your own rules, make a point of apologizing for it.

, Whether you’re teaching organic chemistry or basic grammar, if you don’t care about the course material, then nobody else will. You have to show that you’re excited about The War of 1812, The Canterbury Tales, factoring equations, or whatever it is you’re teaching that day. Your enthusiasm will be infectious and will show students the importance of caring about what they’re learning. If you act bored or sick of the same old material, then the students will follow suit.


One of your goals, as a teacher, should be to show your students what it’s like to have a passion for a certain subject. Your enthusiasm can lead them to develop a passion for your favorite subject, too, and this will be a great achievement.

, This one is a bit tricky. You want your students to see you as the person with all the answer and the guy who administers the tests. However, sometimes things do go wrong — maybe you forgot an important point in the lesson, maybe one of your test questions didn’t add up, or maybe you promised you’d have your students’ essays back on time and didn’t get to them. If these situations arise, you should tell your students that you’ve made a mistake and move forward from there. Swallowing your pride for thirty seconds will be worth it in the long run, because they’ll see that they’re fallible, too.


Of course, this doesn’t mean that you should allow students to question your every move, or for grade-grubbing students to go over every little part of every little exam with you. Find a balance between being open to admitting errors and not letting students question everything you do.

, Though asking a class of third graders what they think of your lesson plans may not yield the best results, you can become a better teacher and a great role model if you ask older students for feedback about your teaching and lesson planning. If you're a college teacher, for example, asking for feedback at the end of your class can help you do your job better the next time around and will show your students that your ideas aren't set in stone and that you're flexible.


Of course, it's a fine balance. You have to be aware of what's good for your students, even if it's not the most fascinating material, and which lessons are useless because your students don't actually learn anything.

, If you want to be a good role model, then you should encourage your students to do well and to work harder in school. If they’re struggling, then help them after school, give them additional resources, or give them extensive feedback on their essays to help them improve. When they show improvement, make sure you give them the praise they deserve. This models the idea of improvement and shows students that they can be better than they are; if you make a habit of being encouraging to good students and dismissive of weaker students, then you’ll make students think that there’s no room for improvement.


To be a good role model, you shouldn’t make students feel bad for performing poorly, or to praise high-achieving students too much. Instead, you should talk about how the subject matter can be quite difficult and leave room for questions so students can clear up anything they don’t understand.
Being encouraging about your student’s progress will make you a good role model because giving them a drive to succeed in your class can also help them apply this determination to other realms of their life.
Also, keep in mind that unfortunately, not all students get help or encouragement at home. Giving them a positive role model who offers encouragement can give them hope for the rest of their lives.

, It can be really hard to swallow your pride, especially when you’re used to being in charge of your little brother and sister. However, if you’ve made a mistake, genuinely hurt your sibling’s feelings, or just did something you regret, it’s really important that you suck it up and say you’re sorry. Not only will this show your sibling that you really do care, but it will send the message that they should apologize to you when they make a mistake.


Make sure you really mean it and that you’re not just doing it because it’s what your mother or father told you to do, either. Say, “I’m so sorry for what I did,” instead of, “I’m sorry you got so mad at me,” to show that you’re accountable for your actions.

, If you want to be a good role model, then you can’t be the one throwing the temper tantrums, kicking the wall, or yelling at your parents. Your little sibling will want to be just like you, and it’s up to you to act mature and take the high road instead of acting like a baby. Though you can’t always be mature and reasonable, you can try to set a good precedent, so your sibling knows how to act. If you’re in a fight with your sibling, don’t stoop to his level and name call or start crying, and act more mature instead.


This can be tricky, especially if there’s not a huge age difference. Still, try to be more mature even when you’re upset, and your sibling will try to do the same.

, If you’re an older sibling, then you may have this idea of yourself as being a shining, flawless example for your sibling at all times. Though this can be true in some cases, you should take the pressure off yourself and recognize that you’re only human. When you’ve done something wrong, you can talk to your sibling about the behavior and explain what you would do differently, next time. Whether you’ve yelled at your mother or showed unsportsmanlike behavior at your soccer game, you can tell your sibling what happened and show that you regret the behavior.


You don’t want to cover up anything you’ve done wrong and act like you’re always on top of your game, or your sibling will think that he or she should do the same when he or she makes a mistake. Life is all about learning from your mistakes, and it’s important to talk to your sibling about them.

, Of course, there will be times when you’ll just want to hang out with your buddies and leave your kid sister out of it, and that’s fine. However, if you’re running errands for your mom, watching TV, or doing something that your kid sister or brother would be happy to do without bothering you too much, then it’s important to let your sibling have that time with you when you can. You want to be a good role model of inclusion and family togetherness, so that your sibling doesn’t feel compelled to leave you out of anything in the future.


It’s okay to get some alone time too, though. Not only is alone time healthy for everyone, but getting some time alone will also show your sibling that he or she should get some alone time for personal growth and reflection, too.

, If you want to be left alone for a while or want to just hang out with your friends, don’t just tell your little brother to scram; instead, say something like, “I want to spend some time alone with my friend Jenny. You wouldn’t want me to be around when you’re just hanging out with your best friend, would you? It’s nothing personal and we can hang out later.” This will not only strengthen your relationship, but it will show your sibling that he or she is also capable of offering reasonable explanations to people instead of being mean.


Of course, you’ll feel cooler if you just tell your sibling to leave you alone and slam the door, especially if your friends are around, but this sets a terrible example.

, It’s likely that your younger sibling will want to talk like you, dress like you, and be like you. This can be flattering and sweet, and it may just be something you have to deal with. However, you should avoid creating a competition between you and your sibling, whether it’s over your looks, your grades, or your soccer skills. You want to be there to encourage your sibling to work hard, not to discourage your sibling from trying. If you set up a competitive relationship with your sibling, it’s likely to carry on for the rest of your life, and can lead to some unpleasantness down the line.


Remember that, since you’re older than your sibling, it’s naturally easier for you to do things faster and to be stronger or more skilled. Instead of pointing this out, help your sibling improve, and offer encouragement whenever you can.

, You don’t have to be a straight-A student in order to be a good role model for your sibling, but you should try to show a general respect toward your teachers and your school. If you act like school is pointless, all the teachers are stupid, and that you don’t care about studying for your tests or skipping school, then your sibling will surely follow suit. You don’t want to set a precedent where your sibling thinks it’s okay to not care about showing up to class or succeeding in school; this line of thinking can affect the rest of your sibling’s life in a bad way.


On the other side of the coin, if you’re a stellar student while your sibling is struggling in school, you shouldn’t flaunt your test grades and super achievements, either. Don’t make your sibling feel bad about not catching up to you. Instead, take on the role of a mentor and help your sibling with his studying and homework as much as you can.

, If your sibling is a few years younger than you, it can be tempting to get your sibling to join you when you smoke cigarettes, drink beer, or do something more adult with your friends. Your sibling may be desperate to please you, and you may think it’s cute to get your little brother or sister to help you play a dirty prank on someone or even to break the law, but in fact, you’ll be sending your sibling down a dangerous path. If you want to drink with your friends or do something else your sibling isn’t ready for, keep the pressure off.


Make it clear that your sibling is his own person and that he should never make decisions based on what you want. If your sibling feels like he should cater to your needs, he may be vulnerable to other people who want to boss him around.

Show appreciation.",How to Lead," Alright, so you have the set-up. You're part of a group that needs some direction. However, in order to become the leader your team needs, you need to have a vision. Be a seer. Be able to identify what needs to happen. See what would light that spark to get your team's creativity pumping. Recognize how individuals work.


A good leader sees the ""next big thing."" When the computer was invented, Steve Jobs saw the iPhone. When Justin Timberlake and Usher logged onto YouTube, they saw Justin Bieber.Once you see the next step, you also gotta see how it might come about. How can your team, specifically, maximize their potential? Who is good for what? What potential problems might arise?;
, You cannot become a leader in a microwave. You must become a leader in a crock-pot. In other words, these things take time. You gotta be patient. You gotta work your way up that ladder. There will be very few environments where you can walk in, say ""I'm here!"" and casually take charge. And if you can, you seriously need to question why!


No leader is a good leader who hasn't been led. You must be a follower before you can be a good leader -- or you won't understand thing one about your team. You would never elect a president who has never been a citizen, right? The same sentiment trickles down the levels of leadership. If you don't know what it's like being part of the team, you can't really lead it. So be patient, do your time, and it may come.

, If there's only one other thing a leader must have besides vision, it's strength. No leader has even risen to the top without a backbone, without drive, without their heads held high, without believing in themselves. Show your team that you can tackle the world head on and leadership will come unquestioned.


There's a difference between strength and arrogance. There's a difference between a leader that knows he's suited to lead and a leader that thinks he's the only one suited to lead. Your character needs to be strong, you need to be sure in your decisions, and you need to be confident, but that doesn't mean you don't recognize the abilities of your team (and your own inabilities at that).

, Sounds kinda funny, but it couldn't be more true. The leader that basks in their power, clinging to it, will have none in time. Assume you have none and you'll be more persuasive (because you have to be), you'll be able to relate to your team more (you're on the same level), and you won't go power-crazy (you have no reason to). And remember this: you only have power because your team allows it. They could take it away in no time. So, who really has it, anyway?



Being a good leader isn't about authority. It isn't about control and it definitely isn't a power trip. It's about your team's accomplishment. If you have to take a step back for everyone to be happy, jive, and reach their potential, then so be it. A good leader is only a good leader when their power is understood. It's not shouted on the hilltops or displayed like a modern-day Versailles. It just is.

, To be a leader, you have to have a team that's working toward something. If a team isn't accomplishing anything, they're just a group of people in one place, hopefully enjoying each other's company. There needs to be a clearly-defined goal, that everyone is a part of. In leading, you help determine just what that goal is.


Make sure everyone is clearly aware of what they're working toward. If someone doesn't understand, they'll get on the path to accomplishing something else! Each person needs a duty that maximizes their worth and makes them an integral piece of the proverbial pie.

, Here's a fun little exercise you could try: create a list of all you wanted to accomplish in the past year. Then go through that list and check off what you actually did accomplish. Hand that list to a friend and ask them if they would hire you. If they would consider you a go-getter, someone that gets the job done. What's the verdict?


We're often quite crappy at seeing ourselves how we actually are. Take a look at the list. Does it accurately reflect how you view yourself? What weaknesses does it bring to light? What strengths? Ask that same friend what you-on-paper proves.

, If you're part of a team that's running smoothly and all of a sudden you grab hold of the reins, trying to lead...well, you're cruisin' for a bruisin'. In order to lead, there must be a team that needs leading. Otherwise you're just a dictator seeking power needlessly. So wherever you are -- be it on a class project, on the basketball team, or in the office -- recognize what the situation is. Is no one stepping up? What's the situation? Is there a void at all?


No team operates efficiently when there are too many chefs in the kitchen; too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Those are sayings for a reason! Luckily, when the team you're on is running around like chickens with their heads cut off, it's pretty hard to ignore. You'll know a lack of leadership when you see it. And then you can fill the void!

, If Helen Keller were on your team, you wouldn't assign her to start making phone calls, you know? You're not gonna assign Lennie to watch over screaming, dramatic teenage girls. You're not gonna hand Voldemort the Elder Wand. People (read: your team) have individual strengths (and weaknesses). It's your job as a leader to put them where they need to be. Where they're most useful. It's your job to recognize that each person has value. It's your job to ignite that chemistry between people and their efforts.


Since you're leading, you're also (presumably) delegating. So let Helen read, write and inspire others. Let Lennie take care of the rabbits. Have He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named work on the recruitment side of things. Let everyone maximize their potential -- they'll be happier and you'll be happier, too.

, If you're running for President of the United States, it's a bad idea to have your slogan be, ""EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE PERFECT IN 2016!"" It's just not going to happen. You cannot lead your team with the expectations that everything will go swimmingly and everything will always be totally awesome. No. You gotta be real. You gotta be positive, but you gotta be real. Let your team know what's down the road. You're the seer, after all.


It's important to handle expectations on a macro and micro level. You need to check-in on the team level and on the individual level. Does everyone know what their own obligations are? How does that fit into the bigger picture?

, With any focus-driven team, there's bound to be people who disagree and there's bound to be people who disagree with you. There will be those who think they should be leading, there will be those who just don't like your style, and there will be those who just plain think your team should be going in a different direction. This is normal. Your job is to get them on board.


In most cases, this will be the minority (if it's the majority, you'll probably be ousted). The other two groups will be those who are behind you and those who really could go either way. You need to take those who are behind you and light them with a fire that can't help but spread to others. If you do it right, the rest will wonder why they're wasting so much time being difficult!

, This sort of goes along with the ""be a seer"" thing, but it needs to be happening constantly. Your vision for your team needs to morph as you make progress -- what seems right one day may seem incredibly wrong the next. So as the clock ticks, as you get further and further into your efforts, think outside the box. What could be done that you're not doing that could make it even better?


Often people rise to their position. Meaning those who are under you may be full of good ideas, but they don't really say anything or they don't grow them fully because they don't feel like it's their place. Make sure to hear everyone out, regardless of their status. They may have that notion that sets a light bulb off in your head, who knows?

, A good leader is one who is respected, and you can't be respected without being ethical and fair. Your team may not seem like they're watching you, but if you falter in your morals, they will take note. If you play favorites, they will take note. If you cut corners, they'll take note (and follow suit). So if you want your team to play nice, you should be playing nice, too.

, When you're factory worker #142, it's easy to lose sight of your importance. You may have a group of people that all feel like they don't really matter, whether they say it or not. When that happens, productivity (and success) natural rests at a minimum. You can avoid that by giving them purpose. Let them know what they're doing, why it's important, and how it will affect people. Pay attention to them. Let them know you're paying attention. If you care, they're more likely to, too.


Remember, you're a leader, not a boss. You're not just ordering them around. Heck, a monkey could do that. You're there to get the most out of them, regardless of circumstance. So be genuine with them. If they like you at all, they'll want to do their job. If they don't, they'll leave the first chance they get.

, In order to be an effective, good leader, you can't live by the mantra, ""Do as I say, not as I do."" You have to set forth the example you want your team to adhere to. If you don't, why should they cooperate? Why would they succeed? If your team is going every which direction, you're not much of a leader. So be the role model they need to show them the way.


Even if you don't think you're a role model, you are. You're in a natural position for it. Some leaders are more like friends, some are more like bosses (and yet some others are more like dictators), but they're all role models. Your team looks up to you. Use your powers for good!

, No one can predict the future. Computers get pretty good at predicting trends, but they still can be very, very wrong. Because of this, it's of utmost importance that you stay adaptable to change. Imagine if Apple stopped after its first computer! If Ford stopped after the Model T! If Britney stopped at ""Baby One More Time!"" Society is constantly changing and you (and your team) have to change with it.


This probably makes more sense for a long term leader, like the president of a company or captain of the football team. But even school project leaders have to be receptive to change! If Pedro has a better idea than what you're currently doing, you need to use it. If Jane doesn't show up to school, you gotta pick up her slack. Even small obstacles present to opportunity to show that change will not deviate you from your course of awesome.

, On the whole, people crave leadership. They prefer not making their own decisions (that way they can't really be held accountable when it all hits the fan) and using other people to light the way. Because of this, you're in a natural position to be a mentor. Use your powers for good! When someone comes to you for advice, help them out. After all, a good leader breeds more good leaders!

, Mike Tyson is credited to have said, ""Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.""Truer words never spoken, Mike. When you get ""punched in the mouth"" (meaning someone rocks the boat, rises up against your leadership, etc.), what are you gonna do? Go with the motion of the ocean? Or drown?


The correct answer is the first one, by the way. All good leaders face opposition. All of them. Think Nelson Mandela had it easy? Mother Teresa? Morgan Freeman? It has nothing to do with how good you are and everything to do with your position. There will always be haters. Always. It just means you're doing something and you matter. It's a part of leadership.

, A simple example would be if you're preparing a talk for a large group of people. Not only do you need to have your speech down, know what tools you need, who's all going to be there, but your team (in this case, possibly your audience), needs to know the drill, too. What will you be talking about? How can they do a little research in their own time? How can they equip themselves to be of use? When everyone's ready, things go a lot more smoothly!


Of course, some obstacles can't be prepared for. This is inevitable. But you can prepare for a bumpy ride -- and that's with expectation monitoring. If everyone goes in knowing it's not gonna be easy (but hopefully it'll be worth it), you can avoid the heavy sighs, the heads shaking, and, well, quitters!

, This is just good common sense. If Joni and Judy are fighting over the last staple, just stay out of it. They're probably actually fighting about something else, and that's not your domain. You do not have to handle your team's personal lives. If it doesn't have to do with work, just remain a neutral party. It's in everyone's best interest.

, When your team is doing stellar work, let them know they're doing stellar work. When all the cogs are turning, bask in it. Let your team bask in it. Point out the hard work you're seeing around you. Because you know what? You sure couldn't do it all on your own. As a good leader, you'll recognize that this is a team effort and everyone's part matters. Everyone deserves appreciation.


It's best if it's genuine appreciation. A phony leader who plasters a smile on their face won't be listened to for long. Find something about everyone's work that you can commend. And then commend it. If you can't, either you need to open your eyes or they shouldn't be part of your team!

Remember that it is about the entire team.",How to Be a Leader," This step has nothing to do with actually knowing what you're doing -- as long as you're confident, few people will ask questions. People assume things, and when you act as if you belong, they assume you do. Therefore, when you are confident, they will naturally assume you know what you are doing. This earns you trust, responsibility, and respect.


Confidence can be had in any situation. Imagine saying, ""I don't know the answer,"" while looking down, thumbs twiddling, and your legs fidgeting. Now imagine saying, ""I don't know the answer,"" with your head up, your shoulders back, and looking the speaker in the eye. Not knowing something is fine -- just be confident that you don't know it! A lack of knowledge has nothing to do with your confidence (or ability to lead).
There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance. Focus on being humble with people, avoid coming off arrogant.;
, Since you're leading, you're the one that needs to set the rules and boundaries. It's up to you to establish some system, rhyme and reason to the situation. To do so, you must be firm in your convictions and keep to your stance. However, being dictatorial will instigate a revolution. Be logical and understanding when you assert your rule.


Here's an example story of poor leadership: An airline's forks kept disappearing and no one knew why. After an investigation, it was discovered the dishwashers were throwing them away because they had trouble with adequately cleaning them and they were scared of punishment if they returned dirty forks (and would thusly be reprimanded).If you're too dictatorial, your team will throw away your forks. Better management would have prevented this problem. So be kind and keep your entire cutlery.

, Saying, ""I don't know"" as a leader is fine. Saying, ""I don't know"" repeatedly to every question you're asked is not. When you don't know something, find out the answer. Become an expert on what you need to be a pro in. Eventually, you'll have all the answers. You don't need them all right now, but you'll need each one eventually.


Having a certain level of knowledge will help you feel confident and more leader-esque. While you can do without it, it's a matter of time before someone else with more knowledge and charisma comes along and takes the title out from under your feet. So whatever, whoever you're looking to lead, start studying up! It'll pay off in the long run.

, You're standing in a circle of a group of friends, debating on what to do that night. Everyone is dilly-dallying, complaining, nixing everyone else's ideas until one person finally steps up and says, ""Guys, we're doing this."" That person rose to the top, saw the situation needed direction, and took charge. Leader, leader, leader.


That being said, you have to know your place. There will be times when you have to make the decision yourself and times when you have to give the team time to form a consensus. Respect your followers -- what might happen if you veto their opinions? Which brings us to...

, Just because they are not leaders doesn't mean they are idiots. They'll be able to tell if you're compassionate and genuinely concerned for them. And if you're not, they'll chuck you off your pedestal. Remember who butters your bread! Without them, you have no one to lead and are a leader no longer.


Caring for them is not the same as acquiescing to their desires. You're leading (hopefully) because you know what's best for the team; they may not. Just because someone disagrees with you doesn't mean you have to give them what they want. Allow them to disagree with you, listen to their argument, and let them know why you think the way you do. Let them know you care, but are acting in the best way you see fit.

, Truth be told, everyone is looking to be led. Think of life as a dark path -- the more leaders you have, the more people are in front of you holding industrial strength flashlights. Which would you rather have? Not only do people want leaders, but also they are looking for them. For that reason, anyone can do it. You just got to fill the void.


Think about going to a new restaurant (the restaurant is life). You get a waiter that greets with you a smile and outlines the flavors of three of their best dishes, guarantees your satisfaction and tells you he'll personally whip up something else if you don't like it. Somewhere in your head, you are breathing a sigh of relief thinking, ""Ahh. Yes. This will be a relaxing night -- I'm in good hands."" That's what everyone wants in life (in most restaurants, too).

, You know how politicians are viewed as promise-breakers? Good. You also know how people hate politicians? Well, there you have it. Break your promises and you lose respect. Point blank. You can fit the suit, you can have all the charisma, and you can have the knowledge, but if you don't deliver on what you promised to deliver, the people will have you silver platter.


An integral part of keeping promises is knowing what's doable and what's not. If you can define between the two, the only other obstacle is being honest. Practice this with your kids, practice this with your teammates, and practice this at every opportunity. Developing a strong moral code removes room for those questioning your ability to lead and hold power.

, If you walk into an office in a suit and tie, constantly glancing at your watch, people are going to assume you're waiting for some schmuck who's late for a business meeting. Walk into an office in a t-shirt and baseball cap and people will start wanting to know where their pizza is. If you want to lead, you gotta look the part.


There needs to be a distinction here between dressing to impress and dressing to influence. You don't necessarily want to dress to impress -- impressing may not be appropriate for the scenario you're in (if you are delivering pizzas, don't wear a suit, for example). You simply want to influence people's perceptions of you. What image do you want to give off? You can largely control what they perceive of you and your attitude by what you wear (sad, but true).

, Alright, so you know to care about your team, but you gotta follow it up with your actions. If you preach to your team to be cohesive, act like they're having fun, and be friendly with your clients but turn around and yell at them every 5 minutes when they crack a smile, you're not living out your message. Set forth a good, caring example, and they'll fall in line.


The old adage, ""Do as I say, not as I do"" is crap. It might have worked on you when you were 6 years old, but it will not work on a team of adults. They might not let you know explicitly, but they will be unhappy, eventually leave, and this will cut into your product. It may not have immediate repercussions, but eventually any hypocrisy on your part will catch up with you.

, For your organization to grow, everyone has to get better. This has nothing to do with just you being great -- you have to make your team great. Ideally, the task will done and the team will say, ""We did it!"", not you exclaiming, ""I did it!"" It's about the whole of the group, not the one.


To grow your team, you have to pay attention to them. Forcing numbers and leaving them to figure out roles won't do them justice. Get to know them on an individual level and commit to them becoming more resourceful members of your group (what role do they fit best in? What resources could they use). Help them learn, help them grow, and help them take the reins when you need back up.

, As a leader, you're sort of untouchable. People may not come to you because you're the big man of the organization. They don't want to pipe up and cause a ruckus. Know that you're dealing with a constant level of perceived intimidation that you need to break down. How do you do this? Ask questions first!


Don't wait for feedback from your team -- they may never offer it. After all, you're the one dictating how things are going; they may not think their opinion matters. Ask them how you're doing, how they're doing, and what they see to make the whole process better. Just because they're not leading doesn't mean they're not full of great ideas!

, A natural leader does not walk into a room and proclaim, ""Here I am!"" It's not about grabbing a situation by the horns and molding it to your vision, no, not at all. It's about seeing that something needs to be done and rising to the occasion.


In most situations, no leader will be titled as such. It's just a position that someone naturally gravitates to. People will not grant you the outright privilege, but they can keep you from having it. Avoid coming off as a dominant, who-does-he-think-he-is go-getter and wait for the right moment. You'll feel it.

, As you have probably started gathering, being a leader is more of an innate quality than a series of actions. To lead a situation, you need to see it arising, see how you can help it, and see the path it's going down. Let your team take care of the doing. You just gotta have a vision.


This is similar to ""the one who yells loudest gets heard."" Just because that person is loud certainly doesn't mean they're right. You don't have to be going 90 mph (140 km/h) leaving a trail of rubble behind you to be a good leader. Actually, you shouldn't be doing that. Your time should be spent interpreting, molding, and offering solutions.

, Look around and find ways to make the world a better place. Observe your surroundings and listen to people. How can you help? What challenged has yet to be answered? What could use organization?


Discover what your talents are, develop them, and focus on applying them towards making a difference. What problems would your talents be best suited for? Think of problems in the broader sense - they're not always easy to define.
Look for needs, niches, conflicts, gaps that need to be filled, and inefficiencies. The solutions won't always be creative or cutting edge; sometimes they're the simplest things.

, As you're solving problems (or simply improving what's already satisfactory), you might notice patterns, and wonder if many of those issues are symptoms of a deeper, bigger problem or construct. Thoreau once said, ""For every thousand hacking at the leaves of evil, one is hacking at the root."" Take a step back and try to find the root. The deeper matter is often not something anybody can solve alone; it'll require a group effort, which is where your role as a leader comes into play.


If you are working closely with a team, use them to your advantage. What roles do they feel best suited for? How is their time being utilized? What ideas do they have that have yet to be implemented? In many cases, growth is a matter of rearranging and refining -- not necessarily a problem at all.

, If you have these ideas in your mind about what the deeper issues are, you can probably predict the problems that will crop up as a result. Instead of waiting for those problems to appear, take steps to prevent them. If you can't prevent them, then you can at least prepare. That's the core difference between a leader and a manager. A good manager responds well to various situations; a good leader takes effective action to prevent and create situations before they actually happen.


Don't be afraid to assign roles to your team! They may take solace in the label. If you see a potential problem, construct a preventative task force. That's what your team is there for, after all.

, To exert influence and tackle bigger problems, you're going to need decision-making power, and those decisions will affect the people who grant you that power. This is as much a responsibility as it is an honor. Not only do you need to be able to make sound decisions, but you also need to be willing to be held accountable to them. If things go wrong, people will assume it's your fault (whether it is or not).


Think of yourself as the captain of a ship; the fate of the ship is essentially in your hands, and it's up to you to steer everyone in the right direction.
Exercise wisdom when being in charge; hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
If you're not prepared to take responsibility for your decisions - if you struggle with hesitation and self-doubt - it might be a good idea to step down. An insecure leader often becomes a tyrant.

, As a leader, you can see the bigger issues, but you can also see how things could be so much better if we could just remove those obstacles. To get people to help you in changing things, you need to share that positive vision with them. Inspire them. Motivate them. Guide them. Show them how their actions are bringing everyone closer to that dream.


John Gardner is quoted to have said, ""Most importantly, leaders can conceive and articulate goals that lift people out of their petty preoccupations and unite them in pursuit of objectives worthy of their best efforts."" Let that be you.

, The greatest leaders saw their role to an end, and themselves, as an instrument of a deeper purpose; any glory, prestige, or wealth was a side effect rather than a motivation. After all, nothing would get done with just the efforts of one man. Or woman!


If you want to realize a vision, the most effective way to do it is not with an army of drones; that army will only last as long as you do. For the most long-lasting results, share your vision and let people adopt it as their own, and let it spread like wildfire.
Think of yourself as the beginning of a chain reaction--once it's begun, you can step away and it'll continue to happen without any effort on your part.
Here's another apt quote for you -- this one from Lao Tzu: ""A leader is best when people barely know he exists. When his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.""

Procure or create a manual to develop a working format for proper parliamentary procedure.,
Create an agenda.,
Devise a ""minutes"" document.,
Appoint a member to be a parliamentarian, if the chair is not one already.,
Make sure that members understand the parliamentary procedure.",How to Conduct a Meeting Using Proper Parliamentary Procedure," Nearly every formal body has different rules and regulations, but most tend to derive from Robert's Rules of Order. You can get a copy of this book at your local book store.;
, If there is no agenda, it becomes quite difficult to conduct your meeting, and it won't be long before the meeting becomes uncontrollable. An agenda will safeguard you against this. Make sure that your agenda includes a proper placement and time for all items of business to be discussed, and ensure that at the minimum you include a time for reading of the minutes, officer/board member reports, old business, new business, and announcements. Depending on the organization, the person usually responsible for creating an agenda would be the President/Chair, Vice President, Secretary or a specific committee.

, The minutes will contain a brief, but comprehensive review of the immediate previous meeting. This is exceptionally important because without the minutes, people can and will forget what happened at the previous meeting, especially if there is a long period of time that elapsed between the two meetings. Human memory is never perfect. The task of taking the minutes usually devolves upon the Secretary of the organization, but this is not always the rule.

, A parliamentarian is a person who is very knowledgeable about your procedures - so make sure that person has a copy of the manual you are using. There will be a time in which questions of procedure will arise, and a parliamentarian will be able to render a solution quickly and effectively if the chair is unable to do so.

, If everyone that regularly participates or votes on issues does not understand your group's policies, you will find that conducting your meeting will be impossible.

Set a date and time convenient for all directors to attend.,
Record minutes of the meeting.,
Adopt the bylaws.,
Elect a “permanent” board of directors.,
Issue stock.,
Make any other pertinent resolutions.",How to Conduct an Initial Board Meeting," Make sure to give the directors of the company ample notice so that everyone can attend. Generally, in order to conduct business at the meeting, you must be a quorum, where a majority of all directors is present. Usually, directors may “attend” the meeting by conference call as long as everyone present can hear one another. Directors may vote by proxy if the bylaws provide for proxy votes, however since this meeting is a time where the initial directors will make many decisions, it is important for as many directors to attend the meeting as possible so that they can provide their input.
Your bylaws may require certain notice to be given to each director before a meeting is held, which usually provides that the notice be given a certain number of days in advance. If so, you must give the proper notice. In the alternative, you may conduct the meeting without giving the specific notice if all directors attend the meeting and do not contest the lack of notice, if some directors miss the meeting but a quorum is still present at the meeting (under the condition that they each sign a waiver of notice), or if the directors that miss the meeting sign the minutes of the missed meeting. In general, it is a good idea for any director that misses any meeting to sign off on the minutes of the missed meeting by simply writing “approved” and signing their name.;
, Company minutes are where the results of votes, records of resolutions, and summaries of proposed ideas of the company are kept. A director, usually the secretary, should keep a record of what went on at the meeting. The minutes need not contain any specialized language, but should accurately reflect what was said and done at the meeting.
Items to include in the minutes are: the time, location, and members present at the meeting; any pertinent company issues raised and a summary of some of the key issues raised in response to that issue; the results of any votes conducted, including who voted for or against; and any other important information about what happened at the meeting. A good rule of thumb is to include all information that a director that could not attend the meeting would need to know. Minutes should be filed with all other important company documents. A sample template is linked below.

, In many cases, a company that has just incorporated will form a bylaw committee in the early stages of incorporation in order to draft a set of bylaws for the company. The initial bylaws are usually informally agreed upon even before this formal meeting. Therefore, the adoption of the bylaws is a simple matter of taking a vote and recording the results. The bylaws themselves may provide for a specific type of voting for resolutions, but at this initial meeting, each director will have one vote and the majority of all directors must approve the bylaws. Each director will usually sign the appropriate place on the bylaws and the results of the vote will be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.

, The Articles of Incorporation usually provide for an “initial” board of directors. Those directors are the ones who attend the initial meeting and do the initial work to form the company. The initial board of directors may or may not be the same as the permanent board of directors. At the initial meeting, the initial board of directors will use the method of voting prescribed in the bylaws to elect the “permanent” board. The number of directors of the company is set forth in the company bylaws. The word “permanent” is in quotes because it refers to the newly elected board of directors, but those directors are usually up for a vote on an annual or biannual basis.

, At this initial meeting, the physical certificate of stock ownership should be authorized by way of a resolution of the board. Each state will have a procedure for the formalities required in the certificate. Many companies choose to order “corporate books” from a business supply company that come with stock certificates that can be easily filled in and given to shareholders.

, Optionally, at the first meeting you may make other resolutions necessary to begin conducting business. Such topics may include choosing a banking institution, an attorney (if one has not already been chosen), an insurance company, and/or an accountant. You may also choose to discuss employee salaries and benefits. It is not a requirement to discuss these topics at an initial board meeting, but it could be necessary in order to conduct business and therefore it may be efficient to discuss them at this time. The board may also elect to address other optional topics during the initial board meeting, in which case, the following should be considered:



Determine whether you will require shareholders to sign buy/sell agreements.
A buy/sell agreement requires a shareholder to give other shareholders or the corporation the first right of refusal if they wish to sell their shares. A sample buy/sell agreement is included in the “California Corporate Formation Information” link below.

Decide who will be authorized to sign on behalf of the corporation.
Consider which of the directors will be authorized to sign contracts on behalf of the company. Typically officers of the corporation (president, vice president, etc.) may need authorization in the interest of efficiency.

Decide if you will be an S Corporation.
An S Corporation is a corporation that elects to avoid double taxation of traditional corporations by paying taxes of the corporation at the individual level. To become an S Corporation, all shareholders must sign off of the election on IRS form 2553 and pay quarterly taxes.

Choose an accounting method.
The IRS requires corporations that have inventories to use the accrual method of accounting. The accrual method uses the terms “accounts payable” and “accounts receivable.” This means that you generate income at the time you sell your product and the buyer is liable to pay for it. Likewise, the businesses expenses are generated when the company becomes liable to pay for something.
The cash method of accounting is far simpler. It essentially works like a bank account. Income is recorded when it is received, and expenses are recorded when the business pays its bills.
The financial issues of a corporation can be quite complex. Hire a good accountant or financial adviser to advise the business about these issues.

Authorize the release of funds for initial costs and purchases.
The individuals authorized in the section above may wish to authorize the release of funds from the corporate account for any start-up costs that may arise, such as the costs of attorneys, rent, inventory, etc.

Avoid swaying.",How to Call a Meeting to Order," This is a great opportunity to set the tone, encourage people to speak up, and direct people to the seating area.Keep your body language casual by smiling and moving about the entry way.
Use casual greetings. You could try a simple, “Good morning. How’ve you been?”;
, Have brief, casual conversations with attendees. Remember to keep your topics professional.Use small talk to establish your role as chairperson in a relaxed manner. This is your opportunity to speak to attendees in your official role as meeting host. Say, ""Have you seen that news article about safer playground equipment for parks?""
Choose topics related to the meeting’s agenda so that you can gently move attendees toward the meeting’s objective. For example, if your meeting is related to park services, choose topics like recent park improvements or stories that take place in the park.

, Set an exact starting time and a projected end time. Stick to your schedule because delaying the start of a meeting costs the organization the time of each individual who sits waiting.If someone crucial to your meeting has not arrived or you are lacking a necessary quorum, address your attendees to let them know of the delay in that person's arrival. Begin the meeting and use the delay time as an open forum. Direct the discussion so that people are not sitting around waiting.
Keep in mind that if you start late, there is a likelihood that people will still leave at the originally scheduled end time because they may have scheduled other meetings or activities for later in the day.

, When the time arrives to start the meeting, rise from your seat to get the attention of the attendees and signal that you are about to begin. By standing, you communicate that you are in command of the room., Begin speaking with a generalized opening remark. This signals the opening of the meeting and draws the attention of anyone who is still occupied with a side conversation or off-task activity, such as scrolling through work email on a cell phone.


For example, say, “Good morning. Thank you for joining us today.”
Avoid informal greetings, such as “Hey, everyone.” This will set the wrong tone.

, Briefly provide your name and state your position. Even if the attendees know you, it’s important to establish that you are the chairperson. This is also the time to introduce any speakers., As the chairperson, you are responsible for establishing a start time for the record. The minutes start after the official call to order. As part of your call to order, you will also state the date and time for the record.At a formal meeting, say, “I call this meeting to order at 11:30 AM on Thursday, May 4, 2017.”
If your meeting is informal, you can vary your speech, but it’s still important to state that the meeting has begun. Rather than saying that the meeting is called to order, you could say, “We are beginning this meeting at 11:30 AM on Thursday, May 4, 2017.”

, Remind the attendees of the meeting’s objective. As the chairperson, it is your responsibility to make sure that everyone understands what is expected from the meeting and that everyone is on-task for the duration of the meeting.Say, ""We're here today to select a paint color for the new benches in Quiet Pines Park.""
Your purpose should be stated in 1-2 sentences.

, Take your seat and follow the agenda to continue the meeting. As the meeting chair, you should ensure that the meeting stays on task and that everyone's input is heard.


How much control you have over the meeting as chairperson will depend on your personal style and the culture of your organization.
Once the meeting begins, your call to order is complete.

, Eye contact increases attention, makes you more noticeable, and convinces people that what you’re saying is important.In a meeting setting, shift your gaze around the room as you speak, making eye contact with each person as your gaze passes over the room.
If you are uncomfortable, look at the center of their nose instead.
Get comfortable with eye contact beforehand by practicing on your friends, family, and coworkers. Start by looking at their foreheads, then move to the center of their noses. Finally, make eye contact for a few seconds at a time, slowly progressing to consistent eye contact while speaking.

, Standing or sitting still conveys that you are confident, so find your balance.Moving around a lot and fidgeting suggests that you are nervous or anxious, undermining your authority.Keep your hands focused on a task, such as shaking hands or notating your agenda.

, Nervous people tend to speak quickly, so be mindful of your speech. Convey confidence by speaking calmly and loudly., Keep your arms at your side. Anxious people often fold their arms or try to cover their faces., When speaking with someone, lean towards them to show that you are interested in what they’re saying and that you are active in the conversation. This shows that you recognize what others bring to the table and aren’t afraid to hear alternative points-of-view., As the chairperson, your attitude dictates the attitude of the whole meeting. To have a successful meeting, approach your role as chairperson with professionalism and an optimistic outlook. Through your body language, convey to the attendees that you expect professionalism.Smile as you speak of the organization's goals, plans, or responsibilities.

Gesture as you speak.
Say, ""We have a great opportunity to reflect the mission of our organization through the new program we've come to discuss.""

, Imagining a string pulling you up straight is the first step to maintaining good posture. Good posture shows confidence and gives you a commanding presence.


Practice standing up straight so that it’ll become a habit.
Tuck in your stomach, and let your arms hang at your sides.Push your shoulders back. You should feel your shoulder blades tighten as though they are being pulled toward each other., Keep your head straight. To have good posture, your earlobes should be even with your shoulders.Don’t push your head forward. You want to show that you are confident, not over-eager.
Don't gaze downward, which can cause you to slouch.

, Keep your feet firmly planted. While you can shift your weight from one foot to the other when you are standing for a long time, this should be a subtle shift, not a sway."

View a webinar as a ""live-web-seminar"" in each of your offices or homes, wherein the seminar is held at dozens of sites at one time, exchanging information across hundreds or thousands of miles/kilometers in all different directions, in a special kind of computer assisted ""conference call"", using your cell phone or wired phone connected for all to hear each other.,
Use a webinar hosting service to get connected.,
Realize some things that you need, although holding a webinar is easy.,
Consider, also, arranging to get information from marketing companies, technicians, or suppliers, using the webinar method -- contacting them to set up a webinar conference for your associates to meet online.",How to Arrange Live Webinar," All the participants are online, connected virtually, with the help of the web having the ease to voice questions and get verbal answers about the information you're all viewing and hearing. It overcomes distance -- gives a feeling of being on the telephone -- giving each person ease of personalizing contact with associates, as directly training users, employees or reporting results to clients and immediately exchanging ideas and getting understandings verbalized.;
, Use your favorite search engine to look for ""Webinar Hosting"" and similar key words. These there are many providers that have a wide range of pricing plans from free to several hundreds of dollars each.
Think of a webinar host as connecting at least two, and perhaps hundreds, of persons speaking and sharing by using your and their computer screens, sharing a PowerPoint (PPT) presentation (or other application) with colleagues or several associates while you talk them through the presentation. With a webinar, your client -- or hundreds of them -- can not only watch your presentation while you share it, but can also listen to you as you walk them through your presentation. The wonderful thing is that (a) your friends, associates, or potential clients can be anywhere in the world, (b) you can still have a dialogue or exchange of questions and answers during your webinar and, (c) in just about all cases only you need all the materials and the presentation software that you are sharing with them.

, (1) Since a webinar is dependent on the internet, all the participants must have access to it and should have good connectivity. (2) Before you conduct the webinar, you need to prepare strong, useful, composite visual and verbal materials that are required by the audience to be sure your message will be understood.

, Similarly if you have hired consultants to help you with your company’s growth or need them for competitive benchmarking, you can use the webinar to get the information presented to you, to understand them easily.

Start by giving your agenda a title.,
Include ""who?,
Write a brief statement of the meeting objective(s).,
Write a schedule outlining the main elements of the meeting.,
Allocate time in the schedule for any special guests.,
Leave extra time at the end of the meeting for Q&A.,
Optionally, provide an outline of the discussion topics.,

Use a template included with a word processor.,
Alternatively, download a template from a third-party source.,
Fill out the fields in your template.,
Make minor modifications to make your agenda fit your needs.,
Schedule the most important topics first.,
Stick to your agenda schedule, but be flexible.,
Start writing your agenda well in advance of the meeting.,
Share the agenda with the attendees before the meeting.",How to Write an Agenda for a Meeting," From the most beautiful literature to the driest spreadsheet, nearly every important document needs a title, and meeting agendas are no exception. Your title should tell the reader two things: First, that s/he is reading an agenda, and second, what topic the meeting is covering. When you've made a decision, place your title at the top of your blank document. The title doesn't have to flowery or complicated — in a business context, simple and direct titles are usually best.


Resist the urge to use fancy or large fonts for your title. In most situations, you'll want to use a plain, dignified font like Times New Roman or Calibri and to make your title the same size as the rest of the lettering on the document (or only slightly larger). Remember, the purpose of your title is to inform readers of what they are viewing, not necessarily to amuse or distract them.;
,"", ""where?"", and ""when?"" information in the header. Following the title, meeting agendas usually have a header which can vary in detail depending upon the level of formality your workplace encourages. This header is usually located about one line below the title. Generally, in the header, you'll want to include brief factual information about the meeting that doesn't have to do with the topic being discussed. This is so that people who aren't at the meeting can tell when and where it occurred and who was there. Below are some of the things you may want to include; regardless of the information you choose, be sure to clearly label each piece of information (bolding the label text works well here):


Date and time. These can be grouped together or in their own separate sections.
Location. If your business has multiple locations, you may want to write the address, whereas if it has just one location, you may want to name the room you're meeting in (e.g., Conference Room #3).
Attendees. Job titles are usually optional and not required.
Special individuals present. These may be special guests, speakers, or meeting leaders.

, Meetings that don't have a clearly-defined purpose risk wasting precious time as attendees decide what to talk about. Skip a line after your header and use bolded or underlined text to label your objective section with a title like ""Objective"" or ""Purpose"", followed by a colon or a line break. Then, in a few concise and to-the-point sentences, describe the items of discussion for the meeting. Aim to write about 1-4 sentences here.


For instance, if you're looking to write an objective statement for a budget meeting, you might use this one: ""Objective: Outline key budget goals for the 2014-2015 fiscal year and discuss long-term, cost-cutting measures. Additionally, R&D Director Marcus Feldman will present the results of a recent competitiveness study.""
If you've ever written in a scientific context, think of the objective statement as the meeting abstract or executive summary. You're essentially saying, in broad strokes, what you plan to be discussed at the meeting without going into detail.

, Schedules help combat a common flaw: business meetings often run far, far too long. Skip a line after your statement of the objective(s), give your schedule a bolded or underlined title, then begin making entries that correspond to the main topics of discussion in your schedule. For ease of reading, start each entry on its own line.


Label each entry with either the time you plan for it to begin and end or the amount of time you plan for each entry to take. Pick one system or the other and be consistent — mixing and matching looks unprofessional.

, If any guests are coming to your meeting to discuss topics of importance, you'll want to devote a chunk of the meeting time to these people. Plan on assigning each guest a single schedule entry even if s/he has more than one topic of discussion.This way, each one will be able to organize his or her topics as s/he sees fit.


It is best to contact the guests ahead of time to figure out how much time each one will need for their discussion topic. This helps to avoid embarrassing scheduling conflicts.

, During this time, people can ask for clarification about confusing topics of discussion, offer their own adjunct opinions, suggest topics for future meetings, and make other comments. You can make this Q&A time explicit by including it as the final entry in your schedule or you can simply bring it up yourself after the final element of the meeting.


If you reach the end of your meeting and no one has any additional questions to ask or comments to make, you can always end the meeting early. Many of your attendees will likely be thankful for this!

, Generally, the schedule is the ""meat"" of the meeting agenda — the part that people will look to to guide the discussion. However, while it isn't essential to go this extra mile, providing an additional outline of key points can be a big help for meeting attendees. An outline provides attendees a reminder of the organisation of the ideas presented during the meeting, helping jog everyone's memory of the specific topics mentioned. Below is a sample of the type of outline organization you might want to employ (see How to Write an Outline for more information):






I. High-priority Budget Items








A. Employee travel budget
B. Dealership fees








i. Negotiating a better deal?








C. Lobbying costs








II. Revenue-boosting Measures








A. Alternative service deals








i. Presenting options to customers
ii. Soliciting feedback








B. Re-investment in mobile technology








...and so on.






, Because some attendees may end up relying heavily on the meeting agenda, it's wise proofread it for errors and completeness before giving it out. Doing so isn't just a courtesy to the attendees — it also reflects positively on your attention to detail and the respect you have for them.


Additionally, ensuring there are no errors in your agenda can save you time and face.


, Many word processing programs, like Microsoft Office, Pages for Mac, and so on, have templates for a variety of personal and professional documents, which may include agendas for meetings. These templates make it remarkably quick and easy to produce a professional document. Typically, these templates are organized into logical sections with an aesthetically pleasing arrangement; all you need to do is type the relevant information into the appropriate fields and you're ready to go!


Though every word processor is slightly different, most that have the ability to use templates will allow you to navigate to the templates by using the menu bar at the top of the program window.
If your word processor can use templates, but doesn't have any templates suitable for meeting agendas, you may be able to download one from the program creator's website. For instance, Microsoft Word templates are available from office.microsoft.com, while templates for Pages for Mac can be found in the App store.

, If your word processor doesn't come with any agenda templates and you can't obtain any from the official site, don't worry — there are tons of free templates available online. A simple query on your preferred search engine for ""meeting agenda template"" should yield dozens of relevant results. However, since not all of these results will be from official, reputable sources, it's important to be discriminating when it comes to choosing which templates to use. Below are a few third-party sites you may want to visit:


Save Word Templates—This professional site offers many quality templates for Microsoft Word.
Word Templates Online— Another good source for Word templates. However, this page offers only a few options.
iWorkCommunity— a good Pages agenda template. However, this template is for older (pre-'09) versions of Pages.
The App Store also has numerous templates for Pages. Unfortunately, not all of these are available for free., Once you've located a suitable template in your word processor or downloaded one that you like, all you need to do is fill out the template with the necessary information. Most templates will have clearly-marked areas for you to type in names, times, topics for discussion, section titles, and so forth. Fill in all relevant fields to complete your agenda, then, when you're done, carefully check your work for errors. As convenient as agenda templates are, they don't protect against spelling, grammar, and factual mistakes.


Don't leave any fields blank. Nothing looks less professional than, for instance, having a schedule entry that reads only ""Type here."" If, for some reason, there are parts of the template you don't want to fill out, be sure to delete these rather than leave them unfilled.

, Templates for meeting agendas can be incredibly convenient, but there's no reason why you need to stick to the prepared style and format exactly. Feel free to make changes to the template content and style to ensure that your agenda meets the standards that your business has set and your professional preference.


For instance, if you really like the look of a certain template, but its header section is so long that it's distracting, feel free to delete superfluous areas of the header as you see fit, as long as you do so in a way that doesn't ruin the formatting of the document or negatively impact the agenda.

, When planning meetings, it's usually a good policy to front-load the schedule with the most important topics. This ensures two important things. First, it ensures that everyone will be able to discuss these important topics when they're at their sharpest and least-fatigued at the very beginning of the meeting. Second, it ensures that in the event that the meeting has to end early or certain attendees need to leave before it finishes, important topics have already been discussed.


Meetings don't always go the way you plan them to. If minor, unimportant topics get cut from the end of a meeting, it may be possible to resolve them on your own or to schedule another meeting for later. However, if you're unable to get through the biggest topics of discussion, your meeting has failed to achieve main part of its purpose, which can be considered a failure. Keeping the most important topics at the top of your schedule usually avoids this problem.

, When planning and conducting a meeting, one of the biggest dangers to look out for is the meeting going over its allotted time. Generally, employees loathe overly-long meetings, and with good reason.—They can be tremendously boring and can delay people from addressing pressing work. Ensure that your meeting stays on schedule, by keeping an eye on the clock and, when you get the opportunity, politely moving the meeting forward by saying something like, ""We should move to the next topic if we want to get out of here on time.""


However, meetings often don't go as planned, so you'll need to be prepared to adjust if one part of your meeting runs longer than you would have liked. Be flexible while trying to cover as much ground as possible in the limited time allotted for your meeting. For instance, if one part of your meeting runs long, you may need to shorten the discussion for other parts of your meeting or eliminate relatively unimportant parts of the meeting entirely to assure a timely conclusion. (You might strategically include optional elements to ease the time constraints.)

, Agendas are critical: They project a professionalism let attendees know you value their time and contributions to the organization. Therefore, ensure that you have enough time to produce a quality document by starting to write your agenda as early as you reasonably can.


Starting early also gives you the benefit of being able to solicit feedback on your agenda before the meeting and refine it. Sharing a draft of your agenda with coworkers or supervisors and asking for their input can help you fix flaws and add details that overlooked. If you wait until the last second to write your agenda, you will not have time to solicit and integrate the feedback.
While you may be able to get away with writing agendas for ordinary, everyday meetings the day before the meeting itself, important meetings may require weeks of preparation.

, This ensures that everyone arrives at the meeting with full knowledge of the topic(s) to be discussed. Depending on the company culture, this may mean printing numerous copies and delivering them in person, or simply sharing them electronically, for example, by emailing the agenda as an attachment. In either case, be sure that it is free from technical errors before sharing.


Depending on the importance of the meeting, you'll probably want to give attendees the agenda at least an hour or two before the meeting. For big, important meetings, sending the agenda a day or more in advance may be in order.
Since people are often busy, it's a smart idea to take several additional copies of the agenda with you to the meeting in case anyone forgets theirs.

Realize that the strongest choices often come from individuals—in this case, the decider.",How to Supercharge Collaborative Decisions," This person will notify the participants, prepare materials, and set the agenda.;
, The organizer/facilitator should secure a meeting place and set a time that is suitable for all those participating. He or she should notify everyone and may state the general purpose of the meeting and the expected length of the meeting—thirty minutes, including refreshments., The organizer/facilitator should gather all the ""Things You'll Need"" and prepare any crib notes to guide him or her through facilitating the meeting. This process should be completed earlier in the day or the previous afternoon.

, This may be done during the meeting by a blind draw of toothpicks (or marbles). - The individual who draws the short toothpick (odd colored marble) becomes the decider. Alternatively, the decider may be chosen ahead of time by pulling a name from a hat. A second name might be drawn as an alternate in case the first choice balks at being the decider.

, Give everyone two pieces of paper and a writing implement, then set a timer for seven to ten minutes (time set by facilitator). During this time, each person records, individually, as many pertinent ideas as he or she can.
These will not all be shared with the group, so everyone is encouraged to really open up without regard for any potential judgements. The plan is to unleash a free association of wild, loose thinking and capture all the ideas. No one has to worry about sharing dumb ideas. The facilitator should make sure to mention:


The objective of the meeting - be it to identify opportunities for new ventures, to plan an optimal transition to a new product line, whatever.

The time allotted for this task - Seven to ten minutes is really a lot of time once your mind opens itself to the task. There is no need to rush.—Just calmly note your thoughts and ideas in short bullet points.

, Set the timer for two minutes and have everyone narrow their thoughts to the two best. Each person should cross off all ideas except their two stellar insights—either whole solutions or critical components. Again, the thinking should be by individuals and be uninfluenced by what others might judge., Each person, in turn, reads their ideas while someone lists the ideas on the whiteboard. There should be no pitching of the ideas at this time, however it is fun to use inflection and vocalizing as entries are read. Everyone should, of course, be pretty hyped about the suggestions they offer and a bit of drama is encouraged.

It is best to number the choices so they may be easily referred to during the voting which follows.

, The time limit for this section of the process is three to five minutes (time set by the facilitator). Set the timer for the appropriate length of time.

Everyone selects their favorite from the list on the whiteboard and records it on a piece of paper. There is to be no discussion during this process. When each person has made their selection, they should turn their piece of paper face down and wait quietly for the others to finish.

, Each person, in turn, says aloud his or her vote while someone marks the votes by putting a dot next to the appropriate idea. Pitching your choice is permitted, but the pitch must be short (no more than one minute per pitch)., The decider makes the final call for the group and can choose to honor the votes or not.


Instead of a lot of back and forth, the decider helps to streamline the process. Each individual has had a voice and everyone in the group should have implicitly agreed that everyone will honor and support the choice of the decider. Using a decider eliminates a lot of back and forth and politicking.

, Make sure to tailor the process to your group needs, to the team members, and to what is being considered—what is ""Noted and Voted"" upon.

, These may be used on separate line items or doubled up on one item.

, Allowing alone time to consider and sift through viable options helps circumvent ""groupthink."" This results in a richer and more diverse pool of options.

, Normal meetings are linear: One person speaks while the others listen, awaiting a turn to articulate their thoughts. The thinking is normally a thought chain with one thought loosely linked to another and that to another, and so forth.
This thought chain normally proceeds along a linear path and members in the decision-making process often try to jump the thought train onto a path that follows his or her vision: Many individuals seek to invoke their visions.—Thus, in a traditional meeting, the thought train is often derailed or becomes misdirected.

""Note and vote"" isolates each thought process and, to a great extent, gets around the misdirected final outcome that often results from a traditional meeting.

, ""Note and Vote"" invokes the processing power of each mind simultaneously and taps the power of parallel processing: Many independent ideas are generated rather than one, none, or a single watered-down compromise., By voting independently, each choice reflects a unique perspective and no voice is amplified.


In other processes, votes often echo the opinion of someone who is considered wise or the ""voice of reason.""

, Listening to the perspective of others sometimes provides valuable insights which super-charge ideas., The usual meeting gives little time for focused, individual thinking. Normally, there is little engaged, creative thinking and sorting. The ""Note and Vote"" format kick-starts the creative sorting process. And, usually, a large amount of individual thinking yields better final choices.

, The decider will likely select an outcome that is superior to one arrived at in a traditional meeting, and in one-quarter of the time.

Keep track of your time.",How to Chair a Meeting," When you learn that you’ll be chairing an upcoming meeting, one of the first things you should do is to spend a little time talking to the people who will be attending (especially high-ranking or important people). Ask them if there’s anything they’d specifically like to discuss at the meeting. Take note of their answers and use them to guide you when you write your agenda.


Asking your attendees about what they’d like to discuss is a smart move not only because it makes it easier to write an agenda, but also because it engages them in the meeting process before it’s even begun. People are more likely to attend and pay attention during meetings if they know that issues important to them will be addressed.;
, A meeting agenda can be a valuable tool not just for a meeting’s chairperson, but also for the guests in attendance. Agendas contain valuable information about the meeting like when it will be, where it will take place, and who will be in attendance. Most importantly, they also outline all of the intended topics of discussion, allowing everyone to prepare. Send your meeting out in advance of the meeting itself — the more important your meeting is, the earlier you should send it.


One thing that your agenda should definitely contain is an approximate time limit for each topic of discussion. Having a rough schedule outlined beforehand makes it much easier to keep your meeting on-track. Though some items on your agenda may run long (and others may run short), a schedule makes it much easier to keep track of these items and adjust accordingly.

, The people who attend your meeting may not be up-to-speed on all of the topics you plan to discuss — some may not have attended past meetings, while others may have simply forgotten. As the meeting chair, it’s a good idea to know the history of discussion thus far. Try talking to people who attended previous important meetings to learn any important unfinished business that you should address in your meeting. You may also want to request the minutes of past meetings from an official record-keeper to help direct your planning.


The minutes from previous meetings can be an important resource to you as chair. These summarize the discussions and decisions that occurred during past meetings, making it relatively quick and easy to get up-to-speed. You may even want to distribute important meeting minutes to your attendees with your agenda.

, On the day of your meeting, you’ll want to ensure that the room or place you intend to meet in is clean, presentable, and ready to accommodate your attendees. You’ll want to make certain that any technological components of the meeting (like presentations, projectors, displays, etc.) are functioning properly and are completely ready to go — technical snafus can waste valuable time and put your meeting off track.


If you're using an electronic presentation (like PowerPoint, etc.), take a moment to familiarize yourself with the remote control or clicker you'll be using to cycle through your slides. You don't want to waste time fumbling with your controls when you could be discussing important issues.

, When the meeting reaches its scheduled start time and all of the attendees (or at least all of the important ones) are present, get the attention of everyone in the room. Introduce yourself as the chair and state the purpose of the meeting. Establish the intended time frame for the meeting by informing everyone of the ending time you're shooting for — you may run long or short, but stating your intended time limit ahead of time helps keep the meeting on-track. If some of the attendees aren't familiar with one another, take a moment to conduct a brief roll call and introduce important attendees.


Note that some businesses and organizations have strict, regimented procedures for opening and conducting a meeting. For instance, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) uses a system called Robert's Rules of Order which includes calling the meeting to order by banging a gavel and very specific rules for introducing and passing motions., At the start of meetings that are part of a long, ongoing project, you'll want to briefly catch all of the attendees up on the state of the project thus far by quickly summarizing any relevant events or decisions from previous meetings. Not everyone in attendance may be as knowledgeable about the topics of discussion as you are, so quickly bringing everyone up to speed can go a long way towards making your meeting an efficient and effective one.


Rather than summarizing previous meetings yourself, you may want to have an official scribe or record-keeper read the minutes from previous meetings to give the summary a sense of formality.
You may also consider reading any important correspondences or communications that have occurred since the previous meeting.
Note that if you provide copies of the minutes/correspondence to attendees, reading aloud isn't generally required., Next, allow people with relevant knowledge to inform the assembly of new or recent developments that have occurred since the last meeting. These can be virtually anything — for instance, new problems facing your business or organization, personnel changes, project developments, and strategy changes can all be addressed here. Meeting attendees will also want to hear about the results of any specific actions that were taken because of decisions made at the last meeting.

, If there are any problems that remain unsolved or decisions that haven't been made from the last meeting, make an effort to address these before moving on to new problems. The longer that old problems are put off, the less that any attendee will want to take responsibility for them, so try to pin down and resolve any lingering unfinished business during your meeting. Usually, unfinished business is specifically noted as ""undecided"" or ""tabled for future discussion"" in minutes from previous meetings.


Depending on the culture and rules where you work, your business or organization may have specific procedures for reaching a decision — for instance, the meeting attendees may simply need to reach a majority consensus, or a select group of high-ranking individuals may be tasked with all decision-making.
Note that some things are just too big to complete between meetings. You don't necessarily need to dwell on the progress of long-term projects that aren't finished yet. You should, however, bring up decisions or projects where present action is required.

, Next, bring up new problems, concerns, and issues that need to be discussed. These should be things that naturally stem from the developments that have occurred between any previous meetings and the present. Try to obtain concrete, definite decisions from the attendees — the more items you leave undecided, the more unfinished business you'll have to bring up next meeting.

, When you've addressed all past and present business, take a moment to sum up the conclusions of the meeting for everyone in attendance. Break down the results of all the decisions that were made and, if necessary, describe the specific actions that attendees will be expected to take before the next meeting.


This step is crucial — it's your last chance to make sure that everyone leaves the meeting knowing exactly where your projects stand and what is expected of them.

, Finally, tell everyone what to expect for the next meeting and, if you've already begun to plan it, tell them when and where to expect it to be. This helps give the attendees the sense of continuity from one important project or decision to the next and gives them a time frame for progressing or completing their assigned tasks.


Note that you don't necessarily have to plan another meeting if you address all past and present business at your current one. However, if there's enough unfinished business to warrant future discussion or you're waiting to see how certain projects develop, it's probably a good idea.

, One of your roles as the meeting chair is to keep the discussion moving and on-task. Your role is not to offer opinion on every single issue or keep the discussion on an exact schedule. Have some flexibility. Let the other attendees talk freely and allow new topics of discussion to arise even if they're not on the agenda. You may find that you need to subtly end or change certain topics of conversation to keep the discussion on track, but you shouldn't feel as if you have to control every aspect of the meeting. After all, it's a collaborative process.


As the meeting progresses, keep an eye on your agenda. If you're running behind, you may need to skip certain topics of discussion or table them for later in the interests of time. Don't be afraid to do this if the topics that are being discussed are very important ones.

, As the meeting chair, your job is to ensure an open, productive discussion. If you notice that certain attendees who may have knowledge relevant to the issues at hand aren't opening up to the group, encourage them to talk. You don't have to challenge or call them out directly — simply saying something along the lines of, ""I think Mrs. Smith's expertise would be useful here"" is a great way to get less-active members of the meeting engaged.

, It can be difficult to remember that not everyone attending the meeting has the same amount of experience or knowledge in the topics of discussion. To make sure everyone attending the meeting has spent their time wisely, you may want to take the opportunity to briefly simplify complex issues or topics when they come up. The less-knowledgeable attendees will undoubtedly appreciate this.

, If they're not kept under control by a competent chair, meetings can be remarkably unproductive. Try to make sure that every important issue you came to discuss gets addressed. Don't allow attendees to blame-shift or offer vague excuses for problems that haven't been addressed. Try to pin down and obtain answers for issues that no one wants to address. Though this isn't necessarily what every attendee will want, these sorts of awkward questions are precisely the ones that need to be answered the most for the meeting to be as effective as possible.


Make sure important decisions are recorded (if you have official record-keepers or minute-takers, assign them this task). If you're going to go the trouble of asking the hard questions, you'll want to make sure that the answers you get are well-documented.

, There's a reason meetings have a bad reputation — for many, they're thought of as serious wastes of time. To prevent your meeting from running long, use your power as chair to keep the discussion moving. Don't be afraid to table certain unimportant issues or conversations until a later date if your meeting seems to be taking longer than you expected. Be ready and willing to adjust your schedule on the fly to make sure that none of your attendees' precious time is being wasted.

Announce the session ahead of time.,
Prepare the SWOT chart.,
Add any further labeling.,
Prepare individual materials.",How to Facilitate a SWOT Session1," It is important that your employees or colleagues know to expect such a meeting in the near future. This will get their minds working on the topic and will provide for a much more productive session.


Perhaps issue some background materials on what SWOT is all about, along with some suggestions for individual preparation. It also helps to make it clear what is hoped for in terms of individual participation.;
, Use a large flip-chart to make a chart with four squares - like a tic-tac-toe chart, but 2 x 2 instead of 3 x 3.


Label the top left square “Strengths”
Label the top right square “Weaknesses”
Label the bottom left square “Opportunities""
Label the bottom right square “Threats”.

, Be sure to make it clear that the top two squares (Strengths, Weaknesses) focus in the “Internal” aspects of your organization or company. The bottom two squares focus on “External” elements; things that are not directly under your control.

, This step is completely optional but it can be helpful to guide the process, especially for beginners. You can choose to create individual SWOT charts for employees to use in the brainstorming session explained below, or you can simply have them bring their own paper and write it out themselves.

"
"
Begin the meeting.,
Brainstorm.,
Consolidate the ideas.,
Review.,
Record.",How to Facilitate a SWOT Session2," Introduce the session you are about to begin and be sure to explain how a SWOT session works, why it is important, and what you will be using the output for. This step is especially important if your employees are unfamiliar with SWOT analyses.


Ask members of the team to relate back to you what their personal understanding of SWOT is. This will help you to identify any misunderstandings and to see how well team members have grasped the purpose of this exercise.

, Beginning with internal factors, have employees think of any and all strengths and weaknesses either individually or in groups. Next, move to external factors and have them do the same things for opportunities and threats.


It can help to divide large teams into small groups of 2-4 persons for more effective brainstorming outcomes. Then bring the group together to discuss as a whole and to share the different ideas.

, On your large chart, start with one area and have employees call out the ideas they came up with. When one area has been exhausted, move on to the next until all four have been completed.

, Beginning with internal strengths and moving all the way through external threats, review what you have come up with. If necessary, add new ideas that are generated. From there, decide where your major focus areas should be based on the situation you have lined out on the chart - this may require an additional brainstorming session.

, It is extremely important that you record all of the output of the meeting to use in your subsequent planning meetings, and to refer back to as a sort of guide to see how far you have come.

Select something user-friendly that most distance attendees have installed. Make sure you've chosen software with a video component if the call includes slides. If installed software isn't a realistic option, go with a service that everyone can freely access online.


To accommodate attendees without software requirements, make sure the call takes place in a room with a speaker phone. This dial-in option will also be a handy backup if the webinar software fails.;
, Pick three to five potential dates and times of day. Send an email to all participants to gauge their availability for each possibility. Tell anyone who can't make any of the times to let you know as soon as possible.You can also use online scheduling surveys like Doodle. These tools allow attendees to choose dates and times with the click of a mouse. If you choose this option, don't forget to include the link in the email.
If all attendees are in the same time zone, avoid planning calls during lunch breaks, immediately at the beginning of the work day, and or after normal business hours.

, Include topics that need to be discussed. Cover any questions or concerns you anticipate from other members. Focus on the positive issues first. Then, address challenges and offer solutions or ideas to overcome any obstacles.If you plan to assign any tasks to certain attendees, discuss it with them before you send out the agenda. The last thing you want to do is catch someone by surprise or give a manager or client incorrect information.

, Include everything they'll require to log into the call, such as the call-in number and password. Attach a draft of the agenda to the email. Ask that everyone read over it and notify you if they want to add something or revise existing content., Choose the most responsible and attentive physical attendee for this task. Make sure they include the names of everyone present. Have them summarize major points discussed, using the agenda as an outline.If they have a digital audio recorder or record function on their phone, ask them to use it if no sensitive material will be discussed.
Don't skip this step if you're using the record function on the webinar software. Technology can fail when you least expect it. If that happens, you'll have written minutes as a backup.

, Do this on the day of the call if it's after lunch or the day before a call scheduled in the morning. Use this opportunity to send any reports or documents that will be needed on the call. It's your responsibility to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that everyone has completed their responsibilities before the call.If someone else created these materials, give them credit (or prevent blame from falling on you) by forwarding their message containing the documents.

, Flesh out items already on the agenda to keep yourself from losing focus. Don't draft a prepared statement. Stick to a bulleted list of key points, short imperatives, and incomplete sentences. This will prevent you from sounding mechanical.Some examples include:



Current state of hiring needs: Accounting now fully staffed. Still need new manager in Marketing and new administrative assistant in Advertising. Budget limit = $100,000 total for both openings.

Benefits changes: Head office phasing out 401k. Instituting new 403b plan for new hires. Health, dental, vision insurance unchanged for now but still under review.

, Include where they're from and general personal information about them. Use this info as you introduce everyone to each other. You can also use this information to chat while you’re waiting on additional attendees to join.


Make a copy of this list for your note-taker. Instead of taking the time to write out everyone's name, the note-taker can simply check off each person's name as they arrive or log in.

, Don't wait until the last minute. Start reviewing the information the day after you finish your notes and/or presentation. Try committing the major points to memory so that you can discuss them without pausing to look at your paper or screen. Every second you save can be used for other presenters or for questions.

, Make sure all equipment is present and working properly. Look for strategically positioned speakers if you're using a large room in anticipation of many attendees. If anything is missing or malfunctioning, notify the relevant department as soon as possible., Log on to the conference call 10 minutes early, if possible. Some tools won’t let you log on until the time scheduled. Others won’t let anyone communicate until a leader with a special password logs in. Test the bridge one last time to make sure it's running smoothly.If you don't know how to use the equipment, learn a few days ahead of time. Get help from your company's IT department, if necessary. Not knowing how to operate the software or hardware can make you look unprofessional., Have some notes handy to initiate small talk at the beginning of the call. Introduce all attendees by their names, titles, and roles they play. If anyone arrives or joins the call after the five-minute delay, don't interrupt a discussion in progress. Wait until after a speaker has finished or a topic has ended to allow latecomers to introduce themselves., Ask attendees dialing in to mute their phones to avoid background noise. Request that they avoid using the hold button to prevent broadcasting their company's hold music. Tell everyone physically present to silence their cell phones and keep them away from the meeting phone to prevent interference. Make sure all attendees speak audibly and clearly so that everyone can hear them., Keep an eye on the clock to accommodate the needs of attendees and presenters. Cover the most important issues first in case you run out of time. If anyone asks a question you can't answer or weren't expecting, tell them you'll get back to them as soon as possible., Don't wait until the end of the call to do this. Do it right before you get to questions and answers (Q&A) on the agenda. Ask everyone the most convenient date and time for the next call. If most attendees are undecided, send out a scheduling survey after the call., In a conference call, you might have trouble getting everyone to participate. To prevent this from happening, don't ask if anyone has any questions. Rather, ask specific people relevant to the topic of discussion a question.For example, you could ask, “Bob, have you gotten all of the information you need to create the topic text?”

, Start to wrap up about five minutes before the scheduled ending time. If Q&A is still in progress, tell everyone you have time for one more question. Thank everyone for their time and wish them a good day or week(end)., Start doing this immediately after the call. Ask your note-taker for a copy of the minutes. Make sure you include a list of everyone's responsibilities. The minutes will document the conversation in writing in case there are any discrepancies later.Ask a colleague to proofread the recap before you send it out. A second pair of eyes can catch mistakes you might have overlooked, no matter how many times you've proofread the material.

, Do this as soon as you've made any edits your proofreader has recommended. Invite all recipients to make comments or ask questions that might have slipped their minds during the call. If you promised to send out a scheduling survey for a follow-up call, include that link with the recap., Take action as discussed during the call. If you promised to answer any questions at a later date, follow up within no more than a week. Meet any deadlines you set. Make sure any promised work is delivered to the proper recipients within a reasonable amount of time.

Remember the differences between hobos, tramps, and bums: hobos are people who travel and look for work, tramps are people who travel and don't look for work, bums are people who neither travel nor look for work.,

Learn the hobo code.,
Hit the road!,
Don't hesitate to dumpster dive.",How to Become a Hobo,";
, You can time your travels to follow harvest seasons around the country or even around the globe.

, Historically, hobos have made their living from manual labor, but that doesn't always have to be the case. Any skill that is in wide demand and does not require an extended time commitment can be useful to a hobo. As long as you can advertise your services and earn people's trust (ideally through references), you can do anything. Some pursuits that lend themselves to this lifestyle are:



Landscaping and construction - Many migrant workers who cross international borders find work in this area, as it is the least demanding in terms of language barriers. Having experience is essential, however, as you'd be required to work with potentially dangerous equipment and machinery.






Farm hand - If you've ever thought about becoming a farmer, there are internships all over the world that offer housing, food, a stipend, and experience, in exchange for getting your hands dirty. You can follow harvest seasons around the country or around the globe. Progressive farms tend to provide better circumstances.







Fishing - Serve as a deckhand, cook, or fisherman as you travel the high seas.






Any web-based service such as writing, editing or programming.

, This is a serious, life-altering decision. Don't abandon everything suddenly and disappear. You need something to come back to if your life on the road doesn't work out. Make sure all your debts are paid and responsibilities are handled before departure. If possible, have some savings set aside before you go, that you can access while you're on the road, if need be. Emergencies happen, and they cost money.

, You may like the romantic idea of leaving with nothing but the clothes on your back and whatever is in your wallet, but that is a sure-fire recipe for disaster. You must assume that you will be sleeping, cooking, traveling, and essentially living outdoors, unless you decide to drive a car.


How will you get from place to place? Hobos are often associated with train-hopping, because this is what many hobos during the Great Depression did. A car can double as transportation and sleeping quarters, but keep in mind that gas is expensive, and upkeep on a vehicle is a major expense and if the expense bothers you, hitch-hiking is a good option since it's free. Some hobos prefer bicycles, but this will limit your range (to warm weather regions) and limit how much you can carry. A motorcycle can get you where you're going faster, but has maintenance requirements similar to those of a car, though not to the same degree. Buses are also an option: Greyhound, in the US at least, offers steep discounts when you purchase tickets a week in advance, and even more for still earlier purchases. Buy tickets at the station for the best deals; web purchases have an extra $3 or $4 tagged on whether the tickets are mailed or ""on call"".






Where will you sleep? Unless the place you work can offer housing, you will have to sleep in your car (if you have one), urban camp, squat in an abandoned building, or stay in hostels or motels. Another option is using the Communities Directory online to find urban co-ops, land trusts, and other alternative housing arrangements, which often welcome guests. See directory.ic.org. Yet another option is a traveler's network such as couchsurfing.com or globalfreeloaders.com, which offer free lodging to those who intend to contribute (in kind, or in other ways). Consider the costs and dangers associated with each.






Where will you take showers? Some campsites have showers, but many don't, so you may consider purchasing portable shower equipment. You can also obtain a membership to a national gym chain and use the showers there (provided you actually work out and maintain your appearance).
How will you defend yourself? A nomadic lifestyle can be a dangerous one because you're constantly putting yourself in unfamiliar situations, and you're probably alone—both of which can make you a target for theft and assault. You'll need to outline some precautions you can take, such as always letting people know where you are, carrying a cell phone - and only going places where there's a reliable signal, having an alert system or weapon on you, etc. In addition, always know where you are so when you call for help you will be able to give them a location.







, Look at maps of the areas in which you'll be traveling, and determine whether or not there's anyone you know, directly or indirectly, who lives there. Ask your Aunt Sally if your great uncle Billy still lives in that cabin in the woods. Ask your friend if his cousin still works at the car dealership in Utah. Most important of all, ask them if it's okay if you can get in touch with those people in case of an emergency. Some people might offer to make arrangements so that you can actually visit, which is always nice. (Just be a good house guest!)

, Do as much research as you can beforehand. Make a list of places you can stay, eat, shower, camp, etc. It's also wise to look up churches and shelters and any other services that are offered to the homeless. The more prepared you are, the more you'll enjoy your travels.

, Historically hobos relied on a shared system of symbols that let fellow travelers know more about their current environment.The symbols can vary from place to place and may no longer be used in many areas. Here are some symbols to get you started:


spearhead - defend yourself






circle with two parallel arrows - get out fast, hobos not welcome
wavy line (signifying water) above an X - fresh water and a campsite nearby
three diagonal lines - not a safe place.
cross - ""angel food,"" (food served to hobos after a party)

, Leave your roots behind. Find a place to live and work from day to day. See the sights of each new place you visit. Make interesting friends (you never know when they might lend a helping hand). Life on the road means that every moment is your own. With no schedule and no responsibilities (except keeping yourself healthy), you must decide how to best use your time to achieve a balance between work, travel, relaxation, and entertainment. Enjoy the variety that each day has to offer...you're earning it.

, You wouldn't believe the amount of free undamaged food that is thrown away all the time. For the best results check behind smaller grocery stores and fruit markets, as they usually don't invest money in a sealed garbage compactor (although these can sometimes be opened as well)—just be careful. Fast food chains are also usually good, but more traditional restaurants generally don't waste nearly as much food—although if you are really hungry you can usually find at least something there.

You'll need excellent reading comprehension and an ability to clearly communicate through writing in a professional tone. You can improve your reading and writing skills by reading challenging texts and writing whenever you get the chance.


Improve your reading skills by looking up words you don't know. Write them down in a journal so that you study them later.
Improve your writing skills by writing letters or emails back and forth with a family member, such as your mother or grandmother.;
, Historians all need to speak more than one language, as a general rule. This is because the documents being written at the time were often written in different languages because they came from different sources. You'll need to study from these original sources in order to learn more about history. Even as a native speaker studying the history of your own land, often you may need to read the work of diplomats, explorers, and immigrants in order to get a more complete picture. You can learn these languages cheaply from local community colleges, at the university where you get your degree, or even using online study tools (like Rosetta Stone or DuoLingo).


For studying ancient history, you'll often need to know French, German, and multiple dead languages for the area you'll study (Attic Greek, Latin, Middle Egyptian, Sumerian, etc.)
For studying medieval or European history, you'll generally need to know Latin, French and German, as well as some languages like those used by the Celts or Old Norse, depending on your area of study.
For studying North American history, you'll generally need to know Spanish and French.
Note: learning the languages prior to entering graduate study is often required.

, Historians highly value the abilities to read between the lines, infer information correctly from minimal evidence, and remove as much personal bias as possible. You'll want to practice your critical thinking skills, so that you too can be fully prepared to look at historical documents and situations from all angles.


A good way to practice is to keep up with and discuss politics and law cases.

, Professional historians will often be required to travel in order to study. Being truly comfortable with this kind of work means being able to take a 14 hour long flight and go to work the next day. It means that you need to be ready to go to a monastery in the middle of nowhere, without a single English speaker in sight. It means you need to be prepared to eat a lot of weird foods and look happy about it, because passing might offend your guests. Traveling and dealing with unusual environments is not for everyone, so if you're wanting to become a professional historian, you'll need to be sure you're up to the challenge.


You may need to consult materials in a museum across the country, or go on an archaeological dig half-way around the world. It is also very common to guest lecture at universities around the world. You'd be surprised at all of the reasons that historians need to travel.

, Historians often need to be skilled and knowledgeable in lots of different subject areas. Often historical studies will require you to have a basic understanding of statistical analysis, health problems common to the time, and even law procedures.


What areas you need to know about will vary by what era you study and what subject within that era. Play it by ear!

, Peer review is going to be the food on which you live for your entire career as a historian. It's especially important for untrained historians, since they will lack the training to analyze historical information. Essentially, it's like homework that's gotten an A. While studying, you'll need to pull your information from peer-reviewed sources and once you work professionally, you'll need to get your work peer-reviewed as well.


Basically, the way it works is that someone researches a subject and then writes about what they found out. Of course, history is very complicated and lots of guesswork and interpretation are involved. So, once a paper is done, it's given to other historians to read. They'll double check that the arguments are good and the facts are straight. Once everything is checked, the paper or book will get published by a journal or university press.

, Understanding and knowing how to use primary and secondary sources is another incredibly important skill for a historian. Primary sources are sources that were written at the time, by the people who actually experienced the event or close to it. Secondary sources are sources that were written after the fact or are studies of events that happened. Marcus Aurelius wrote primary sources. Historians write secondary sources.


As a historian, you will rely on primary sources (with greater degree, the further you get into school and your career). Secondary sources will be supplemental but will still be used when doing your own research.
Secondary sources are considered not as good as primary sources because not only are you getting the bias and filter of the original authors and people experiencing the events, you're getting the bias and filter of the secondary author. This can make the information skewed at best and wrong at worst.
This skill is especially important for casual, at-home historians. You will have less training in distinguishing sources and companies looking to make money off of enthusiasts will try to take advantage of you and sell you secondary sources as if they are as reliable as primary sources.

, Professional historians are required to have a degree in history or a related subject (such a anthropology). You'll need to get a BA and then an MA and PhD or a combined MA/PhD. You can get your Associates degree at a cheap community college but you'll need to get your BA from the best university you can get in to. History is a very competitive field and going to a good school will help you get into the graduate programs which are often held at very prestigious universities.


Usually, about 10 years of post-high school education are necessary to complete the education you need to get a job in the field. Some jobs, such as lower level museum jobs, you can get with only an MA however, which works out to about 6 years of college.

, Of course, in order to make it in this competitive field, you'll need to get outstanding grades. Graduate schools generally require a minimum 3.4-3.5 GPA. Study, study, study, get tutors, an any extra help that you possibly can.

, As you progress through school, usually between your second and third year of your BA, you'll choose an area of history to focus in. This area will be your specialty. You will probably also take classes in secondary focus areas, often ones that are related to your major field.


Example areas of interest include: Ancient history, Medieval history, Early Modern history, American history, history of the Middle East, Ancient East Asian History, Modern East Asian History, history of science and technology, history of medicine, and other fields of study.

, Having a good relationship with your professors will be crucial to you succeeding as a historian. They will need to write you recommendations to get into graduate school and they will provide you with a lot of guidance along the way. They might even end up being your colleagues someday. Make a good impression by looking and acting professional, and make use of their office hours so that you can get to know each other. Speaking up in discussions and lectures is also helpful.

, You'll need to complete your BA with a minimum 3.4 GPA in your major in order to get into graduate school. Completing a BA generally takes about 4 years, but you can probably complete it in 3 if you work hard and smart. You will want to take language courses as your electives when possible in order to speed up the process.

, Applying for graduate school usually means taking a test, such as the GRE, and then filling out applications. Often the applications will have a number of essays. You'll also need three recommendation letters from professors that you studied under. You'll need a significant writing sample, which will usually be your undergraduate thesis paper. Doing extra things to make yourself appear better to the school is also a good idea.


You can try to get your work published somewhere or volunteer with a museum. For research fields that require fieldwork, getting a spot on a dig can also look good on an application.

, Graduate school usually entails a small number of extra classes, more language classes, but mainly actual experience in the field. You'll be doing research, writing your dissertation (and possibly an additional MA thesis), and interning in museums or getting other experience. Often graduate students are called on to TA and then teach lower level classes.


In the study of history, most graduate school students will receive a tuition waver in exchange for work.
While working on your graduate degree, you will significantly narrow the area of study you work in. For example, you might be researching and studying only marriage and family relations for the era you specialize in. Economics, military, international relations, and trade are other common areas of study.

, While in graduate school, you will be required to write a dissertation in order to earn your PhD. This is a book-long research paper which significantly contributes to the field you work in. Generally for historians, working on this dissertation is all you do in order to earn your PhD and other classes will likely not be taken unless you want to take them (meaning that really, you get many years to work on the paper).


Don't worry: you will have a professor who supervises your work and helps you find an appropriate topic.
When you are done, you will be required to defend your thesis to a number of professors at your institution, in order to complete your degree.

, Once you graduate with your PhD, you'll need to find work as a historian. Your university will usually help you find a position and may even offer you one themselves. You might go on to work for a museum, teach at a university, work in the field, or even work for other institutions (like the government).


You can often find job listings by visiting the websites for the institutions you are interested in working with. Doing this before you get your degree can be helpful, because it can give you an idea of the kinds of qualifications they're looking for. You can also find work by attending conferences and networking with people.

, While you work as a historian, it is generally required that you continue to research and publish in your area of expertise. You will likely travel in order to get the documents you need. You will also go to conferences where you will hear and give lectures about your area of interest. You may write books, which will often either be published by your university or by another university press. Writing articles for peer reviewed journals is also required.


Generally, you will be expected to publish around one journal article every two years, and write a book every 5-10 years.
You may be given what is called a sabbatical in order to write your book or do other major research. This is essentially a year long paid vacation, except that instead of sitting on a beach you sit in a library. Which is almost as nice to a historian.

, You can audit classes from a local college or university, which allows you to take the college courses but not get credit for it or be allowed to do much of the homework. It is, however, a great learning experience. If you're well into your years as it is, you may also find that your local college has a great continuing education program, which provides classes to adults for much cheaper rates than those trying to get a degree.

, Read lots of books about history. Make sure that the books you read are peer reviewed or from otherwise good sources. When you see a serious history book, it should have a long list of citations at the back of the book or in footnotes. Be wary of sensationalist books. These are usually just trying to get you to spend money on the book, and are often poorly researched or just wrong.

, TV shows and documentaries will often twist facts and even manipulate interviews with experts in order to make the subject sound more interesting or support the premise of their show. Even the best TV sources, like PBS, have been guilty of this. You're better off with books written by experts than anything you find on TV.


Such things are fun to watch, however. Don't feel bad if you want to watch them for fun. But it is important to realize that you shouldn't pull your information from them.

, You can often find special lectures at nearby colleges that are either ticketed or just open to the public, where a special speaker is brought in to teach a one-time lesson on a subject. You can also ask the history professors at local colleges and universities if they're okay with you sitting in on the occasional lecture. They'll usually be supportive and allow it, as long as you are quiet and well behaved.

, By going to museums you will not only help yourself to learn more about history, you'll also be helping those organizations raise money. That money gets used for research and preservation, which is very important to the study of history.


Ask your local museum about other ways you can help too. They will often need volunteers or people to help out at fundraisers.

, Contribute to the study of history by doing your part to create and maintain the historical record. Do interviews with the elderly, keep a journal of your own experiences, maintain historical documents like significant newspapers, and find other ways to record events as they happen. This will give future historians material to study and work with.

Consider becoming a Marine officer.,
Contact a recruiter by going to Marines.com.,
Go to MEPS.,
Take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB).,
Tell your family.,
Go to boot camp.,
Graduate.",How to Become a Marine," In the Marine Corps, you must pass a physical fitness test (PFT) every six months. A perfect score (300) is achieved by doing twenty dead-hang pull-ups(no time limit), 100 crunches in 120 seconds and a three-mile run in 28 minutes.

You don't need to be perfect to enlist, but make sure you can do at least two pull-ups, 60 crunches and run 1.5 miles (2.4 km) in 12 1/2 minutes.
The stronger you are, the less torturous boot camp will be.



 

;
, Although ""Every Marine is a Rifleman,"" there are hundreds of different jobs in the Marine Corps.

Each job is called a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS). By doing a little research, you should be able to find what suits you.
The Marine Corps offers jobs in everything from infantry, to photography, to truck drivers. Eventually your contract will end or you will retire, so pick something you think will help you make a living in the civilian world.







, If you want a higher position and more respect go to college and contact a marine recruiter after you finish your freshman year. They will take a look at your grades and physical ability. If you're eligible you will be sent to PLC (platoon leaders class). This is for six weeks for two separate summers. Or if you already have your bachelor's degree you will be sent to OCC (Officer Candidate Course), a ten week program.

, They'll see if you're eligible and guide you through all the paperwork. You can even do this first, before you do anything else, and he/she will guide you through everything.

, The Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) is where you will get medical screenings and tests, to evaluate if you are eligible to join any military service. A drug test and a physical will be administered among other things. Typically MEPS are located near big cities. If you live far enough you will be taken to a hotel where you will stay the night. Be prepared to wake up early in the morning and leave late in the afternoon, the process is a lot of sitting and waiting. It is here you will take the oath of enlistment. You will also go to MEPS again before shipping out to boot camp, the process will be shorter though., This is the test to determine what jobs (MOS's) you are eligible for. Many high schools offer the ASVAB to its juniors and seniors, at no cost. Ask your school if they offer the test and register for it. ASVAB scores are good for 2 years, when you visit your recruiter, give your score. If you haven't taken the ASVAB it will be given while your at MEPS. Make sure you study for this because certain jobs in the Corps require higher scores than others.

, Expect to hear some whining and crying. Stick to your guns. If you've decided to ""man up"" and do it, then do it. Just wait till they see you graduate boot camp and they're bawling their eyes out because they're so proud.

, If you live east of the Mississippi River you'll go to Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) Parris Island, S.C. If you reside west of the Mississippi River you'll go to MCRD San Diego, Ca. However all females regardless of residence attend Parris Island.

, It is here that those torturous 13 weeks of bootcamp have ended. And now you will stand as a proud Marine in front of your family. However it doesn't end here, there is still more training to be done before you will go out to the fleet. But in that moment you have joined the Few, and the Proud, and have earned the title of a United States Marine.

Applications are accepted from men who are 28 years old or less. You may request an age waiver (for those 29 to 30). Age waivers are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
If you are 17, you may enlist with a signature from a parent.
If you have previous Navy SEAL experience and would like to become an officer, you are eligible up to age 33.


SEALS must have under 20/70 vision, and it must be correctable to 20-25 vision. The worst eye can be 20/70, while the best eye 20/40






All types of color blindness are disqualifying.


In order to be a U.S. Navy SEAL, one must be a native-born or naturalized United States citizen, and must speak, read and write English fluently.






Upon enlisting in either the Navy or to be a SEAL, you'll need to pass a secret security clearance. In order to do so, it's important to have a blemish-free record. If you were planning on a committing a felony any time soon, change your plans.






It's important that you are not only physically sound, but mentally and psychologically sound as well. These traits will be assessed during your training.

;
, There is not an adjective in the English language that can adequately describe the training you'll be going through. Horrendous, immensely draining, designed to push you to your limits, and at times torturous only begin to describe it. Start well before you begin training. The SEAL website has a training guide that you should get started on pronto that's available here.


Though it's not necessary, it's a good idea to hone your swimming and SCUBA skills sooner rather than later. Though they will take the time to teach you, it'll be that much easier if you already know how to do it.







, In order to become a Navy Seal, you must enlist in the military. Visit your recruiter and tell them of your intentions. They will ask you about all the above requirements and administer a practice ASVAB (the test you'll be taking to determine your mental aptitude).


It's important to tell them that you want a SEAL Challenge Contract. If you enlist in the Navy and then decide to become a SEAL, you do not get a $12,000 SEAL sign-on bonus. You'll get a bonus, it just won't be as steep.
When visiting the recruiter, take with you your birth certificate, Social Security card, a 10-year history of where you lived and worked, three references with name, phone number, and address, and the names and addresses of people who can verify this information.

If all goes well, the Navy recruiter will put you in touch with the regional Naval Special Warfare/Special Operations Mentor or coordinator. They will help you train for your PST (Physical Screening Test). They will also give you your Delayed Entry Program qualifying PST. Specific locations and information are given out on a need-to-know basis, but more information can be found on the SEAL/SWCC website.



, You will be required to take the ASVAB to join the military. Your scores on these tests determine the Navy jobs or ""Rates"" for which you are eligible. You must score well enough to qualify for the SEAL program. The ASVAB test is made up of tests in the following subject areas:


Word Knowledge
Paragraph Comprehension
Mathematics Knowledge
Arithmetic Reasoning
General Science
Auto and Shop Information
Mechanical Comprehension
Electronics Information
Numerical Operations
Coding Speed (this is optional and should be requested at your Military Entrance Processing Station. If it's not requested, there is only one way to calculate your score; requesting this gives you more flexibility).

You'll want an Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) score (another qualifying test) of 78 or better. Men with this score and higher typically succeed at BUD/S.



, Because of the elite-ness of the SEAL qualification, you cannot jump right in and get a SEAL contract. You must first start out with your Navy contract that will be superseded by your SEAL contract in time.


On this day, you will take your ASVAB, get a physical (vision, hearing, range of motion, drug testing, medical history), and get a background screening. You will be told whether or not you qualify to become a SEAL. You will then need to sign the contract, taking any other job classification.

This contract will have a boot camp date on it. This is for the Navy. Disregard this. After you take your PST (you're ""Delayed Entry,"" remember?) and pass, you'll start your SEAL training instead.



, To say this test is strict is an understatement. SEAL training is very difficult and there is a high drop out rate during training. Below is the list of physical screening tests. All times are approximate.


Event: 500-yard swim using breast and/or sidestroke






Allowable Time: 12:30 Minutes
Competitive Time: 9:30 Minutes
Rest Period: 10 Minutes


Event: Push-ups






Allowable Time: 2:00 Minutes

Allowable Time: 10:30 Minutes/Seconds
Minimum Repetition: N/A
Competitive Repetition: 10:20 Minutes/Seconds
Rest Period: N/A



, Now that you've signed your Navy contract and taken the PST, you are now allowed to receive a SEAL contract. Your Special Warfare/Special Operations mentor will help you along this process. If all is fine, you will be reclassified into the SEAL program and a new contract (replacing the old one) must be signed.


There is another PST you must take two weeks prior to SEAL boot camp in order to keep your contract. Do not let up on your training. If you do not pass PST 1 or 2 (or any other future PST), you will be taken off the SEAL pipeline and put in another area of the Navy., Here you'll have another initial PST and a closing PST (that's harder than the first one -- a timed four-mile run and a timed 1000-meter swim). It's basically boot camp. Intense boot camp.


This lasts for 8 weeks. If you make it through, you'll be shipped off to BUD/S in Coronado, CA. If you don't, you'll be placed in another division of the Navy., That stands for Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL. It is a 24-week challenge that will develop you into a mental and physical machine. Each week you will be required to show sufficient improvement. Because of its nature, only 25% make it to the end. BUD/S includes three phases:


Phase I is ""basic conditioning,"" focused on mental and physical ability.
Phase II covers underwater skills such as combat swimming and SCUBA diving.
Phase III, on San Clemente Island, will teach weapons, demolitions and navigation skills and basic, small-unit tactics.

, This is the first 3 weeks of BUD/S. It will introduce you to the instructors and the lifestyle to be expected. You will get a sense of the training and be prepared to begin the first real phase.


Get ready to hear some not so pretty things. You'll be doing things like drown-proofing -- where you have to swim with either your legs or hands bound -- and surf torture -- where you're exposed to cold water for minutes on end, ordered to do calisthenics, and possibly even run miles in your cold, wet clothes. Then, you'll just be ordered back into the water., This lasts 7 weeks and is gruesome. It's where the most Drops on Request (DOR) get filed.Those activities mentioned above happen during this stage, along with running 4 miles (6.4 km) in boots, 2 mile (3.2 km) swims in the ocean, participating in timed obstacle courses, and learning small boat seamanship.Fourth week of this Basic Conditioning is affectionately known as ""Hell Week."" You will be training for 5 1/2 days continuously with 4 hours of sleep total. This is the ultimate test of your physical and mental motivation. You will learn that you can do a hundred times more than what you thought you could ever do and learn how to depend on your team. If you make it through this torturous week, you'll spend three weeks gladly making surveys, charts, and being more academic., During this time, you will be trained as a combat swimmer. The second phase of this portion concentrates on SCUBA skills -- both open and closed circuits (compressed air and 100% oxygen). You'll also learn some medical skills as well.


You'll be doing long-distance underwater dives. Actually, you'll learn how swimming is a mode of transportation. This is unique to SEALs and sets you apart from other Special Operations forces., For these next 7 weeks, you'll be trained in basic weapons, demolition and small-unit tactics, with the last half on San Clemente Island. But your initial skills aren't forgotten -- in fact, the ante is upped yet again. You'll need to run, swim, and negotiate the obstacle course even faster than before.


You'll also be doing some sophisticated land navigation, patrolling techniques, rappelling, marksmanship and military explosives. Thankfully it's not all surf torture and drown-proofing!, Having made it through BUD/S (hats off to you!), you'll be taken to do static line and free-fall training at Tactical Air Operations in sunny San Diego, CA. The emphasis here is to everything as safely as possible. If you had vertigo or acrophobia up until this point, you might want to consider getting over it.


You'll be starting off simple, with basic static line jumps to free falls to accelerated free falls to accelerated free falls with combat equipment to accelerated free falls with combat equipment from 9,500 feet (minimum)., SQT includes Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) School and Tactical Air Operations. It's another 26 weeks honing your mental and physical prowess.


You'll be taking this time learning TTPs; that's Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. You'll be put through cold-weather survival, marine operations, advanced combat swimming, close-quarter combat and land-warfare training, rendering you virtually immortal. Perhaps more importantly, you'll be working as part of a platoon and as a valuable member of a team., After graduating from SQT, you're a Navy SEAL, worthy of your crown. Congratulations and take a nap. However, the training isn't over. You'll get advanced training and eventually get assigned to a SEAL team.

, Navy SEALs get specialized -- advanced training could be in foreign language study, SEAL tactical communications training, Sniper, Military Free-Fall Parachuting, Jump Master (Static line and Military Free Fall) and use of Explosive Breachers, to name just a handful. Then there are those that go the medical or officer route. Which speaks to you?


A Navy SEAL is a Navy SEAL. Once you have this designation, you've already risen to the top. Now it's time to just home in on what you're naturally good at and thrive on it.
Depending on the route you take, you will either go to Virginia Beach, VA, Pearl Harbor, HI, or Coronado, CA., Once you do this, you'll begin advanced training that lasts around 18 months. You'll be going through Individual Specialty Training, Unit Level Training and Task Group Level Training. Whatever rating you chose will determine how you progress from here.


If you have a medical rating, you will attend the Advanced Medical Training Course 18D first for 6 months to become a SEAL medic. This is in Fort Bragg, NC.
If you are choosing to go the Officer route, you will attend the Junior Officer Training Course to learn about operations planning and how to brief and manage teams., Now that you have skills that could rival any superhero, it's time to put them into action. Most deployments last around 6 to 8 months and could really include anything. You could be traveling by parachute, submarine, helicopter, on foot, or combat swimming. Either way, you'll be maneuvering highly specialized, ridiculously challenging warfare missions that are beyond the scope of standard military forces.Do Navy SEALS have to kill people? The SEAL/SWCC website says quite carefully, ""The Navy SEALs train for war and fight to win. The execution of a SEAL's duties is swift and violent when required yet guided by the principles that he serves to defend.""

, Being a Navy SEAL will present you with a number of opportunities, from educational to professional. The Navy offers schooling to make you an expert in virtually anything -- from chemical and biological warfare to military tactics to deep-sea diving. You can even get college credit!After the Navy, you will always be a Navy SEAL. Having that title shows the world that you successfully completed some of the most rigorous training America has to offer. Your future will be full of opportunities.

Attain two compatible part-time jobs.,
Keep your schedule consistent.,
Be honest with those around you.,
Plan your week ahead of time.,
Keep your jobs separate.",How to Work Two Part Time Jobs Instead of One Full Time Job1," In order for you to work two part-time jobs, they need to occur at different times. Search out part-time work in your area through various channels. Look for jobs that occur on different days of the week, or different times of day. Another option is to find one job that involves working from home. You may try online resources (like Monster, Glassdoor, or Career Builder), look on Craigslist, or search in your local newspaper. Carefully follow the instructions on the job calls, submit the necessary materials, and with any luck, participate in some interviews.


Be strategic with the jobs you select.
Two very different jobs will give you more variety and keep you on your toes.Two very similar jobs may help you if you’re on a specific career path.Be sure you are looking for part-time work.;
, The smoothest way to accomplish working two part-time jobs is to figure out, and maintain, a consistent schedule. If you can keep your schedule the same from week to week, working both jobs will become a comfortable routine., It may be tempting to try and keep your jobs secret from one another. However, if your employers and/or clients are aware that you’re working multiple jobs, they can give you the time you need to get things done. They may be more respectful of your schedule. They may view you as an even harder worker.Make sure each employer understands that you can only work part-time from the beginning.
The sooner you inform your employers of one another, the better. You may consider mentioning it in your interview.
You may say, ""Will it be possible to maintain a consistent work schedule? I work Mondays and Wednesday evenings for , so I will not be available. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays you will have my full attention.""

, If you’re not able to keep a consistent schedule from week to week (or even if you are), it is a fantastic idea to sit down and plan your whole week in advance. Use a paper planner, or an online one, to pencil in both jobs, commuting times, breaks, and any other obligations or chores. Use different colors for various activities to help keep you organized., It is important to resist overlapping your jobs and trying to do both at once (such as being logged into a telecommuting job, while on the clock at your office job). Combining jobs may seem like an efficient use of time, but in actuality, you will make mistakes and both jobs will suffer."

Create a sleeping environment that prevents interruptions.,
Eat healthy foods.,
Exercise regularly.,
Maintain your social life.,
Transition easily into working a midnight shift.",How to Work Midnight Shift," The average person requires at least 8 hours of sleep per night to function optimally, so you must ensure that your sleeping environment supports your schedule.


Sleep in a dark room. Since the human body is biologically designed to stay awake during sunlight hours, you must trick your body into thinking it's dark out by blocking out sunlight. In addition to helping induce REM sleep, the melatonin hormone is produced at night in the dark to prevent tumor developments. Exposing your body to sunlight while you sleep will suppress your body's ability to create melatonin. Methods to block sunlight include hanging dark curtains or shades over your windows, as well as wearing a sleeping mask.
Eliminate noise. Since the majority of people are awake during the day, you may be exposed to sounds of traffic and neighbors while you sleep. Methods to block out noise include wearing earplugs or running a fan in your bedroom, which usually blocks out background noises. Turn off your phone or pager before sleeping to avoid interruptions.
Establish a bedtime ritual and sleeping routine. Before going to sleep, perform a relaxing activity to help you unwind from your shift such as reading a book, listening to soft music, or taking a warm bath. You should also maintain a consistent sleeping schedule even on your days off to adapt your body to working the midnight shift.;
, Since the majority of restaurants are typically closed during the midnight shift, it's crucial to focus on maintaining a healthy diet. Prepare your meals at home and bring them to work to avoid eating vending-machine snacks or other unhealthy foods. You will also want to limit caffeine to the hours prior to your shift or at the beginning of your shift.

, In addition to helping you stay fit, exercise will naturally increase your energy, positively impact your mood, and will also help you sleep better. Perform exercise before you begin your shift or during your breaks. Avoid exercising within 2 hours of going to sleep to prevent increased heart rate and restlessness so you can fall asleep on time.

, Make time to call your loved ones and friends from work or during your break and make plans with them on your days off work to maintain social ties. You should also publicize both your work and sleeping routines to friends and family to help them understand and be aware of your current lifestyle.

, Although it may seem difficult to adjust your body's sleeping patterns, there are steps you can take to prepare for daytime sleeping.


Take daily naps between noon and 5 p.m. before beginning a midnight shift. Not only will naps help increase your alertness and performance, but your body naturally experiences increased sleepiness during these hours.
Turn on bright lights between the hours of 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. Bright lights will help decrease your sleepiness, especially when the peak of sleepiness occurs during these hours.
Establish a caffeine strategy and schedule. Caffeine will stimulate your body during the midnight shift and wear off before your shift ends when taken right before or at the beginning of your shift. Try to avoid caffeine a few hours before you go to sleep.

Aim for a short commute.,
Make a daily checklist.,
Set limits for yourself.,
Plan some breaks.,
Truly take some time off.",How to Work Two Part Time Jobs Instead of One Full Time Job2," One of the keys to managing two part-time jobs is keeping your stress-level low. One way to accomplish this is to aim for a minimal commute. If both of your jobs are close to one another (and ideally also close to home), then you will be able to travel between them more easily. This will minimize the time you could spend worrying about getting to work on time. Keep location in mind when selecting your jobs.If working two jobs close to each other is not an option, consider working different jobs only on different days.
This way, you won't need to travel between them.

, In addition to maintaining a consistent schedule and planning your week ahead of time, it is important to create a new checklist each day. When you are working more than one job, it can be easy to get confused and let obligations slip. Instead, each morning sit down and make a list of everything you need to accomplish that day at each of your jobs. Then when you are at work, simply move down the list, tackling projects one by one., An important component of managing multiple jobs is remembering to sometimes say “no.” You are not going to be able to always take the overtime, or the extra project, or attend every training seminar. Working multiple jobs will have you stretched thin, and you will need to protect the precious time that you have.Set limits for yourself, such as maintaining one full day off each week, never working past 7:00pm, or never exceeding 50 hours per week.

, Along the same lines as setting limits, it is crucial for you to plan some breaks into your work schedule. If you do not prioritize taking breaks, you are likely to burn out. When you are figuring out your schedule, aim for at least a two-hour break between jobs, and one full day off each week., In order for your breaks to be effective, you must really use them as breaks. When you’re not working, don’t think about work. When you are on break, don’t check email or try to get caught up on work-related tasks. Instead, spend time with friends and family, simply sit and enjoy a meal, or do something else fun to get your mind off of work."

Work out a budget.,
Plan your meals.,
Find time to exercise.,
Talk to your family.",How to Work Two Part Time Jobs Instead of One Full Time Job3," When you have more than one revenue stream, it is important to keep careful track of your income and spending. Take some time to figure out how much money you plan to bring in, and how much you will need to spend on expenses. Make sure you plan to put some money away in case of emergency.You may need to consider budgeting some extra money for health insurance.
When working two part-time jobs (instead of one full-time job), you may not be offered insurance through your work.

, When you are working two part-time jobs, you will not have as much time to prepare healthy food. As such, it is important to take some time to plan your meals ahead of time. Otherwise, you will end up wasting money on quick food options and jeopardizing your health.Consider using a slow cooker. You can add ingredients before work and come home to a nice meal.
Consider making large batches of food on your day off and eating leftovers throughout the week.

, With so much time spent working and commuting, it may be easy to let exercise go by the wayside. However, working toward good health will be a crucial factor in allowing you to maintain both jobs effectively. This will help you reduce stress and stay focused.Set aside just 20-30 minutes per day to do something active.
Try taking a walk on your lunch break, doing a quick yoga practice before work, or completing a step-aerobics video in the evening.

, Whenever you make a big life change, it is important to talk things over with your family. The decision to work two part-time jobs can have a big effect on your spouse and/or kids. Be sure to talk things over with them and work together to make a plan. This way, you can effectively juggle home responsibilities as a team.There are several ways that this change can impact your family. It is a good idea to touch on all that affect you.
These can include: more time away from home, less income coming in, general busyness, and a general change-up of normal routines.

As soon as you get up, do something to get some sunlight. Try pulling back the curtains in your bedroom or stepping out on the porch for a few minutes. This may help wake you up, allowing you to proceed through the morning with more focus.During winter months, you may want to invest in a light therapy box. This is a device that simulates sunlight that you can purchase online or at a department store.

, Use a timer on your phone or alarm clock. Set the timer to go off every 10 to 15 minutes, and keep an eye on the time. Try to keep every aspect of your routine, such as breakfast and showering, within short time frames. This will help you keep your pace up, allowing you to get out the door in time for your early shift.Keep in mind, this may be tricky for the first few days. You may not hit all your timeframes exactly, but stick with it and eventually you'll be breezing through your morning routine.

, If you have an early shift, do not skip breakfast to save time. Breakfast is a vital component of a morning routine. As you've gone 8 hours without food, you'll have an energy deficit in the morning that can be fixed with a healthy breakfast.Pick a healthy breakfast that energizes you. If you tend to feel an energy boost after some protein, try hardboiled eggs. If you tend to thrive on carbs, choose a healthy and complex carbohydrate like oatmeal.
Also, in the interest of time, pick something quick to prepare. Try instant oatmeal or purchase precooked hardboiled eggs at the store.

, If you have time, a mild amount of physical activity can help wake you up. Exercise increases blood flow, providing an instant boost of energy.If you regularly hit the gym before work, that can help. However, you do not need to engage in intense physical activity in the morning. Even quick, light activity can wake you up for a day of work.
You can try taking a brisk walk around the block, doing some light gardening, or even striking a few yoga poses in your living room. All of this can help wake you up in the morning.

, Some studies indicate your brain releases dopamine in response to music you enjoy. Try listening to your favorite song or band in the morning. This may have a stimulating effect on your brain, allowing you to go into the day with energy.Consider having a morning playlist that you listen to first thing in the morning.
You can also set your alarm to be one of your favorite songs. This can give you an instant energy boost as soon as you climb out of bed.

, If you're in a hurry to make an early shift, it's a good idea to try and shower more efficiently. If you can cut down your shower time, you can sleep for a few extra minutes each morning.Instead of using shampoo and then conditioner, try a 2-in1 combination.
Time yourself as you shower. Set a timer and keep an eye on it, striving to keep your shower time within that frame.
Use lukewarm water instead of hot water. This will motivate you to get out of the shower quickly.

, Caffeine can be helpful to get you through an early shift. However, moderation is key. About two or four cups of coffee should provide you with a boost in energy. Anymore will likely result in your feeling jittery and may cause a crash later on., Sugary energy drinks, sodas, and other sweets may give you a quick boost of energy. This will not last. You'll end up crashing later, feeling more tired than you were before that soda or donut. Instead, stick to healthy, energizing snacks throughout your shift.A salad with lean protein, like chicken, can be an energizing lunch for a long day. Anything rich in lean protein, complex carbs, and vegetables is a great lunch to keep you energized during work.
If you have a sweet tooth you want to indulge, go for fruit or yogurt over products with a lot of added cane sugar.

, If you had to wake up earlier than usual, your attention span may waver during work. If you get breaks, take them when you begin to feel restless. Brief breaks can help you stay focused during an early morning shift.Try going for a 15 minute walk during break time. A small amount of exercise can give you a boost of energy.
You can also use a short break to go into the break room and have a healthy snack. You may also want to grab a cup of coffee, if you had not had more than 2 cups that morning.

, Drinking water throughout the day can help you feel alert for several reasons. First, if you're getting up to refill a glass of water every hour or so, you're staying active. This can keep you engaged. Second, you may have to use the bathroom more. You're less likely to nod off during work if you have a full bladder.You can keep a water bottle at your desk and occasionally refill it in the break room. You can also make use of any water fountains in your office. Take any chance you have to stop and get a drink of water.

, You'll thank yourself when rushing through your morning routine if you've prepared beforehand. Pick out the clothes you're wearing for the next day and set them out on a desk or shelf. That way, you won't have to scramble to choose an outfit in the morning. You could also set up your coffee maker to go off in the morning. If you wear makeup, pick out the types you'll be using that day. Set up a makeup station for yourself before a mirror.

, If you want to stay alert for your morning shift, work on getting high quality sleep the night before. In the 45 minutes before bed, try to engage in an activity that relaxes you. This will signal to your brain that it's time to wind down and sleep. It will also help you take your mind off any stressful thoughts that may keep you up at night.Do something that you enjoy and that helps you calm down. You can read a book, take a warm bath, or do a crossword puzzle.
Watching television may be a bad idea, as the light from the TV can stimulate the brain. However, a short amount of a relaxing program may be helpful. If you want to watch TV before bed, stick to lighthearted programs over dramas or news shows.

, The light from computer screens, laptops, and phones can stimulate the brain, much like sunlight. Using electronics shortly before bed can make sleeping difficult. Keep things like laptops out of your room and do not use them when you're trying to wind down for rest.If you have trouble staying away from your computer or phone at night, there are many programs and applications you can download that block some of the light from the screen. These programs can help you use your electronics close to bed time without them having as harsh an effect on your sleep., It's a good idea to evaluate your room to make sure it's optimal for high quality sleep. An uncomfortable sleeping environment can keep you up at night.Make sure your room is the right temperature. A temperature between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit is optimal for positive sleep. If your room is warmer, consider a fan or air conditioning.
Make sure your bed is comfortable. Avoid sheets and pillows made from materials that cause irritation.
Work on blocking out noise and light. Make sure your curtains close all the way, preventing the light from a streetlamp from getting into your room. If there's a lot of noise from outdoors coming in, turn on a fan or white noise machine to block out the sound.

, If you're having trouble falling asleep, try some relaxation techniques. Things like breathing and meditative exercise can help turn your mind down, allowing you to fall asleep faster.Try tensing your toes, counting to ten, and then releasing them. Count to 10 again and then repeat the process 10 times.
Tune into your sense. Pay attention to your breathing, any sounds you hear, how your body feels against the mattress, and other sensations.
You can also make a list before bed. If you have trouble sleeping due to stress about the coming day, try making a short list before bed of everything you need to do tomorrow. This can help get your mind off the coming day, allowing you to relax and fall asleep.

, If you frequently work early morning shifts, work on setting up a sleep schedule for yourself. Your body has a natural circadian rhythm that responds to a regular sleep/wake cycle. If you go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each day, even weekends, you'll end up feeling energized in the morning and tired at bedtime. This can help you easily adapt to an early work schedule."

Make a list of long term goals (one year or more) you wish to achieve as a freelancer.,
Don't go overboard.,
Create a rough schedule.,
If you've never tried sticking to a schedule, start with something small and gradually work your way up.,
Create something you can easily stick to, but still boosts your productivity.,
Investigate your options.,
Pursue opportunities providing experience.,
Consider the payment.,
Give blogging a try.",How to Stay Busy As a Freelancer," Keep your goals realistic and attainable. These long term goals can be broken down into short term goals (less than one year- typically 6 months or fewer) and from then you can start establishing daily goals.


Ex: If your goal is to write about 2,000 words per week, your short term/daily goal would be to write about 300 words per day.;
, Two or three well thought-out long term goals should be enough. If you find yourself writing a long list of vaguely detailed goals, you need to imagine the big picture and ask yourself what you want out of your freelance career.


Ex: Say your long term goal is to live comfortably working from home. You need to determine how much you want to make and how you plan on getting there.
If can't come up with a decent plan, then that long term goal should be set aside until you're in a position to make it happen.

, You can start planning from the time you wake up or when you prefer to start working. Start with jotting down your daily goals then add a task that will help you complete said goal.


Ex: You want to write three articles? Well, where do you find work, and how much time are you willing to commit the task?

, Add to it when you feel more comfortable completing more tasks throughout the day. Don't overwhelm yourself. Remember: Realistic and attainable.

, Establish deadlines for yourself, and hold yourself accountable when you miss them.

, Whether you've been freelancing for one website for years or you're completely new to freelance work, keep in mind that there are dozens of websites dedicated to freelancing. However, before you sign up for a new website, make sure that it is a reputable source. You don't want to enter your personal information into an iffy website.

, If you're just starting out, it's wise not to focus on the money so much as the experience you're gaining. The better work you produce- paid or otherwise- will help you build a positive reputation as well as expand your professional portfolio. This will help you move onto bigger projects later on.

, Content Mills are a great start for inexperienced freelancers, but keep in mind that most only pay you $0.01-$0.05 for your work (BKA Content, Demand Studios). Other sites have more of a bidding system (Textbroker, Freelancer). Clients set their terms and provide the basic details of what they need and when they need it. Creators then bid to get picked. Whoever the client picks is the one that gets to write the article.


Ex: ""I need 10 articles written in 6 days and I'm willing to pay between X and X amount of money.""
Ex: ""I can write 10 articles in three days for $250."" Congrats, you win money.

, Blogging is a very useful tool in today's world. Not only can creating a blog keep you busy in between projects, it can be used as a creative outlet to document you personal experiences or it can be used to get your name out there. Find a niche or use your blog as a sort of online journal.

Evaluate yourself and your time.,
Get a piece of paper or use colour note or a similar app such as you prefer.,
Try inserting stars per each day that you engage in the activity.,
Count up.,
Now analyse again.,
Ask yourself which things are really important for you to have more time to do.,
Keep the flame of motivation in your heart by selecting your three top activities (or more) that you want to do.,
Give back to community.,
Realize the ways in which you are tempted to fall off the path of balancing yourself.,
Be gentle on yourself when evaluating your progress.",How to Make Time for Your Passions After Tiring Full Work Days," There are many methods that you can use, but you need to realize that they're only useful if they work for you, so be choosy. This article describes one such possible approach:;
, Now create a list and, if possible, have two columns. At the header, write this question: ""What 10 activities do I really enjoy/love to do?"" Basically, you are setting up a visual aid to review answers. If you really want a detailed comparison, expand your list to 20 items. Either way, for column 2's header write ""How many times a week do I engage in or ""do"" this activity. Mentally search your week. It may help to look at a calendar for this part and, of course, you might do a whole month and calculate averages as there may be some variance.

, Then count and observe for each how many times you are participating in your activities. And whether it's one night a week or one time a month, or never, notate that in some way so that you can determine your pattern of participation. You may not even have to count the stars, if you used a paper calendar or monthly that allows you to insert characters you can get a real birds eye view of your activity. If there's any activity you wish you did and actually aren't doing at all, put an arrow next to that.

, How did you do? Many people who use this method are able to see readily and determine either ""Yes, I'm spending my time as I wish"" or ""No, I am not"". It's really obvious as to how little you may indeed be be engaging in your favourite activities. Finally, ask yourself how it feels to note this. Are you happy, glad, sad, frustrated? You can get really detailed and use number scaling to cite 1to 10 to display the level of happiness you feel when you see your participation. Many people feel sad or frustrated when they note they are just not engaging in their preferred activities. Activities that you care about bring your spirit and mind energy. When you don't get to do them, your quality of life diminishes.

, What do you think? What did you notice? Did it work? Can you see how much time you spend? Is it enough? If you're a person with chronic tiredness due to being overworked, or disabled and ably working while tired due to health or medications, you may notice that ""mostly all you did was work"" for the longest time! If that is the case for you, or if you just wish you would extend your days and can't, it's time to extend you!

, This might be taking your girl or guy friend on dates, spa time or gym time for you and/or slow cooking time to bask in your own amazing culinary skills. Whatever it is, these are the activities that you want to start with, to keep in your mind's eye as you sit in a quiet place to ask yourself: ""Why am I not doing or feel like I can't do these things?"" Just sit with yourself for now. You can add friends or doctor's opinions later. For now, just be you and hear you.

, This is important. Having sat with yourself, and then with your friends, and doing a check in with your doctors or therapists to see what organic issues might be going on that are truly affecting you, the next thing is to find two to three things you can slowly that will positively add or change to add quality and change your energy levels. You can do a few at once, or do one a month for a period of three months.


You may need to match these with a journal or blog online, where you can have fun noticing what you are doing and motivate yourself when you do achieve the new changes.
Do pick positive things, such as exercise.

, The ability to do this may occur as your energy begins to return, helping you to feel better and more able to balance the things you're doing. Sometimes doing things for others feeds you unexpectedly in spiritual ways. Whether it's walking your elderly neighbour's doggies, or doing grocery shopping for your mom, cooking for your friends, cleaning your church, visiting sick people at the hospital, washing dishes for your neighbour whose husband is in hospital or participating in an online community such as writing or editing or supporting wikiHow, or fundraising for a crowdfunding activity or Wikipedia, or other amazing online info fun social connectors, you may well find that the experience creates an energy loop.

, Notice the things that detract from your time and tempt you to be your least best self. This includes eating junk, walking less, working so much harder that you don't get home on time to eat with your spouse, or over volunteering yourself and getting too tired, So this step means.... wait, evaluate!


Ask yourself: ""How is what I wanted going?"" and ""How do I sustain and notice my successes and changes I've made and enjoy those? Also consider how you can avoid comparing the ""but I wanted "" or the ""but I still don't haves"" into the ""wow, I can see my friends more often"", and ""I'm feeling more peaceful when I try to sleep at night and don't need as much medication!""

, As Joyce Meyers would say: ""I may not be where I want to be, but I'm where I need to be, I'm okay and I'm on my way"". Indeed, as some recovery modes say, it is ""progress not perfection"" that brings you to the final step, so remind yourself of this when evaluating your progress. Celebrate you!

Create a prioritized task list.,
Create post-it notes for critical tasks.,
Jump straight into work each day.,
Break tasks down into manageable sections.,
Do your worst task first thing in the morning.,
Say no to non-priority or extra tasks.",How to Deal with Being Behind at Work1," When the amount of work that you have to do seems overwhelming, it can often help just to write it all down. Go through and think of every task that you must complete to catch up. Make a note of the specific deadlines, any unusual requirements for each task (materials that must be ordered, for example) and time needed to finish each item up.Don’t spend days creating this list. Be quick, but be as thorough as you can.
For example, you might write down, “PowerPoint presentation for investors, deadline July 6, need 3 hours to complete.”;
, Look over your list and identify those tasks that need to be done as soon as possible. Write each task on a single post-it note and then place these somewhere visible in your work area. This will keep your most important tasks right in front of you. Throw away each note as you complete the task and add another one to replace it, as you slowly make your way through your list.Making these notes is a great way to regain control over your projects. You are once again in charge of what tasks are a “must do” and when they should be completed.

, When you first arrive at your workplace, sit down at your desk and begin a task that is in progress or start a new one. Resist the urge to wander around and talk to your colleagues or hang out at the watercooler.This same approach is effective if you are working or studying from home. As soon as you get up in the morning, head into your workspace and keep going until you get a scheduled break.

, Target larger projects and look at how they can be performed in stages or parts. Perhaps you need to research the project first. Or, maybe you'll need to make a handful of phone calls to kick-start the task. This approach makes complex jobs seem just a bit less daunting.

For example, if you need to create a PowerPoint presentation, you'll need to research the subject matter, outline your slides, create your slides, and then proofread everything.

, You’ll have the most energy at the very start of the workday, so it makes sense to jump into your most challenging or difficult projects at that point. This will prevent you from putting them off. Instead, select the post-it note task that requires some additional manpower and push to complete it.For example, if you are scared of giving presentations, it might help to prepare that PowerPoint presentation at the start of your workday. The adrenaline boost of the morning can help to balance out your anxiety.

, It’s important to set boundaries when you are fighting to keep up with your work. A good rule to follow is to ask yourself how a certain task fits within your larger career or life goals. If you can’t clearly answer that question in 30 seconds or less, than you should not take that task on.Always be polite when saying “no” to a task. It’s fine to say, “I’m making my way through a backlog. So, I really can’t help you right now.”

Delegate tasks to your coworkers.,
Ask your coworkers for pointers.,
Ask for an extension.",How to Deal with Being Behind at Work2," Choose a few projects that can be completed by someone else and really don’t require your special attention. It is best if these are jobs that are fairly straightforward and don’t require a ton of explanation. Then, approach a coworker or employee and ask for their help.Only approach those people whose work you actually trust. The quality of their final product could reflect poorly or positively on you, so consider that when making your choice.
Offer a type of work exchange. You could say, “If you can finish these jobs up for me, I’d be happy to return the favor when I catch up on everything.”
Keep in mind that delegating can be a great way to give other employees opportunities to complete work and gain experience that they may not have access to otherwise. It can be a win-win situation for everyone.

, If you are struggling with a particular project, find a coworker who you respect and talk with them about your issues. Having these types of conversations will not make you seem lazy or incapable. Instead, it will build camaraderie with your colleagues and you might even get some good tips out of the talk, too.For example, you might say, “I’ve been working on this project for a few days and can’t quite wrap my head around this final part. Do you mind if I run it by you to see what you think?”

, While some deadlines are strict, others are more flexible. If you are feeling overwhelmed, assess which projects’ deadlines can be moved. Then, ask your boss if you can have an extension. Extending some deadlines may relieve some of your stress and allow you to complete your more urgent projects.When asking your boss for an extension give them as much advance notice as you can. Briefly explain why you need the extension and offer to submit portions of the project that are already done.

Turn off your email, phone, and social media.,
Set a “no interruptions” timer.,
Take short, purposeful breaks.,
Extend your workday or work weekends.",How to Deal with Being Behind at Work3," When you are working, go through and silence and turn off as many of your electronic devices as you can. You might even go so far as to put a “do not disturb” sign on your door. This minimizes the temptation to take small social media or email breaks, which eventually add up to huge time wastes.It’s a good idea to let your family and friends know that you are really swamped at work. Tell them that you will not be taking personal calls during business hours until you get caught up.
If you must check your email or voicemail for work, set specific times to do so. For example, fifteen minutes into every hour you will spend a maximum of five minutes looking at your emails and messages.

, If it is not feasible to shut off your email or phone long term, guarantee a chunk of work time by pushing a “no interruptions” rule. Set a timer for 30 minutes (or the maximum time that you are comfortable with) and then work at a fast pace until the time runs out. When the timer dings, that is the signal to your coworkers that you are available again for conversation.If you are in a loud or very busy environment, you could try putting on headphones and listening to some non-distracting music or no music at all.

, Keep an eye on your breaks and limit them to 10 minute intervals, aside from lunch. Set a timer on your phone to keep you on track. Squeeze out every bit of enjoyment from these few minutes. Take a quick walk outside. Close your eyes and just relax. Read a few pages of your favorite book. Do a few fast runs up and down the office stairs., This may not be the most popular suggestion, but it can work wonders for your productivity. Make a decision to arrive at work 30 minutes earlier and leave 30 minutes later, or something similar. Keep up this pace until your backlog begins to disappear. Or, devote one weekend day just to tackling your to-do projects.Make sure to keep a proper work-life balance when extending hours. If you work too much, you run the risk of working slower and even suffering burn-out.

"
Establish a routine.,
Set a goal for each day.,
Invest in a scheduler app.,
Take care of your mind and body.",How to Deal with Being Behind at Work4," Try to go to sleep and wake up around the same time every day. Start and end your work on a strict schedule as well. This will help you to better estimate exactly how much you can accomplish each day.For example, wake up at 7:30 each morning so you can get to the office by 9 a.m. to start your day.

, As part of your prioritizing, set a goal for each day. Look at your list of tasks and commit to accomplishing at least three of those tasks. But, try not to overcommit yourself. Most capable people can only accomplish three to five tasks per day., There are many downloadable planners available free or by purchase for your phone or computer. Read online reviews of your different options, paying particular attention to the features available and costs. Download two different apps and use them for a week to see which one is the best for you.Using this app for all of your scheduling and appointments will allow you to direct your brainpower toward more challenging tasks.

, Make sure to eat at least three healthy meals a day. Aim to work out between three to five times a week. Get at least eight hours of sleep per night. Treating your body the right way will help it to perform well when you need it to."

Track your stressors.,
Establish boundaries.,
Engage in positive work relationships.,
Use humor.,
Relax at work.,
Plan a vacation.",How to Cope with the Stress of After Hours Work1," Keep a journal for a week or two where you keep track of what causes you stress and how you handle it. When a co-worker asks for something more do you go to the vending machine? When meetings run late do you get cranky or raise your voice? Tracking the things that cause you stress throughout your day can help you curb bad habits and get into better ones. It can also help you get through after hours stress more effectively.Write down what causes you stress as well as when you feel stressed. There may be certain times of the day you are more stressed than others.;
, Bringing work home or being constantly on-call can increase your stress. While everyone has different work-home boundaries, do your best to keep work at work. Consider not checking emails or taking phone calls once you leave the office.If working at home is unavoidable, set boundaries by scheduling a specific time for it (perhaps after the kids go to bed), and by confining it to a dedicated workspace. Keep your work and relaxation space firmly separated: no working in the bedroom, and no goofing off in your home office.


If bringing work home is common practice at your workplace yet you decide to stop, let people know. Say, “It’s important for me to keep work at work so I can focus on myself and my family when I’m off. I’m only checking emails and taking phone calls while I’m working and not on my time off.”

, Being at work can be a much more positive experience if you like and appreciate your colleagues. Develop your friendships at work and use your co-workers as support. It’s likely they’re experiencing some of the same stress that you are.Initiate friendships with your co-workers by inviting them to lunch or talking with them after meetings.
Seek out people whom you enjoy and are positive. While someone who complains a lot can commiserate with you, you may not want to be around their negativity all the time.

, If the stress of work is getting to you and your co-workers, break through the tension with some humor. If meetings are increasingly intense or deadlines are too close, find a moment to share some laughter. Make a joke or share a meme.Start an office joke to get you through the difficult times.
For example, end tense meetings with a funny video or a joke.

, If you notice that you are stressed in the moment, take some deep breaths. Stop what you are doing and take some deep inhales and exhales until you feel more relaxed.Squeeze a stress ball or do some progressive muscle relaxation for a few minutes. If you’re working, put on some calm and relaxing music to work to. Take some time each day away from your people by closing your door or not accepting phone calls during a certain period of time.


If you tend to work through breaks or keep thinking about work during lunch, use the time to go for a walk outside your workplace. Regular breaks can improve your mood, as well as the quality of your work.

, Having something to look forward to can be the light at the end of the tunnel that helps you get through the difficult moments. If you know you’re coming up on overtime or after hours work, plan to take a vacation shortly after you complete that work. Have a photo of the place you will go on your desk to remind you that you have something wonderful to look forward to. Taking a vacation can be a much needed break from work and can help you feel more rejuvenated and motivated once back to work.Planning your vacation can be a fun way to get through the stressful times at work.

Avoid harmful substances.,
Get some exercise.,
Practice relaxation.,
Sleep well each night.",How to Cope with the Stress of After Hours Work2," If you tend to cope with after hours stress by eating junk food or with alcohol, these practices likely are not helping you in the long-run. Things like zoning out by watching television or doing recreational drugs are not effective ways to cope with stress.If you find yourself using unhealthy coping strategies, stop engaging as soon as you can. Replace the time you spend in these activities with more healthy activities, such as reading or exercising.


If you find yourself wanting junk food or substances, remind yourself that they do not relieve stress effectively and choose something healthier.

, Exercise can help you boost your mood, deal with stress, and give you more energy. See if your workplace has a gym and consider going there either before work or during your lunch break. Try taking a 10-minute walk between appointments, or give your dog a walk before going into work. Aim to get about 30 minutes of exercise each day.If you dread going to work, try working out in the mornings. This can improve your mood and make it easier to get out the door and start your day.
Consider taking a dance class, karate class, or yoga.

, Find some healthy outlets for stress, such as relaxation. Daily relaxation can help you deal with stress and feel calm.Aim to relax either early in the morning or before you go to bed for about 30 minutes. This can include reading, taking a bath, or listening to calm, relaxing music.


Find relaxation methods that feel good and that you want to do every day. Try daily yoga, qi gong, tai chi, and meditation.

, If you’re under-sleeping, it’s more likely that you’ll feel stressed and cranky the next day. Having good rest allows you to be more emotionally balanced, which can help you cope with stressors at work and after work. Aim to get between 7-9 hours of sleep each night.If you’re having trouble sleeping, turn off all screens (tv, laptop, and phone) at least one hour before bed, as the light can disrupt your sleep. Keep time before bed relaxing and calming.
Get in the habit of going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, even on the weekends.
Spend time before bed relaxing. Take a bath, read a book, journal, or meditate. This can help your mind slow down and prepare to sleep.

"
"
Talk to a supervisor.,
Practice time management.,
Modify your position.,
Use some perspective.",How to Cope with the Stress of After Hours Work3," Don’t approach your supervisor with a list of complaints. Instead, suggest solutions to make your workday more efficient, or to adjust your schedule to avoid on-call evenings. If your supervisor does not accept your suggestions, ask for alternative ideas to reduce after-hours work. Here are a couple examples:


""I'm happy to be on call for urgent tasks, but I've been receiving a few non-urgent emails late at night. Could I fit them into the next day's work to better manage our priorities?""
“I tend to bring a lot of work home at the end of the month, when our orders are processed. If we could move this to a biweekly schedule, I could work more efficiently with less overtime.""

, If you struggle to manage your time, this can lead to staying later and working longer hours. Begin to write a to-do list each morning to organize your tasks for the day. Allow enough time for each task, and consider doing them in order of priority. If you have a large project, break it up into mini-deadlines to keep you motivated to work on it little by little.Spend some extra time on the onset of tasks to make sure you do it right the first time. It’s better to spend some extra time upfront than to have to do the task over again later.
Even if you have to work after hours, divide up your time so that you can use it as efficiently as possible.

, If you’re sick of working after hours all the time, consider making some adjustments to your current job. Ask for fewer hours each week or for less work. If you were promoted to a more stressful job, ask for a transfer.Your employer cannot always tell how reasonable your workload is unless you communicate with them. Be respectful, but be honest and assertive.


Ask about ways to tailor your job to your skills. For example, say, “I’d like to work more with my hands than I currently am. Is there a way to do this more regularly?”
You can also say, “Is it possible for me to come in earlier in the mornings so that I spend less time at work late at nights?”

, If working after hours becomes a regular responsibility of yours, you might want to consider your working circumstances. When management increases your responsibilities and working hours, it may be a longer lasting arrangement than you signed up for. Consider whether you are okay with the circumstances or whether you need to find a new job.It is much easier to replace your job than it is to replace your health, family, or friends.


If you are too overwhelmed by work to search for another, consider using an employment agency, resume specialist, or other service.

Understand their needs.,
Prepare the home for their arrival.,
Encourage activity.,
Allow them to rest.,
Give them positive feedback.",How to Help Someone After Bypass Surgery," A person who has just had bypass surgery is recovering from the effects of both the surgery and the medication that they have received to ease the pain. They may be groggy or overly tired, and may still have bandages and dressings to cover their wound.


In addition, they may not be able to walk well due to the incision and the pain that accompanies it.
Visit them in the hospital and talk to their nurses and doctors about their specific care needs.;
, A person who is recovering from bypass surgery will be extremely limited in what they can do during their first few days at home.


They may be unable to climb stairs or do any type of heavy lifting.
According to the National Institutes of Health, people recovering from bypass surgery are advised not to drive a car or operate machinery for up to six weeks following the surgery.
Aerobic exercise and sexual activity may also be prohibited for weeks following bypass surgery.
Cook meals in advance that can be heated easily.
Take on household tasks such as cleaning and yard care until the person has made a full recovery.

, While this may seem contrary to following the advice of the doctor that restricts activity, becoming active is a necessary part of healing after bypass surgery. The patient who has received bypass surgery should be encouraged to take small steps toward becoming independent.


This includes getting out of bed slowly and taking a few steps every day.
The patient should shower and bathe with help until he is able to bathe on his own.
The worst thing you can do is to allow the patient to languish in bed all day and not do anything for himself.

, Although the person recovering from bypass surgery should be attempting to do things for themselves and gradually become more active, getting proper rest is also key to healing.


The body will tell you when it is time to slow down and when it is taking on too much activity.
Watch the person for signs that they are over-exerting themselves. Extreme fatigue, blurred vision and headache are signs that the body needs to slow down. Encourage them to sit or nap if they are overdoing it. #*Keep small children quiet and out of the way so that the patient can rest.

, Let the person know that they are doing well and that, with time, the pain from their surgery will subside and they will have a normal life. Your words of encouragement will give them the mental boost they need to recover and heal from their recent operation.


Avoid commenting on what the scar looks like or how they appear bloated (which they probably will) as a result of the surgery. Remain positive so that they will also be positive about their healing.

Find out the details of their trip.,
Make sure you have all of the supplies you will need.,
Assist them with their departure.,
Complete your tasks as requested.,
Assist your friend when they return.",How to House Sit," Make sure you know what day and time they are leaving, and what day and time they plan to return. Most importantly, find out what tasks they want you to take care of while they are away. This typically includes taking in their mail, watering plants, caring for their pet (if applicable), shovelling their driveway (in the event of snow), keeping an eye on their house for safety reasons, etc.;
, If you're taking care of chores inside the house, you'll need a house key. Always ask for their cell phone/hotel number or e-mail address in case of an emergency. Most importantly, make sure you know where everything you will need is located, whether it be pet food or a garden hose.

, Even if they refuse, offer to give your friend a ride to the airport instead of them taking a taxi. Ask them if they need help packing or would like to borrow anything of yours for their trip. There can be a lot of stress in preparing before embarking on a trip, so be as helpful as possible.

, Once they are gone, fulfill your duties. Follow their exact instructions with your best effort, and be sure to give them a call as soon as possible if you don't understand something or a problem arises. Carrying out the most common tasks includes:


Taking in the mail. Go to their house in the afternoon or evening to gather their mail. Bring it into their house if you have a key, or take it back to your house if you don't. When entering their house, put the mail neatly into piles with newspapers on the bottom, magazines in the middle, and envelopes on the top. Arrange these piles on a table or counter where they will easily find it. If you bring them back to your house, keep them in a box so you can easily give it to them upon their return.







Caring for plants. Water all of the plants you are requested to, both indoor and outdoor. Give them plenty of water and do so either in the morning or evening if they are outdoors. Remember to turn off the hose or faucet when you finish.







Caring for pets. Depending on the pet and your friend or neighbor's instructions, you could be feeding the pets, playing with them, walking them, cleaning up after them, etc. It solely depends on the type of pet. Most importantly, in any case, make sure the pet survives and does not get lost or run away.







Shoveling snow. In the event of a snowstorm, be sure to shovel your friend's driveway and the sidewalk in front of their house, even if you weren't asked to. The snow will likely turn to ice within a few days, making it very difficult to shovel. If you want, gather a group of friends to help you out; the more you recruit, the less work you will have to do.

Watching their house. Once a day, simply check around your friend or neighbor's house to make sure there is no vandalism, signs of a break-in, or other serious event. If there is, be sure to contact the police right away and alert your friend. Both the homeowner and house sitter can take steps to reduce the risk of theft or break in.







, Offer to pick them up from the airport, help them unpack, etc. Hopefully, your friend or neighbor will be appreciative and thankful for your help and will likely offer some kind of reward. At the very least, you can count on them to do the same for you when you go out of town.

If you don't have medical terminology experience, consider getting a part-time job in a local medical office.

Understand the difference between an independent contractor and an employee.,
Advertise for help in reputable publications.,
Don’t take shortcuts during the hiring process.",How to Get Domestic Help," And independent contractor, such as an electrician, controls their work; they decide what to do and how to do it. People hired to do domestic work don’t usually make the decisions, you do. If you decide how the work is to be done and where it is to be done, then you are hiring an employee, not an independent contractor. Review the IRS Publication 926 concerning your tax obligations regarding hired help. You will probably be responsible for the following federal and state taxes:


Social Security taxes
Medicare taxes
Federal income taxes
Unemployment taxes
Disability insurance taxes;
, Or, you might consider using an agency to help you locate and hire domestics. Credible agencies perform background checks, drug testing and other methods to thoroughly vet candidates. Look for an agency that bonds and insures their clients.

, You really must thoroughly vet any person you plan to hire for domestic help. Keep in mind that the person you hire will have unlimited, and usually unsupervised, access to your home and everything in it. If you are hiring domestic help to care for your children or your elderly parent, it is even more critical that you do everything possible to choose someone you can trust and rely upon:


Conduct an in-person interview. A telephone interview won’t suffice. During a live interview, you can observe the person’s mannerisms, body language and demeanor. It’s true that some people are masters of deception, but in most cases, you can trust your gut reaction or intuition. If something feels “off” to you, pay attention. If the interview goes well, and the person is being interviewed as a caregiver, set up a second interview for him or her to meet the children or adults they will be caring for.
Ask for a resume. If possible, get the resume ahead of time so that you can review it at length and check out the validity of the applicant’s previous work experience.
Ask for personal and professional references. But don’t stop there; call every reference and chat with them. Ask open-ended questions and try to get the reference to volunteer additional information about the prospective employee.
Conduct a background check. A background check will reveal any legal problems or criminal history. You can hire someone to do the background check, or you can do it yourself using trusted websites that specialize in background checks. There are fees involved, but they are reasonable and well worth the money for your peace of mind. Above all, you must verify the prospective employee’s legal status. Hiring an illegal, undocumented worker is against the law, and the onus is on you to verify the applicant’s legal status.

, Always try to make their day nice.

, No one wants a caregiver that does nothing but say a few words now and again. If all you do is the bare minimum, prepare to get fired very soon

, Most of the time it doesn't matter, unless of course you're in charge of medicine at the facility at which you are working. Just make sure you remember what they taught you about emergencies and have some first aid training just in case.

, This can be a fun and relaxing time for the as they may not get outside often. Walks are also a great way to become acquainted and have some group exercise too!

Most phone sex companies prefer to hire phone sex operators who lack taboos; some companies, however, are understanding and will allow you to have one or more taboos.

, For the sake of clients and professionalism, most phone sex companies will require that you work in a quiet space free of any background noise.

For example, if you will be required to talk to some clients using a foreign accent, choose foreign names that go with those particular accents.

,


Practice reading a script that contains erotic content using your phone sex voice prior to leaving a voicemail recording for the phone sex company. Practicing while speaking in a sexy voice will help you feel more comfortable and confident at the time you call to apply.

, After you have been hired, you may be able to start speaking with phone sex clients immediately.

, Always show up on time for appointments and to work. If you must be late or miss work, give plenty of warning and try to find a replacement if possible.

, Write reports about the child's daily activities, take pictures or videos of important firsts in the child's development to share with the parents, and leave notes or tell parents about things the child did. Work with the parents to come up with solutions to problems. Ask for advice and approval before changing routines, but take initiative to solve minor problems as they occur. Take time to get the know the parents to learn how to be a successful nanny for them.

, This should be a key factor before even choosing to work in childcare, but as with all jobs, the passion could wear off over time. Remember to take time to cherish the children in your care, and have fun with them while teaching and answering questions.

, While a nanny is not a housekeeper, cleaning up after the children, washing their clothes, and preparing their meals is part of the job. Learn to prepare healthy meals and snacks and present them in fun ways that the children are eager to eat, instead of junk food.

Put in some research.,
Contact developers.,
Consider volunteering.,
Keep an eye out for new opportunities.,
Join beta testing groups.,
Be detailed and accurate.,
Focus on the GUI.,
Make sure available functions make sense.,
Verify that the mechanics function as intended.,
Promote the product.",How to Become a Beta Tester," While some games have open betas and some other beta testing positions are advertised, most paid beta testing isn't. If you have a particular game or program in mind, try looking for information on the developer's website. Some gaming and software forums may also have valuable information to share with you.


If you don't have a specific game or program in mind, you can search for positions.
Try searching for ""Beta Testing Job"", ""Crowdsourced Beta Testing"", and ""Freelance Software Testing"". You'll turn up plenty of results.;
, Once you have found the products you are interested in testing, look up who their developer is. If they were looking to bring on beta testers they will probably have an online application. If not, simply send an email. Briefly explain your interest, testing experience and skills in volunteering as a tester. Be succinct and to the point. Developers are busy. Be as brief and concise as possible. It'll look more professional too., As is the case in many industries, you can get your start by volunteering. Companies will often look for volunteer testers, and they may bring on those with talent and dedication for a paid position.

, Search for information on blogs, news articles, and game or software teasers that can provide news regarding products that are entering a beta testing phase.

, You can also join beta testing groups and communities. Sometimes, developers advertise on their message boards or post announcements regarding upcoming betas. If nothing else, you'll be able to communicate and gain experience from other testers.

, If you are accepted as a beta tester, focus on providing detailed, useful information for the developer. Beta testing might not be as exciting as you anticipated. Odds are that you will be tasked with testing one specific function over and over.


There are many specific testing roles. Focus on excelling at yours.
If you succeed in a limited role, you may be asked to take on additional new and exciting tasks.

, One of the most common areas to begin beta testing is by evaluating the General User Interface (GUI) and ensuring that it is straightforward and user friendly. Interactions with the GUI should be easy, quick, and enjoyable , All available actions on a page should make logical sense, both visually and functionally.Does every tab on a particular page belong? Are similar tabs placed next to each other? There are a lot more factors than you would initially think to consider.

, This is the most common task that people associate with beta testing. Repeat simple actions and make sure that they all run smoothly and as they should.You'll need to discuss with the developer how the mechanics are supposed to function, and use that as the baseline for your observations.


While people get excited because they are testing how to run or shoot in a game, more often than not you'll be running into or shooting the same wall repeatedly.
Don't get distracted by testing anything outside of the requested parameters.

, Never trash the product you've been testing. If you don't like the product, keep that to yourself. You've only been testing a pre-production version of the software anyway. You have been trusted to both be objective during testing and act professionally afterwards.


Trashing a product can ruin the opportunity to beta test in the future.
If you were a skilled beta tester, you contributed to making the product better.
If you enjoyed your experience, consider referring suitable friends for future beta testing positions.

Plan your working day in advance.,
Set your alarm the night before and use it as a wake up call.,
Get up with a good few hours before you're due to be at work.,
Order a cab if you have to.,
Have breakfast and splash your face with cold water, this will help you function normally.,
Be ready for the taxi or transportation when it gets there.,
Follow these steps every working day and they will become a habit.",How to Get to Work on Time," Prepare and organise everything you'll need for it the night before. This includes clothes, documents, food and meeting preparation. This will prevent you rushing to get everything ready in the morning.;
, However, don't just put it right by your bed where you can just turn over and hit the snooze button when it goes off. Leave it on the other side of the room so that when it goes off, you'll have to get up to turn it off.

, Even if you think you can be in work on time if you wake up half an hour before you're due in, chances are your first attempt at toast will burn, your shower will break on you and your train will be cancelled. It's better to be safe than sorry so leave plenty of time for unforeseen circumstances.

, If you knew in advance that your bus or train was going to be delayed, but you overslept anyway, get a cab. The expense will be worth it when you don't lose your job for being late again.

, A good healthy breakfast in particular will help energize you, making you complete the journey to work faster and more efficiently.

, There's no point ordering a cab if you keep it waiting. There's also no point in knowing when your train leaves if you're not there and waiting when it pulls into the station. Sometimes trains leave a couple of minutes earlier than scheduled, so it's worth being on the platform early.

, Hopefully, it'll be a habit that helps you retain your job.

List how you spend your time.,
Divide the tasks.,
Come up with examples of how you've shown responsibility.,
Determine if you have the temperament.,
Create a formal proposal.,
Focus on how productive you can be.,
Address your boss's concerns.,
Get it in writing.,
Accept a ""no."",
Compromise.,
Show your boss you can do it.,
Be productive.,
Come in as needed.",How to Ask to Work from Home," Make a detailed list of what you do each day, including the time you're on the phone, when you're emailing, and the time you spend working with clients. You can even time yourself for a couple of days to see how much time you spend on each task each day.It can help to mark a percentage for each task. You can take an average over a week, especially if you don't do the same tasks every day.
For instance, maybe you spend fifty percent of your time on the phone, thirty percent of your time working on reports and spreadsheets, ten percent on emails, and ten percent in meetings.;
, Decide which tasks would be easier to do at home, as well as which would be more difficult. Some tasks may be equal at home and in the office. Then, come up with solutions to make the tasks that are more difficult at home easier.For instance, if one problem is collaborating with coworkers, find good software that would still allow you to collaborate easily.

, Another point that can bolster your case is bringing in examples from the past of how responsible you are. Good examples include being on time, not missing too many days of work, and hitting your deadlines. Also, any projects you showed self-initiative on may be helpful to bring up.

, Not everyone has the right temperament for working from home. If you thrive on being around people, it may not be right for you. Similarly, working from home means you must create your own structure, which some people have difficulty with. You may decide that you won't do well working from home., A formal proposal shows that you take your work seriously. Write up the information you've collected about your job. Include information on what days you'd like to work from home, how you'll be available to your boss and coworkers, and how you plan to compensate for any tasks that are more difficult at home. Also, note how you plan to work the same (or similar) hours from home.When you go to talk to your boss, have the proposal in hand. You can say, ""I'd like to talk to you about the possibility of telecommuting. I've written up a proposal about how I think this will work."" Then you can lay out the basics of your proposal.

, Most of the time, your boss isn't going to care about how working from home will make you happier. Even if they do care, they care more about how productive you can be at home. Make it a point to show your boss that you believe you can actually be more productive at home, away from the distractions of coworkers.For example, you could say, ""I know one of your concerns will be productivity. However, I actually believe I will be more productive at home. Sometimes in the office, the noise is a distraction. At home, that won't be a problem, and I can focus more effectively on my work.""

, Your boss is likely going to have some questions, particularly if you are one of the first employees to suggest telecommuting. Take some time to figure out solutions for each problem. It's best to think through as many solutions as you can before talking to your boss.For example, if your boss is worried about accountability, offer a way to maintain accountability by having weekly meetings over video chat or even in-office. You could also offer to write up weekly reports.
Talk to tech support to ensure you could have the same level of security that the office has, which will put your boss more at ease.
Discuss any special accommodations, such as setting up a VPN and whether you'll need to get a work computer for home (if you don't already have one).

, It's best if you can get the agreement in writing. That way, if you get a new boss, you still have an agreement with the company to work from home. Even a set of emails will do in a pinch., If your boss does end up saying ""no,"" accept it, and plan to revisit the idea in the future. Getting upset or sulking isn't going to help your case any. If you prove you're a hard worker who can handle responsibility, your boss is more likely to be lenient in the future.

, You may not be able to get your boss to agree to let you work from home full-time. However, you might be able to swing a day or two a week on a trial basis. If your boss is unwilling to give you the full-time nod, offer this up as alternative.You could say, ""I understand you're hesitant to let me work at home full-time. What about if we tried a day or two a week on a trial basis?""

, Another option is to use a sick day to prove that you can work from home. When you're feeling lousy enough not to go into work, go ahead and take a sick day. However, spend the day getting as much work done as you can, proving to your boss that you can be productive at home., If you get a trial period, it's time to show your boss you can be just as productive at home as you are at work, if not more productive. Get all your work done before the deadlines, for instance, and try to increase your output over what you used to do in the office., Even if your boss agrees you can work from home, you'll likely still need to show up for some in-office meetings. Stay in the loop, and come in without being told to by your boss. That shows an initiative that will keep your boss happy."

A lot depends on what you hope to accomplish. Are you just trying to make a little extra money, or are you hoping to work the equivalent of a full-time job? What is your ultimate goal? Asking yourself these questions will help you see what you need to do to move forward.;
, Take the time to develop a basic, professional cover letter that you can send to employers. Describe your skills in detail. Having a basic template ready to go will make applying for jobs much easier.


Remember that this basic cover letter will simply serve as a template. When you start applying for actual jobs, you’ll need to customize your letters, adding specific details tailored to individual jobs.

, Check freelancing websites like oDeska, Elance, and Freelancer. These websites will list available freelance jobs and let you advertise your services.


Search these sites regularly for jobs, as they are updated frequently. Remember that there are not nearly enough well-paying jobs out there for all the qualified people who want to freelance, but with some persistence, you may find what you need. Consider setting time aside every day to search for jobs online.

, On freelancing websites, good profiles explain your skills in detail and include something that sets you apart from others. Choose a high-quality, professional-looking profile picture, and build portfolios with a few examples of your very best work.

, Enter “write for us” or something similar into a search engine, and peruse the offers that appear. You might find jobs not included on the biggest freelancing websites.

, If you think a particular business could use your services, send them an email.


Do your homework. It’s not advisable to send hundreds of form emails to every person you know and every company you think might conceivably hire a freelance writer. You’ll only waste time and energy (and annoy people). Direct these emails only to those companies you have reasons to contact, and personalize your messages.

, It’s probably not a great idea to apply for every single job you see. You will be a stronger, more efficient writer when you tackle subjects you know well. The cliché that you should “write what you know” applies to freelance writing too.


Consider your possible areas of expertise. Are you a doctor, economist, or computer expert? Are you an excellent cook? Do you know a lot about the entertainment business? Could you write about parenting? Explore potential jobs in the areas that fit your skills and interests.

, Remember that your employers won’t care whether you have children or if you have other obligations: they just want the job done well. Deliver a professional product.


Many freelancing sites allow employers to rate your work. You’ll need this rating to be high if you want to get more jobs.

, Make sure that your employer receives your work at the designated time. Lateness comes across as irresponsible, no matter what the circumstances were.

, Strive to make your writing better and better and to expand your areas of expertise.


If English is not your first language, work to master it. Freelance writers frequently need to write in English.
Learn about new subjects. Yes, it is best to write about what you know, but remember – you can work to know more and more! Do research on fields that seem to be in high demand.

, It can take time to build a reputation as a freelance writer. Keep taking the jobs you are offered, and keep doing your best work. With time and persistence, you will gain the approval of your employers and score higher ratings on freelance websites.

, If you don’t set some boundaries around your writing time, you’ll wind up trying to do everything all at once (and not doing any of it particularly well). Designate particular hours for writing, and do your best to stick to them – you are “on the clock.”


The best working hours will depend on your individual circumstances, but consider setting time aside when your children are usually asleep. This might mean getting up early (before your children) or staying up late (after your children have gone to bed).
If your children attend school, use those hours for work.
Make older children aware of your work schedule. If you must work while your children are present, teach them that you are “at work” during certain times, and encourage them to avoid disturbing you.

, Just as you must protect your working time, you need to make time for undisturbed interaction with your children. Designate particular hours for high-quality family time, and do your best to stick to them.


Again, the best specific hours for family time will depend on your individual circumstances, but consider protecting family meal times and bedtime routines. If you are present and attentive at these important times, your children will feel more secure – and you will feel less guilty!

, If you have a spouse of partner, it’s important that he or she understands your goals and supports you. Come to an agreement about how your family’s time will be managed. If, for example, you provide child care while your partner works a regularly-scheduled job, then perhaps he or she can do the same for you during evenings and weekends.


Remember that your children may still come to you when your partner or spouse is home. If this becomes a problem, consider going somewhere else (perhaps a park or a café) to work.

, If your children’s grandparents live nearby and are willing to help, let your children spend some time with them while you work! If you have other relatives or friends who offer assistance, accept their help, and try not to feel guilty – it’s good for your children to spend time with other people, and it’s good for your family for you to make extra money.

, Tell your friends and neighbors (as well as anyone else you regularly talk to or socialize with) about your freelance work. Let them know that you’d appreciate it if they’d avoid calling or visiting during your working hours.

, Schedule enough time for domestic tasks and parenting obligations, and then strive to get those things done in the time allotted.


Cook in larger batches, so that each recipe will make more than one meal.
Stick to a schedule for cleaning and laundry, so nothing ever gets out of hand.
Run weekly errands all at once, rather than running out again and again.

, In general, you should take care of any necessary research before you start writing. Decide how much research time a particular project will require, and then stick to that time.


Avoid spending too much time surfing the web and reading about subjects related to your topic only tangentially. Stick to the research that is absolutely necessary.

, Put some thought into how best to organize your data, and then start writing. Use your writing skills to their best effect.


Consider outlining your project and filling in topic sentences for every planned paragraph. Having this step complete will make writing feel much easier – you’re just filling in the gaps.

, No matter how excellent your writing skills are, your work will need careful proofreading and revising. Set aside sufficient time for these tasks.


In addition to fixing any errors and making the writing flow more smoothly, don’t forget to revise for format and style. Strive to produce a document that looks as your specific employer wants it to look.

This space should be able to accommodate all your supplies, so when you sit down you can jump right into work mode. Another plus of a home work space: tax deduction on maybe everything you buy for your home office and some of your utility and rent bills too.;
, Different things work for different people. If a shower, your favorite sweats and a cup of coffee is all you need to get into work mode, that’s great. If you feel most confident doing conference calls in your underpants, that’s great too; working from home gives us a comfort that allows us to get our game face on. The dress code is your prerogative, but a nice blouse or button up for a professional video call is required to maintain your image as a professional in your field. As well, you may not come in contact with your professional contacts often, but that is no excuse to ignore our personal hygiene.

, Working from home isn't about cutting yourself off from the world. You should actually be connecting by networking through social media platforms. In a conventional work setting you have the watercooler to catch up with other employees. When you are at home and starved for conversation, take a break to go online and join a networking group. Keep your online profiles up to date with your professional accomplishments. You never know what professional opportunity is lurking on your online profile.

, In a conventional workplace it would detrimental to your future at the company if you were sitting at your desk posting all day. Same rule applies when working from home. There’s no boss to check your work progress, and your computer doesn't have website blocks on it; getting sucked into the latest trending Twitter hashtag is so easy. The solution is simple: turn off the Wi-Fi. If you need internet connection to work then try a web-blocker.

, When you work from home a drawback has to manage the many distractions of your home life. Your mom thinks you’re sitting on the couch watching reality show reruns. Your friends think it’s completely acceptable to call whenever they have some downtime from their work lives. Or people just come over to hang because you’re “at home.” You may be physically in your home, but you’re also at work. Set office hours and stick to them. When you respect your work hours the people in your life will begin to recognize that you’re at work and respect those boundaries too.

, Frequently running to the refrigerator for a snack happens when we’re at home all day. Donuts, chips and energy drinks may fill the vending machine in a conventional work space. Fill your kitchen with sensible, healthy options. When you feel good on the inside, you will be much more productive in your work endeavors. Invest in protein rich foods that will increase your focus and energy naturally.

, When 6pm rolls around, you shouldn't be confused about you did that work day. Divide your work schedule into time intervals. Work intensely for a set amount of time then take a five-minute break. A lot more business will get done focusing on one thing at a time rather than multitasking at half speed for twice as long.

In addition, freelance writing offers the opportunity for you to put your creative abilities to use and to create a wide variety of content.


Freelance writing jobs can pay between $10 and $30 per hour.
Look on websites like www.freelancewritinggigs.com for writing jobs that might interest you.
Contact your local newspaper to see if they have any opportunities for paid writing.
Enroll in courses that will help you sharpen your writing.
Offer to do no-charge copyediting for friends or nonprofits in your community. This will help you get lots of experience and to sharpen your skills so you can eventually charge customers.;
, Tutoring is one of the easiest ways you can make money and put your academic or intellectual background to good use. If you have a degree in a specific field (like English, Math, or History) or professional or teaching experience, you’re likely qualified to tutor a subject.


If you have kids in public school, let their teachers know you offer tutoring services in certain subjects.
Look for tutoring jobs on websites like www.wyzant.com or www.varsitytutors.com.
Charge an hourly fee. For instance, you might charge $20 to $50 dollars per hour depending on the subject and the level. Tutoring AP Chemistry might fetch a higher fee than elementary school English., By charging a fee per dog, you can make a good amount of money over the course of a week. In the end, you’ll make money working with animals and doing something enjoyable. When starting your business:


Put up flyers in your neighborhood advertising your dog walking business.
Tell your friends, family, and neighbors about your business.
Offer discounts if a person has multiple dogs or has you walk their dogs several times in one day.
Your fee may vary on your location. For instance, dog walking fees in Southern California will be higher than in Atlanta, Georgia., While services might be a good option, selling or reselling products might offer you a profitable alternative. Reselling products will give you the ability to take care of your family and make some money on the side. Consider selling:


Vintage clothing
Baked goods
A variety of goods on Amazon Market Place or eBay. For example, you could resell toys, dishes, electronics, or more., After you’ve created a list of goods or services you can offer, you need to narrow down your list and figure out if you can make money. In the end, an unprofitable business is not worth starting.


Think about how much you would charge for a certain service. For example, if you’re offering a dog walking service, think about how much money you need to make per dog so it is worth your time.
Decide how much it would cost you to resell a product. For instance, if you are reselling vintage clothing, determine how much you will or can pay for a specific article of clothing and how much time and money it costs for you to sell it., Before starting your stay at home business, you should investigate any local, state, or federal laws or regulations that may be applicable to your business. Without being aware of laws and regulations, you could wind up being fined or have your business shut down.


Call the permit department of your local municipal government for information about laws and regulations that govern small businesses in your area.
Be aware that some cities or municipalities have laws that govern what type of businesses you can run out of your own home.
Make sure to pay municipal, state, and federal taxes if applicable.
If you employ others, make sure to have them sign appropriate paperwork. For example, if you hire hourly workers as independent contractors, make them sign an independent contractor agreement. Consult a contract lawyer for more information., Most governmental authorities require many types of businesses to register and to get a business license. Without a business license, you could find yourself in violation of state statutes.


Call your state or province’s department of business regulation to find out if you need to apply for a license. For example, in Florida contact the state’s Department of Business and Professional Regulation at (850) 487-1395.
Certain professionals, such as real estate agents or cosmetologists must be licensed. In addition, many states and provinces require certain professionals to enroll in continuing education courses., Depending on the type of business you start, you may need to purchase insurance to protect you from loss or lawsuit. Without insurance, your small business may open you up to monetary losses much larger than anything you may gain by working. Some insurances you may want to consider include:


Worker’s compensation insurance. This insurance will cover any employees if they are injured in the line of work and are unable to continue working.
Liability insurance. Liability insurance may protect you if someone is hurt due to the fault of you or one of your employees.
Property insurance. Property insurance will cover your property – and sometime other people’s property – if it is damaged during your work., Creating a budget for your business is perhaps the most important step you’ll need to take to make sure it is successful and profitable. Without a budget, you won’t be able to keep track of your expenses and project income.


Know how much money you spend on supplies weekly, monthly, or quarterly.
Calculate your general overhead for a given period. For instance, tally up what you pay for a website, a store front, or to rent equipment. Ultimately, your sales must cover the cost of product and general overhead., Before putting together a schedule to balance your work and family responsibilities, you need to list all of your obligations. This is important, as you might have significant time constraints associated with taking care of your children. Thus, reflect on them when picking a potential business to start. Some time constraints might include:


Picking up and dropping off children.
Coaching little league or another extracurricular activity.
Preparing meals or cleaning the house.
Readying the kids for school in the morning.
Taking care of unforeseen events like taking a sick child to the doctor., Balancing your many responsibilities as a stay-at-home parent and small business owner will perhaps be your biggest challenge. There are several steps you need to take to create a proper schedule so you can manage your responsibilities. Make sure to:


Get a day planner so you can organize your time.
Write in all your family obligations on your day planner. This includes little league, picking kids up from school, and everything else.
Block out portions of the day for your business. For example, put aside 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the afternoon to take care of your work., During this time, you won’t work at all. Ultimately, while you're in business to make money, you're first priority will always be your family.


Dedicate meals, bedtime, homework time, and other time to your family.
Wait until after family events to answer phone calls. If you’re at one of your children’s softball games, you should wait until after the game to respond to a customer., While your primary responsibility is taking care of your family, you also need to make sure that you provide service to your customers.


Return all phone calls and emails within 24 hours.
Acknowledge the fact that your customers have contacted you. For example, if you're on a family trip and won't be able to access the internet all weekend, set up an autoreply message that lets your customers know when you'll be back.
Don't interrupt family events to answer a call that can be answered later. For example, don't leave the dinner table to call back a customer unless you know the issue is time sensitive., Without punctuality, you'll establish a poor reputation. To avoid this, make sure to get your product to your customer as quickly as possible.


If you sell products over the internet, make sure you ship them as quickly as you can. However, don’t pick your children up from school late because you were shipping something at the post office.
If you provide a service, don’t show up late. If you have to because of family obligation, let your customers know as soon as you can., After you’ve chosen what type of business you’re going to start, you need to make sure you have everything you’ll need to run it. Without gathering your supplies, you’ll be ill-equipped to attend to the needs of your customers.


Stockpile your product. If you’re starting a consignment shop, make sure you’ve lined up enough people with enough goods. If you’re reselling clothes, visit thrift stores and start to accumulate clothes.
Buy anything you’ll need to provide a service. For instance, if you’re starting a dog walking business, you’ll likely need treats, leashes, and dog poop bags., After you’ve stockpiled products or determined what service you’re going to offer, you need to make sure people know that you’re in business. Ultimately, advertising is one of the most important aspects of establishing a successful business.


Create a website, if appropriate. For instance, if you’re setting up a consignment shop, you should probably create a website that lists store hours, location, and gives potential customers an idea of the products you offer.
Use social media to promote your business. For instance, create a Facebook page for your business.
Take advantage of your friend network to get the word out about your business. For example, let your friends know, and let the parents of your children’s friends know. This might be especially helpful if you’re offering a dog walking or babysitting service., While you’ve set your budget, gathered supplies, and done some sort of advertising, you need to be ready to serve your customers when they call. Thus, make sure you are ready to supply your goods or services when the time comes.


If you provide a service, be ready to set aside time to provide that service. For instance, if you have a dog walking service, write in the times that you’ll walk a person’s dog.
If you sell goods, make sure you have plenty on hand. For example, if you sell baked goods, make sure you have ingredients on hand to bake cupcakes when your customers want them."

Have passion for starting your own business.,
Become tech savvy.,
Determine your business and personal goals.,
Research success stories from other entrepreneurial moms.,
Develop your business idea.,
Make a plan.",How to Be an Entrepreneurial Mom1," In most cases, entrepreneurs must work more than usual during the first few years in order to make the business a success. Passion and drive will help to propel you forward when you are trying to balance work and kids at home.;
, Many entrepreneurial moms work from home, using the computer, phone and websites to do business. Enroll in a series of courses that teach you to manage your email, website and finances.

, These may include working while caring for kids, starting your own business, doing something you are passionate about or being your own boss. For most moms, they want to combine their personal and financial goals, which leads them to be their own boss.

, Subscribe to blogs like theentrepreneurialmom.wordpress.com, workitmom.com and theentrepreneurialmother.com.au. Reading about opportunities for success may inspire your own business idea and interact with like-minded moms.

, The key to a successful business venture is formulating an idea that will work in your life. The following are examples of successful businesses for busy moms.


Consider the skills that you have developed from years of work. Many moms decide they want to work from home after years as a professional. Chances are you do something better than most people, so decide what that thing is and try to develop a business approach.
Become a virtual assistant. If you have worked in an office and you have a lot of technical knowledge and experience, then companies and business people can hire you on a contractual basis to do data entry, set up appointments, write business letters, make calls, manage websites and manage marketing. You would be self-employed, market to professionals and companies and work regularly or completely from home.
Become an antiques or eBay dealer. The prevalence of online classifieds and auctions means that a savvy sales person can buy and sell to make money. It is a good idea to choose a few different products and specialize. Sign up for accounts, develop your credibility and find some storage space. Cruise Craigslist ads to find cheap deals and visit second hand shops when you have the time. The rest of the work can be done from home.
Become a personal stylist or organizational consultant. If style or order are skills of yours, then start marketing yourself to people in need of a life change. Volunteer for friends and family until you get a client list, and then start to market on the Internet and in print or on television. Much of the research required can be done at home or at stores, with the kids in tow.
Become a copywriter, if you have professional experience in writing or marketing. There is a plethora of jobs available to people who can change the style and tone of their writing for different audiences. Develop a portfolio, promote yourself online and apply for telecommuting copywriting jobs. You may be able to use your experience to work with businesses in your hometown as well.
Become a craft seller. If you are passionate about a certain art or craft, develop it further. Once you have an original product, make an account with Etsy.com and/or your own website and start selling it online. Thousands of people start doing this part-time and end up making a living from their creativity. Consider signing up for booths at craft fairs to supplement your income.

, While it is essential for all entrepreneurs to have a well-vetted business plan, you should also develop a long-term personal plan, based on how much time you want to spend taking care of your children. Consider how your time will change as your children grow older.


Spend plenty of time developing an iron-clad business plan. You may need to present it to banks for loans or friends and family for investment. Include managerial, marketing, financial, demographic strategies and a calendar that extends at least 5 years into the future.
Develop a daily schedule. For example, read emails while the kids are in bed. Make calls and meet with clients while they are at school. Devote time to the kids after school. Return to your office when they are doing their homework.

"
"
Create a dedicated work space.,
Separate work and childcare in your schedule.,
Do something healthy for yourself each day.,
Hire positive, driven employees.,
Engage your children to help you with your business.,
Take time management or organization classes, if these are not your strengths.,
Network with other entrepreneurial moms.",How to Be an Entrepreneurial Mom2," If you have an extra room at home, then turn it into an office, complete with a computer, printer, cork boards and a filing system. Separating work from home during the daylight hours is hard enough, so try to make your office as professional as possible.


Focus on creating a space where you won't be afraid to meet with clients. If you have local business, then you should be able to bring them into your office without being afraid of looking unprofessional. In some states, you need a license to conduct business at home, so check with your local Clerk of Court to see what the rules are.

, Although there will be many times throughout the day when the 2 worlds will collide, choose times that are dedicated to work and clients and others that are dedicated to your children. Separating your time will increase your focus and productivity and help you to enjoy being a mother.

, If you find that you aren't exercising, eating right or taking time for yourself, you may become overly stressed. Take a walk, do yoga when the children are napping, wander around a farmer's market, or do whatever it is that makes you feel relaxed and ready for motherhood and work.

, Most entrepreneurs need to hire employees to take care of certain aspects of business or watch over it while you are on vacation. Choose adaptable, trustworthy people who understand why you are motivated to make your home business a success.


Don't assume that friends or family are the best choice for employees. Starting a business with a friend can lead to problems down the road. Make sure you have discussions about how to handle arguments and problems within a business. If you hire an outside worker, you may be able to achieve a better boss/employee relationship.

, Most adolescents and teenagers have chores. Don't be afraid to give them work-related tasks, such as filing, cleaning your office or picking up around the house.


Children who are near entrepreneurs may get a better idea about hard work and the drive to succeed. Encourage your children to develop ideas of their own, whether it's a lemonade stand or fundraising for school.

, Both these skills are more important in an at-home entrepreneur than at an outside job, because you are in charge of all aspects of your day. Attend a seminar or class to learn these basic skills.


Embrace technology to help you organize yourself. Many calendar programs are available via email, mobile phone and remotely. Update your calendar while you are waiting to pick up your kids or before your appointments.

, These contacts can help you solve problems, use resources and work through stress. You can connect online or in your community.

Understand why other meeting attendees tend to perceive the latecomer unfavorably.",How to Pull Off Being Late to a Meeting1," For many people, having a latecomer enter a meeting is an annoyance because at its most basic, it is either disruptive, or it holds up everyone else if you are a vital part of the meeting. Being on time matters because here is how lateness can be viewed by your fellow meeting attendees:


Lateness is viewed as discourteous, inconsiderate, and even insulting by those arranging and attending the meeting.If you're the CEO or a top manager, you're setting a standard by your behavior, one that can easily demoralize the staff who do show up on time.If you're in charge of the meeting and you're late, which in turn causes the meeting to run overtime, you won't win any popularity contests!
If it's a job interview, your lateness really tells the interviewers that you're not that interested in the job. Even with traffic excuses, interviewers will expect you to be better organized to avoid that early morning traffic...
Turning up late makes attendees feel that you value yourself over them. Cherish other people's time as much as your own, otherwise you're wasting their time and it wears thin if repeated.;
"
"
Prepare.,
Alert relevant people in advance.,
Follow your workplace culture as the cue for entering a meeting late.,
Where it is possible or appropriate to explain your lateness, don't make up stories.,
Do your best to contribute productively to the meeting once you are there.,
Consider apologizing to colleagues after the meeting.",How to Pull Off Being Late to a Meeting2," If you know you're going to be late to a meeting, at least prepare the things you need to have with you for the meeting. Arrange your documents, files, agenda, laptop, etc., to grab as you rush to the meeting.

, If it is possible or appropriate to do so, try to alert your tardiness in advance because this lets the meeting organizer, any presenters, and attendees know that you will be showing up, albeit late.


A note or call to your boss or via a colleague will be a good way to alert the meeting chair that you're still intending to come despite running late.

, The formality or informality of your workplace will be a deciding factor in how you sidle into the meeting late. The most important thing is to not interrupt, but to wait for a natural pause to offer any excuses for your tardiness.


Be sure to turn off or silence your cell phone before entering the meeting!
For a formal workplace culture, it is best to try to keep your head low and be as unobtrusive as possible. Give your apology to the person chairing or leading the meeting quietly, provided it is not rude to interrupt, or where there is an appropriate pause in proceedings. A simple explanation suffices, such as ""Sorry I'm late, our London client called"", in order not to hold up progress of the meeting.
If there is a presentation underway, forget offering any apology at this stage unless your boss sidles up to you asking for a whispered excuse. Instead, slip in, sit down and be quiet until an appropriate opportunity presents itself to explain your lateness.
For an informal workplace culture, you might be able to inject a little humor into your late arrival, perhaps a smile and a shrug, and a quick, amusing anecdote of what delayed you. Don't overdo it though, and be prepared to settle straight into business.

, Sooner or later, any cover stories will be uncovered, especially if you're not in someone's favor. And clearly, obvious lying will be picked up by all! In particular, note what does not work:


Saying something along the lines of: ""I was doing something urgent/things would have fallen apart if I didn't stay behind"". This is also known as the ""putting out the fires"" excuse. It annoys people because first, it smacks of the late person perceiving themselves as indispensable - and if it were really that company-preserving, why didn't all the team get asked to pitch in?! Second, if it's a constant excuse, it makes everyone hearing it suspicious that the late person is just a really bad judge of time.Constant lateness. It annoys your coworkers because they had to sit through the tedious start, so why can't you. If you make a habit of it, they'll make a habit of not looping you in to what you've missed. An exception might be made if you're the company's irreplaceable glue – your workplace will be sure to let you know if you're that rare, crucial person – otherwise, you're in the same boat as everyone else.

, While it's important to slip into the meeting unobtrusively, you can redeem yourself by not being a shrinking violet during the meeting, and by participating actively. Some things to keep in mind, however:


Don't launch into a lengthy attack or defense on something that may very well have been explained in detail and resolved prior to your arrival. If you're not sure, preface by saying something like ""I'd like to talk about X, but I'm not sure if you already broached this subject earlier."" Look around to see how people react to draw your cue from.
Do your very best not to look bored or fidget during the rest of the meeting. That will only confirm to people that you delayed coming because you weren't interested.

Appear completely at ease. Do not, under any circumstances, seem frazzled or not on top of your game. Remain casual but engaged in the immediate proceedings.

, Approach members of your team after the meeting and explain your situation so that they don't bad mouth you behind your back. This is important. Many a top executive candidate has been sunk by lack of conciliation. Apologize and explain that you were on an important call, etc.

"
"
Acknowledge that you are going to be late the moment you're aware of it.,
Apologize to the person in charge of the meeting as soon as you arrive.",How to Pull Off Being Late to a Meeting3," If you find yourself suddenly stuck in traffic, the best business etiquette is to call the person or their administrative assistant, apologize and ask:


If it is okay for you to still come in and keep the appointment, even though you're going to be 15 or more minutes late. It is vital to estimate a reasonable time for your late arrival, as this allows the receptionist to check the diary to see whether or not your being late will cause other things to be out of schedule.
If you're going to be late by half an hour or more, ask for a rescheduling of the appointment or if it's still okay to come.
Take your cue from their answers. Either turn up as fast as you can, or turn up on time for the rescheduled appointment.

, Give a short, factual reason for your late arrival and let them know that you are now keen to get down to business.

"
"
Gauge how late you're going to be.,
Decide how important your punctuality is.,
Call ahead.",How to Apologize for Being Late to Work1," Depending on your job, a few minutes may not be that big of a deal. However, if it is going to be longer, you probably need to call or apologize when you get there., For instance, if you have a big meeting, it may be more important for you to be on time. Also, some jobs are more attentive to punctuality than other ones., If you're going to be more than 5 minutes late, it's probably best to call ahead. Let your boss know that you'll be delayed, and give her an estimate for about how long it will take."
"
Apologize sincerely.,
Note what you're apologizing for.,
Make your apology honest.,
Acknowledge that you know being late is wrong.,
Say, ""Thank you."",
Don't make excuses.,
Don't interrupt a meeting to apologize.,
Avoid being late in the future.",How to Apologize for Being Late to Work2," If you're not sincere, your boss will spot it from a mile away. Before going to apologize, make sure you are properly remorseful.One way to show you're sincere is to not make light of the apology. Don't laugh or joke while making it.

, Your boss may not understand why you're apologizing out of the blue because she may not have noticed you coming in late. Therefore, be specific.For instance, you could say, ""I would like to apologize for being 15 minutes late to work today.""

, Give the true reason why you were late, unless it's not a work-appropriate reason. The more elaborate story you try to make up, the more likely your boss is to think you're lying. Plus, lies usually have a way of coming out.However, keep it short.


For instance, you might say, ""I'm very sorry I was 15 minutes late. My kid got sick as I was walking out the door, and I had to make arrangements.""However, skip the reason if it is too silly or not work-appropriate. For instance, if you were late because you were having a bad hair day, that's probably not something you want to share at work. It's better to not give an excuse than to lie., You should make sure that your boss knows that you know what your lateness can cost the company. At the least, you're not performing your job as promised. At the worst, you could lose clients for the company.For instance, you could continue your apology by saying, ""I know that this company values punctuality for a good reason, and I will strive to be on time in the future.""

, If your boss doesn't fire you on the spot (which can happen at some jobs), show that you are grateful by saying thank you. For instance, you could say, ""I appreciate that you are giving me another chance."", If your boss tries to lay into you about being late, don't make an excuse. Let your boss have her say without interrupting and make sure she knows that you understand the consequences of being late., If you are going to a meeting first thing, it's best if you just go and join it, making as little noise as possible. Don't interrupt the meeting to make an apology. Wait until after the meeting., Of course, everyone is late once in a while. However, if you're chronically late, your boss will notice. No matter how sincerely you apologize, being chronically late means you're not actually sorry for what you've done because you keep repeating the same mistake."
"
Know when an apology letter or email is appropriate.,
Keep it formal.,
Open with ""Dear."",
State your reason for writing the letter.,
Show that you understand what it cost the company.,
Show you have a plan for the future.,
Show your gratitude.,
End with a ""Sincerely.""",How to Apologize for Being Late to Work3," If you were exceptionally late, you may need to move on to an apology letter or email. Another reason you may want to choose this option is if your lateness caused a big problem for the company, such as losing a client.

, That is, use addresses and a date at the top. Start with your name, address, and email at the top. Underneath that, put the date. Underneath that, add your boss's name, work address, and email., A safe bet for any business letter is opening with ""Dear."" If you call your boss by her first name usually, it's fine to insert her first name. If you don't, you should use ""Ms."" or ""Mrs.""

, Begin by stating why you are writing the letter. Note the date and time you were late, as well as the reason.For instance, you could say, ""I want to apologize for being 2 hours late to work on Friday, September 4, 2015. I had a crisis at home I could not avoid. I realize this caused problems with the company, and I would like to say how sorry I am.""

, Next, you need to show that you understand why your mistake was bad. Acknowledge what you cost the company.As an example, you could write ""I know that my tardiness has cost the company. I missed a meeting with a customer, and though I plan to make it up, I know it has lost the company some credibility.""

, End by stating how you plan to avoid this problem in the future. Show you have taken steps to prevent it.For instance, you could write ""I know you expect better from your employees, and I have taken steps to make sure this situation doesn't happen again. I've asked another family member to be available should another situation like this one creep up, so that I can be on time in the future.""

, Always end with gratitude. You want to let your boss know that you are thankful for any second chances she offers.As an example, you could say ""I appreciate the fact that you've been understanding, and I am grateful for another chance to prove my loyalty to the company.""

, Sign off the letter with ""Sincerely."" If you're printing off the letter, leave space for you to sign and then put your name underneath in type. If you're making an email, just put your name in print."

Do something that you enjoy.",How to Avoid Teacher Burnout," You may feel burnout because you're stuck in a rut and have been teaching the same material for a while. Sign up to attend a local workshop or national teaching conference. You'll be exposed to new ideas, passionate teachers, and new ways to think about your profession.Talk with other teachers at your school about the concepts you took away from the seminar. You might actually help other teachers who are struggling to stay excited about teaching.;
, It's easy to focus all of your energy and stress on the students who are causing problems or are struggling. Remind yourself that you've had successful students who enjoyed having you as a teacher. If you can, reconnect with some of those students to remind yourself that teaching is worth the effort.


Another trick is to remember what you loved about your favorite teacher. Try to include some of this person's positive traits into your own teaching., Practice some form of relaxation. You could meditate, do yoga, get a massage, or do deep breathing. Make sure you choose something that helps you completely unwind from teaching and reduces your anxiety.


You should also relax during school breaks. Studies have shown that relaxing over breaks prevents exhaustion and burnout., As a teacher, you have a lot of responsibility. It's easy to think that when things aren't going as smoothly as you'd like, that it's because of something you're doing (or not doing). For example, if you're feeling frustrated or burned out because you think a student doesn't respect you, you may be personalizing the problem. Instead, consider what might really be causing the problem.While you may think the student doesn't respect you, you may not have considered that the student is having problems at home and is taking out frustration in the classroom.

, You're probably used to getting feedback and criticism from fellow teachers, administrators, parents, and even students. Instead of getting hung up on their concerns, remind yourself that you're making a positive difference in the lives of your students. Let yourself see the good in your job and remind yourself why you enjoy teaching.Try to compliment yourself when you do anything that you're proud of or that helps a student.

, If you find that you're still struggling to get excited or motivated about teaching, talk to someone. Many schools have counselors or you could talk to colleagues. You might find that other teachers are feeling similar frustrations and have helpful ways to cope.


You can also talk to a professional therapist outside of the school. Just talking to someone outside of the school might help you regroup and recharge.

, It's easy to feel overwhelmed by a lot of little things when you're a teacher. Conquer this feeling by writing down a list of the key things that are important to you in your job and make them your focus. For example, instead of getting stressed out about preparing your students for a weekly quiz (that happens every week), put your efforts towards helping them prepare for the big term exam.Evaluating your goals also reminds you of what you've been able to accomplish. Your goals should be attainable or you'll frustrate yourself.

, If you're in a large school where several teachers teach the same grade, work together to come up with lesson plans, activities, or exams. Not only will this lighten your work load, but you can also discuss similar problems or concerns.You might even discuss combining your classes for some activities. You and the other teacher could trade off leading the class and using the free-time for grading or more lesson planning.

, If your school offers professional development or ways for teachers to interact, you should participate. Teaching can be an isolating job. But taking time to engage with other teachers at your school can make you feel more invested and supported in your job. Just make sure to avoid spending too much time around other teachers who complain all the time or who don't enjoy their jobs.You can also communicate with other teachers through social media if you find that it's hard to schedule time to meet up in person. Check out blogs that other teachers manage.

, As the school year progresses, you might find that it's harder to be prepared for teaching. Give yourself a fresh start and plan to get to school early one week. Getting to school 30 minutes early can give you time to finish up any last minute details, respond to emails, or just focus on the day ahead. Try to plan out your week so you're not scrambling every day.Being prepared will keep you from feeling rushed which can lead to burnout. At the very least, spend 15 minutes every night preparing for the next day.

, If you feel burned out because you can't seem to catch a moment's rest or are always scrambling to get through the day, you need to organize. Organize your teaching materials so you can easily find things and get rid of unnecessary things that are just taking up space.Being organized will help spend your time making daily lesson plans and weekly schedules instead of searching for materials and files.

, You may feel like a combination of things is causing burnout, so try to confront your biggest cause of stress at school. If you struggle with difficult behaviors in your classroom, you may need to meet with parents or bring in school support staff to talk with the student.Running away from your stressors will only lead to burnout. It may take a little time and energy to resolve your problems, but it will improve your work environment.

, This may be easier said than done. But you can try to leave work at school so that when you're home you're mentally home too. Not only will time at home help you unwind from the stresses of the day, but you'll be able to focus more on school when you're at work.Remind yourself that there will always be work to be done. But it's alright to leave it at work and take time to be home. If you don't, you'll quickly burnout.

, Don't be afraid to take a day off from teaching if you're sick, your child is sick, or you just need a mental health day. This is especially important if you're feeling really anxious, aren't sleeping well, and are struggling to function. Spend the day doing something that recharges you.If you take the day off, don't do anything school related. Use this day to heal, rest, and refocus your energy.

, You'll quickly feel burnout if you don't take care of yourself. Make sure you're eating several healthy meals throughout the day (even if you're busy). Try to eat healthy things that give you energy (like lots of fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates). Choose lean sources of protein for sustained energy.Avoid eating processed foods and loading up on sugary drinks or caffeine. These can cause sugar crashes that leave you feeling fatigued.

, One of the best ways to reduce stress is to exercise or do some physical activity. Try to get 30 to 40 minutes of exercise every day. Exercise is great for your health and can reduce your stress levels. Just choose a physical activity that you enjoy. Consider going for a walk, swimming, jogging, or strength training.Try to put work aside while you exercise. Let yourself focus on the activity you're doing rather than what you're worried about with your job.

, Try to spend some time every day doing something that you enjoy even if it's only for 20 or 30 minutes. Take a long shower, read a book, go for a walk, or watch your favorite tv show. Teacher burnout is something that only you can control so making time for yourself is important.If you don't regularly make time to do something you enjoy, you'll soon begin to resent your job.

One way to motivate your students to do the readings and come to class ready to discuss them is to give daily reading quizzes.You can either create simple short answer quizzes or assign writing prompts that will test your students' knowledge of the reading. Give these quizzes at the beginning of every class. You may even incorporate the quizzes into your class discussions, such as by asking students to share their answers.
Make sure that you give an adequate amount of points for the quizzes and responses. For example, if the quizzes for the entire semester are only worth 5% of the overall grade, then some students may not see these as worthy of their time and effort. Instead, consider making the quizzes worth around 20 to 30% of the total grade.;
, Another option to motivate students to do the assigned readings is to require students to come to class with questions about the reading. You can then use your students' questions to kick off the class discussion.


For example, you might require your students to bring in a set of three discussion questions per class and invite students to ask questions at random. Then, you could also collect the questions at the end of the class and give points to students who completed the questions.
Make sure that you explain how to write a good discussion question before you start requiring your students to bring in questions. Explain to students that good discussion questions should be open-ended. They should not result in a yes or no answer, or a single answer, such as “What was the name of Mrs. Dalloway’s visitor?” Instead, a good question might be something like, “What is the significance of the lines from Shakespeare’s Cymbeline that Mrs. Dalloway reads? Do these lines seem to have importance to anyone else but her? Why or why not?”

, If you give a lecture, make sure that you include a participation opportunity about every seven to 10 minutes. These opportunities should allow your students to respond, discuss, or ask questions about the material. Some good strategies that you might use include:Asking rhetorical questions. For example, while reading Mrs. Dalloway, you might ask your students something like, “What is the purpose of an internal dialogue?”
Having students share a similar experience with a neighbor. While reading Mrs. Dalloway, you could encourage students to identify something that they have in common with Clarissa, or another character.
Requesting that students paraphrase a concept that was just described. If you introduce a theoretical concept that sheds light on the text you are reading, then you might request that your students break into pairs or small groups and attempt to put the concept into their own words.

, At the college level, students should be exposed to literary theory. If your department has a specific course meant to introduce students to theory, then you may be able to request that students incorporate theory into papers or presentations. If not, then you may need to provide some instruction to help students understand and use literary theory.


For example, you could require students to craft discussion questions that incorporate a specific type of literary theory, such as feminist, psychoanalytic, or Marxist theory. Or, you could assign different schools of literary theory to individual students or small groups and require them to develop an analysis of a text using that theory.

, Close reading is essential when teaching literature at the college level, so make sure that you devote plenty of class time to close reading. Try to pick one passage per class or invite a student to pick one passage per class and focus on it for 15 to 20 minutes.


For example, you might invite one student per class to read a favorite paragraph aloud and invite the rest of the class to discuss that paragraph.You can also ask other students to point to other areas of the text that connect with the first student’s chosen paragraph as a way to deepen the conversation.

, Some passages may be too difficult for students to develop a response on the spot. In these situations, you can always direct your students to free write to help them generate ideas.


For example, if you notice that students are struggling to comment on a passage or that the discussion is limited to only a handful of students, give them five to 10 minutes to free write about the passage.
Avoid filling the silence with your voice. Keep in mind that there will be times when your students are silent, but it is usually because they are struggling with a question or concept. Allow them some time to struggle silently rather than giving them your answers.

, Some students will not feel comfortable speaking up in class, at least early on. Therefore, it is helpful to include small group activities into your classes so that all students have the opportunity to contribute to class discussions. Including group activities, or cooperative learning, in your classroom can also benefit students by providing them with the opportunity to learn from their peers.You might begin some of your classes by dividing your students into groups and assigning them a question about the day’s reading. Or, you might ask students to focus on a particular passage or chapter and develop some ideas and/or questions to add to the class discussion.
For example, if you are reading Mrs. Dalloway, then you might start the class by asking students, “How does Virginia Woolf transition from one character’s point of view to another? Find an example from the text to support your answer.”

, Scaffolding is when you teach students to do something that is one level beyond their abilities and then support them through the task. The students should develop mastery over the skill after practicing it a few times and then you can remove the support.For example, you might introduce close reading by guiding your students through a close reading of a passage during one class, then provide your students with chances to do the same during class time. Then, you might ask your students to do a close reading of a passage outside of class and write about it in a paper.

, Your students will often observe you and emulate the skills that you model for them in your class. Therefore, it is important that you model the types of skills that you want your students to learn.For example, you might model good questions for your students with the questions that you ask in class. Or, you might model good writing for your students by showing your students a paper that you wrote while you were a student.

, Asking questions can help students to connect what they have read with their own knowledge and experiences. It is especially important to ask questions that will help your students make connections between the readings and their own lives.Make sure that you ask your students some thoughtful questions during classes to help them find effective ways to enter the conversation.


Focus on open answer questions, rather than yes, no, and other single answer questions. Ask questions that start with “Why” and “How.” If you do ask any single answer questions, then make sure that you invite students to say more by asking “Why” and “How” questions.
For example, if you have just finished reading Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf, then you might ask your students something like, “How does Woolf tell the story?” and “What does this format reveal about the way we narrate our own lives?”

, Using images, films, and other visual aids can be quite beneficial for students who are more visual learners. No matter what your preferred form of teaching, you should consider incorporating some kind of visual aid into your classes. This can range from high-tech, such as a PowerPoint, to low-tech, such as notes and doodles on the whiteboard.


For example, creating a PowerPoint that pairs difficult concepts with images may help some students to gain understanding of a book that a spoken lecture might not.
Films can also be helpful aids to include. For example, you might use a film to provide a compliment to a complicated scene in a book, or as a point of comparison after the class has finished reading a book.

, To maintain a positive environment in your literature class, you will have to offer your students encouragement for contributing to the discussion. This can just be a simple, “Thanks for bringing that up,” after a student finishes a comment or question. Or, you can offer more personal responses. For example, you might say something like, “I wondered the same thing when I first read Mrs. Dalloway.”


Thank your students at the end of each class for their participation as well. For example, you might say something like, “I really enjoyed our discussion today. Thank you all for contributing such excellent ideas.”
Avoid criticizing your students’ interpretations or shutting them down if something is unclear. If something that a student says is unclear, then you can prompt the student to clarify by asking something like, “That is an interesting thought. Why do you say that?” Or, “It seems like you are wrestling with a difficult concept. Do you want to expand or open up the topic to the rest of the class?”
Avoid praising the quality of a question. Saying that you think a question is “good” might lead others to think that their questions are not good. Therefore, try to avoid this type of praise. Instead, stick to remarks that will encourage students. You can even use non-verbal encouragement, such as smiling, nodding your head, or giving a thumbs up., Some departments may assign you a mentor to help you as you begin to teach. If your department does not assign you a mentor, then you might consider choosing someone for yourself. Choose someone who you think is well-suited to help you develop your teaching skills.


For example, if you are a medievalist, then you might ask another medievalist in your department if he or she would be willing to serve as your mentor. However, having the same scholarly interests is not a requirement for a good mentor. You might simply choose someone who you think would make a good mentor because of his or her personality and experience., You can improve your knowledge of pedagogy and what works for teaching literature by attending conferences and by reading articles about teaching literature. Try to view presentations and read articles that connect with the texts you are teaching.


For example, if you are teaching Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, you can read journal articles about the most successful pedagogical strategies for teaching this work. Or, if you attend an author specific conference, such as a Virginia Woolf conference, then you might try to attend pedagogy presentations that discuss teaching Woolf in general or a specific text, such as The Waves or Orlando.

, Think back to the professors that taught your favorite college literature courses to start getting some ideas for teaching strategies. Some questions you might ask yourself include:


What teaching methods did your favorite professors use in class?
What did you like about these teaching methods?
How did these methods help you to understand and discuss difficult texts?
What (if anything) would you change about these methods if you decide to use them in your class?

, Based on past teaching experiences, you may already have a sense of what you excel at in the classroom. For example, you might be really good at making and giving PowerPoint presentations, or facilitating class discussions, or developing interesting group activities.


Make a list of your strengths in the classroom as well as any other personal strengths that you think might lead you towards some effective teaching strategies.

, Your more experienced colleagues are excellent resources for learning about teaching strategies and getting lesson plan ideas. Whether you are a graduate assistant who is just starting to teach or a tenure track professor, you can learn something new from a more experienced member of your department.


Try setting up a meeting with someone who also teaches literature in your department. Ask for suggestions on what works, feedback on your current ideas, resources that might help you, and general advice.
Consider asking to observe other literature classes to see how other teachers encourage discussion.

, A teaching philosophy communicates your goals and values as a teacher. Creating a teaching philosophy may even help you to develop your teaching skills, so it is a good idea to write out your teaching philosophy even if you do not need to. Most teaching philosophies include:your ideas about teaching and learning
a description of the strategies that you use to teach
an explanation of why you teach the way that you do

, Your English department might have specific guidelines for the course you are teaching, so it is important to check before you start designing your course. For example, you might be required to teach specific texts, give certain assignments, or incorporate specific concepts.


Ask your department chair or another supervisor if you can see other professors' syllabi to get ideas about how your course should look. Use these syllabi to help you determine how you can meet the department’s requirements for the course.

, If you are teaching a special course for your department, then you may already have a theme. However, you can always add a theme for even more focus. If the course does not have a theme, then you may find it easier to identify readings and craft assignments by choosing a theme. Some common literature course themes include:African American literature
Author courses, such as Shakespeare, Chaucer, or Dickens
Family
Food
Gender
Myth
Rural or Urban literature
Symbolism
Time periods, such as the 20th century, the Enlightenment, or the Renaissance
Types of literature, such as poetry, short stories, drama, or novels
Utopian or dystopian literature
Women writers

, Once you have identified your theme, start listing potential texts that you could teach for that course. This list may include far more books or other works than you could realistically teach. Just keep in mind that you can narrow down your list later on.


You can also ask colleagues for suggestions. Someone who has taught for a long time might be able to suggest texts that work really well for the course you are teaching.
For example, if you wanted to teach a course that focuses on women writers, then you might include on your list works by Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, Toni Morrison, and Zora Neale Hurston.

, Once you have decided on the works that you will include in your course, you will need to develop a reading schedule. First, decide what order you would like your students to read the texts. Then you can devise a schedule for how much of each text you will read each week.


Consider the length of the texts as you develop your reading schedule. For books and other long works, you will need to break the readings into manageable sections. For short works, such as poems or short stories, you may be able to read the entire piece for one class.

, Most literature classes require students to write at least one paper, but you can also include different types of assignments. For example, you might also include presentations, discussion leading activities, or quizzes and exams.


Make sure that you check the course requirements to determine what (if any) assignments are required by your department.

Tabulate the grades and show the students the completed rubric.",How to Make a Rubric," Rubrics are generally used for longer assignments or projects that involve multiple sections or parts that will require a certain amount of subjectivity in the grading. In other words, you wouldn't use a rubric for a multiple-choice test but you might use one to grade an essay or a presentation. Articulating the particular goals of the project to be graded is helpful in coming up with the more specific things you'll look for in evaluating it. Consider the following questions:


What is the main purpose of the assignment you're grading?
What are the students supposed to have learned by completing the assignment?
How will you recognize a successful assignment?
What makes a project stand out?
What's ""good enough""?;
, To start breaking the grade down, distinguish between the parts of the grade that cover the content and the parts of the grade that are morel like completion points. There are typically two main categories of components that you'll need to determine to complete a comprehensive rubric, depending on the assignment you're grading: content and process.



Content components refer to the actual meat of the assignment and the quality of what the student produces. This includes things like:

Style
Engagement with course themes or objectives
Argument or thesis
Organization
Creativity and voice



Process components are the individual steps that a student must complete to perform the assignment. This refers to things like:

Title page, name, and date
Time or length requirements
Formatting



, Is it going to be worthwhile to assign a point-value to the student's use of transitional sentences? Their breath-control while giving a speech? The quality of the binder they use? Try to pick a manageable number of criteria to look for and to grade. The less complicated your rubric the better. It should be comprehensive, but not overwhelming, which makes it more frustrating for you to grade and more difficult for the student to understand. Be judicious in choosing the criteria and cut it down to the fewest possible categories.


A basic essay rubric, for example, might include five sections, weighted appropriate to their respective values: thesis or argument, organization or paragraphing, intro/conclusion, grammar/usage/spelling, sources/references/citations.

, It wouldn't make much sense to throw a rubric that assigned fifty points for thesis statements if you haven't talked about writing thesis statements in class. You would use the content of your lessons to evaluate the assignment, so use the same content to develop your rubric.

Within the larger or more basic categories on your rubric, you could get more specific if you wanted to. Within ""Thesis or argument"" you might assign particular point values to topic sentences, the thesis statement, claims and use of evidence, depending on your students' grade level and the particular things you're focusing on in your lesson plans.

, There are many ways to structure a point system over the course of a semester, but by far the easiest way to do it from assignment-to-assignment is to work on the basic 100 scale. It breaks down easily into letter grades, the math is simple, and students are already familiar with it. Try to assign values to your criteria that add up to a total of 100, in either percentage or total points.


Some teachers employ over-complicated point systems as a way of shifting the focus away from more traditional grading distinctions and the stigma associated with them. It's your classroom, but know that this tends to be more confusing than helpful for students, reinforcing the impression that they're being graded subjectively by a never-ending chain of different teachers' whims. Consider sticking with the traditional 100 point scale, flawed as it may be., Certain parts of the assignment will probably be worth more than other parts, so you should assign values accordingly. This can be the most difficult part of the rubric, which is why it's helpful to do some thinking about the major goals of the assignment and the students' learning. The basic essay rubric might look something like this:


Thesis and argument: _/40

Thesis statement: _/10
Topic sentences: _/10
Claims and evidence: _/20


Organization and paragraphs: _/30

Order of paragraphs: _/10
Flow: _/20


Introduction and conclusion: _/10

Intro previews topic: _/5
Conclusion summarizes argument: _/5


Proofreading: _/10

Punctuation: _/5
Grammar: _/5


Sources and Citations: _/10

Works Cited Page: _/5
In-Text Citations: _/5


Alternatively, you can equally divide the individual tasks into numerical values for assignments in which all components of the project are weighted equally. This would be less applicable for a written assignment, but might be appropriate for a presentation or other creative project.

, It usually helps to have a semester-long cemented grade breakdown to avoid over-complicating the grading progress, so it's usually recommended to keep letter grades on a basic 100 point scale.


Alternatively, if you dislike the connotations with traditional letter grades, you can assign terms like ""Outstanding"" ""Satisfactory"" and ""Unsatisfactory"" to the different levels of points to communicate grades differently to your students.

, Write-up detailed descriptions of each level, articulating what a particular grade ""means"" in terms of its points and how the students should interpret the grade they get. It's sometimes easier to begin with the highest level and then identify aspects that would lower the quality of work for each lower level. Saying what exactly a ""C"" entails tends to be a lot more difficult than saying what a ""A"" means. A basic grade breakdown for an essay-style assignment might look like this:


A (100-90): The student's work fulfills all criteria of the assignment in a creative and exceptional manner. This work exceeds the criteria of the assignment, showing the student took extra initiative in originally and creatively forming content, organization, and style.

B (89-80): The student's work fulfills the basic criteria of the assignment. Work at this level is somewhat successful, but could be improved in organization and style.

C (79-70): The student's work fulfills most of the criteria of the assignment. Though the content, organization, and style are somewhat mixed in quality and may require some revision. This work does not suggest a high level of originality and creativity from the student.

D (69-60): Work either does not complete the requirements of the assignment, or meets them quite inadequately. Work at this level requires a good deal of revision, and is largely unsuccessful in content, organization, and style.

F (Below 60): Work does not complete the requirements of the assignment. In general, students who put forth genuine effort will not receive an F.

, Organizing a chart that you can fill in as you work through each assignment will streamline your grading process and give the students something concrete to look at when they get their paper back. It tends to be a lot more helpful in guiding them towards areas for improvement than a big letter grade scrawled in red ink.Place each objective or task in its own row, making the different possibilities for points at the top of each column. List the expectations for each quality level under each the heading. The headings should be in order from the lowest quality to the highest quality or vice versa, depending on your preference.

, It's always a good idea to give the students some idea of how they'll be graded and what they'll be graded on. You should probably emphasize the specific assignment sheet, depending on the type of assignment, but it's still helpful for the student to have some sense of the different things you'll be looking for and to be able to use the rubric as a checklist before turning the assignment in.

, Brainstorm different values for the grade on the board and let the students come up with the rubric themselves. Typically, they'll weight things exactly as you would, and it gives them some sense that the grading will be fair and that they've got a stake in their own success. This is a highly recommended exercise in getting students to engage with the process of their own learning.


You're still the teacher. If students are united in wanting to assign 99 points to grammar, you can end the exercise without completing it. Use it as a teachable moment, though. Pick on students with bad spelling and ask if they'll really want the bulk of their grade to come from sentence-level nitpicking. They'll get the picture.

, If you're in the middle of a big batch of essays and you realize it's somewhat unbalanced, maybe weighting too much and giving what you think might be skewed-positive grades, it's not the right time to switch things up and go subjective-rogue on the grading. Stick to the rubric and revise it for next time.

, Assign points to each category, tabulate the grade at the end, and share the finished product with the student. Save a copy for your records, and return the table with the individual grade breakdown to each student. Make time to speak with students about their grade if they desire a consultation.

Start teaching immediately.,
Study all you can on the subject of teaching guitar, all the while continuing to teach so that you build concrete experience that will help you make sense of what you are studying.,
Start thinking of guitar teaching as a business.,
Promote your teaching business extensively using a variety of methods.,
Consider getting a professional logo if you don't have competent design skills.,
Build a website and use your logo.,

Communicate your enthusiasm for teaching.",How to Make a Living from Teaching Guitar," Teaching is a skill best learned by experience and the sooner you start the better. Depending on your experience level, either start with friends and family members; teaching them for free, or offer to teach beginners for a modest rate (such as £10 per hour in the UK or $15 in the US). The classic mistake many would-be guitar teachers make is to think that they have to “complete” learning the guitar themselves before they will feel ready to teach. The fact is that you can never complete learning the guitar – it’s just too big a subject.


During this time, you should put together some teaching materials like a list of beginner songs you can teach along with print-outs of tabs and scales and exercises that your students can practice at home.;
, This is by far the single most important factor to your success as a professional. The reason why it is easy for you to succeed in this business is because it is crammed to the gills with people who are not great at teaching. It’s not that they are bad people – it’s just that they haven’t realized that the job is not about being a great guitarist – it’s about being a reasonably good guitarist but a brilliant teacher! And, some great guitar players are terrible teachers, just like some great doctors have terrible bedside manner.

, Set a goal for how much money you'd like to make per year from teaching guitar then, research other guitar teachers in your area. See how much they charge even if it means calling as a potential student. Find out what the going rate is because that's about where you should start too. (As demand for your lessons grow, you can raise your rate.) Divide your annual goal by the rate you're starting off with and that should be approximately how many lessons you need to give to meet your goal. (E.g. To make $20,000 a year charging $40 an hour, you need to give 500 lessons in a year, or about 42 lessons a month.) However, there are other things to consider. This site may help you to gain some ideas: Where are these students going to come from?
How will you handle cancellations of lessons?
What about student turnover?
When do you get to take a holiday?
What do you do during the summer if no one wants lessons?
How much do you have to pay in taxes from this income?
Can you write off any business expenses, like mileage you use to get to people's houses, if you commute to teach?

, Since the business primarily is local, focus on methods such as community boards, fliers and possibly local newspaper. Traditional advertising such as ads in newspapers or radio can be very expensive so keep track of your money if you choose to advertise. Consider using discount coupons as a way to increase your responses.

, It will set you apart from 90% of other guitar teachers and show potential clients that you're serious about your business. This article talks about that a bit more, among other things:. Keep in mind that a logo's job is only to attract attention. In the long run, it's the quality of your teaching that determines your success. In other words, don't spend too much time or money on a logo when you can spend time developing your teaching business in other ways.

, If you do a search for guitar teachers in your area (e.g. guitar lessons Denver) you will probably find very few websites, and the ones you do find will likely be very basic. Take advantage of this niche by building a simple but clean and professional looking website, and using search engine optimization to your advantage., Post hundreds of those fliers around your neighborhood (coffee shops, gyms, stores, telephone poles).

, Tell everyone you come across that you are now teaching guitar professionally and have vacancies for beginner students. Hand out your cards and also leave them in places where people will find them.

, Don't be picky. Don't go into teaching with the mindset that you'll take only ""motivated"" students (i.e. students who practice diligently). Most people looking for lessons are motivated to some degree, and their motivation will also depend on how the lessons go, and how you teach them. Plus, some people just don't have time to practice, and a guitar lesson is a chance for them to relax, so that might mean going over the same simple song several times with them.Don't get frustrated if people don't practice outside of their lessons, just remember they're paying you to teach them guitar, and how much progress they make is ultimately up to them.

Who are your students?
What curricular needs do they and/or your department have?
What would you like students to have achieved by the end of the course?;
, Write out a set of learning goals for your course (using action verbs) and include it as one of the first sections on your syllabus. You don’t need to have a great number of learning goals for your course; including a few well-thought out goals is best. You don’t have to only teach what is included in your stated goals, but they will serve as a guide. Some examples of learning goals used in actual courses are:


Demonstrate the ability to read, evaluate and interpret general economic information.
Apply research methods in psychology, including design, data analysis, and interpretation to a research project.
Communicate effectively in an oral presentation.
Formulate a well-organized argument supported by evidence.
Identify major figures and ideas in peace movements from around the world.

, Typically, you will determine this based on how students perform on the assignments you provide, but there are other options as well. You will want to write a more or less detailed description of assignments/assessment tools to include in your syllabus. Some typical ways of assessing learning include:


Quizzes and exams
Learning activities (fill in the blank, practice equations, etc.)
Presentations
Writing assignments (essays, research papers, etc.)
Portfolios that gather and introduce a collection of finished work
Self-reflective exercises (ask students to describe what they have learned from the course)

, In order to determine how a student is performing on any given assignment, you'll want a rubric. Rubrics help you measure student achievement by comparing it to certain levels that you've set. Most rubrics operate on a points or letter-grade scale, such as A/B/C etc. A rubric has four components:A description of the task. This should be a clear set of instructions about what you are asking students to do, such as write an analytical essay or conduct a scientific experiment.
Characteristics you will be rating. These are the skills, knowledge, or behavior that you will be observing and grading. For example, you might measure clarity of language for an essay or use of the scientific method for an experiment. Usually, these are listed in rows on the left of the rubric sheet.
Levels of mastery. These levels measure how well the student displays the rated characteristics. You can use names (e.g., Exceeds expectations/Meets expectations/Below expectations) or grades (A, B, C, etc). Usually, these are listed in columns across the rubric sheet.
Description of each characteristic at each level of mastery. This will explain what each characteristic looks like at each level of mastery. For example, you might say something like ""Student has fewer than 5 grammatical errors"" for an ""A"" level of mastery in ""clarity of language.""
You can find many samples of rubrics online,or you can ask fellow instructors in your department to share theirs with you.

, Aside from teaching the content of a particular course and giving assignments, you will also need to articulate expectations and requirements for managing the course. Consider, for instance:Will students be required to purchase textbooks or other materials? Or will they be optional? How will you ensure that course materials are affordable? Will students have to purchase materials all at once, or can they stagger the purchases throughout the term?
What will your grading policy be? Your institution, department, or supervisor might require a certain grading policy. If not, you will have to determine how different components of a course will factor into a student’s overall grade or evaluation.
Will you accept late or incomplete assignments? Will you allow students to resubmit assignments on which they did not perform well?
Is attendance required in your course? If so, how will you keep track of it, and evaluate it? If it is not required, how will you ensure that students are meeting your learning goals?
Will you allow students to use electronic devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc.) in class? Not at all? Only at certain times?
How will you accommodate students who may have special needs? Many institutions have an office dedicated to this concern; if you are not sure if yours has one, ask your supervisor about it. This office may even require that you include an accommodation statement on your syllabus, so check with your department.

, Decide which topics, readings, concepts or activities will be covered each session. In addition, schedule examinations, when assignments are due, and any other important dates. You can modify your schedule later, if you need to, but always think about how to schedule your course to help students meet your learning objectives.


For instance, you might plan to cover more complex topics and assignments later in the term.
Likewise, you might schedule activities early in the term that help you see how prepared students are for the course, and to identify any areas that might need special attention.
Think about scheduling assignments and activities at a pace students can handle. For instance, you might not want to assign a major assignment immediately before or after a major examination.
Remember to block out holidays or other days on which your school is closed. Nothing is worse than working out a beautiful syllabus only to find out that you have scheduled an exam for a holiday.

, The specific components of a syllabus, as well as the order in which they appear, will vary based on the course and/or institutional requirements. However, syllabi commonly include sections on:Basic information (course title and/or number, meeting times, office hours, contact information)
A course description
Learning goals
Materials (books or other supplies required for the course, and/or a list of helpful resources)
Requirements (examinations, writing assignments, presentations, participation, etc.)
Grading/evaluation policy
Course management policies (attendance, use of technology, etc.)
Statement on accommodation
Statement of honor code (describing expectations to combat plagiarism, for instance)
Schedule of class meetings, examinations, assignments, and other significant dates.

, Just as your course as a whole has several broad learning objectives, defined on your syllabus, each lesson plan should outline specific goals. If you have designed your syllabus and course schedule well, this should not be too difficult. Think about:What is the day’s topic? (reading, concept, method, etc.)
What do you want students to learn?
What do you want students to be able to do or understand at the end of class?

, Your lesson plan should incorporate an amount of activity that is appropriate for the time allotted for the class. Don’t try to do too much, but also make sure that class time is used effectively.Some find it helpful to write out a rough timeline for each lesson. For instance: “We will spend 10 minutes on activity A, then 20 minutes on activity B….”
Prioritize activities and/or learning objectives. Place those that you definitely want to cover with students early on in the lesson. If there are others that are optional or could be omitted if you are pressed for time, place them near the end of the lesson plan.

,


Try giving students a brief introduction at the start of class that explains what you will cover that day (activities, key points, concepts, etc.).
After covering the material of a lesson in the middle of a class, close by summarizing what you have done in the session. This helps students retain information. You can also ask students to self-reflect on what they have learned in a discussion or written form.

, You don’t have to write down your lesson plan if you don’t want. Even if you do, it doesn’t need to be a lengthy document. Whether it is written or just “in your head,” just make sure that your lesson plan outlines learning objectives in a way that is effective for you and your students.

, Your lesson plan doesn’t have to be fixed. If you notice that a particular activity isn’t working well, for instance, you can move on to something else. Alternatively, if it seems that students want to or need to spend more time on a particular topic or activity, you can do so. Be flexible with your lesson plan, as long it helps to meet your learning objectives.

, You can learn a lot about teaching by discussing ideas with other instructors. Talking to instructors who have taught the same or similar courses can help you when you are planning your syllabus and lesson plans. You can also gain ideas from them throughout the term.

, You don’t need to become best friends with your students. Knowing something about their backgrounds, interests, and future plans, however, can help you teach them more effectively. If you are familiar with your students, you can foster an inclusive classroom environment.Likewise, students are more likely to be engaged in a course if they feel that their instructor understands and cares about them.


You can ask students to fill out a brief survey at the beginning of a course that describes any of the following: their background, reason for choosing the course, similar courses taken, interests, etc. You can also meet with students individually in office hours to get to know them.
Model diversity and inclusiveness for students by accounting for multiple points of view on a given topic. For instance, if you are teaching “American Literature,” make sure that the course acknowledges a range of perspectives, including those of Native American, European, African, and Asian descent as well as other heritages and perspectives, such as LGBTQ writers. You could do this by including a wide variety of readings, for instance.
Don’t assume that students will contact you if they have problems or questions about a course. They might be busy with other courses or work obligations, or be unsure of how to approach you. Be proactive and ask students frequently if they have questions or concerns.
Have high expectations for all your students. If you expect that they can and will succeed, they are more likely to. Identify those students that need more assistance, and work to provide it. Don’t assume that a student from a certain background will or will not succeed just because of that background.
Don’t assume that all members of a group will share the same opinion. Respect your students as individuals.
Have a reasonable policy for accommodating students who will be absent for religious or cultural events, services, and holidays.
Don’t assume that students who don’t participate much don’t care about your course. Some students are shy or unaware of how to participate. Identify these students and work with them to develop ways they can be engaged in your course.

, You will want to make sure that students can contact you throughout the term, including outside of class hours. Email is a good option, but it is also a good idea to keep regular office hours where students can visit with you and ask any questions about the course or assignments.If you are teaching an online course, you can either keep office hours (if you have a physical office students can easily visit), or virtual office hours via video conference, email, a forum, etc. Instructors teaching traditional courses can also make use of virtual office hours, if they like.

Prepare ahead of time.,
Remember, the right decision is not always the most popular one.,
Always keep focused on the MAIN outcome of your lesson.,
Reinforce the purpose of the lesson.,
Don’t give out all the information all the time.,
Consider group work as an option.,
Allow some time to think.,
Encourage discussion.,
Be pragmatic.",How to Be a Better Relief Teacher," The best way to bridge the gap is to communicate with the teacher you are relieving and asking her how she runs the class. How she handles disputes. Who the mischievous kids are. And any things that are unique to his/her teaching style so you can replicate them as best as possible. If the teacher is unavailable to answer your questions, ask the teachers that work next door to her or perhaps ask the faculty in the teacher's lounge what your teacher was like.;
, Canceling a homework assignment might make the students love you that day, but it sets them back in the long run. Instead of skipping an assignment, make it fun and interesting.

, This should be clearly established in your own mind well before you start the lesson. Write the answer to this question somewhere in your diary, “At the end of this lesson I want kids to …”

, Students may see work as annoying, time consuming, pointless and something that prevents them from doing something fun (like watching tv, playing outside, etc.).


A lot of the time these feelings arise because students do not understand the relevancy of the assignment in their life. The simple question, ""Why is this important? How will doing this assignment benefit me?""
If you can think ahead of time good, fun and witty answers to these questions before you teach, you can change the attitude of resistant students and mold them into receptive and eager vessels of knowledge. But you need to help them understand why it's worth missing their fav tv show or playing outside for less time than they did yesterday.

, Some time kids want to explore options to get information. Give out books, computer access and/or website for students to search. Show the students how to use common search engines like Google.

, There is no doubt that group work is the chatty option. Having kids facing other kids is a sure fire bet to start discussion. But if discussion is important to your lesson, then perhaps group work is a great option.


Investigations are powerful learning opportunities. Investigations are those activities avoided by most relief teachers because they are usually difficult to organize on the spot.

, Students need time to THINK and process new concepts. Relief teachers, because they know content and skills, sometimes go on without giving kids the take up time needed to understand a concept.


Sometimes relief teachers talk too fast and pepper the students with questions and activities without giving them time to process. You know the old adage, “Stop and smell the roses!” That is also true in the classroom.
Be mindful that students in your class may be at completely different levels. Some process things extremely quick, others take a lot of time, while some need repetition.

, What is the article about? Do you think the article is bias? Is there anything you would like to know that the article did not mention? And more investigatory questions like that.


Allow students the time to talk. Check out this strategy. Honestly, everyone needs to be given a chance to talk. Put 30 adults together in a small room and tell them to be quiet. It is not a practical application of learning.
Share your learning process. There is nothing more valuable to a student learner than to see a master at work. When learning a new concept, vocalize the thought processes you use to interpret meaning. Show your class how you develop meaning.

, Sometimes lessons develop in a completely different way than you expected. Sometimes that can be a good thing. So how do you know the difference? Is the main thing still the main thing? If not, then bring the lesson back and consider the matter another day.

Reputable graduate programs often accept applicants from similarly reputable colleges and universities.Set a clear study schedule for yourself and plan out your assignments weeks in advance. If you plan ahead now, you will establish the necessary time management skills you will need in college.Divide your time into manageable chunks. Don't plan for large chunks of time (like 4 or 5 hours) because it might be harder to maintain that level of attention and commitment. Instead, create manageable 1-2 hours blocks of time to study and complete projects.Study for your standardized tests. Your SAT and ACT scores are a key part of your application package. You can find study tips and practice tests at the College Board's web site. You should study for a few months before the test -- don't cram for it the night before.
You can also check out test prep books at you local library, take prep courses offered by companies like Pearson and Kaplan or look into studying with a private tutor.;
, Many college departments will list how many students gain acceptance to graduate school on their web site. You can also ask an admissions officer how many students go onto Ph.D. programs from their university's department.


Consider the size and scope of your university. Small liberal arts colleges are great for getting a personalized attention, but they tend not to have the resources for archival research provided by larger universities.Similarly, with a larger university, you will need to work extra hard to become known to your professors since many of them will teach very large survey courses or they will only teach upper level courses and graduate courses. Attend department events and stop by your professor's office hours to express your interest in the material and discuss specific projects. This will help your professors get to know you when they have hundreds of other students.
If you are planning to attend a large university, you should also look into joining an honors college within the university as this will give you a smaller cohort and more individual attention., Your performance in your undergraduate program will be the major factor that your graduate committee will consider when they admit you. Make sure you manage your course load so you can balance your responsibilities. Anything more than four reading intensive courses each semester will be difficult to manage. Don't overload courses. You will need to strengthen your reading skills in college as most graduate programs require you to analyze an intensive amount of reading material. But don't feel pressure to cram extra courses into each semester. Talk to your advisor about the recommended amount of courses to take for your graduate school aspirations.
Maintain a high GPA. You should have a generally high GPA, but in the courses of your major, most graduate programs will expect you to earn grades of an A+, A or A-. If you have consistently earned C's, Ds or failed courses in your major, then graduate school might not be for you..
Work or volunteer as a tutor. This could be in a position in your school's writing center or you could tutor students at a local high school. In most graduate programs, you will be expected to do some form of teaching and tutoring while you are an undergrad will indicate your interest in this role., An internship will give you valuable professional experience and will allow you to learn outside the space of a classroom. It will also help you to build a professional network outside of academia.


Talk to your university's career center for tips on finding a rewarding internship., While being a strong reader and writer are essential skills for most graduate programs, you should consider developing other skills that can translate inside and outside of academia.Consider taking a web development class and an introductory data analysis or statistics course. These courses will give you vital technological and quantitative skills that will translate into a variety of professions, not just graduate school.

, In your senior year, consider enrolling in a graduate level course if your school offers a Master's or Ph.D. program. This will give you a sense of the level of work required by a more advanced degree.If your advisor is offering a graduate level course, ask them if you think you should enroll in it. This will let them know that you are interested in graduate study.

, In order to become a college professor, most departments require you to have a Ph.D. Before you begin the application process (which is very time consuming), you should think deeply about why you want to attend, especially when the promise of job security after you graduate with a Ph.D. is very unlikely.Are you afraid to go on the job market after graduating with your B.A.? Do you not know of anything else to do? These are not good reasons to go to graduate school.
Even if you have a genuine passion for your discipline and want to study if further, consider if you would be willing to do this after ten years of very hard work with little pay and no job security., Particularly, research how many of their graduates have been placed in tenure-track jobs in the past ten years. If the department doesn't supply this information on their web site, this is a red flag.You should aim to apply for 10-15 programs. Aim high when you apply; only 50% of all Ivy League Ph.Ds go on to earn tenure-track jobs and the percentage decreases at lower tier programs. Going to a very prestigious school will help your chances of getting a tenure-track job., In graduate school, you will work much more closely with your advisor than in undergrad. You should look for faculty members who have the title of Associate Professor or just Professor. This means they have tenure and they have a stable future at the university.


If a faculty member has a title of Assistant Professor or Visiting Assistant Professor, then this means they are only tenure-track or on a limited term appointment. Do not pick them as an advisor as their future at the university is uncertain.
As most Ph.D. programs last between 5-7 years, you will need someone who will be at the university for a long time to support you and approve your dissertation.Take the time to read that professor's research. Don't just peruse their interests as they are listed on the faculty web site -- read articles and books by them to see what kinds of contributions they have made to their field.

, Don't go into significant debt for a Ph.D. Unlike a J.D. or an M.D. degree, the Ph.D. generally does not offer very lucrative careers that can pay down large amounts of debt (the average salary of a tenure-track Assistant Professor is $53,000; the average salary of adjunct professors is $25,000-$27,000, although it can be much lower). Your Ph.D. program should at least cover tuition and should also provide some sort of living stipend., If you already have significant debt from your undergraduate degree, you should consider if it is worth it to take on additional debt for another degree or if it might be worth to spend a few years paying down your debt.Many programs offer funding through Teaching Assistantships or Instructor positions. Beware of programs that want you to begin teaching in your first year of coursework or programs that want you to teach more than one course a semester. A heavy teaching load will make it difficult for you to finish your research.
Look for grants on the U.S. Department of Education's web site or for grants offered for graduate students by your professional organization (such as American Psychological Association)., After you have decided which 10-15 programs you want to apply to, make a timeline including all the relevant information for each application. When is the due date for each application? Do they all require the same materials or do some require different components (such as a portfolio)?


You should start the application process a few months before each due date. Talk to your advisors and let them know you are thinking of applying to graduate school. Ask them if they will be able to write letters of recommendation for you. You should make a formal request for a letter of recommendation at least a month before the application is due.
At the beginning of the fall semester of your senior year (or in August if you have graduated), contact your university's career for any guidance on applying to graduate school. They will have lots of guidance and can help you network with alumnae who have gone on to graduate school.

, Most Ph.D. programs require the GRE; they often also require a GRE subject test in your area. As with the SAT, you should give yourself time to study and practice taking this test. Do not cram in the night or week before the test.


Look for prep test courses and study guides offered by your university's career center. You can also study with guide books, takes practice tests offered through Educational Testing Service, or look into using a tutor to help you prepare.In most major cities, the GRE is offered year round when taken on the computer. The fee for taking the test is $195 and can be paid on-line with most major credit or debit cards at Educational Testing Service's web site.

, Your cover letter should clearly state your professional interests in the program and which field of study you would like to pursue. Most graduate programs require some form of specialization (i.e. if you study history, you will have to choose a geographical and historical specialization, like early American history before the Civil War).


Clearly state which faculty members you want to work with in your cover letter. Explain how their research interests align with yours. Discuss which experiences in your background make you prepared to study this field.
Avoid making any cliche statements, such as sentences that start with the phrase ""I always knew I wanted to teach this subject"" or ""Ever since I was a child, I loved reading."" Instead, focus on what research questions you are interested in exploring in the program.
Obsessively proofread your cover letter. If you include any typos or grammatical errors, this will indicate to the committee that you are either a weak writer or a lazy one. Don't let you entire application be thrown out over something that is easily fixable.Learn more at our Guide to Writing a Personal Statement for Grad School ]

, Your writing sample should be flawless and meet the page requirements as stipulated in the application. Do not include a shorter or longer sample; this is a quick way to get your application dismissed.Make sure the writing sample is a reflection of your research interests. If you want to study ancient Egyptian art but your writing sample is on the Impressionist movement in the late 19th century, then this will not give the committee a clear idea of your research strengths.
Work with your college's writing center to get feedback on your writing sample. Does it make sense to someone who doesn't know very much about the subject of your research? Is it clearly written?As with your personal statement, make sure your writing sample is grammatically pristine and contains no typos.

, After you have submitted your application, be patient when waiting to hear back. Most graduate school applications are due in late fall/early winter but you may not hear back until the middle of the spring semester.


Do not harass the department administrative assistant for updates on the status of your application. This is a quick way to get rejected. The school will let you know if your application has been accepted or rejected.

, Some programs require their applicants to interview before they admit them. You should participate in this interview if only to get a more in-depth sense of the program and how it supports its graduate students.Many other programs will offer visiting weekends for students who have been accepted. Once you have narrowed your choices down to 3-4 options, try to visit at the schools you are most interested in.
Meet with the faculty members you want to study with on your visit. Are they interested in working with you? Do they have no clue who you are? Do they seem to be the most popular advisor in the department, perhaps working with too many graduate students? If you answer yes to the latter two questions, that might be a sign this department wouldn't be the best fit for you.
Ask questions from current students in your program who work with the faculty members you want to work with. Does the faculty member support his or her advisees? Will she provide feedback on your research in a timely manner? Does she encourage students to attend conferences or meet colleagues she knows at other institutions? Does she help students to get published in reputable journals?
Consider other factors about the institution. Is the university in a very small college town or is it in a bustling, expensive city? Is this a place that you would be happy to live in for 5-7 years? How will you be able to afford to live in this place on a graduate student stipend?
If you can, try to stay with a current graduate student when you visit. That way, you will get a sense of what kind of housing grad students can afford. Can they live on their own in a nice neighborhood or do they have to have multiple roommates? Is it easy to find an apartment in the city or is the rental market really competitive?

, For the first couple years in your program, you will likely be required to take a range of courses. Try to focus on taking classes with the faculty members you want to advise your dissertation. Taking a class with a faculty member will give them a sense of your strengths and interests.


Read strategically. You will have an overwhelming amount of reading to complete in graduate school -- perhaps multiple books each week. As you read, take in-depth notes and highlight the most important sections or moments from each text.You can also generally get a reading list from your professor or find the book list on the course schedule in the summer or winter break before the class starts. Completing some of this reading ahead of time will give you a lighter load for when you are mired in work during the semester.
In your first and second years, you should attend as many department events as you can -- talks from current faculty and visiting scholars, graduate student presentations, department parties, etc. This will show your investment in your professional setting.

, In your first and second years, you should spend time familiarizing yourself with your academic field. Spend a couple hours each week reading the major academic journals in your field (if you don't know what these are, ask your advisor or a faculty member in that field). This will give you a sense of the broader conversations happening in your discipline.Join your professional organization. You should join early in your career in graduate school and maintain your membership. Most organizations offer reduced membership fees for graduate students.
If you are studying English or a romance language, this will be the MLA (Modern Language Association), or the American Psychological Association if you are in a psychology department. In your third or fourth years of the program, you should plan to attend the major conference hosted by this institution., Most tenure-track jobs (even at less research focused institutions) now require applicants to have published at least one article. Scientific disciplines often expect an even more extensive publication record since most papers contain multiple authors.


Join a writing group in your department (or start one if it does not already exist) that will give you deadlines for turning a paper you wrote for your course work or qualifying exams into a piece of criticism.Remember that the process for publishing can take a long time. Some journals might take months before they let you know if they have accepted, rejected or requested that you revise and resubmit your article. After that, it could take even longer before it appears in print. If you want to have a publication by the fourth year in your program, then start to prepare it in your second year.Ask your advisor for guidance on which journal you should send your article to. Some journals do not publish graduate students as a rule whereas others are more welcoming toward junior scholarship.

, Teaching experience will prepare you for the daily responsibilities of a college professor. Many Ph.D. programs have teaching opportunities built into their programs, where you will often teach freshmen or sophomore level courses or leading a lab for a large section of an introductory course.If these opportunities are not built into your program, then you may need to apply for teaching opportunities. Talk to your advisor about the best way to secure a teaching appointment.
Look into taking a Teaching Assistant position. In these positions, you generally assist a professor with things like grading, taking attendance, and helping students during group work in class. But make sure that you have the opportunity to contribute some of your knowledge to the course; just working as a grader might not give you enough professional experience to be a teacher.Save lesson plans, syllabi, student evaluations and lecture notes for your teaching portfolio. These will be necessary documents for when you apply for a tenure track job.

, Many graduate schools will offer certificate programs for graduate students in other departments that supplement your core interests as a scholar. Popular options often include programs in Women and Gender Studies, American Studies, Writing and Rhetoric, Non-Profit Management, Digital Humanities, On-line Teaching and Learning, Instructional Design, etc.Completing a certificate in one of these programs could make you a more competitive candidate for jobs inside and outside academia than applicants who just have a degree in one field., The most complicated component of the Ph.D. program is writing and defending a dissertation, which is a book-length research project. Most departments will require that you submit a proposal at the beginning of the writing process for your topic. When you finish writing it, you will have to defend your work in front of a committee of faculty members who have read it.Set up a clear, easy-to-follow writing schedule with frequent deadlines. Some programs will give you a year of funding to write you dissertation; you should have at least a couple chapters completed before you embark on this.
Break down your time into manageable chunks. Give yourself one or two hour blocks of time with achievable goals, like adding an extra three pages to your introduction or analyzing in an extra scholarly source.Maintain clear communication with your advisor. As you are writing, don't fall off of your advisor's radar. They should approve each chapter as you go. Plan to check in with them every 2-3 weeks during the writing process so they get a sense of your progress.

, Once you have completed your dissertation, Most Ph.D. programs require you have somewhere between 4-6 faculty members to conduct a defense of your work. They will ask you critical questions about the strength of your arguments and also offer other perspectives on your work.


Coordinating the schedules of multiple academics can be tricky. In many departments, the administrative assistant will coordinate the schedules of your readers, establish a date and time, and book a room for you, but you should contact him early in the semester you plan to defend to do this.To prepare for your defense, re-read important moments in your dissertation (introduction, conclusion and the thesis statements of each chapter) so you can quickly and eloquently respond with the key points of your argument.
Take a deep breath and remember that no one knows your work better than you. You have spent years with this material and you have every ability to defend it successfully., Most tenure track jobs are posted in the fall semester of the academic year before they are meant to begin. They will generally have the title of Assistant Professor.Job postings for tenure track jobs are often listed on the web site of your major professional organization (like the Modern Language Association or Computer Research Association) or other places like HigherEdJobs, the Chronicle of Higher Education, and H-Net.
Most academic candidates go on the market in the last year of their program when they are still ABD (all but dissertation). You should plan to have defended your dissertation and earned your degree by the time the tenure track job begins in the fall of the next academic year.
You will generally need many of the same documents that you used to get into graduate school: a cover letter (personal statement), a C.V. listing your academic accomplishments such as publications or teaching awards, a writing sample, letters of recommendation from your advisors, etc. You also will be frequently required to present a teaching portfolio consisting of things like student evaluations, lesson plans, a statement of your teaching philosophy, etc.

, Interviews for tenure track jobs are notoriously rigorous. First, you may have to pass preliminary interviews conducted at the conference hosted by your major professional organization. You may also have a phone or Skype interview, which will be less expensive to attend than traveling to the professional conference.You will generally be asked questions about your research, what contributions do you make to the field, how did you become interested in your topic, etc. You will also be asked questions about teaching -- such as how you structure a lesson plan or how you manage a large survey class. You should have tangible examples to provide when you get these questions.After you pass the preliminary round of interviews, you will be asked to come on a campus interview. The campus interview generally lasts 2-3 days. You will travel to campus and may be required to do some of the following things: give an extended talk (25-50 minutes) on your research interests, lead a class to demonstrate your teaching interests, and conduct multiple smaller interviews with members of the job search committee or other faculty members.Always express interest in the research of other faculty members while you are on your visit. You want to make it clear that you are a helpful, congenial potential colleague.You also will be required to meet with the Chair of your department, the Dean of your college and possibly other administrative figures. These interviews generally take place in the spring semester before the fall semester when they plan to hire you.

, Once you have been hired, most institutions expect to assess faculty members for tenure within seven years of starting as an Assistant Professor. However, they will often require pre-tenure review within the first two years of appointment and then again in the fourth of fifth years.


Departments have different requirements for tenure review. Once tenure is awarded, the professor has a secure future at the university (barring any major financial crisis) and the professor can enjoy a lifelong career teaching students in the subject of their expertise.
For the humanities, you often have to publish at least one book with a reputable academic press and/or multiple articles in well-respected journals.
For the sciences, you have to receive funding from an institution like the National Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation to start a lab and procure the equipment need to conduct your experiments. Writing and winning grants for this has become increasingly difficult, especially with major financial cuts to these institutions., As you are preparing to apply for tenure, consider where you should focus your energies. Does the department value research or teaching more? If it values research, resist the urge to spend extra time mentoring students or planning events for students in the department. Put that time into conducting research.Similarly, if the department mostly values commitment to students (as frequently is the case as liberal arts colleges and community colleges), then put more of your focus on advising and supporting students. Consider serving as the advisor to a student group in your department.
Always talk to your chair or dean about the expectations for tenure at your university. Most schools want to improve their national profile, which means that the will value research. From your first year forward, work as hard as you can to meet those expectations.

, For your tenure review, you will often be required to produce an extensive file of documents cataloguing your successes in the department. These often include:Student evaluations and evidence of your teaching record (lesson plans, syllabi, etc)
Copies of all of your publications or any technical documents/creative projects
Letters from scholars at other institutions which assess the value of your research
A log of your service to your institution, any additional certifications you have earned
After you have compiled your dossier, the tenured members of your department will vote on whether or not to recommend you for tenure, Your file will also be sent out to other faculty members from other departments for review. The final decision will be made by the President, Provost or Chancellor at your university., With the increasing scarcity of tenure-track jobs, more Ph.D. holders are taking limited term or contingent faculty positions. Non-tenure track professors currently make up more than 70% of all teaching positions in the American university. Some of these titles include:Post-doctoral research fellow
Visiting Assistant Professor
Lecturer (often with different levels such as Lecturer I or II or Senior Lecturer)
Adjunct
The first two categories of jobs can sometimes be found posted during the fall alongside tenure track jobs, but they are also regularly posted during the spring and throughout the academic year. Lecturer and Adjunct positions are often interviewed closer to the start of the upcoming school year in which they are needed.

, The interview process for these jobs can be very similar to a tenure track job; you may have to go on a campus visit and give a presentation, but the focus will probably be more on your teaching abilities than your research.


Beware of post-doc positions that have heavy teaching loads (such as a 4-4). A post-doc is meant to help you turn your dissertation into a book manuscript to publish. If the position requires you to have a heavy teaching load, you might not be able to accomplish this., With the rising costs of tuition and the growth of administrative salaries, many schools have turned to adjuncting to cover the bulk of their teaching needs.Adjuncts are Ph.D. holders who are often kept on a part-time basis so they do not receive benefits or health insurance from the university. They are not paid a salary but rather, on a per-course fee which averages $2700.00. Currently, adjuncts make up more than 50% of the current college faculty workforce and they earn on average $25,000-$27,000 a year.Because institutions are hesitant to grant adjuncts course loads that would make them full time employees, many adjuncts are forced to teach at multiple schools in any given semester. They might have long commutes to get to many different campuses.
Departments are also likely to cut courses at the last minute, leaving adjuncts to scramble to find other ways to supplement a meager salary. Working as an adjunct provides very little job security.

, You might decide that working long hours for little pay, no health insurance, and no stability is not for you. In this case, you should spend part of your graduate career preparing for a life off the tenure track or even out of academia altogether.Build up a portfolio of non-academic writing. You can volunteer to edit medical or technical documents, write grants for a non-profit in your area, or freelance for a local magazine or newspaper. But you should have a body of writing that translates outside of academia.
Prepare to revise your job search materials. While a C.V. is supposed to be multiple pages in length, a resume should be no longer than one. A cover letter should be just one page also.You must learn how to communicate your transferrable skills. If you lead a lab, you have project management skills. If you wrote and structured your dissertation, then you have excellent organizational prowess.Think of alternative career paths. Many Ph.D.s go on to have successful careers in industry, non-profits, teaching at private high schools, researching in governmental jobs, or by starting their own businesses. Talk to the Career Center at your graduate institution about finding ways of transitioning out of academia.
The web site VersatilePhD also provides tips from Ph.D.s who have found career paths beyond the tenure track.

, As a student teacher, think that making mistakes is normal; so don't make anything of it. Bear in mind that no one is perfect. Even experts sometimes get off track when they are distracted. Just don't give up, persist and you will improve with practice.

, Learn its rules and regulations, including any dress code information (all of this will help you if students test you, trying to find out how much or little you're aware of). Find out what areas are considered ""out of bounds"" to students, find out where staff hang out, and even whether it's possible for you to get a car parking sticker or permit. Every small thing matters for a smooth experience.


Learn about the school district, school boards (if relevant), parent teacher associations, and all acronyms accompanying these things.
Know where forms for student permissions, etc. and other important documents are located.
Ask if there are any legal issues or restrictions that you need to be aware of if you haven't already been taught these as part of your teacher training.

, each need simplified procedures quickly instructed or refreshed on that event (each time).
Have your basic classroom rules sorted before you stand in front of your class for the first time (for example, raise hands when you want to communicate, respect others, be prepared to listen, etc.). You are then able to discuss these with students from the outset.

, Ask what his or her teaching philosophy or expectations are, along with learning about the expected teaching program for the duration of your time working with him or her. Be sure to find out whether you have free reign or restrictions on teaching methods, topics, and other relevant issues. Also aim to have a regular meet-up time for discussion or asking questions as you work through your student teacher time.

, When you first enter the classroom, it's probable that your head will be filled with all the things you've been taught about teaching. While all of that is important, set aside the need for perfection and concentrate on quelling your nerves and fears. The students will be expecting you to appear confident, relaxed and at ease. As such, fake it until you make it! And, approach the entire experience with a positive attitude, expecting to find the experience a good one -- and you're more likely to find this as a result.

, It's important to be attentive to detail but not expect to be perfect in what you think a teacher should be. Avoid unnecessary confrontations. Acknowledge that you're still a student yourself, and realize how a student pretending to be a tough teacher must look! The students will cut you some slack, if you're friendly, affable, and approachable -- firm but not rigid.

, It's important not to produce a caricature of a teacher. Your real task is to convey information to students, with you as the conduit. It is not to convince students that you're a model teacher. However, there is nothing wrong with sharing your passion for teaching with them! Things to consider include:


Avoid coming across as too scary or too strict. You're still a student, remember! Would you have liked it, if your teachers had done that to you? Show the students that you know how they feel, and that you're on their wavelength. Accept the newness of the situation for both of you.

, Be complimentary as you go, and you'll be welcomed and helped by students. Be a facilitator.
~ Don't sit in one place. Kneel or sit, but realize that stooping low may put your posterior in someone space -- and squatting is awkward or humorous.

, Flex; float: say, ""I'll come back in a minute..."", if a student seems frightened or angered by your attention.
~ Don't act overly bossy: just be matter of fact.

, While you may feel that this contradicts the previous steps, it is possible to earn respect without being scary, too strict -- or too chummy with the students. Do this through a confident demeanor, and by conveying that you expect compliance with simple rules or boundaries. In addition, if something does happen requiring discipline, make it clear that you're not beyond reporting poor behavior to those in the chain of command who have authority to deal with it by actually reporting conduct. It will only need to happen once for students to understand that you're not a pushover.


Try hard not to sound nervous. If you fear this, it's more likely to happen. Make the most of pauses, and taking deep breaths to recover your composure before speaking. Smile. Be enthusiastic, but not over doing it. There is no need to rush.
Do not fear being disliked. Some students will always push boundaries and make it seem they dislike you. The reality, however, is that most students will respond far more respectfully to a student teacher sticking to well-defined boundaries than giving in, or acting disappointed that you're not liked. Your are not there to be a buddy.

, Speak respectfully and show support (Say, ""Thanks for your attention."" or ""May I show you this..."" or ""Right!"" or ""Good idea. Also, try this.""). Critique the work, not the student. Respect earned is respect best returned. Avoid using your authority as a power trip that causes you to forget that students are people, too. Go back to the roots of why you took up teaching, if you feel you're losing any sense of perspective about the students.



Be genuine. Show real interest in your student's efforts and praise their work when you have the opportunity.

, Always come to the lesson prepared. All professional teachers are expected to be prepared, so it would be a mistake if you as a student teacher didn't. This is training for your future career; make the most of it.


Schedule a timetable for marking and preparing work. This is your first chance to experience the intensity involved in teaching, in which you need to be present mentally the entire time you're teaching, and then find a second wind for marking and preparation. This is a fantastic time to develop time management and personal organization skills that will set you in good stead for the rest of your teaching career.

, If you tell your students you will have the quizzes, special projects, or homework checked by next week, always do as you've promised. Set an example for them to see and respond to; otherwise, you can't expect them to do what they're supposed to!

, Being a student teacher can, and should, be really fun. It is a chance to meet new people (usually only a few years younger than you), earn some money or credits, and to find your rhythm. Use your sense of humor to its best advantage to engage others and to make light of some of the more challenging aspects; in that way, you're set to enjoy your experience a great deal more.


Mingle with the other teachers. Be early; stay late. Seek information: Listen. The the staff can be a great source of information, support, ideas, and future contacts. Do your best to develop good relationships with amiable faculty members.
Make good friends with parents. Keeping in touch with parents regularly will establish an excellent rapport, and it helps to pass on something positive that their child has done now and then.
If it's permissible, after lessons socialize on campus with your students while having a coffee or a chat together. Do not be personal buddies. This will depend on the student's age and type of school you're teaching at; it might not be appropriate. At the very least, attend social functions held for the students during the term, such as dances and sports events.
When mingling with the other teachers, you may make good friendships with them (don't expect too much, too soon); also, don't judge them or yourself; do not be quick to spread rumors or gossip that can come back to you and ruin your relationships with them.

Realize that the awe of a new school year in a new class on day one won't last, for ""you as teacher in name and position only"".,
Respect students, and their needs for success and involvement: Thank the class for working and doing well.,
Succeed by breeding success.,
Focus on definite (certain) accountability, but, also, with a focus on applications instead of mere repetitions; use a quiz to motivate a summary; and use a test to motivate recap and review (namely, successful reps for learning without boredom):


Renew hope: Reteaching, without starting over; keep making use of learned skills.,
Expect resistance against excellence that is gained by discomfort (temporary embarrassment, fear, confusion or boredom).,
Earn attention in your class by success in achievement.,
Avoid ungraceful meanness and abusive shouting.,
Instruct positive expectations that translate into assisting you to have authority in your class.,
Depend on progressive discipline within your/their classroom.,
Depend on student centered goals, but question: ""Are we enabling unacceptable behavior in order for us to appease those persons (who are causing disruption) in order for us not be rejected, confronted, challenged, or hated by them?"",
Show confidence which overcomes doubt and fear, anger and anxiety by creating a peace of mind that helps both you and your class.,
Criticize or praise the whole class: ""Wow, everybody is working!"",
Create daily successful discipline.,
Know what to do as a leader who is out in front of the class or group, followed by the others.",How to Lead to Be a Great Teacher1," The needed cooperation and respect comes on the basis of leadership into successful learning opportunities every day.

, Facilitate whole class, and smaller groups with students leading or having the floor when you call on them, and help with what is seen as necessary to follow you to receive the promised good results – if you can deliver them.

, Busy-work (things they already know) will not bring ultimate success. But, the students need new learning activities. ""Success breeds success, but failure breeds failure.""



Assignments need to be understandable and to seem successful to the student.

, Retesting can help for competency or excellence. The coach-teacher/leader facilitates athleticism/academics (successful reps for learning without boredom).

, Discomfort is a critical element of daily renewal, coming out of moments of confusion and embarrassment, but not from boredom.



Confusion motivates learning – if the students are allowed to demand clarifying of confusing elements. It is critical to be renewed by clarifying confusion again and again, and to pass on renewed viability to your class.
Super-focus (without interruption) and then take a break: ""work from bell to bell with breaks in the stress – being on the edge of your chair leaning toward the future,"" may be one way to express this.

, However, be sure to share the floor, as needed. Ensure that others have the floor at your behest, and at the same time keep a sense of overarching authority and contagious enthusiasm in order to maintain the students' cooperation. Retaining the initial starry feeling that ""this is my awe inspiring new class/teacher"" (or regaining) that first day kind of awe of the new-teacher/subject is tricky, but aiming for this is a precious goal.

, Such negative approaches to marshaling attention and action is not ""leadership"". Leadership consists of acts or instances of guidance; direction; leading; for example, ""They prospered under his/her leadership toward their shared goals for learning."", These positive expectations will help you to do what you expect as you manage the circumstances that are benefiting the whole. Maintain this initial position every day by showing that you are not allowing a vacuum of leadership to lead to a loss of the initial unquestioned position of the teacher as the main leader in the classroom. Insist on your finding ways to:


Engage students,
Involve students,
Promote student-centered learning (and enjoy their learning).

, This involves step-by-step calm, firm, and fair discipline, that will impact not only their learning with you but their education as a whole and eventually pass through to their careers. Instill discipline by your plans and by having the students working and learning to become successful without frenzy.

, Avoid fusion with the role of students and confusion of goals for the teacher-leadership role within the class learning unit.

, Nourish and nurture good expectations.

, And individual work or credit (objectively), never praise the student in front of others (to subjective).



Ask for students to agree: ""Wasn't that a great job. Yeah that was right on! Great Job!"" Praise a child for work!
Praise the ""great job"" and ""fine work"" publicly. That is as simple as asking, ""You see?"" and praising them ""You got it! Okay?"" Leadership inspires confidence in others and draws out the trust and best efforts of the group to complete the task well. A leader who conveys confidence towards the proposed objective inspires the best effort from class members.
Present a positive and also authoritative (not authoritarian) demeanor: Students have the handy ability to be able to tell, if a teacher is not confident. So you must consistently show confidence as a person and in your leadership role. If they suspect your lack of confidence, then they will take advantage of the situation, attempting to get away with everything while largely ignoring you, making poor choices, being disrespectful or even disruptive. They may pretend to give in: ""Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, okay I'll stop."", but ""not"" for long.

, This will bring the opportunity to give motivation and much more than just hope. Hope has limitations. Success elicits your faith, love of learning and expectation to experience change by believing in it, expecting it, but not just hoping for it.


Backing off and relaxing from your few consistent rules can be based on circumstances where you share power when students work in groups, but then you must regain that consistency – or suffer the loss of your position as ""leader-one"" and your control of that classroom to chaos, boredom, or frenzy, if you allow a free-for-all or loss of your position to a student(s) who wants to run the class, or ignore you.

, If you are not being followed by at least one other person you are not leading and the following proverb applies to you: ""He who thinks he leads but has no followers is on a lonely, individual walk."" Do more than survive in the classroom because you can't be taking a walk all alone; the real leaders in your class may run right over you.

Decorate your classroom.,
Update displays and walls.,
Consider arranging your students' desks into two areas by room halves.,
Be secure and keep your students and yourself safe.,
Establish a ""Positive Zone"".",How to Be a Teacher1," Put up one wall section that says something like ""Kids at Work."" Another wall area should say, ""Focus Wall,"" that shows what the class is learning, and a ""Word Wall"" of vocabulary is good for any new concepts.Another wall should be about a special topic such as reading, spelling, social studies, or upcoming tests. The idea is that all wall spaces can become learning centers, instead of just using bulletin boards.;
, They need to include current subject matter to be effective and interesting. These displays are good for enrichment, review and for reminders.


Have helpers for the displays and walls: hold clubs outside of class or ask the six weeks or quarterly class officers or even room parents to help with the subject walls and bulletin boards.

, Put about four or six rows and have a walkway for yourself in between the two sections. This lends itself to creating teams that inspire motivation. Your students' desks should allow easy viewing of the main presentation area and whiteboard.

, In many schools any visitors are required to sign in at the office and have an identification sticker or ""ID-tag"" for security and control (including regularly scheduled ones like room parents).


Always be prepared to challenge unknown people as to their purpose for being in the school.

, Post a sign above or by the door which reads ""Positive Zone for students, teachers and parents"". Doing this creates a refuge from negative feelings, both yours and the students' and their parents. Take a positive attitude. If you are not having a good day, leave those feelings outside the classroom. Smile and ""choose"" the more positive attitude. This doesn't mean there is trouble if you're not always positive, it simply means that you aim to encourage everyone showing a positive attitude to each other, and that you encourage everyone to get along and have a positive experience.

Be known to live honestly, i.e.,
Be enthusiastic about your and the students' work (praise the work not the student) or the cause and also about your role as leader.,
Roll up your sleeves and get dirty/do not sit, or yawn and look bored.,
Be orderly and purposeful in situations of uncertainty by portraying a confident and positive demeanor.,
Tolerate ambiguity (wait and see) and remain calm, proactively composed and steadfast to the main purpose.,
Focus on the whole but see its parts to think analytically and break it down into sub parts for closer inspection.,
Raise the bar.",How to Lead to Be a Great Teacher2,": “Walk/Work your talk!” with integrity -- and in doing that, earn the right to have responsibility for others' success. True authority is born from respect for the purpose, good character and trustworthiness of the person who leads them to opportunity for success.;
, People will respond more openly to a person of passion and dedication -- but by not complaining against the student and never demeaning the work... Leaders need to be able to be a ""source of inspiration"", and be a motivator getting the work into gear towards the required action or cause. It is impossible to make a student do anything -- but inspire and coach the techniques: ""Do it this way!"" -- and ""Right. That's it!""

, Although the responsibilities and roles of a leader and follower are different, the leader needs to be seen to be part of the team working towards the goal. This kind of leader will not be afraid to work.

, People look to the leader during times of uncertainty and unfamiliarity to find reassurance and security.

, Storms, emotions, and crises come and go and a good leader takes these as part of the journey and keeps a cool head. In turn, students learn to follow suit.

, So then, the goal is in view – a good leader views the situation as a whole, and also in part:


Always be breaking the course down into manageable steps and making progress towards each part and the finish line. The course changes each day. It is not one race, but many sprints.

, A good leader is committed to excellence. Second best does not lead to the best success. The good leader not only maintains high standards, but is proactive to advance the goal forward in order to achieve excellence in all areas.

Focus to bring out student ambitions: by leading to reach goals in student achievement.

Face and overcome obstacles by leadership: to improve achievement.

, A study showed that teachers who lead many students in low-income (at risk) areas to as much as two to four years’ worth of academic progress in a single year had used unusually ambitious, ""measurable goals. Rally your students around the idea that they begin to believe that they could double their learning this year:


Urge them on to demonstrate ""at least two years"" of measurable reading growth for improving in all subjects, and to achieve eighty percent (80%) mastery of rigorous, attainable, measurable math and science standards. But a clear focus is not enough to get many of them to where you want your students to academically achieve even more by the end of the year.

, This cycle all too often characterizes ""disbelief in learning"" because of your students’ lower sense of academic self-worth and perspective on the value of purposeful activity in school. To break through this:


Instill encouragement (by successfully achieving early and often) and a need for students and families to be enthused to work harder to achieve bigger goals.
Change students’ belief that it is already decided what their intelligence (understanding and applications) will be: No, it is not really set. Work can improve. They are young and still can grow and change for the best, in many ways!

, Maintain high expectations at all times, while still inspiring your students from right where they are academically.

, is something that sounds ""athletic/physical"" and everyone may be accepting of that, but ""you're so smart"" may sound like mush and criticism to others who did not receive that ""vanity""/praise.

,


Call, email, or text parents throughout the day with updates on their children. Each week send home student work with ""Post-Its"" for parents to make comments on; when they’re returned, laminate the comments and put them on the wall to keep students proud and motivated.

, To succeed in the challenging environments where an achievement gap is prevalent, teachers must backwards-plan to begin each idea from individual lessons through the year calendar, with keys:


“Where are my student's current achievement levels versus where I will lead them to move and to reach?” and
“What is the best possible use of time to move them forward?”.

, Not just organized learning objectives in units, but lead them in logical order so that the skills are built on each other, with the school’s calendar taken into account. For each week’s unit plan look at the objectives for that unit, then write five assessment questions per objective, and only then plan lessons.

, Strong classroom leaders are effective executors, making good judgments about when to follow through on their plans and when to adjust them in light of incoming data. They offer their students consistent, caring, demanding leadership, and constantly seek to maximize the time students have to work hard toward their goals.

,, Your kids will know what to expect from you and may be excited on a daily basis by what you have in store for them that day.

, Be a strong leader as your own toughest critic, constantly seeking ways to improve your skills.


Use data to reflect and improve on your teaching and to ensure that you maximize your impact. You might even consider occasionally videotaping your morning classes and fast forward viewing the footage that day, slowing it to play to critique your instruction and to tweak lesson plans for the afternoon classes.

, In many low-income communities, schools with the least capacity serve children with the greatest need. To make significant academic progress with students, highly effective teachers go above and beyond the traditional role of “teacher” and do whatever it takes to lead their students to academic success. Successful teachers refuse to allow the inevitable challenges that they face to become roadblocks. Instead, they see these as obstacles to be overcome on their path to achieving ambitious goals.


Make it your personal mission to do everything humanly possible to help students get on a college bound path (or to know how to make informed choices about taking an alternative but equally successful path).
Offer tutoring during lunch hour and after school every day except for the day reserved for faculty conferences.
Consider special Saturday school from 9 a.m. until noon.

Look for tutors and their advertising in your area.,
Compose your advertisement.,
Create different versions of your ad with varying lengths and headlines.,
Advertise locally.",How to Advertise to Be a Tutor," Your advertising will be most effective if you can create a good first impression with those who call. Good preparation should also show through in your ads.


Choose the subject(s) you will tutor. If possible, select subjects relating to your own expertise, subject of study, or professional experience.
Consider the age range with which you'd like to work. Second graders and high school juniors will have widely varying levels and needs.
Get some experience tutoring, formally if possible. See if your local library has an adult literacy program. Look for volunteer tutoring opportunities in your area and find out whether any offer tutor training. Or, tutor somebody you know, such as a neighbor or family member.

Write a resumé of your tutoring experience and related education. Don't forget volunteer experience, such as helping a classmate, sibling, or child. You can show this list of qualifications to prospective customers or their parents. Even if you don't show it to them, it will help to prepare you to promote your services and answer calls.
Consider taking classes or training in how to teach. There is more to it than knowing the subject you'll teach. You also have to know about how to motivate students and explain things.
Decide how much you will charge. Evaluate your credentials and experience, and find out what others in your area charge.
;
, If you will go to the students, don't forget to factor in travel time. If the students will come to you, make sure you are comfortable having them at your home.

, Besides being a simple and inexpensive way to spread the word, personal contacts and word of mouth are very powerful and persuasive advertising tools. People tend to trust people they know. Also send these cards and brochures to school counseling offices to let them know about your service. Often they will mention your service to teachers, especially if you mention recommendations from parents and students.

, Depending on the agency, be prepared that you may have to demonstrate at least basic academic credentials, such as having a college degree. Also be aware that these agencies take a cut, so you will make less per session than you might freelancing. Also find out what they have in their contracts for non-competition clauses. That said, they can be a good way to build your tutoring experience. But you must also keep in mind that many of these agencies take a very large percentage. You might be much better striking off on your own.

, This and various other on-line services match up tutors and students. If you go with such a service, read the fine print and find out what the fees and restrictions may be. Keep in mind that you may not meet your students personally this way, nor necessarily have long-term contact with them.

, Notice what gets your attention and what doesn't. Notice what's persuasive and what's just ho-hum. Also, if you can, try to get an idea of what other tutors with similar credentials are charging for their time.

, Aim to catch attention, then demonstrate value. Mention your credentials and focus on results. Don't forget to include some information about what subjects and ages you can teach. One approach might begin: ""'Jessica' raised her math grade from C to A; you(r child) can, too. Ask me how!""

, A classified ad will read differently than a flyer, for instance. Have somebody proofread your ads. Even if English is your strong point, you can still miss things in your own writing, and you want to come across as professionally as possible.

, Try these options:


The local classified ad pamphlet that comes around in the mail once a week
The classified section in the newspaper

Flyers at local supermarkets, libraries, campuses, etc.
You can advertise your services FREE on local.yahoo.com.

Treat your students with respect.,
Be firm and matter of fact about rules, not argumentative.,
Walk toward the source of noise, misconduct or toward a particular student, but remain clear of the student's personal space.,
Focus on student achievement above all.,
Collaborate with other successful teachers.,
Be a leader, a person to trust and a person to have learning-fun with.,
Compliment the work, not the student.,
Never threaten.,
Use the ""teacher-look"".,
Take a deep breath.,
Be consistent.",How to Be a Teacher2," Students will respond to positive treatment. Students notice how you treat other students and will react accordingly. Treat all students with equal respect. In turn, expect respect back from the students.


If you're concerned that the students have a difficult time understanding respectful behavior, besides showing it yourself, it can be helpful to have discussions about respect in class groups. It could even serve as a class topic for a term.

, Occasionally repeating an important phrase or sentence (several times) is an effective way to make it definite and without arguing, being harsh or rude.

, Back away saying: ""I'll be back in a minute"", if a student becomes emotional when you confront them at their desk. Or, have the student sit down, if you have a problem with one who is out of the student assigned seating. Unruly students or shy students may object (act out) or withdraw if embarrassed or stressed by to much or too close attention.

, The purpose of education is to improve the knowledge of your students. Plan activities and lessons that will increase student achievement, and plan ways of recognizing even small improvements for each individual student.

, You will learn a lot from other teachers on how to deal with students and make your students successful learners. Spend some time talking to them about how they have dealt with particular situations in class and what sorts of things they do to encourage respect, trust, and learning.

, Don't compare one student to another, except saying how great they all are working. ""This is so great. Everyone is working."" or ""What a fantastic job you've all done!""

, Say, ""That work was great, so quick."" or ""Your work is very good, aw perfect."" (Not: ""You are so smart."") The reason for this is that you focus on the student's effort and therefore don't imply that only smart kids succeed but demonstrate that anyone prepared to put in the effort will succeed.

, Say what you mean. Do not make idle promises: things that you cannot do or wouldn't do.


Don't back down. Bluff with a stone face as in playing cards when you need to make your point. Put on your game-face, namely, be serious and mean it, or students may actually say: ""Act like a teacher."" Joking around may bring silliness out of students.

, This is important because it engenders an air of authority, which students look up to. Look in control, but kind. Smile, remain positive minded. You may want to act like a coach sometimes. Cross the arms and strut. Or, act a little bit like a soldier or officer. Look like you are not amused by misbehavior (that may simply encourage it), and look like you are not confused or shaken up – though you may be upset, do not show it.


But, sometimes you may need to calmly explain what is what!

Calmly: ""I know you are teasing: you don't mean it:""
Misconduct occurs: Such as the student gets up and starts toward the door.

Instruct: ""Stop."" - ""Go sit down."" - ""Obey me.""
The student may turn around and stare at you, or just smile or shrug.

Explain: ""Follow instructions. I can not allow that. Do as you are instructed.""
If you say something sarcastic, cold, mean or irritating: Apologize quickly.
Say, ""I shouldn't have said that. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.""

, Don't rage or cry when you feel embarrassed or infuriated. Observe. If your throat tightens or tears well up in your eyes: Do not wipe your eyes, or sniff. Clear your throat. Breathe. Narrow your eyes. Keep composure. Relax, though you may tremble/shake with anger and dread. Walk. Walk around the room observing.


If a students asks, ""Are you crying?""
Say, ""No."" Don't explain feelings. Act natural.
Just say, ""No. No problem."" Or, ""It's alright. It's okay."" (That's you overcoming it.) Get busy, walk across the room and back, observing.
With some students: A teacher who cries, will be crying more and more if the students see that they can trigger such emotions.


, Be persistent. Be fair/wise: sometimes you must (need to) treat everybody the same, whether good, bad or indifferent.



Fairness - Two opposite concepts – (1) You must treat everybody as individuals (""differently"" according to events/needs). Or conversely: (2) You must treat them all ""the same"" in some matters as the only way to be fair.

Make it so that the points enable each student to ""buy"" something (such as a piece of candy, an item of stationery, or other things you know your students would appreciate).,
Consider class offices, for each team.",How to Be a Teacher3," Give groups a topic such as a reading assignment. Each student in a group would (1) tell each other and agree how to split up and (2) read their part, find information in their part and answer a question. Then (3) the group leader or reporter (or group members) would present their findings to the class, (4) for all everyone to listen, write down notes or answers, and perhaps, discuss and give their take on that groups answers.

, This is where (1) each student individually reads a slip with one of several questions, processes or problems. (2) Each one writes an answer or solution. (3) Then students mingle to seek missing information and write it down to fill in the blanks on a chart, exercise sheet or data-gathering sheet.

, This involves (1) each one of the students reading separately. Then (2) they form pairs when instructed to pair, and (3) the pairs answer questions or do problems together. This may then move to ""check and compare"" if that is needed or if there is time.

, This is to (1) form groups of two students and work together as pairs to do their part of the assignment and then (2) join with a second pair in a four member group and check and compare the work with each other. Then (3) they return to their usual seating place.

, (1) Form an inner circle and an outer circle of students and interview each other as a pair. Then (2) rotate and fill in blanks or boxes on an answer-sheet or chart with information from each student's point of view, about the topic to be discussed. Repeat the interview and rotate once or twice. (3) Discuss the questions and answers to bring out and put together variations of different interpretations, if any.

, Each group of students is given a math problem for which they are to make a poster, with (1) a drawing/diagram (sketch), or a chart of the situation in the problem, (2) make a relation/function or math expression, (3) make a graph, (4) write a verbal explanation/paragraph, and then the reporter gives a quick presentation to the class and reads their paragraph.

, For academics, get a four inch (10cm) soft-foam plastic/rubber (Nerf) basketball and use a trash can sitting on a chair or table as the basket (or use a plastic breakaway hoops-rim) in the front of the class. Divide the class into two teams, and tape places on the floor or on the wall where the basketball hoop is located for point values for scoring from behind the marks or below the marks (low shots: lying, squatting, or sitting on the floor). Score a hoop from longer distances for more points: from about the opposite end of the classroom for the 6 pointer, a 3 pointer goes closer, 2 is closer, and any similar point system for low shots below the marks.


""Play a rewards game"" similar to ""basketball."" This game may help by offering reward points for attendance. “Play basketball-shots” for (1) good behavior/conduct, (2) attendance, or (3) academics for making a score on classwork/test or quiz, or a reward for catching up on classwork and improving ones own grades or as a team – where a team member would earn and receive a shot for their team to make points by shooting the Nerf ball. Shooters could choose from five positions worth 1-5 points from different difficulties of questions answered correctly to then shoot from the correspondingly difficult position if the answer is correct. Lining up for shots in front of the class may make for some thrillingly moments for the student and class.
Decide why and how to allow students on each teams to earn the opportunity to play the game. This will be determined by your own rules – but in any case, only how and when you decide to allow playing. A team gets a shot for doing an objective or behavior very well.
If a member of the other team doesn't follow class rules then give the other team a shot.
Or, as a variation give five free points without shooting, if that works better for test days or other quiet times.

, For academics, consider a variation of the Nerf basketball for such things as a verbal ""quiz/quiz-show"". Members of the two teams compete for points that are earned in a number of ways.

,


Points may be used for receiving ""grand-raffle tickets"" to be drawn after school is out that year – for improving by the end of the school year, and the prizes are mailed out.
The Nerf games can be a year long team type of competition. The winning team may be announced after school is out at the end of the year.

, Have offices such as: a Scorekeeper, and Assistant Coach, and a Captain and Co-Captain with each one serving for a certain time to help you with certain things (in elementary classes call the captains ""President"" and ""Vice President""). You, (the teacher) are the Head Coach. Offices could be rotated among the students who display better conduct.


Teams are good for motivation and control, since you can: when one team is noisy, give another team turns to make points – and they'll all learn to be quiet. If your class walks noisily to recess, or anywhere, you might consider letting them out one to three minutes later than they're supposed to be (at the end of the day)–or if they're good, let them out a minute early.

Become more tolerant of ""conflict,"" ""inconsistency"" or ""confrontation"", in the classroom.,
Be aware that encouraging critical thinking can promote (some) kind of a psychological discomfort in (some) students as conflicting accounts of information and ideas are argued and debated.,
Promote and facilitate logical and emotive ideas by both: (1) ""analysis"" involving dis-assembling/digesting concepts into constituent parts (recording data and statistics) and (2) ""synthesis"" which involves assembling concepts from information and data that may have been found by analysis.,
Help students develop skills for resolving such dissonance.,
Allow conflicts and confrontational thinking.",How to Lead to Be a Great Teacher4," By raising issues that create dissonance, you teach children how to deal with disharmony and to value having their ideas stretched in new directions. Refrain from expressing your own bias so that students have the space to debate and resolve problems without being directed by any preconceived notions.

, Such discomfort may motivate them to resolve their opposing views on issues.Engage student-critical-thinking, those students must encounter the dissonance of conflicting ideas. Dissonance discussed by Festinger (1957) promotes a psychological discomfort which occurs in the presence of an inconsistency. Inconsistency when found in opposition can motivate students to solve, stir, and resolve issues.

, Synthesis is of the higher order of thinking compared to analysis because synthesis is creative: as in writing, designing, forming or inventing a process, system or story. Analysis is similar to detailing the elemental framework of existing concepts as in opening, displaying, explaining parts of ideas.

, Frager (1984) models conducting critical thinking classes and provides samples of popular issues that promote it, for example: ""banning smoking in public places"", the ""bias infused in some sports stories"", and ""historical incidents written from American (individualized) and Russian (socialized) in opposing perspectives"".

, If you find this to be useful from an instructional point of view and you're prepared to develop materials for promoting engaged thinking, and if you practice (repeatedly) using exciting, topical critical procedures, then using critical thinking activities in the classroom can produce positive, involved, and enthralling results.

Enforce school rules of the entire building and school grounds, and explain that you will follow the school and district rules.,
Set your class rules.,
Be strict and ""you decide"" how and when to allow any game or whatever else may be needed.",How to Be a Teacher4," Rules such as: No cell phones on during class; keep your hands to yourself; say only kind things; do as your teacher says; be on time; what to do if you miss a day of school; lawful activities, etc.

, Perhaps five or six, at the most, but these are not "" the situational procedures"". You will need several differing procedures that the students must know or that you must explain at the time of necessity. An effective way to decide rules is to let your classes help decide reasonable rules and consequences, and this way your class should follow and help you to enforce them because they have bought into the ownership of them. They can also decide for some fun things like the point values and reasons for shooting at various distances for the ball game, etc. (see above).

, By the same token, be moderate and let a student occasionally have an ""oops!"", for example:


Give them each a credit, call it an ""oops!-card"", when students are good for a certain length of time, then they can trade their oops!-card which allows them to miss one night's homework or for some other reward.

"
"
Teach how you manage the class.,
Teach the students your classroom procedures the way you need them to be observed.,
On the whiteboard, list topics of what they need to do.,
Know the school-wide procedures.,
Balance your subjects.,
Keep all subjects on track.,
Have a class bank in the elementary class.,
Plan to have no free periods, no free days or parties, unless the entire school is having a festival-day, homecoming, or other such observance.,
Have a room mom or dad in elementary school.,
Avoid messy and dangerous surprises.",How to Be a Teacher5," Use some non-verbal signals or prompts to establish order. For example, perhaps when you raise your hand in a certain way to get class attention (similar to the way they must get your attention by raising a hand) or instead you start clapping a certain way (clap-clap, clap-clap-clap, clap-clap) – and they can join the clapping for a quick funny motivator (keep it short). This is better than shouting, stamping feet or slapping on a wall or table, can get students to smile, and enjoy class, especially for harder subjects.


Some teachers use a noise like an instrument (perhaps a recorder) or running a stick over a wooden animal to make a croaking sound. You can some up with many different ideas for noise-makers, and visiting a local trade aid shop can provide many handcrafted options for little cost!

, This is quite different from the few set rules. Develop as many procedures as are needed according to and as you have different situations:


Classwork: Testing procedures, work turn-in, homework, grades, hallway procedures, etc.
Smooth operations: You tell them what to do when entering class and to begin the class, you must reserve the right to say when the class ends, not the bell in any case. Bells may ring at the wrong time, and for varying reasons and you may not have finished class when the bell rings.
General orders: Putting away and getting out supplies and books, pencil sharpening, cleaning-up/throwing away trash.

, Another trick for the worksheets is to have team officers who can give out and take-up and file individual folders or packets (daily or for a change of activity).

, Fire drill procedures versus storm warning/storm watch, earthquake drills, etc. Get the bell schedules for different kinds of days, and keep them available, such as half-days, assembly and pep-rally days, etc.

, Every week, have a ""Math Day"" and ""Language Arts Day"". Every other week have a ""Science Day"" and ""History Day"". This way you'll be sure that your students have tons of things in mind.

, Don't be the teacher who hardly ever gets around to science or math because you only have time for reading, spelling, compositions and handwriting. You'll be in trouble and very unhappy when your students do not make adequate progress or may even regress in those technical courses.

, During the beginning of every trimester or semester, have your student's parents each donate five dollars or ten dollars. This way, for parties, or anything, there is no need for parents to donate repeatedly.

, Talk to the other teachers to get a feel for what goes on at your school.


Many school systems will no longer allow ""homemade"" foods or snacks to be sold or given to students because they may be unsafe/unsanitary. Find out how your school operates.
Some teachers do ignore food rules, and such, but the rules are there to protect the school system (and you) against law suits and bad publicity – as opposed to a food incident that could be devastating to student health and safety.

, They will volunteer a week (or some other period of time) and will help students that need help or can observe students doing an assignment in one area of the room, while you work with a group on another routine or procedure.

, Keep all supplies put away and locked up if possible, things like paints, glue, art-paper, stapler, paperclips, tape and such or some student(s) will surprise you and get them out to make something or do something. Dangerous, wasteful or messy mischief may be rare, but it is very problematic when it does happen, especially when you have your mind and eye occupied elsewhere. This, of course, is an area for a strict rule to be set.


Have things like tissues and wipes on hand for sneezes, messes, and other such things. If you are a high school teacher, have spare sanitary ware on hand for students in need.

Think of a name


When thinking of a brand name, it's usually best to get a notepad ready for a list that will help you remember all the name and make the process of elimination easier.,
Practice makes perfect


go on the Internet to try to find some accessory-making courses/classes.,
Choosing your brands theme


now it's the hard part, how do you want to represent yourself and your brand?,
Inspiration goes a long way


before you actually start making anything or finalising your brand, go to craft fairs and look at some of the homemade jewelry they have created.,
The long and patience testing bit


now you actually have to make the jewelry!,
Tell and show


after making all your fabulous pieces, it's time to spread the word and put on a jewelry party!,
Advertising


getting flyers put up around town and posting business cards on bulletin boards really help improve business.,
Meet the managers


if the jewelry is selling, its time to talk to some high street store managers that could maybe give you a brand funded by that shop.,
Helping out


as you went to craft fairs earlier on, do the same and sell some of your accessories there, maybe to help someone in the same position as you were!,
Grand opening


if you think you have enough money, and the accessories will do well enough, maybe it's time to open up your own shop!,
Employee of the month


you should really try to get some staff now you have your own shop!,
Never give up


if business isn't going so well, ask your friends to recommend you and advertise more on the radio or tv.",How to Start an Accessory Business," Try to think of something that emphasises your persona or brand message.;
, This will help make your brand more original, creative and will also make your days a bit more

, If your a happy person, opt for light colours and fun designs. If your a serious, practical person, design the whole brand to how it suits you! This is one of the most important parts.

, Take a note down of the properties and design features of the ones that you like so you can mix them up and add to yours when you do start making!

, If you couldn't find much inspiration go on youtube and see how they make the jewelry in different ways to give effect.

, Get a few friends to come round, have a few drinks, mingle but most importantly, ask for feedback and try to sell the bracelets! Obviously not for much as they are not part of a big brand yet, but hopefully soon will be!

, Also setting up your own website is another really helpful way to get people to buy your jewelry and try to get 'founded' by shops and big accessory brands.

, Make an appointment with a lower end fashion store is a good way to start. Keep on trying until you finally get accepted

, Make multiples of the same design just in case some are more popular than others.

, Look around town and the high street to see if there are any places to let, or set up your own stall in the middle of a shopping centre. You could maybe think about getting a ground floor apartment close to where you live and use that as the shop, with the landlords permission.

, As the job market is rapidly getting lower, you could help a non-working friend out by giving them a job. Even though you have your own business, it never hurts to carry the store on and try to set up a brand in another shop.

, Just don't give up!

, These should contain ALL your contact information, and should also be stylish and eye-catching. If you have bland business cards and you're a makeup artist, people aren't going to think well of your creativity.

, If you are freelancing, this is extremely recommended.

, If you don't think it's too rude, hand them a couple of business cards! This way if they have any friends or family who need a makeup artist, they'll know exactly who to send them to!

, Having a website will help you reach more clients.You could tell people about you,and have a blog on your favorite products. You could also post your resume online in case someone wants to consider your abilities without asking you upfront. Maintain your website well.

, Some colleges offer courses.Taking one will give you references and help you practice. Although usually only cosmetology schools will specify in certain types of makeup, like bridal and high fashion.

, Look at how the makeup is applied in Vogue and try to imitate on yourself or friends. It might not turn out good the first couple of times.

Get a degree in Film or Film Production.,
Start with an entry-level position, like production assistant or grip.,
Get an internship with a film studio.,
Do every single job to the best of your ability, no matter the task.,
Make films in your free time.,
Put together a “demo reel” to send to potential employers.,
Meet as many people as possible.",How to Get a Job in Hollywood1," While not necessary to succeed in Hollywood (directors like Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino and James Cameron never went to film school), film school is a great place to learn the hard skills of film -- camera settings, lenses, lighting, and sound design -- while getting a chance to practice with professional equipment.


Many cities have night classes in film at local art schools if you have already graduated.;
, Filming is an incredibly involved process that often takes over 100 people to get right. From make-up and costuming to sound engineering and cinematography, there are a lot of potential jobs in Hollywood behind the scenes. However, almost none of them will hire you without past experience. In almost every instance you have to start from the bottom to get the job you want. Some of the most common entry level positions are:


’’’Production Assistant (PA):’’’ The PA does whatever the movie needs, from picking up actors or food to checking the script and rolling up cords. This is oftentimes the first job a burgeoning filmmaker takes, because they get to work with many different film departments and meet many people, but it is thankless work.’’’Grip:’’’ Holds boom microphones and sometimes cameras. This is a great job for someone interested in the audio side of Hollywood, but it is physically taxing to hold up equipment all day.
’’’Script Supervisor:’’’ Reads the script while filming to make sure there are no mistakes. Though this is not always considered an entry level position, smaller studios will often hire a new person if they have experience in editing or writing., Internships are not just for college students and recent graduates – anyone can find a good internship with a little hard work. And though the job is often thankless, being in a studio each day teaches you about the industry and open doors to better jobs later in life.Most major studios, like Lionsgate, Universal, NBC, and FX offer yearly internship programs on their websites. If you love the movies or TV a certain studio produces, check out “Employment” or “Jobs” on their website.
Search Craiglist, InternMatch.com, and EntertainmentJobs.com for internships across Hollywood.

, Being a production assistant or intern is not easy. Most of your day is spent doing menial tasks or running errands, and it might feel like you are wasting your time. However, almost every single person working in Hollywood started from the bottom and worked their way up because they were dependable, respectful, and helpful.


You must prove your can do the basic jobs on a film set before you are trusted with the creative jobs.

, The best way to get experience is to take matters into your own hands. These days, the equipment needed to make a film is almost astonishingly cheap, as most smart phones can record HD video and sound right out of the box. Grab some friends, write a short script, and start filming today.


Post your videos on Youtube, Vimeo, and Reddit to grab viewers online.
Submit your movie to film festivals, like Austin Film Fest or Sundance, where film professionals might see it and ask for more work. This is how several famous writers/directors, like the Duplass brothers (Jeff Who Lives at Home, The League,) got started., While a good smile and personality will help in an interview, most studios want to see some of your work before hiring you. A demo reel is a short compilation of your film accomplishments that you use to prove your skills. It should be no more than 2 minutes long and it should feature your very best work.


Keep it short – you should grab their interest in the first 30 seconds.
Tailor your reel to your job – if you are applying for a job editing, focus on scenes that cut between multiple angles, if you are focusing on sound design then focus on scenes that showcase how you mix music, dialogue, and sound effects seamlessly.
Try to show a variety of work – if you can show 2-4 different projects successfully you prove that you can work on a variety of films., Hollywood is a tight-knit community, and you never know when someone will offer you your big break. Working lots of different gigs, going to parties, and introducing yourself often will create a network of people around you that can lead to your next job.


Work as many gigs as you can to gain experience and make new contacts.
Always be respectful and helpful on set – you never know who might get a promotion and need your help later in life.

Have something to say.",How to Get on TV," In order to walk into any audition big or small, you need a resume and headshots. This tells the casting team how much experience you have, what kind of experience you have, and what you look like. When they’re going over hundreds of resumes, the headshot helps them remember what you look like.


A theatre resume is very similar to a career resume or CV. Look up some examples online or read wikiHow’s article on writing a theatre resume.
As for headshots, they’re pretty simple. If you have a friend who’s a good photographer, you just need to get one good shot out of them. You only need one set of clothes and a plain backdrop. However, you can go the professional route and get a series taken, too.;
, If you live in a big metropolitan area, there are probably casting calls and auditions held at least semi-regularly. Most areas have newsletters and websites dedicated to their city’s specific listings, though large organizations, like Backstage.com offer postings country-wide. The best way to find these auditions, though? Talk to people you know.


An “open audition” means anyone can come. This is good news because you don’t have to sign up and it’s often lower caliber competition, but there’s more of it. They’re generally cattle calls. If it’s not an open audition, you’ll need to sign up and get the audition in the first place, so work towards those well before the scheduled date.

, You could swamp yourself in casting calls and auditions, but why do that when you should spend time honing your craft or making actual money? Have someone do the paperwork side of things for you – an agent. That way auditions sort of land in your pocket – you just have to get the role.


And a good agent is free. Do not pay them before you land any gigs. They only get money when you get money. If they demand it beforehand, it’s a scam.

, With an agent and a list of open auditions (or an audition with your name on it), all you can do now is attend. If you’re auditioning to be an extra on a TV show, bring a bottle of water and some snacks – you could feel like number 1,000,000 having to wait all day. Once you’re up, all you can do is be amazing.


If you’re auditioning for a more substantial role, it’s going to likely be shorter and more intense. You’ll read off of a few other people and you may know immediately what happened or you may be held in limbo for weeks.

, Now that you’re a part of the business, it’s wise to invest in yourself. Sign up for acting classes at a local community college or acting school, get a dialect coach, a vocal coach, and hone whatever skills you think your future characters may need. Language lessons wouldn’t hurt, either.


It's not a bad idea to take directing classes, stage classes, or get other training that isn't your perfect idea of a career, but is related. This way if you come across a project that needs this skill, you have it. Then you can sneak in that you're actually in actor. You'll meet people in different realms and beef up your network in ways you otherwise wouldn't be able to.

, The number of reality TV shows out there seems to be growing like wildfire. Find a handful that intrigue you, or else you’ll be spending weeks trying to figure out how and where to get on TV and get nothing else done. Which ones might be the easiest? Which ones the hardest? Which ones are in your area?


Make a list of the shows you want to be on and prioritize them. The ones you really want to be on should be the ones you spend more time on. As you get further and further down the list, spend less and less time.

, If you live in a big area, it’s possible the show may come to you. Some TV shows tour the country they’re based in looking for potential talent. Even if you don’t live in that city, consider making a trip of it. It definitely sets the groundwork for a unique vacation.


Make a calendar of all the casting calls you're considering. This way you have all your options splayed out in front of you in the order that they're going to happen. It'll help you know where to invest your time, too.

, If you do find a casting call you want to attend, you'll probably have to sign up. They have a finite amount of slots and a finite amount of time to get through everyone, so you'll need to let them know you're coming. This assures that you get a spot, too.


Some casting calls sign up the first, say, 5,000 people, and then everyone else is welcome to come, but not guaranteed they'll get seen. Don't be one of those people. You don't want to waste days of your life preparing for the audition and waiting in line and then not even having one.

, Many TV shows rely on the Internet, too. If you don’t want to wait around for the show to come to you (or if the show doesn’t do that in the first place), make a tape and send it in. They’ll review it and it could be as easy as that.


Check out their policies online. Find the submission deadlines, length requirements, and any other stipulations you have to meet. Is there a specific name you can address the tape to?

, On the tape or in the audition, the most important thing to do to land a gig on reality TV is to make yourself interesting and unique. They're not going to cast someone who is forgettable.


However, make sure that it’s something you can keep up – too many people try to appear outlandish and it’s just a bad act that everyone can see through. Try to be yourself, but emphasize your quirkier tendencies.
You'll want to make yourself look attractive, too (at least, in most cases). Reality TV tends to have a penchant for the more good-looking of our species.

, Game shows are constantly looking for contestants. Do a quick search online to see how each of your favorite game shows work. Should you send in a tape? Put your name into a lottery? Get an in-person audition? All the information you need should be available online.


Take a look at their contestant requirements, too. You may need to be a certain age, not be related to anyone on the staff, live in a certain area, etc. It's best to know this now than to waste time later.

, Some game shows travel the country like certain reality TV shows (think American Idol and American Ninja Warrior). They'll visit X amount of bigger cities looking for hopeful contestants. And they could be coming near you.


For example, Wheel of Fortune has the ""Wheelmobile."" They also accept tape auditions, but they tour the country in a large yellow van with this catchy name. If they are coming near you, decide one way or the other how you want to audition.

, You may have two options in front of you: attending an actual audition or making a tape and sending it in. If you do want to go in person, you may have to sign up for a slot to reserve your time. Do this as soon as possible to be sure there's room for you.


And as for the tape, send that in sooner rather than later, too. Show your stuff, making sure to emphasize how camera-friendly you are, how comfortable you are being in the spotlight, and something that makes you memorable. Make sure to meet their taped-audition guidelines, too.

, Anyone about to go on Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy (or any other game show) doesn't spend their free time before their audition on Facebook and playing Candy Crush. They're doing word puzzles and trivia games. They're honing their skills so they don't wind up looking like a doofus. And that's what you should be doing too, whether you're in a stage one audition or you've made it all the way to the finals.


Watch old reruns of the show, too, to get in the zone. You'll get used to all the potential formats and you may even run into similar (or the same) questions. Immerse yourself in it as much as possible so you stay comfortable when the time rolls around.

, Once you're signed up and in the room (or they liked your tape and called you in), nervously drinking the bottle of water you've been handed, all you can do is rock it. Be friendly to the judges and other contestants, ask questions, and come off as a lively, intrigued, interesting human being. The rest is just up to the questions and tasks you get presented.


Most auditions have rounds. They'll cut people round by round and you'll know exactly who they're cutting. The great part about game shows is that there isn't much waiting. If you make it, you'll likely know it.

, If you make it through all the rounds, you'll likely get put into a pool of eventual contestants. It could take you two weeks to get called, it could take you six months to get called. It's just a matter of pairing people up and filling up the oncoming weeks of airtime. Be patient! The call is coming.


They'll likely give you advanced notice, too, so don't fret about getting it off work or not being ready to make the trip. And if you can't make the date, they'll probably be flexible. They need viable contestants and you've proved yourself – unless you prove to be difficult to work with, they'll try their best to accommodate you.

, Whether it’s a product or an article, get your name out there and attach it to something. When this thing of yours gets brought up in conversation, your name comes along with it. This is going to be your platform for getting on the news. Who else would they interview but you?


Think about what you already are working on. It could be your business, it could be a hobby, it could be an event you're organizing, it could be anything. It just needs to be something you're competent in and that is truly yours.

, Not busy writing or inventing? Then all you need to be is knowledgeable and known. When you’re the it-guy or girl, it’s natural that you’d be consulted when your area of expertise hits the spotlight. If you develop a reputation in your area, it could be a matter of time before you also become a consultant.


Just be sure that those in your community ‘’know’’ you’re the one to come to. Network yourself. Get involved. Make yourself dependable, reliable, and effective. Meet as many people as you can. You may run into someone who thinks you'd made a good story.

, If you have a business proposition, idea, or event you're running, start spreading the word. If it's an article, put it all over social media. If it's a business, start marketing. If it's an event, put up flyers all over your area and on the Internet. Generate a buzz.


Let's say you're a strawberry farmer, something that you wouldn't normally equate with the news. This year, your strawberries are 5 times the size they normally are. What do you do? You start posting pictures on the Internet, hanging up flyers, making signs for your giant strawberries, giving free samples, and creating a phenomenon for yourself. Even something simple can become interesting.

, If they don't come to you, you may have to come to them. Contact your local newspapers, radio stations, and TV news stations about your potential news story. If they like it, they'll bite. They're always looking for stories to fill the time (or space), and if it's good, they've no reason to turn it down.


Visit their websites for contact information. Try to find the right person in the right department you can talk to. For example, if you're selling giant strawberries, contact the person who deals with ""Home & Garden"" or ""Local Business."" The more streamlined you can make the process, the better.

, Once you do nab the spotlight, make sure you actually have something to say. No one just wants to get on TV – they want to get on TV and be interesting. So prep yourself with what makes your story a good news story. What angle would suit you best?


If you were selling giant strawberries, get ready to talk about why they're giant. How you made them giant, if you knew their potential size, how this year is different than last, your competitors and their produce, etc. Do your research into your own work. This way you can be prepared for any question that comes your way.
Be sure to market yourself, too. Getting on the news gets your name out there and could help you make more contacts. Have business cards ready, phone numbers, emails, and whatever else you need to be reached by others in the future.

Learn how to format screenplays .,
Read screenplays from your favorite movies and shows.,
Write screenplays.,
Learn how to craft log lines that sell your script.,
Submit your screenplays to contests and festivals.,
Become a writer’s assistant.,
Only pitch your scripts when asked.,
Work as many film jobs as possible.",How to Get a Job in Hollywood2," Many studio executives and screenplay writers will throw your script out after the first sentence if it is improperly formatted.There are a variety of programs available online that will format your screenplay for you, from free programs like Celtx and WritersDuets to Final Draft, the industry standard.


The type should be in 12pt Courier font.
Always attach a title page to the front with your name and contact information in the bottom left corner.

, Reading screenplays is essential if you ever want to write them. A good screenplay must tell the entire story without any actors or cameras—it must paint a picture in the readers head as if they were watching the movie at that very moment. This is an art form, and you can only learn it by reading the masters.


Perform an internet search for “Title + Screenplay PDF.” While not every screenplay is online, a large number of them have been posted on various websites.
Reading screenplays is a great way to learn formatting as well – if you see a scene a movie you like and don’t know how to format, like a montage or transition, read the screenplay to see how it is written out.

, The first question you will be asked in an interview is, “can we see your work?” Very few people in Hollywood are concerned with your degree or resume outside of writing – what they want to see is a fresh voice that is willing to write for a living. Once you’ve written one screenplay and it is as good as you can possibly imagine, sit down and write another.


Try to write 3-4 pieces in the same genre (horror, comedy, drama, etc.) since most studios specialize in one type of film. If your first screenplay gets noticed, you then have 2-3 extra scripts the same studio might want., Log lines are short, 10-second summations of your film. Think of the brief explanations provided next to movies online and in the newspaper. You want to communicate, in general, the main character, the mood, and the plot in only one sentence, which is often harder than it looks. The best log-lines hook a person before they’ve even opened your script, and in the fast paced world of Hollywood, you may only get 30 seconds to grab someone.


’’Inside Man:’’ A cop has to talk down a bank robber after the criminal’s perfect heist spirals into a hostage situation.
’’The Shawshank Redemption:’’ Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.
’’Forest Gump:’’ Forrest Gump, while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny, eludes him., There are hundreds of stories about unknown writers winning $10,000 and a trip to Hollywood after winning a big contest like the Austin Screenwriting Contest or Final Draft’s Big Break. More importantly, most contests offer feedback on your script, giving you advice on how to improve it from industry experts. This is especially crucial if you don’t live in L.A, as contests are a direct line to Hollywood if you win.


Most contests cost between $35 - $100 to apply to, but they are cheaper the earlier you submit.
Read reviews of contests before submitting to them to see if they are worth your money. Sites like MovieBytes.com offer reader reviews of each contest offered.

, Just like burgeoning directors must start as Production Assistants, a writer usually needs to start at the bottom before getting their own show or movie deal. Writer’s assistants answer phones, take notes, and run errands, but the important part of the job is making connections and lasting friendships. You never know when a writer will get a new gig and ask you to come along as a co-writer.Apply to writer’s assistant jobs on television and film studio websites, under “Employment.”
Websites like Internmatch, EntertainmentJobs.com, and Craigslist often list posts for writing assistants.

, Time and time again, stories filter out of Hollywood about assistants, crew-members, and extras who are more concerned with their own writing then the project they are working on. This not only annoys your superiors, but distracts you from doing your job. Work hard and do everything you can to help your project run smoothly and you will be promoted, noticed, and asked to share your ideas.However, when your chance arises to talk about your writing – take it!

, Work on a crew, act as an extra, and write commercials if you have to. Every experience you get will teach you something and bring you one step closer to your dreams. Remember that every connection you make can turn into something important, so make as many connections as possible.

Be patient while your career develops.",How to Get a Job in Hollywood3," It is incredibly rare that someone gets a job acting from anywhere but Hollywood. You need to be available for an audition or interview at a moment’s notice or you will never become a paid actor.


Make sure you have enough money saved to live comfortably until you find work – the average cost of living in LA is 50% then the rest of the country., Headshots are high-quality pictures of you that studios use to decide if you are the right fit for a role. There are thousands of photo studios that offer headshots, usually costing anywhere from $200-$400. Make sure you tell the photographer that your headshots are for acting, as there are some other professions that require headshots in a different style., Extras are the people in the background of movies and TV shows, and you can often grab a gig as an extra by simply showing up. Being an extra means you get to be on set, meeting people and leaning how the film industry works, while still making some money acting.


Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, Megan Fox, and more famous actors all started out as extras and worked their way up from there.Any chance you get to be on a professional film set will help you make contacts that could lead to your next role.

, Jenna Fischer, star of the hit show ‘’The Office,” got her first big role from a woman she met at a party. Years later, after proving she was a dependable actress in several plays and small TV roles, she was asked to audition for the role of Pam.Be kind to everyone you meet, and work hard on every role you get – you never know who is going to come through with your big chance.


The more roles you take, no matter how small or weird, the more connections you will make with actors, directors, casting professionals, and agents.

, Hone your skills with professionals, but, more importantly, take the time to make connections. The people you take classes with are all in the same boat as you, and opportunities will arise for some people that can help you as well. Many now-famous comedy groups, like the Upright Citizen’s Brigade, began through friendships made at acting classes.

, The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) is a union for actors. Many TV shows, films, and even commercials will only hire SAG certified actors. While this does not have to be your first step in Hollywood, you should register online once you start getting your first auditions.


Membership costs roughly $200 a year
SAG members receive health benefits, acting workshops, online casting databases, and support when reading and signing contracts.

, Auditions are your chance to shine, and they are posted online, in trade books, and in newspapers all over Hollywood. You should also continue asking your friends if they know of any good casting opportunities.


Check online casting databases, like Backstage.com and SAGAFTRA.org, to get up-to-date casting information.
Ask your agent, if you have one, to find auditions or parts for you.
Always prepare for an audition by cleaning up, reading the part, and practicing your monologue or speech beforehand.

, Agents specialize in landing roles for actors by communicating directly with studios about their needs. When a movie or TV show needs someone with a certain look or style, they ask the agent to provide them with a list of potential names instead of putting up a Craigslist  ad. To get an agent, research acting agencies near you and send them a resume, cover letter, and headshots. Many will only accept actors who have already worked a few small gigs.


Try to use SAG/AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) approved agents, as they have been vetted by the industry and have proven connections.
To find agents, search online for “acting agencies,” buy a “Call Sheet” book, which is a print collection of agents, or ask Hollywood friends if they can put in a good word for you.
Apply to 10-15 agencies at a time, as they are often busy and may not even read your submission., As wonderful as it would be to rocket to stardom in your first picture, most actors work steadily for years before being noticed, if they get noticed at all. Do not let pride keep you from applying for small parts on TV shows, commercials, or the backgrounds of movies. Every role you land will help further your dreams as an actor.


Commercials are an enormous market for actors, and usually only require one day of work.

, Sometimes the best way to break into the film industry is to ignore it. Getting on stage is valuable experience that can get you noticed if the right person is in the audience.


Ian McKellan, Alec Baldwin, and Sarah Jessica Parker all began their careers in theater.Stand-up comedians from David Cross to Amy Schumer spent years performing stand up before they broke into television.

, Unfortunately, becoming an actor in Hollywood is a long journey that requires patience, hard work, and sacrifice. Some actors never make it out of commercials and small parts, but they continue because they love their work. Your big break can come at any time, but only if you’re working hard enough to make it possible.

Obtain first-aid training.",How to Blow Fire," You have a couple choices in fuel, each of which produces different results. Take the following things into consideration: flash (ignition) point, taste, smell, and smoke. Popular options include specialized fire blowing fuels (such as Safex Pyrofluid FS), kerosene, and paraffin (traditional lamp oil). You should never use naphtha (white gas), lighter fluid, gasoline, or ethyl alcohol.Ultimately, your fuel of choice should be the one that is least offensive to your senses; everyone has their own personal preferences for fuel, so a little trial and error is necessary to find yours.
Fuels like kerosene and paraffin have high flash points, meaning they don't ignite easily. This is desirable for fire blowing because you want to minimize your risk of ""blowback"" or igniting the fuel's fumes while performing.Kerosene produces a lot of smoke and is also the most dangerous (due to its mostly unrefined quality) of the high flash point fuels; many people also say it tastes and smells terrible!All petroleum-based fuels are extremely toxic and carcinogenic (cancer-causing); these should never come anywhere near your mouth!
Even non-toxic fuels such as paraffin should not be inhaled; even minor inhalation of these fuels can cause serious respiratory issues like lipoid pneumonia.;
, Many beginner fire blowers use a simple, homemade torch made from a non-flammable handle (often metal) and an absorbent cloth wrapped around the end for the wick. You will need to bind the wick material to the handle using a fire-resistant cord so it will not unwrap or fall off while lit.Find binding specialized for fire blowers or that is specifically designed to resist burning; this can be found through juggling specialty retailers online (such as at Dube.com). Stay away from cotton cord or typical rope, as these burn easily!You may use anything for the stick portion of the torch that is not flammable. Many people use bent wire coat hangers for this because they are non-flammable, lightweight, and do not transfer heat easily. The stick should be at least 12 inches long.
Choose a wick material that does not burn quickly; otherwise your torch will burn itself out too early.
Make your wick tip small for your first few practices. Once you have figured out whether you are getting the right sized flame, you can adjust the size of subsequent wicks to reduce or enlarge your flame.
Bind the wick to the handle at the base of the wick material, leaving enough exposed material to easily soak with fuel and let it burn for a while.

, You can either dip the wick into a fuel container or pour the fuel onto the wick. Either way, make sure the wick is soaked with fuel but is not dripping. In order to get excess fuel off of the wick before lighting it (to prevent spreading fire onto yourself or the ground), shake it vigorously over a fuel receptacle until it no longer drips.Make sure no fuel gets onto the handle (stick) of the torch when it is dipped. Even though this material should be non-flammable, it will still light if it has fuel on it.

, Do this with an ignition source such as a match or lighter. Be sure to hold the torch in your dominant hand, either upright or at arm's length. Light the wick at its base (closest to the handle) so you can quickly move your hand away from it once it lights.Make sure there is no fuel on your hand before you light the wick.
Choose an ignition source that can be easily started with one hand, since you will be holding the torch with your other hand.
Select an ignition source that allows you to keep your hand at least a few inches from the wick when you are lighting it; something with a long handle or nozzle, such as a barbeque lighter, is a good option.

, The more air you breathe in, the greater/more prolonged will be the effect of blowing fire, as the flame will subside as soon as you stop blowing. You should get in the habit of turning your head away from your torch when you inhale, so as not to choke on smoke or the fumes from the burning fuel.In order to prevent accidental inhalation of fuel vapor, try to inhale through your nose. If you can get into a rhythm of inhaling nasally between each blow, it will eventually become natural.

, Do this quickly (do not sip it). It is extremely important that you do not inhale (even the vapor) or swallow any fuel!For this reason, you should not attempt to suck the fuel from its container, as this requires simultaneous inhalation and could make you choke.


Hold your fuel container with your palm on the backside, with your thumb and fingers pointing toward you. This will help prevent spilling the fuel onto your arm when you pour it.
Make sure your fuel is in a container that is easy to pour from; having a spout or small sized opening will help with this.
Practice doing this with water before using fuel so you know how much you can hold in your mouth without choking or accidentally swallowing some.

, When pouring the fuel into your mouth, you may notice that some of it spills out onto your face. Use a small, absorbent terrycloth or thick cotton towel to wipe away any excess fuel immediately after you have poured it into your mouth. This will prevent any ""blowback"" that may occur by having excess fuel on your face.Hold this cloth in your non-torch-holding hand. This way you can keep the torch as far away from your face as possible while wiping away excess fuel.
Consider having spare cloths available in the event that the first one becomes saturated.

, Do this in such a way that the fuel is expelled as a mist. The more forcefully you spray the fuel, the better the fire breathing effect. Hold the torch at arm's length and try to angle your fuel spray up and away from your body so as to avoid spitting fuel onto yourself or any nearby objects.Practice doing this without a torch (no fire) until you have mastered the fuel spray procedure. You should make sure the fuel does not make you choke or gag; also, ensure that you are able to quickly and smoothly spray all of the fuel out of your mouth, leaving none behind.
Continue to exhale with force even after you have expelled all of the fuel in your mouth. This will prevent any vapor from remaining in your mouth and will keep the flame from wanting to travel back toward your face.
Wait several seconds after exhaling before inhaling again in order to prevent yourself from ingesting any fuel.

, When your performance is finished, the torch can be intentionally extinguished using a safety towel, damp cloth, or flame-treated cloth.To do this, simply drape the towel or cloth over the lit portion of the torch; this will smother the flame and put it out.


If you choose to use a damp cloth for this, have a bucket of water nearby that you can use to wet the cloth when needed.
Make sure the cloth you use is not flammable or likely to melt. Cotton, for example, is a poor choice of material because it can burn easily if it is not thoroughly wetted.

, A guard functions to keep spectators a safe distance away from you (the performer) while you are working with fire. This is essential, as most bystanders will have never seen fire breathing before and will not know how far the flame could reach. This person should be very familiar with the practice of fire breathing.Fire safety training for guards is a good idea; however, since the guard's main job is to keep the audience at a safe distance from you and your equipment, it is not critical that they be extensively trained in this.

, A spotter is a person (or persons) who is in charge of fire safety during your performance. This individual should be knowledgeable about your performance, the art of fire breathing, and should also have training in wick extinguishing. Your spotter should have a fire extinguisher on hand in case it is needed.Spotters need to be attentive to the safety needs of the audience, the venue, and you (the performer).
It is important to include your spotter in your practice sessions so he can become accustomed to your routine before you perform it with an audience.

, Depending on the nature of your routine, you may wish to have a special costume. Make sure the material you wear is flame resistant (meaning it will not continue burning once an ignition source is removed) or, at the very least, not particularly flammable. Cotton and synthetic materials that tend to melt easily are not recommended.Your costume should be able to withstand 800 degree temperatures for more than three seconds without catching fire in order to be considered flame-resistant.If your costume is not already flame-retardant, you can treat the material with a flame retardant substance made for clothing.
Practice with your planned costume before wearing it for a performance.
Make sure spotters and guards are also equipped with flame-resistant clothing.

, Fire breathing is very dangerous, and your chances of having an accident are greatest when you are first learning. Be prepared for dealing with injuries by becoming trained in first aid before you attempt fire blowing.Your first aid training should include CPR and proper techniques for immediate treatment of burns. You should always have a first aid kit on hand when practicing or performing fire blowing.
Guards and spotters should also have first aid training.
If you are performing a large, organized event, arrange to have an ambulance standing by in case you or someone else is injured during your performance.

It doesn’t have to be a professional photo; you can have a friend to take a picture of your face with a digital camera and blow it up to 8” x 10"" if the agency requests a hard copy.
Contact local photographers and get quotes. Don't just rely on the rates posted on the web-site. Because your needs are fairly straight forward, you may be able to get a great theatrical headshot done affordably.
Have them printed up as needed. You'll probably change your headshot every few months.;
, Don't send anything overly suggestive, or too casual. Make sure your hair is styled and your makeup appropriately applied.


Consider having your makeup professionally done. You don't have to spend a lot but a makeup artist will know how to give you a natural look that won't look underdone in photos with flash.
Ask them to show you how it was done so you can recreate the look.
If your home collection of makeup is more natural, ask the makeup artist to use colors that you are comfortable applying and normally wear.

, This is not a time to send an over glamorized photo or a picture of yourself in your Halloween costume. A headshot should be a good photo of you and not just a candid photo. Some movies may want a photo of you dressed like a zombie, they'll let you know.

, Many casting companies use the internet so have a photo ready to email. You don't want to clog their email, or require them to minimize the photo in order to view it. Use a size appropriate for emails, such as a 3""x5"".

, You may need to update your headshot so it is current and represents your current look. Have a new headshot made whenever you change your look (weight-loss, weight gain, change from long hair to short, change your hair color, etc.)


Don't send a photo that isn't a good representation. Casting agencies anticipate that you will look like your headshot. Arriving and looking totally different may end your relationship with that casting agency before it ever gets going.

, Check the help-wanted section of trade journals under “auditions.” There are also websites that list extra opportunities. And if you live in an area where films often are shot, like L.A., New York City, Toronto, and Vancouver, there may be listings in the local papers.

, You may be asked to send your age, height and weight, hair color and eye color. Don't lie, if you arrive and are a minor, are really 5"" shorter or 20lbs heavier, they will assume you are being deceptive. They need people of all sizes, shapes and ages, but various projects need various people at different times. Your really shape and age may be what they're really looking for. It's better to be honest.


This is NOT the time to tell them what a big fan you are. They aren't looking for weirdo fans, they are looking for people who can act professionally.

, Consider signing with an agency. Find a list online, or try www.centralcasting.org, which is the industry’s largest casting agency. Send a headshot and resume and then follow up with a phone call.

, Extras are hired employees and are paid by the production. No legitimate casting agency or talent agency will ask you to pay a fee in order to get work. Any agency that asks you is a sham. Also avoid agencies that want you to pay for photo packages, lessons on being an extra, or booking fees.

, When you get your first role, ask what you need to bring. Most productions require that you bring your own clothes and arrive with your hair and makeup done. Read the information carefully! It is best not to submit for the sake of submitting, especially if you don't have the wardrobe required for the particular scene. For example, if you don't have a large selection of medical scrubs you shouldn't submit for an extra job on a project that requires everyone wear scrubs or medical attire.


A wardrobe person will approve your selection, choose an alternate selection from what you pack, or they may ask you to change into something from the wardrobe department, if one is available. It is always more professional to come prepared than risk being excused because you didn't bring the necessary wardrobe options. Not all productions have a wardrobe selection for extras.
They may ask you to dress for a certain season so be prepared to go digging in the attic for shorts and tank tops to wear during a winter film schedule.
They may ask you to bring 3-4 different outfits. Read the information carefully and pack a garment bag with your alternate options. Make sure you pack the appropriate shoes, jewelry and handbags for each outfit. Ladies should remember to pack a strapless bra in a neutral color.
Avoid wearing or packing anything with a large logo. This isn't the time to promote your favorite band, or show up looking like a billboard for your favorite designer. If they have a deal to have certain logos allowed they will include it in the information sheet. If you arrive in a logo-ed shirt or hat, they will almost certainly require you to change clothes. If you don't have something, they will excuse you.
They will probably tell you to avoid wearing wild prints, bright colors, red, white and sometimes black. Films using green screens for CGI may ask you to avoid the color green.
Don't pack clothes of all one color. If the star is wearing purple, they will want you to wear another color. If you only pack a purple dress, purple shirt and a purple sweater, you'll be without options. They probably won't know what the star is wearing and that may not make it into the information they give you ahead of time.
Iron and lint roll your clothes and pack them carefully. Using a garment bag is best but you can also pack it in a rolling suitcase. It's better to pack things carefully in a large suitcase than have your clothes wrinkled from being crammed in a small bag.
Ladies should pack their makeup, hairbrush, or anything needed to touch up. You may be sitting around for 10 hours before you are needed.

, The agency will give you the date you are needed. You should completely free your day. Extra work requires long hours and you are expected to stay until the scene is wrapped. You may only be there for 6 hours or you may be there for 15 hours and leaving at 4am. Leaving early will be very unprofessional and you may forfeit your pay.

, Being late is unprofessional. Wandering around, being weird, talking too much and trying to be seen in the scene is very unprofessional. You are there to provide background and ambiance, not to be discovered.

, Act professionally at all times. Remember, you have been contracted to work and you are an employee. Never take photos, bother the crew, or approach the stars. Breaking the rules will get you kicked off the set and you may burn a bridge with a casting agency that books for many projects. The nice, reliable and normal acting people will have more opportunities to work.


Bring a book, iPod, or playing cards—you’ll be waiting around a lot! Listen carefully to instructions. Being an extra is interesting work but can be excruciatingly boring. There will be many hours of sitting in a holding area and perhaps many hours of standing around on set, not allowed to talk or move around.

, You may just be a blurry dot on screen or end up on the cutting room floor. You may just see a celebrity, and have a good story to tell your friends.

Because of this, you will want to decide on your budget at the beginning of your search for a photographer. Keep in mind that high-quality shoots with experienced professionals normally range from 300 to 700 USD.


If you are on a budget, try searching for student photographers in your area, friends of friends, or professional photographers who are at a workshop—they may need a subject for practice.Remember that the headshot is the most crucial component of getting chosen for an acting gig. If there is one thing to invest money in for your career, it is a headshot.
Different photographers offer different packages and have distinct methods of charging. For example, one photographer may charge per hour, while another charges per photo. Most packages include a set number of outfit and background changes. Make sure you’re clear on how a photographer charges, and what is included in the price.;
, Ask others for recommendations for a great headshot photographer. If another actor has had success getting acting jobs using their headshots, ask who the photographer was and call them!

, Once you find a photographer who fits your budget, go to their website or portfolio to see samples of their work. Check to see if the images draw you to want to learn more about the person. Notice if the images look flat or if every person is made to look the same. Are the backgrounds busy and distracting, or is the person the central focus? Does the photographer's style match your own?, You want to be sure that the photographer is reliable and will be accessible when you need to contact them. When you send them emails, how long does it take to respond? Do they answer all the questions that you ask? You want a photographer who is responsive and transparent.

, Since many agencies search for actors online via casting websites, you will want to have access to digital versions of all your images. Ask the photographer if they offer digital copies of the photos, and if there is an additional cost for having them sent to you.

, Some photographers may charge you for their travel time to the shoot, or for their parking during the shoot, which can come as an unpleasant surprise. Make sure you ask your photographer about any extra charges to avoid a surprise cost., More than anything else, casting directors insist that the headshots must look like you—natural, authentic you. Ask your photographer to describe their editing practices, and let him know what amount of editing you are comfortable with.


Be sure to verify whether or not image editing is included in the price you’re paying, or if there is an extra charge.
If headshots look extremely edited or don't properly represent you, the outcome will not be good: either your headshot won’t be chosen because it looks unrealistic, or the casting director will be frustrated when you arrive on set, looking nothing like the photograph. When you are chosen for a role, it is because the “you” in the image matches what they are looking for, not because you look perfect.On the other hand, if you have a pimple or a bruise that you would like to hide, ask your photographer about their ability to hide that type of mark during the editing process.

, Ask the photographer if they have a studio setup with lighting equipment, if they expect you to provide a space, or if they plan to have the photos taken outside. Discuss this to come to an agreement that works for both of you.

, Now that you’ve done your research and found a photographer who you are comfortable with, schedule your appointment! Be sure that the appointment is at least an hour long—it can take time for you and the photographer to get comfortable with each other, and once that happens, the photos often improve.

, In the entertainment industry, there is always a risk of people trying to take advantage of others. If a photographer is charging an exorbitant amount of money that you are considering paying (for example, over 1,200 USD), be sure to check their website and look for references to be sure they’re legitimate. A photographer charging this much should have a professional-looking website and raving reviews, and may have placed some actors that you recognize., You will want to wear subtle makeup for the photo shoot. This will give you a natural look while helping your features to pop. If you choose to wear makeup, select eye liner, eye shadow, and lipstick that are only a shade or two darker than your skin tone, and avoid wearing too much foundation, bronzer, or blush.If you do your makeup yourself regularly, wear it as you would on a normal day (rather than for a fancy event).
If you don’t typically wear makeup or don’t feel confident applying it, consider hiring someone to do it for you. Many headshot photography studios have makeup artists on site.
Avoid shiny eye shadows and lip glosses—these can be distracting in the image.

, Neutral colors like black, white, and beige are safe and can work great. You can also wear a color that is flattering for your face and skin tone. For women, a flattering neckline can enhance the photographs. The most important rule is to keep it simple—avoid logos, distracting patterns, and sequins.Simple, soft patterns like small polka dots or plaid can look very nice in headshots as well.

, To look your best in your photos, avoid drinking alcohol and smoking for the few days before your shoot. Doing so will help you look brighter and more hydrated., The days leading up to your shoot, make sure you are drinking plenty of water. Doing so will help you have energy, can reduce the appearance of wrinkles and dark circles under your eyes, and will help your skin to have a healthy glow., Give yourself a week to get on a good sleep schedule, and be sure to get plenty of quality sleep the night before the photo shoot. This will help you look your best, and will give you the stamina to get through the day of being photographed. If you are feeling energetic and rested, you will likely look more vibrant, engaged, and lively in your photos.


To get the best quality sleep, try turning off any screens (your phone, your TV, and your computer) at least an hour before going to bed. Drink water before going to sleep as well.

, Changing your hair color or getting a radical hair cut right before a shoot is risky for a few reasons. First, you don’t know how it will turn out. Second, especially for men, haircuts are often a bit too short directly after the haircut. If you are going to cut or color your hair, schedule it a week or two before your photo shoot to give the cut time to grow out a bit and the color time to tone down to a more natural shade., You may want to whiten your teeth a bit before the photo shoot. To do so, you can try an over-the-counter whitening product, such as whitening strips. You can also use a natural method, such as a mixture of baking soda and peroxide.


Be careful when trying to whiten your teeth too quickly. Doing so can increase tooth sensitivity and wear away at your enamel.
If you feel that you won’t be able to safely whiten your teeth in time for the shoot, you can also talk to your photographer about retouching your teeth during the editing process., If you have a beard, be sure that it looks tidy and well-groomed for your photo shoot. Consider getting a trim if your beard has become unruly.

, Ask your photographer to show you a few test shots in the beginning of the shoot. By doing this, you can give him input and avoid going through the entire shoot with some component not to your liking, such as angles or lighting.Be sure that you like the lighting, and that the photos are well-framed. There should be no harsh shadows, and the lighting around your face should be good. Headshots should be framed to show your head and shoulders.

, A casting director will want to see several photographs of you to get a more comprehensive idea of who you are. Ensure that your photographer takes various photos of you from different angles.


Avoid a symmetrical stance. In the headshots, you want to stand or sit with one shoulder in front of the other, or turned slightly. This will prevent the headshot from looking like a passport photo., Your photographer should know this, but you want to be sure that the background is either plain, or that it will be blurred behind you. The background should not be a point of distraction, and you should stand out against it.


Be sure that there is background showing in the frame, rather than having your body fill the whole frame. The background provides context and contrast for the image. , Commercial shots typically show you happy and smiling. These will be used to apply for commercial roles. Theatrical shots are used for film and TV roles. Typically, these shots are intended to convey your attitude, energy, and personality. You will typically not be smiling in these shots.For your theatrical shots, try a variety of facial expressions. This is your opportunity to give a glimpse into your character! Use the opportunity to show the casting director why they want to bring you in for an audition.

, This may sound a bit cheesy, but so much of what will catch a casting director’s attention are your eyes. Make sure that your eyes aren’t glazed over—they should look alive and focused. Instead of thinking about how you look as the picture is being taken, think about other events in your life, stories, things you care about, or things that excite you. This can bring life into your eyes, which will help you stand out amongst the stack of hundreds of pictures."

- Start a clip library.,
- Find your niche.,
-Make business cards.,
- Get a VJ program.,
- This should be obvious, but you need to have equipment.,
- No matter how many clips you have, you will always, always need more.,
ALWAYS do an equipment check before you leave your house.,
Wherever you are going to be V.J.-ing at a club, show up before the patrons so that you can hook it all up, position the projector if necessary (a lot of clubs have their own) and make sure everything works.,
Don't rely on the same graphics that other V.J.,
A good way to ingratiate yourself to any club you work for is to make a few clips with their logos in them, or at least the name of the club.,
If you just bring some movies to screen from your hard drive, that is NOT VJing.",How to Become a Popular Vj," Use copyright free or creative commons licensed footage. Or shoot your own. Don't rely on the usual libraries made for Vjs- they are way too common and can be seen in any nightclub.;
, What is your favorite music? It helps if it is anything outside the pop/top 40 realm. Where are the clubs that play this music? Do they have someone doing visuals? If they don't, put together some clips and offer to show someone what you can do.

, Present yourself as a visual artist and always have your info ready to hand out. You can get them cheap or even free from places like Vista.

, A great free one is called VDMX. There is a learning curve- DO NOT wait the day of the show to learn to use it. And don't pretend that you can learn to use it if you don't have a projector. Learning to throw the image onto the large screen is different for every program and computer. This in and of itself can take a lot of time. SO give yourself a lot of room to breathe and a few days to learn to use the program. When you figure things out, write them down. And bring them with you to the show.

, I would recommend a laptop with AT LEAST 2 GB RAM, your own projector, VGM cables, VGM adapters, and of course your VJ program.

, Aim for the thousands. Start a folder with subfolders according to type. You need to be able to access them and know what sort they are, because with a lot of clips your VJ program is just going to show you thumbnails. You won't be able to see what they are that way. Keep it organized.

, I have forgotten obvious things like my hard drive or my laptop power cord before. ALWAYS check.

, Don't be cocky and think everything will run smoothly if you just roll in 10 minutes before they open the doors to the public.

,'s have used. Dig for your clips. Edit them with a movie program. Do something original. Try customizable music visualizer like Bazik.

, People really appreciate that.

, VJs do more work than DJs. They mix the visuals throughout the song, not just in between the songs. And its all improv. To earn the title, do the work. Practice while listening to live mixes from different DJs.

It should include your name, physical description, contact information, relevant experience, training, and any special skills you have.Your name should be in the largest print and listed at the top of the resume.
List your height, weight, eye and hair color.
Include your email and phone number so the casting agent can easily get in touch with you.
If you don’t have any film credits, but you do have theater credits, you can list those for now. As your film resume increases, you will want to replace your theater credits and list just on-camera credits from film, television and commercials. List the title of the production, your role and the production company.
Include any relevant training through a college, community theater, or acting school. List the title of the course and the instructor. Only include courses which you have already completed.
Regularly update your resume to reflect your experience.;
, A class will be the best way to prepare yourself for the work of being on set and in front of a camera. You will learn what is expected of you, expose yourself to the process and understand the lingo you may experience when shooting a movie, and it will look good on your resume.Shooting a film involves several “takes” of the same scene to get it just right and allow the scene to be shot from several camera angles.
Extras are considered part of the background and will be used to fill in scenes, which will be shot in many takes. You will be told where to be and what to do, and will be expected to repeat this as exactly as possibly to maintain continuity in each “take.”

, There is a language which is specific to the film scene. It is helpful to learn some of the lingo in order to understand the directions you are being given. On-camera classes as well as books about acting in film can be helpful in learning this lingo.


”Back to one” instructs the talent to move back to the place where they were when the shot began, in order to prepare for a second take.
”Rolling” means the camera is filming, and is a warning that everyone should be prepared for “action.”
”Cut” lets actors know that they are no longer filming, and action has stopped.

, A headshot is a professional photo of the actor’s head and shoulders. Print several 8x10, color headshots. Attach your resume to the back of your headshot with a staple in the corner. Take a couple of copies of your headshot and resume to every audition.You will also want a high-resolution, digital copy of your headshot for submitting yourself online.
Professional headshots will cost at least $200 by the time you have completed the shoot and printed about 50 copies.
Avoid wearing patterns in your headshots. Keep it simple so that the focus is on your face instead of your clothing. Bring several different shirts to the photo shoot and have pictures taken in a couple of different options.Let your personality shine. While you certainly want to look friendly and personable, you also don’t want to just smile for the camera. Relax and have fun during the shoot and see what your photographer can come up with to make you look unique and interesting.
Your headshot should look like you. You will need to update your headshot as you age, or your features change. This includes things like cutting or coloring your hair into a different style, or shaving a long beard., It is sometimes true that it’s all about who you know in this industry. Go to film screenings, fundraisers, and acting classes to meet other people involved in making films. Mingle and find out what work is coming up and how you might be able to get involved.

, There are several online casting networks where you can post your headshot and resume to be found by casting agents. You can submit yourself directly through these sites. Most are free or have a small fee for submitting or posting extra pictures or film reels.


Try “Casting Networks” and “Extras Access” for posting your headshot and resume online., Local theaters, acting schools, and colleges will have a “call board.” This is a bulletin board in a common area where they will post jobs and casting notices.

, You can go through a large casting site, like Backstage, or check with your local film commission to see what will be filming in your area. There are also films listed on Craigslist under “Jobs.”Backstage allows you to search within a certain radius of major cities. It also allows you to filter casting calls so you can search by age range, gender, type of film and roles. Click on “Roles” to find the option to check “Only Background Roles/Extras.”

, Once you have found auditions online, submit your headshot and resume through their portal to be considered for the role. Write a short note acknowledging what role you are submitting yourself for and asking to be considered.

, Cattle calls are large auditions, which do not require an appointment. Expect to spend time waiting in line in order to meet the casting agents. Bring several copies of your headshot and resume and a pen to fill out any forms they may have at the audition.Find cattle calls by searching the website for your local film commission.There may be a casting agency which specializes in casting extras in your area. Ask around and register with this casting agency to be notified when films are casting near you.

, This applies to auditions and jobs once you have been cast. The general rule is that 15 minutes early is on time, on time is late and late is unacceptable. A simple way to prove that you are a professional is to show up a little early., As an extra, you will likely be expected to wear your own clothes for the shoot. You will get instructions on what to wear when you are cast. Be sure that you have these items on hand, can borrow them, or purchase them.If you don’t have the clothing they are asking for, it is possible to purchase the items and return them to the store after the shoot date.
Generally, filmmakers like to avoid red and stripes, which can effect the camera shot.

, A large part of being an extra is sitting around and waiting for something to do. They crew spends a lot of time setting up cameras, lights and sets. The extras will wait in the “holding area” until they are instructed on what to do. Not every extra will be used in every shot.You are more likely to be used if you are ready and available when the Production Assistant enters the holding area to find extras for a scene.
Bring something to keep yourself occupied while you wait.

, The job of an actor is to follow directions. Whether you are on-screen or in the holding area, be easy to work with. This includes doing what the director asks of you while you are performing as well as being generally respectful, like staying quiet on the set., You can find the current rate for background actors by searching the “SAG/AFTRA” rate sheet. The current base rate, through June of 2016 is $157/day, and will will increase to $162/ day in July. There are certain allowances for using your property or special skills. You can earn extra money above the base rate by doing additional work or using your property.Special skills will earn you more money. This includes skills such as dancing, singing, stunts, and piloting.
If you are asked to furnish formal attire or special outfits, like uniforms, you can be paid extra money as a rental fee for using your clothing as a costume.
You can be paid for allowing your car or pet to be included in the shoot.
Bonuses are paid to extras who take on additional roles, like speaking a line of dialogue or standing in for one of the lead actors.
You will be paid overtime if the shoot runs long or meals are delayed.

, When you work on a feature film, you will receive a voucher at the end of the day. Ask questions to be sure that you fill it out correctly. Keep a copy for yourself, and turn the other one in to the appropriate person before leaving set.The check will be mailed to you in about 2-3 weeks, so be sure that you have listed a valid address.
Just like any other job, you will need to be able to prove that you are able to work as a citizen. Be sure to have an appropriate, valid ID with you when filling out your voucher. This includes unexpired driver’s licenses, social security cards and passports.

All animators bring characters or images to life on screen by creating a sense of motion, but they work in different fields.


Some animators create pictures that are used by motion picture studios and advertising agencies. Others create storyboards that are used by television and movie directors to plan their filming. These storyboards illustrate what will be seen on screen, such as where actors will stand. There are many different roles that people can play in the animation process. Animators create special effects that appear in movies, television shows, and video games. Animators also work as modelers, in computer animation, as painters, as game designers, and as technical directors.
Consider freelancing. Sometimes animators freelance on the side in different areas of the field.;
, Employers look for ""hard"" skills like the ability to use computer programs. They also consider ""soft"" skills, which are the personality traits that many animators need to have.


It can take many weeks to create a 10-second animation. If you don't have the patience for such an endeavor, this might not be the best field for you. Don't expect to learn the skills of animation in a couple of weeks, either. The field requires a great deal of technical training.Animation is fun, and many animators grew up enjoying animated video games or movies. Imagine being asked to create a fight between two Transformers! If you enjoy animation as a consumer of media, this might be a good career field for you.
Animators are perceptive and good observers of life and human nature. This is because they will be asked to recreate facial expressions and the way that people move. They need to have the ability to create story lines, not just characters.
Animators need to work well with other people. It's rare for an animator's role not to involve teamwork. There are many, many steps in the entire animation process. , The animation process can be broken down into different sections. It involves a lot more than simply putting a pen to paper (or finger on a computer mouse). By mastering these stages, you can better choose which role you want to play.


Pre-production. In this stage, the animator conceptualizes the final product. An animator might create a storyboard that includes sketches of each frame and helps develop and visualize the storyline. The drawings in a storyboard often contain text describing the movements of the characters.
Sometimes animators will shoot reference videos in pre-production. For example, if they are going to create a character throwing a baseball, they might want to shoot and study a video of a person throwing a baseball. Model sheets show characters' facial expressions. These specific drawings allow animators to keep the characters' personalities consistent. Then, the visuals department creates animatics, which are simple mock ups of the visual animation. An animator will also decide on a few key poses, which are the core positions of the character.
Production. Layout artists create 3-D versions of the storyboard drawings. Basically, they bring them to life. Some forms of animation use modelers who shape the drawings into life. Textures provide the tiny details that make animation seem real, such as cracks in sidewalks. Rigging means the characters' bones and motion is further defined on screen. Some forms of animation use motion capture, which means an actor or actress' motion is captured and then matched to the animation drawings.
Post-production. There are three basic components of post-production: Compositing brings together all of the previous elements in production into one seamless storyline. Sound editing adds sound effects and lip-syncing to the animated drawings. Video editing is a process to create proper flow and storyline by rearranging images if necessary. , Most animation is either 2-D or 3-D. To understand the difference, recall that traditional cartoons like Aladdin were 2-D and movies like Toy Story were done in 3-D and show more complex dimensions. To be a 2-D animator, you would draw everything you see frame-by-frame. You draw key poses. Then you draw every movement in between. Artistic ability by hand is important for all animators, but it's more important with 2-D animation. Animation usually uses about 24 frames a second. Slower movements can use 12 frames a second. In stop animation, where characters are still, you don't use many frames.
3-D animators move characters like puppets on the computer. 3-D animators create a model of the character. The animator can grab controls using a computer to create nuanced movement by the character. 3-D animation requires a knowledge of graphs and curves and basic geometry. 3-D animators rarely use stop animation. They have to always keep the character in motion or it will look like a mistake., Although there are always exceptions, it will be easier to find a job as an animator if you obtain a bachelor's or associate's degree from a university or technical college that has a good record in the field.


You want to look for an educational institution that offers courses in 2-D and 3-D animation. Although some students in animation choose to major in art, finding a program with a degree in animation specifically is even better.
To help you select a school, look up listings and reviews of animation schools. For example, the Animation Career Review lists top schools for private game design. It also has listings of the top animation schools by region. You might be able to choose a two-year or online program instead. The Animation Career Review is one place you can check for animation school programs. The site has a detailed listing of schools that offer animation related degrees. You should look for schools that offer majors in the specific types of animation you are interested in. For example, if you want to be an animator of video games, you should choose a school offering majors in things like ""gaming design"" and ""3D modeling for games."" , As technology changes, and consumers demand more sophisticated imagery, certain areas of the field offer more job opportunities than others. Study the field, so you understand where its growth areas are and how your skills best fit.


Reading trade publications that specialize in animation fields is a great way to embrace trends and have a better understanding of the industry.
Cartoonists (2-D animators) are not as in demand these days as technical animators who use computers to create imagery. Just consider how movie animation has changed from the days of Mickey Mouse to the digital complexity of Toy Story.

, You should probably specialize in one aspect of the field that you are best at and love most. Don't try to do everything at once. Find your animation niche, whether it's drawing by hand or using computers to create complex special effects. If you love to draw and are good at it, maybe 2-D is the way to go. If you have a mind for math and love using computers, 3-D is the best bet.


Universities and other training programs offer specialties in areas like game design, computer animation, graphic design, visual art, motion graphics, and entertainment animation.
People sometimes figure out which specialty fits them best when they are already in school. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to specialize right away. However, by the end of your schooling, it's good to demonstrate a focus.Specializing will help you pick the right degree program and courses. You will need different courses to be an animator for Hollywood films than you would need to be an animator for gaming. Some universities have degree programs designed along various specialties.
Mastering the fundamentals should not be forgotten, however. If you can show employers you also have a strong basis of the fundamentals, you will be more marketable.

, This is extremely important. You should demonstrate artistic creativity, however you will be far more marketable as an animator these days if you also learn computer programs commonly used by animators. It's essential.


Common programs used by animators include website design software (like Dreamweaver), software used for graphics and photo imaging (like Creative Suite), 2-D and 3-D animation software (such as Studio Max, Maya, Flash, and After Effects), and video editing software (such as Premiere or Final Cut Pro). These computer programs can be very expensive. However, many college programs offer discounts for students.

, Animators aren't just technological robots. They need to have an understanding of artistic concepts and be able to draw. This is true for people going into 3-D animation, also.


Traditional art training helps an animator create poses and stage shots. Good animators will understand how to draw by hand, how to space the drawings properly to create the motion they want, and how to create motion in their characters. In the field, this is called being a ""draftsman.""
There are jobs for animators who draw only by hand, but it's a tougher field these days. Still, taking some courses in art will make most people a better animator. Some animation-oriented companies like Pixar actually say they put as much emphasis on artistic ability as computer skills for all animators.

, There are other courses and experiences you may need to be a good animator that can be found outside the specific degree programs that focus on animation training.


Some big studios look for animators with acting experience. They believe it helps them better capture life and movement in their characters. Remember, they want to hire you to create personality and storyline - to recreate life, essentially. Courses in science and, especially geometry, are valued by animators. Animators must be creative and visual, but they also need to have an understanding of geometry. , Build your resume with actual work experience. This is true while you are still in college. Start then (or even in high school if you can). Animators need to demonstrate professional experience, not just a college degree, to get their first job.


Many animation companies offer apprenticeships and internships for animation students looking to build their resumes to get their first job. Sometimes, these are unpaid.
Consider volunteering. This can be a good way to build up your resume. You may have to work for free for a while, but the work will help you get a job. Many non-profit organizations would love to have an animator help them with projects.
You can put volunteer work on your resume and in your portfolio. Companies won't care much that you weren't paid to do it. The critical thing is to show people what you have done and can do in a very concrete way.
Entry-level animation jobs usually require one year professional experience at least, and you will probably need about 5 years experience to obtain a more advanced position. , It's common in the field for employers to want to see your work on a demo reel. A demo reel is a video in which short examples of different animation scenes you've created plays on the screen. Some companies prefer demo reels that highlight a short segment of your best piece instead of multiple examples of your work.


You might want to alter your demo reel for various positions to highlight the style and training needed for that specific job. Different companies prefer different looks.
Demo reels for beginners should be about 2 minutes, but no longer than 4 minutes for animators with more experience. Select your best work for the reel, not every single thing you've done.Start and end with the best work.Some employers want to see a DVD of the demo reel, but others will accept a link to the demo reel on your website. Some companies, like Pixar, tell applicants they will send them information on what they want to see in a portfolio and demo reel when they apply. Use original sound in pieces that have dialogue, but avoid adding distracting music to the reel. You can use music, but just make sure it complements the animation instead of overpowering it. Some employers will turn down the music when watching your animation anyway.
Number each shot. The number will usually appear on the top right of the screen when each new animation segment appears on the demo reel.
Include a title card. This frame should have your name and contact information on it, as well as the job you're applying for. The title card should appear at the beginning and at the end of the demo reel.
Top animation companies are looking for creative ideas in a demo reel in addition to technical skills. Don't just do what everyone else is doing. Be willing to take chances. One animator said he wanted to use a diving shot, but instead chose a diving shot in which the character slipped and fell, to differentiate his reel from other reels with diving shots.Upload the reel to You Tube, Vimeo, and your website.

, Most companies will want a summary of what you did on screen written in text form that they can easily refer to when judging your work.


The numbers on the demo reel should match the numbers on the demo reel breakdown.
Tell the person watching exactly what you did. For example, if you have a ball on screen, explain whether you shaded the ball.

, These are two traditional job-seeking documents that many animation companies will want you to submit with your demo reel.


The cover letter should introduce yourself and your demo reel. You want to sell yourself in the cover letter.
The resume should list your education and training and places of employment that are relevant to the position, as well as any awards you have received and specific skills you possess.

, You will need to pull your best work into a portfolio to apply for an animation job. People will want to see examples of what you have done, not just be told what you have done. A portfolio is not optional. It's expected.


Include a biography section. You need to give employers a sense of you are as a professional.
Provide longer samples of your work.
Make sure there is a contact section.
Creation a section for your demo reel and resume.
Study examples of real portfolio sites by professional animators. You can find many of these online, and they will give you a better understanding of the norms in the field and what the competition is doing. "

For example, you can specialize in covering baseball, basketball, soccer, football, or volleyball games.
You should also consider if you prefer work in television, radio, or internet-based broadcasting.;
, These courses will have the most practical value to your future as a sportscaster. Journalism courses will prepare you to speak comfortably on radio and television, and will help you develop research and interview skills that are integral to working as a sportscaster.


Also take any courses related to television broadcasting. Although journalism is the field most closely related to sportscasting, learning about broadcasting will also help you master the technical aspects of TV sportscasting.

, Even in high school, you can begin gathering valuable sportscasting experience outside of your journalism classes.This will help you become a more competitive job candidate later in life, and will help you gain confidence. For example:


Practice calling games as much as you can. Sit in the stands during any sporting events you can find, and record yourself using a tape recorder or your phone.Look for opportunities to participate in student-run radio broadcasting programs.
Contact local radio or television stations and see if they need an intern or assistant.

, Although journalism classes and sportscasting practice are important, you should also continue playing sports of your choice, and should stay involved in the athletic community.


If you’re going to work as a sportscaster, you should be passionate about sports—remaining athletically active is the best way to maintain that passion and will give you an understanding of how the games work—which is what you will announce and analyze as a professional sportscaster.
Playing one or more sports will also allow you to form contacts and network within an athletic community.

, The best way to develop your own sportscasting abilities is to watch and listen to professional sportscasters.If you have the time, watch and listen to games at both the college and professional levels. Notice things like:


How sportscasters speak, including vocal inflections.
The kinds of information they include about individual players and entire teams.
The ways sportscasters narrate events on the field to form a cohesive, interesting game narrative.

, Pay attention especially to their journalism and sports broadcasting programs. You can choose a school with a strong journalism program or, for example, sports journalism or broadcast journalism programs.


Also consider choosing a college or university with journalism-related majors such as communications, mass media, or English.

, Sportscaster internships will be most interested in hiring an individual with a four-year degree related to the field of journalism or broadcasting, as these majors ground you in reporting and engaging with media.

, Even if you’re not at college to become a professional athlete, you should still stay involved in sports and the athletic community. You’ll receive a deeper understanding of how sports work at a high level, and be able to better analyze games both on and off the field.


If there’s a sports-related minor—for example, a Sports Studies program—consider pursuing that option.

, While many broadcasting programs exist, it may be hard for college students or recent graduates to break into these markets. Start talking to the Media or Radio departments at your university, and see if they allow students to start their own shows.If that is not an option, try starting your own broadcasting platform, such as a YouTube channel or a podcast.

, This is even more important in college than it was in high school, as an internship will allow you to gain practical experience outside of an academic setting and give you time to study the craft of sportscasting.


An internship is typically required to gain practical experience. You can obtain an internship on your own or with the help of your academic advisor.
Generally, internships are for one quarter or semester (depending on your university) or for a summer.
Although internships may pay, they are typically only for college credit.

, Broadcasting is a challenging responsibility; it calls for specialized skills that cannot be developed in other fields or lines of work. A job as a sportscaster requires an individual with charisma, who can think on their feet and is capable of both announcing specific plays, while also synthesizing information about players and teams with the overall narrative of a sports game.


Build a demo tape with the help of your adviser or a sports broadcast professional. The demo tape should be audio or video clips of work done during your internship or college television broadcasts.
Join college and professional journalism and sports broadcast journalism organizations or groups. Joining such an organization will allow you to network with other sports journalists.
Some colleges (and even high schools) also record student sportscasting, and then upload the videos to stream from the college’s athletics page online. If your college doesn’t record and upload student broadcasting, check with someone in Athletics to see if they’ll consider recording student sportscasting., Once you have finished your college degree and are beginning to look for work as a professional sportscaster, your network of professional contacts will prove invaluable.These contacts will be able to help you and mentor you through the job-search process, and can introduce you to further references and contacts.


Make sure that your references and contacts know you personally; cultivate personal relationships, not just face recognition.
Don’t hesitate to ask for letters of reference or other forms of personal recommendation for internship programs or jobs.

, Like any professional industry, the sports broadcasting world can be difficult to break into. However, professional contacts will be essential to your own success as an upcoming sportscaster. Network and make contacts however you can.Consider avenues like:


Mentoring groups specifically designed to help upcoming sportscasters.
Sportscasting school, which will help you hone your craft and meet others with the ambition to become a sportscaster.
Working in television fields related to sports broadcasting.
Imitating the career paths of successful sports broadcasters.

, It’s very unlikely that you’ll land a sportscaster job at a large TV station in a major metropolitan area right out of college. Plan to find a starting job in a smaller market, and use that as an opportunity to improve your network of contacts and your skills as a sportscaster.

, Even if you must start out with a low-level job, or one that does not allow you airtime initially, the job will still be valuable as long as it is in the field of sports broadcasting.


Closely observe other sportscasters. You can gather a wealth of information from professional sportscasters: interview them, learn from their mannerisms and speech in front of the camera, and learn from them as mentors.
Work up from a sports reporter to a sportscaster. Many sportscasters start out providing on-the-field game coverage as sports reporters, and occasionally pick up opportunities for sportscasting work at their TV or radio station.This is a common way to work your way up in the field.

, Many music label employees played music before switching to the business side of music. Through playing, song-writing, touring and more, you meet excellent contacts that can help you to get a job with a music label.


It is not imperative that you become a musician to work for a record label. Trying your hand at music proves your passion and technical expertise to music labels.

, In order to work successfully in most positions, you will need to network and develop relationships with artists, promoters, venues and more. Since many record label jobs involve attending gigs 4 to 5 nights per week, you will need to have a desire to socialize with other music lovers.

, Although some jobs, such as band management and promotion may not require a college degree if you have exceptional industry knowledge and sales skills, some jobs in finance, business administration and programming require a full 4-year degree in order to be hired.


Some colleges, such as Minnesota State University, offer a Bachelor of Science degree in their music industry program. This 4-year degree will teach you elements of sales, merchandising, manufacturing, recording, publication and arts management.
If you want to work with music events or recording, you can seek a technical degree in sound engineering. Music technology and audio engineering degrees are available in both 2-year and 4-year programs through community colleges, technical colleges and universities.
If you want to work in finance or accounting, seek a degree in those disciplines. Although a love of the music industry is not as crucial, industry knowledge is highly valued. If you are interested in sales, merchandising or marketing, you may find a business administration degree with a minor in music to be an excellent path into those specialized jobs.
Other applicable degrees include a degree in public relations for a job in publicity, a degree in graphic design to work on art for the marketing department or album posters and covers.
Training for a job in the A and R department (Artist and Repertoire), does not have a specific degree. Although a music industry program will be helpful, you must also prove that you have music savvy that meshes well with that of the label. You will need to prove your worth through experience in this department.

, Another element of music knowledge is an overall intelligence about the pressures, legislation and innovations that are common. Read books, magazines, journals and blogs to get a good basis before any interview.


You may consider getting subscriptions to Blender, Billboard, The Source, Spin, Vibe and Rolling Stone. You should also read label blogs and industry websites, such as gavin.com, musicconnection.com, musicweek.com and mixonline.com.

, While you are working as a musician or while you are a student, apply for an internship with a record label. Go online or call record labels to inquire about their internship programs.


During an internship or ""work experience"" period, you will be asked to work part-time, as much as 25 hours per week, plus events. If you impress the record label during a 1 to 6 month internship, you may be considered for permanent employment.

, For a music label, an entry-level position can mean being a personal assistant, doing data entry or applying directly for a specialized assistant position. Look on online job boards, in music magazines and on music label websites.

, An interview is a chance to show your passion for music, as well as your industry knowledge. Before you go, research the label and its competition extensively, so you can show that you are motivated during the interview.

, Every music label employee is required to prove their worth. This means working many nights and weekends for little pay, doing relatively non-specialized jobs.

, Despite the hard work required to make it in the industry, music labels are often keen to promote someone from a low-level job, over hiring someone new, for a promotion. Volunteer to take on or lead projects in order to make yourself a better candidate for promotions.

Dress simply.,
Wear very little make-up.,
Do not hide or distort your features with heavy eye make-up or blush.,
Watch your posture and walk at all times.,
Exercise.,
Drink 8 glasses of water daily.,
Keep your hair healthy.,
Don't neglect your nails.",How to Be a Model in Your Mid Twenties1," A pair of jeans, a sexy t-shirt, and a sexy pair of heels will do. The point is not to let your wardrobe take attention away from your beautiful face or body. You don't want to look overdone. Heals, as opposed to flats, will not only enhance your height, but they will improve your walk and add style to your simple wardrobe.;
, Try to avoid wearing foundation at all, if possible. This will keep your skin clean and healthy. If you have acne, see a dermatologist right away. Realistically, acne may take months or even years to clear up, and at this age, you have very little time to waste on experimenting blindly with products. Also, consider switching to mineral make-up. It is much lighter than heavy foundations, it does not clog pores, and can help oily complexions. Avoid drugstore brands, unless that is financially your only option.

, If you do not know how to do the natural look, see a professional make-up artist and ask for a natural look. If you feel you need heavy eye make-up, you may not be cut out for modeling, or you may lack the confidence needed to succeed in the field. If this is you, try going cold turkey by slapping on some mascara, some light concealer only where it's absolutely necessary, and some lip gloss with a natural tint. You WILL get used to it, and you will probably get compliments from your friends and family, which can only help. Chances are they've been hoping you'd chill with the heavy make-up. Also, make sure to stick to the daytime and nighttime make-up rule.

, Keep your shoulders back, and your head up, regardless of how odd this feels. Keep one foot in front of the other as you walk. Your feet should follow one another in a straight line.

, Be sure to keep your weight down, but be careful to stay healthy. See a nutritionist and discuss your goals with him/her. Lets face it- as a professional, you should take advantage of all of the sources available to assist you. Think of it as tuition, and as an investment in your future success as a model.

, Substitute soda and juice for water if this is difficult for you. You'll avoid sugar, and keep your body hydrated and your skin aglow.

, Avoid hot irons, blow-dryers, and curling irons whenever you can. Try working with the natural texture of your hair, whether you like it or not. Invest in a high-end salon and ask your stylist to create a style that would work with the natural texture of your hair. Straightening iron addicts- put those straighteners down! These tools should be reserved for special occasions ONLY! As a model, you will be exposed to these frequently anyway, so it would help to allow your hair to rest whenever you can. Also, try finding styling products that can achieve the look you're going for. ALWAYS use heat protection sprays and the appropriate products for your hair type. DO NOT wash your hair daily. Try using dry shampoo instead.

, Keep them relatively short (no hooker/acrylic nails, ladies!) and polished with a clear polish or a natural toned polish.

If you're 25, there are agencies who will still consider you for high-fashion depending on how well you've aged, so make sure to take excellent care of your skin, invest in a good eye cream and moisturizer, and stay out of the sun!,
If you're over 25 and believe you still look young enough to try it, submit your photos to reputable agencies through their websites or snail-mail.,
Be honest with yourself.,
If you're over 25 and have ruled out a career in high fashion, or an agent advised you to go commercial, by all means, listen to him/her and GO COMMERCIAL!",How to Be a Model in Your Mid Twenties2," That means, no tanning! EVER. Unless of course it's sunless, in which case, don't overdo it, and don't look orange. Ask a family member or friend who you think would be bold enough to tell you if you look orange or not. If you do, tone it down or avoid it all together. Photographers will apply bronzer to your skin if they think it's too pale.

, Agencies usually cut off open calls to models over the age of 25. Take 4 photos of yourself. The first should be a photo of the front of your face with NO MAKEUP on (if you insist on wearing it, however, make sure you keep it down to mascara and concealer that matches your skin tone perfectly. Second, a photo of your profile. Third, a full body shot of you in a bikini (NEVER send nude photos. They are UNACCEPTABLE). And finally, a full body shot of you in a bikini from the side.

, Are you a size 4, 6, or 8? Are you over 5'9""? If not, you should probably go with commercial/print/plus-size modeling. Seek out agencies with these divisions.

, You can have tremendous success as a commercial/print model, and best of all, unlike those of us in high fashion, you never expire. You can model until you die. Plus, it's still super glam, super fun, and you have the opportunity to make lots of money.

Keep that head up, those shoulders back, and that walk fierce.

Slouch a little, but hold your head high.,
Be strong from head to toe.,
Be asymmetrical.,
Point your nose away from the camera.,
Look everywhere.,
Quarter out.,
Remember your hands.",How to Pose Like a Model1," There are a few times when you'll need to throw your shoulders back for a shot, but generally, a little slouch makes your pose look natural and relaxed. That doesn't mean you should hunch over (although this will work with some high fashion shots). If you're standing, put uneven weight on your feet, and the leg with less weight will naturally bend a little. You'll look more comfortable and your posture will appear more natural. Don't slouch so much, though, that it makes your stomach look bigger.


By ""slouch,"" we mean ""be natural."" Most people aren't aware they're slouching when they are, so don't take your natural slouch and multiply it. Think casually, but with your head high. You want to elongate your neck as much as possible. Imagine a string holding up your forehead.;
, Your entire body needs to have life to it. Think of a dancer -- not a single part of her body isn't engaged while she's dancing, even if she's standing in position. No part of you should be a limp noodle!


Start by engaging your core (this will help suck you in, too) and then engage your limbs. ""Strong"" doesn't mean aggressive or masculine in this context -- it just means with conviction or with energy. You want to convey a feeling through the camera, after all!

, For a more interesting shot, make sure that you're doing something different with each side of your body. You can be dramatic and do something totally different with each of your limbs and tilt your head to the side, if it matches the feel of the shoot. Being asymmetrical can be as simple as dipping one shoulder or hip, making sure that your arms are at different heights, or bending one leg a little (or a lot) more than the other.


Remember: You're part of a picture. This photo isn't about how gosh dang pretty you are -- it's about the aestheticism of the photo. Even with the best make-up and hair in the world, if you don't create pleasing angles, the photo won't be as stellar as it could be.

, Looking at the camera straight on can work in some dramatic shots, but generally it's better to put your face at an angle, and look at the camera from that angle. Tilt your nose a little up or down, a little left or right, but keep your gaze on that camera.


Learn which angles flatter your face the most. Do you have a great jawline? Tilt your head up and to the side a little. Experiment in front of a mirror or with your own camera to see which angles make the most interesting shots on your face.
Know which direction the light is coming from. Remember that light will cast shadows, and even if they are slight, they will affect the appearance of your face. If light is coming from the top, tilting your nose down may cause your browbone to cast a shadow over your eyes, which is good if you're going for a sinister shot, but not good if you're trying to look friendly.

, While an interesting shot can be had by looking at the camera, you have many more options if you look elsewhere. What's going on over there? Is she staring in the mirror? Does she see a leprechaun? Is she talking to the Queen of England? Everyone will want to know.


Be careful of the clichéd, staring-off-into-the-distance look. At best you'll look existential and at worse you'll look like you're trying to be existential by staring off into the distance. Use this gaze minimally.

, Kinda like the last tip just eluded to, quartering out will make you look as slim as possible. Is she facing forward? Is she facing to the side? Just how wide is her waist? NO ONE WILL KNOW. Stick to a 3/4 angle to appear the slimmest.


Going head-on into anything will make you the most vulnerable and exposed (that goes for real life, too!). If you quarter out, which side is your good side? Emphasize that one to get the best photo.

, Possibly the most awkward part of modeling is knowing what to do with your hands. They're just there hanging awkwardly. If you stay engaged head to toe, though, hopefully you'll find poses that feel right, that make sense. The only thing you should not do, is put them around your face. Hello, bad 1980s glamour shot!


A good rule of thumb is to show the side of your hand. This creates the longest, thinnest line extending from your arm. It also avoids the are-my-hands-aging fear and the do-my-palms-look-funny worry.

Research agencies in the area you want to model in.,
Find out what each agency wants.,
Get some photos prepared.,
Prepare a cover letter and, if you have enough past experience, a brief resume.,
Submit to the agency but make sure you do this the right way.,
Prepare for your interview if you get one.,
Know how to accept rejection.",How to Apply to Modeling Agencies," You can do this by checking through your phone book or using an internet search engine.;
, Lots of agencies today now have websites but there are others who you may have to call in order to find out what they want. Look into the types of models they represent. Look into any requirements they suggest. Find out what photos they want.

, Unless they stated otherwise, agencies will want to see the minimum of one head shot and one body shot. Whilst you do not have to have these done professionally, it does help to have some taken especially for the purpose of sending them off to agencies. If you cannot afford or do not want to have photos taken professionally, have a friend take some pictures of you or use a passport photo booth for the head shot.

, The cover letter should make a note of your vital statistics (as in height, dress size, bust, waist and hip measurements for girls, inside leg measurement if you know it and shoe size) and explain, briefly, why you want to be a model and why you think you have what it takes. Your resume should include things like past modeling work, past acting work and any drama/dance training you have had in the past.

, A lot of agencies will now accept e-mail submissions but do check with them beforehand that they do so. You may be better off with regular mail anyway- agencies receive a lot of junk email and some admit to losing new model applications due to cluttered inboxes!!

, Practice your photo face in front of a mirror, practice your walk and flick through magazines to get some idea of how models pose.

, If you have waited a month and still not heard anything, you can safely assume your application has not been successful. If nobody has accepted you, repeat the process. The majority of agencies do not mind you re-applying (in fact, a lot of agents probably have forgotten your first application with in five minutes of decided to reject it!) provided you wait a decent period of time between applications. Read the agency's website to see if it mentions anything about re-applying. If it doesn't, wait at least six months. However, don't make the same mistakes over. Change your look. Tone up. Get professional photographs done. Freelance for some experience in-between applications. Apply to different agencies. Re-work your cover letter. Apply by mail instead of e-mail. Whatever you think may have held you back last time, change it this time!

Have the ""perfect smile"".,
Create an intensity.,
Be tasteful.,
Mix it up constantly.,
Hide your flaws.,
Practice.,
Study.",How to Pose Like a Model2," There is an art to posing with a perfect smile and most good models know how to do this naturally. It is a smile that is halfway between the biggest smile you can make and no smile at all. The lips are slightly parted and only the upper teeth are showing. The smile is considered a ""gentle smile."" The result should look pleasant and relaxed.


Generally, smiling will lift the cheeks and narrow the eyes. So, try to relax your eyes so that they are opened and the whites are showing. This may take some practice in front of a mirror to isolate the different muscle groups; however, it will be worth the effort. Whether you are a model or someone just looking to improve your portraits, mastering the perfect smile can make major improvements to your shots.

, Being a deer in headlights or just plain looking bored as hell is not an interesting statement on non-conformity, a new take on the materialism of the fashion industry, or at all endearing. It's just awkward. When your image is captured, you have to feel something the camera can catch. It'll depend on the shoot, but whatever it is, create it. Feel it. Reek of emotion.


The only non-abstract way to put this is to use your eyes. It's super easy to smile with only your mouth or do a pose with your body and forget that your face doesn't match. If you're unsure what you should be feeling, how is your body cuing you? Are you strong and confident? Are you happy and carefree? As Tyra says, ""Smize!""Translation: smile with your eyes.

, In some of the clothes you'll be put in, it's gonna be easy to feel like, well, a French whore. Regardless of what you're wearing (in most circumstances), it's best not to look...what's the polite way to put it...skank-o-riffic.


A good model should be about sophistication and class. Even if you're in a teeny bikini, unless you're doing that kind of shoot, think casually. Your body will emphasize your sexiness enough -- your face and pose don't have to, also.

, You should be changing poses roughly every three seconds. A photographer will not want to waste time taking the same photo over and over and over. Even if you're unsure that you look good, go for it! You'll get a jillion options to choose from when you're done -- some of them are bound to look great.


Feel free to go a little crazy. If your poses are unique, you'll be memorable. Keep the techniques you know (working in angles, etc.), but switch them up with minute variations. And a little can go a long way.

, Everybody has 'em. Even size 000, 7 ft tall Dutch models have 'em. Odds are you're aware of them, too! The good news is that there is surely a way to hide them (not that they're not wonderful -- just not ideal for the camera).If you put your hands on your hips, it'll create the illusion of a smaller waist. The holes between your arms and body create a background that removes emphasis from that area. Do this in real life, too!
Keep your chin up to reduce your forehead. (The opposite goes for big chins!) Not only will keeping your chin appear strong and hide your forehead, but it'll also elongate your neck.
Turn a knee in to get slimmer hips. Oh, that elusive thigh gap that most women don't have. But if you turn your knee in, it'll help you get there. And your hips will look smaller!
If you turn your body to the side, but square your shoulders, your hips will look a lot smaller. It's like you're facing forward, but you only get the majority of your hips.

, Get a digital camera, set up a tripod, and take thousands of shots. Since viewing the shots on your computer screen costs nothing, there's really no excuse not to practice. You should know which poses work for you and which don't. .


Learn which poses flatter which parts of your body. Become familiar with which poses work with various types of clothing; some poses emphasize the clean lines of a power suit, while others emphasize the flow of a gown. Practice with props like a chair, or holding objects (a vase, a rope, a beach ball, whatever - be creative!). You never know what you'll be asked to do!

, Look at magazines and brochures with a critical eye. Make note of how the model is posing: What is she doing with her hands, limbs, head, eyes, lips? What emotion does the pose convey?


Find your favorite model and analyze her. How does she walk? How does she hold herself in general? What are her go-to poses? While you don't want to be a mimicry, do pay attention to her habits to get you started.

"
"
Listen to your photographer.,
Breathe.,
Don't worry your look.,
Visualize a motivation or feeling.",How to Pose Like a Model3," A good photographer will offer feedback and hopefully be quite frank, telling you what to do so they can get the shot they want. Be cooperative and gracious (and graceful!). Don't allow yourself to get nervous, or else you will tense up and look stiff. Relax into each pose and connect with the camera.


Take into consideration the type of shoot you're doing. If it's fashion modeling, you'll probably be asked to take on those angular, avant-garde poses that look a little strange and forced. If it's commercial modeling, you'll want to look casual and everyday. Think a Jean Paul Gaultier ad versus an ad for Aveeno.

, Sometimes when we concentrate, or when we're nervous, we slow or speed up our breathing dramatically. You might even find yourself holding your breath for a shot. Remain conscious of your breathing; keep it normal and relaxed.


This step is super important. Your breathing can actually determine your mood, thus determining your poses. If you breathe quickly, that cues your body that you're ready for fight or flight -- imagine what you'll pose like when those thoughts are racing through your subconscious!

, Some designers have pretty ridiculous visions that may leave you thinking something along the lines of, ""I look like Lucille Ball just rolled out of bed and got attacked by a reindeer."" Well, that's what they were going for apparently, so you've no choice but to rock it. Put it aside. You're still you. You've still got it.


Remember how we said before that you are one part of an image? The photo is about you, sure, but it's also about the clothes you're wearing, the backdrop, and the feel of the photo. If you don't like your makeup, hair, or outfit, model through it. You've still got the smile, the poses, and the techniques.

, This may help you capture the emotion that you need for a shot. If the photographer is looking for a melancholic shot, for example, imagine a melancholic episode from your life. You may find that you're better able to channel your ""inner melancholia"" that way.


If visiting your own past hits a little too close to home, think of the plot of an applicable movie and put yourself into the actress' shoes. The thought process should take over your face and body, creating an intensity for the photo.

Set your chin facing slightly down.,
Don’t smile, and keep your mouth closed in a natural position.,
Keep your eyes focused on something ahead of you.,
Stand up straight!,
Place one foot in front of the other and walk with long strides.,
Allow your arms to hang at your sides, and keep your hands relaxed.,
Practice walking with your heels on.,
Get a rhythm down, and keep it consistent with your step.,
Strike your pose.,
Walk like a predator down the catwalk.,
Strut with attitude down the catwalk like Naomi Campbell.,
Make your walk a march like Sasha Pivovarova.",How to Walk Like a Catwalk Model," Don’t hang or droop your head- act like you have the invisible string attached at the top of your head holding you up. Because you will be above the audience on the catwalk, keeping your chin facing slightly down will let the audience see more of your face. Additionally, keeping your chin slightly tilted down will add angle to your face and will help lend you a little bit of attitude. , You don't want to distract from the clothes you are wearing with a smile. Look in the mirror and try to hold your mouth naturally to see how it looks and feels. Ask someone else how your facial expressions look. Sometimes other people will be able to see things that you don’t notice.


For example, ask your friend “Do I look fierce?”.
If your lips slightly part naturally, you don’t have to force your lips closed.

, When it comes to making a good supermodel facial expression, the emphasis in the facial expression is on the eyes and eyebrows. Keep your eyes fixed on a point, and do not look around you. Stay concentrated on where you are going, and look alert and at attention. Focus on something that gives you purpose, and it will show in your eyes.


It may be tempting to make eye contact with someone in the audience; however, hold your facial expression, and avoid eye contact.
Be careful not to trip as you are walking. You should occasionally check your walk with your eyes only to keep yourself balanced and confident in your walk.
Use a mirror or a friend to double-check how your look is coming across. Keep trying with different looks until you find one that works as a supermodel look while feeling natural for you.

, Imagine that there is an invisible string holding you up from your spine to the top of your head. Keep your shoulders slightly back, and stand up as straight as you possibly can. This posture is what is going to sell the model presence the most, even if you are not actually tall like a model. Keep your body loose while you stand tall. You do not have to hold your body stiff in order to stay tall. Practice appearing comfortable while walking tall by practicing in front of a mirror. , Imagine that you are walking on a rope by keeping one foot in front of the other walk, which will allow your hips to swing from side to side in that classic model way. As you strut forward, try to project confidence with your walk. If you are doing male style modeling, you do not have to place one foot directly in front of the other, instead, you can walk more naturally with your feet placed more side by side than one foot in front of the other. Don’t go overboard with swinging your hips. You don’t have to be afraid of letting your hips move; however, do not exaggerate the motion intentionally., You do not need to swing your arms quite as much as your body will naturally. Let your arms hang and swing only slightly. This will make you look cool and composed as you walk down the catwalk. Likewise, keep your hands relaxed so that they are loosely cupped and slightly open. Also, don’t hold your fingers together too closely. There can be a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of space between your fingers. Don’t make your arms too stiff, let them bend and sway slightly with your body.
Try not to move your hands too much or ball them up as this will make you appear nervous.

, No catwalk strut is complete without a tall pair of heels to give you height. But, if you are not practiced in walking in high heels it can take some getting used to. Put on your heels in the morning while you are getting ready. Strut around to get used to walking like a model and walking in high heels at the same time., Listen to music with a strong beat that has an attitude that you like while you are practicing strutting with your heels on. Try to concentrate on the attitude that you want to project, and sustain that look for as long as you can while walking. If you can put a rhythm and attitude in your step, your walk will come to life and exude a fantastic supermodel energy.Think flirty and confident as you step to a rhythm.
When you are on the catwalk, imagine the music that puts you in your groove and follow that groove.
While you are stepping to the beat, remember to keep your shoulders back and body composed in the posture of a supermodel.

, Once you get to the end of the walk, wait a beat, and then lean onto one hip with all of your confidence and poise. You can look down at the audience now and break your focus for a moment. You don’t have to move your head much- your look should come mostly from the eyes.Then compose yourself in the same facial expression and walk as before, and walk off stage.


Practice your pose in the mirror. Be especially aware of how long you break to pose and make eye contact with your audience. When you are in front of an audience your nervousness can make a few seconds seem much longer. Get used to holding your pose for a couple of seconds in the mirror so that you have muscle memory to rely on in front of the audience.

, There are a few signature supermodel walks and Karlie Kloss' has one that is famous for its predator like style .Make your walk down the runway more swift by quickly bringing your knees up slightly more than normal and keeping one foot in front of the other. This should create a jaunty step in your walk. Put more swing in your hips because your walk is faster. Your arms will also swing from side to side more. Gently move your head back and forth with the movement of your body as you strut down the catwalk.

, Pump your legs up and down in deliberate steps down the catwalk with determination and attitude. Let your body bounce up and down as you walk. Your shoulders will move slightly up and down as you walk. Because you have more motion, you will swing your hips more. Let your hands bounce and fling back and forth however they naturally move with your walk. Keep your head ever so slightly tilted to one side and only slightly moving with your shoulders as your walk. , With this walk your arms are almost still at your sides as you walk. With this walk, your feet do not go quite as much one in front of the other as the traditional catwalk strut instead they stay more side by side. Gently stomp your way down the walkway, but keep your body mostly still and composed. Do not move your head much or arms much. Think calm and determined as you walk."

Sites such as Craigslist, and Model Mayhem, cater to your needs. Be careful of scams though. If you are a minor, you must bring a parent/ guardian with you.

, Send a zed card and cover sheet to each one. Wait for responses and take meetings with potential agents. Sign when you find someone that wants you and you feel comfortable with. Offer your services free in exchange for prints for your portfolio. If no agency will represent you, pay a visit to a local attorney. They may be happy to help you negotiate contracts as a non agency represented model. They will however charge an up front fee.

, This will allow you to see the standards of modeling and may acquire you some handy hints. Plus learn about fashion. So you can be prepared better safe than sorry.

Know the look.,
Eat correctly.,
Dress well.,
Do your hair and makeup.,
Establish a skincare routine.,
Live like you own the world and everybody else is just living in it.",How to Act Like a High Fashion Model," Will you go for the sexy Barbie-doll looks of Candice Swanepoel, Adriana Lima, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley? The striking noticable looks of Karlie Kloss and Magdalena Frackowiak? The eccentric bad-girl looks of Abbey Lee Kershaw or Joan Smalls? The blushing cutie-pie looks of Miranda Kerr and Barbara Palvin? The classic beauty of Ming Xi or Clair Westenberg? Or even the cheeky tomboy looks of Cara Delevingne and Behati Prinsloo? The list is honestly endless, and it never hurts to brush up on your knowledge of high fashion or even just some models - you know those glossy thick $9 magazines you see in bookstores? i-D, Dazed and Confused, V Magazine, Wonderland, Jalouse, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, W Magazine... Pick one up and leaf through it! They're usually packed with editorials featuring high fashion or unknown models. It will give you a good stepping stone to work from.;
, High fashion models are typically 5'8/5'9+ (with few exceptions) and have measurements of around 33 inches (B/C cup), 24 inches, and 34 inches. They usually weight around eight stone. Your hips are generally required to be around 10 inches or so wider than your waist, and you have to have small breasts. They often have long, straight hair, or hair cut into a neat, contemporary, modern style (such as a bob, very short fringe, or even cropped!), 100% clear and smooth skin, tweezed eyebrows, and a facial or bodily trademark - high cheekbones, a strong jawline, piercing eyes, pouty lips, or even something such as a gap tooth. If you consider something a flaw, chances are it would be considered a trademark in the modelling industry.


Establish a workout program. The workout program you pick will have to fit in with your ideal look - the Victoria's Secret models favour pilates, cardio, running, spinning, or yoga, which is often a wraparound workout for all models. Find something you enjoy (for me personally, it is running, yoga, and spinning) and stick to it! If you're in school or don't have a lot of free time, try to be as active as possible (swapping the car to walk, or the elevator for stairs) and workout on the weekends. Eventually, your body will start to firm and tone, and you will be on your way!

, This cannot be stressed enough. You can really eat anything, as long as it's in moderation. For instance, you'd be no healthier eating six salads a day and one candy bar than you would be eating six candy bars and one salad! Carbs are required to grow, especially if you're a teenager, so don't be afraid of sugary foods! East Asian food is often healthy and yummy - try sushi, miso soup, or spicy tuna rolls. Most models eat a diet of:


Breakfast: Avacado on toast, yoghurt, granola, eggs, fruit, oatmeal, lean protein. Coffee, milk, and juice are good to drink, as well as green tea of fruit tea! Coconut water is a BIG favourite, as well as vitamin water.
Lunch: Green smoothies, salad topped with chicken or turkey, fish (such as tuna or salmon) and lean meat.
Dinner: Steamed vegetables (zucchini, spinach, cauliflower, broccoli, and asparagus are all favourites) with fish, chicken or turkey. You can have some fries or brown rice (the healthier option!) with your dinner. Miranda Kerr favours sweet potatoes.
Snacks/Dessert: Nuts, edamame beans, raisins, fruit, dark chocolate, or oatmeal cookies/flapjacks are all good!

, High fashion models are known as high fashion models for a reason - they KNOW how to wear clothes. It's all about finding what works for you personally. Make sure you look clean and well-presented - you can make a dumb t-shirt and baggy jeans rock if you wear them with confidence! Try wearing:


Skinny jeans or jeggings with a black or white t-shirt and some heels or boots, such as Behati Prinsloo and Candice Swanepoel (http://40.media.tumblr.com/471b21c6f3f09bb1f9fec82b2aa17969/tumblr_mgonqvWEN11s1dwk9o1_500.jpg)
A thigh-length jacket with a black dress or black shirt, black tights and black shoes, such as Abbey Lee Kershaw (https://lovethyhunter.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/abbey-lee-kershaw-street-style-8.jpg)
A white vest, black jeans and boots, a statement accessory, and dramatic eye makeup like Cara Delevigne (http://images-ff.asos-media.com/shmotterstorage/169763/large_092159eb-613e-424f-98fa-6e28986d6a89.jpeg)
Or co-ordinate colours like Jourdan Dunn (http://40.media.tumblr.com/e9dcc0193cd42bce6dd97000c6c62dbf/tumblr_msjnpyn2Cf1qai0bqo6_1280.jpg)

, For hair, simply use a shampoo and conditioner that is suitable for your hair type, and make sure to not damage it via heat styling - models have clean and healthy hair. Backcombing your hair is a popular hairstyle for the runway as it allows your face and features to be seen clearly. Don't wash your hair everyday as it will strip it of its natural oils - try investing in some coconut oil or argan oil if you have to wash your hair regularly. Most HF models have perfected the makeup/no makeup trend to a T. Apply all your makeup gently, as if your skin was made of china. Make sure your face is clean and moisturised - if you fly on planes a lot, consider bringing some rosewater spray (the moisture in the air will be lost the higher you go.) ALWAYS remove your makeup at the end of the day! Try out:


A very light liquid foundation and concealer. Contouring is done to models, but only very lightly as to make their features pop for runway or editorials. If you have prominent cheekbones, this will not be an issue.
A coat or two of black or brown mascara to make your lashes stand out if you're pale.
Tinted lipbalm or Vaseline.
A cream blusher to make you look as if you're alive!

, This is one of the most important steps. Models are human - they do get pimples and blemishes like the rest of us - but overall their skin is healthy and clear.


Use a exfoliater, cleaner, toner, and moisturiser suitable for your skin type. Visit your dermatologist or local beauty store to ask about what type is right for your skin type (you will either be oily, dry, combination, or normal.)
Use mud masks, steam facials, and pore cleansing strips to rip out any dirt! Dirt trapped in your pores can cause blackheads and other nasty pimples on your face.
Care for your whole body, too. If you have scaly or bumpy skin, use an exfoliater and body lotion. If you have body hair where you don't particularly want it, shave it off! HF models have the freedom to fit any kind of criteria they want in regards to body hair - shave stars and hearts down there if you really want to. Remember, high fashion is about making people go ""wow!""
If a product isn't working for you, try a different one. Most store-brand products won't work as they cater to all skin types and are often filled with harmful chemicals, so try a brand name instead.

, This doesn't mean that you have to turn into a stuck-up prissy person who is catty and rude to everybody, but to live with confidence and a pleasant demeanour. In the words of Miranda Kerr, ""I guess I'm just an open-hearted, fair, good person. I try to encourage people to be their best and look inside themselves and find out what they are passionate about and expand on that and enjoy life.""

In this vibrant industry where trends are constantly changing and new customers are always emerging, the key to beginning a career in beauty is to pinpoint where in the market you can find a place for your talent. The Beauty industry can be broadly divided into two parts:


Products. This includes cosmetics, Skincare, and fragrances.
Services. This includes beauty treatments, massages, tanning, manicures, etc.;
, Not all careers in the beauty industry are the same, or require the same kind of training and skills. Before you move forward, decide where you want to express your particular talent. Ask yourself:


Do you want to work hands-on with people?
Do you want to work with product management?
Do you want to use the Internet to reach your audience?
Do you want to create new styles and trends?

, Before you begin your career as a beauty expert, it is necessary that you gain the skills to do so. The majority of careers in the beauty industry require some kind of vocational training or schooling.


Some careers also require an undergraduate degree. These are often business related careers of the industry, which focus on sales, marketing, and product management.
Some careers in beauty require no more than personal experience and natural talent. If you strive to pursue your career as an Internet Blogger or Youtuber, additional training, while helpful, may not be necessary.

, It takes about two years of training and study to complete most beauty school programs. Because there are so many beauty schools out there, it's essential to pick the right school for you. Some schools receive approval by professional beauty organizations, offering their graduates a qualification that is more widely accepted.Here is a list of professional beauty organizations that approve curriculum at beauty schools all over the world:


CIDESCO (Comite International d'Esthetiques et de Cosmetologie)This world wide organization has a qualification that is accepted in 35 countries, where all its schools work by the same syllabus.
CIBTAC (Confederation of International Beauty Therapy and Cosmetology)This is the examining body of the British Association of Beauty Therapy and Cosmetology (BABTAC). All schools work to the same syllabus.
ITEC (International Therapy Examination Council)VTCT (Vocational Training Charitable Trust), In this millennium, the Beauty Industry moves fast, and the Internet moves even faster. Learn the ins and outs of the major social media platforms including Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, etc.


Even if you don’t plan to use a major Internet platform like YouTube or Facebook as your workplace, knowing your way around social media can bring you great advantages as a beauty expert. Learn what you can about these platforms and how to use them, you will need to post your work online later.

, Work experience in a beauty salon, or working as a Sales Assistant in a makeup store or retail store can provide valuable experience and a huge advantage for breaking into the industry.


Get a job at a health spa. Health spas have become increasingly popular in a beauty industry and typically do very well. This type of entry-level job offers you training in a hands-on beauty environment.
Most spas are looking to employ qualified beauticians, personal trainers and holistic treatment specialists, but will often hire recent beauty school graduates for shampooing, hairstyling, and nail care.

, Beyond having a great resume and reputable school with great references from the instructors, your professional portfolio will catch the eye of potential employers, setting you apart from your competitors. When you’re just starting out, your experience will be limited, this is okay. Include:


Your training and experience in school. This section can make up for the lack of experience you may have by demonstrating to employers that you have the commitments and professionalism to complete a training course in beauty.
A Cover Letter. Take this opportunity to introduce yourself, highlight key aspects of your resume, and explain your passion for becoming a beauty professional.
Photos. Include clear, sharp, and well-lit images illustrating your skill and style.
Your resume: Your resume should include details of your background, experience, skills and qualifications in one well laid-out document. Make sure it is free of spelling and grammatical errors.
Your License. One of the first things employers will check for is whether you are licensed, so if you have a license, include it!
Client testimonials. As you build your experience in the industry, you may want to ask happy clients to write a brief statement about their experience working with you. Also, include completed service checklists to show employers you are serious about giving clients a professional and complete service every time.
A Letter of recommendation. Ask instructors or stylists and professionals who are familiar with your work.

, Create a website or space in the Internet where you can display your portfolio. This will give potential employers an easy professional way to see your work. Be consistent with your designs and keep your online portfolio updated with the best new project.


There are several online services you can use to create a portfolio including Dunkedand Carbonmade., Working in this type of career, you will provide a wide range of beauty services to clients, including facials and body treatments. A Beauty Therapist's work involves the following tasks:


Carrying out skin analysis and giving advice about skin and body care.
Performing facial or body massage and figure analysis.
Giving advice on exercise programs and nutrition.
Using a variety of treatments and products to treat skin and body conditions.

, Use your artistic talent to create makeup and prosthetics for television, film, and runways. In some cases, the title of Make-up Artist can also include the responsibilities of hair and wig design as well.


Television and film are constantly looking for top-notch beauty experts and often pay quite well for their services.
As a make-up artist, the subject and application will vary a lot. This job requires flexibility.
Many make-up artists are self-employed.

, Image consultants are specialists who combine all aspects of fashion, beauty, and hair care into a single profession. Provide advice and expertise on public image.


Many Image consultants are self-employed, but there are also opportunities to represent an agency, or production company.

, Sales Reps travel on behalf of their brand or company to visit salons and educate their fellow colleagues on how to properly use their products. The job of the sales rep is to know everything there is to know about the product line and be passionate enough to get other people excited about it.

, A job like this requires natural charisma and top-notch tech skills. YouTube is one of the biggest platforms for internet blogging. Before you begin posting videos, think about what kinds of videos get the most attention and outline a business model for yourself.


Get the necessary equipment and learn how to use it. You will need a recording device, a space to work, and adequate lighting. It is recommended that you invest in a good quality camera and make sure your video quality is good.
Prepare your material. Once you have all the gadgets in place to record your first Video blog, make sure you know what to say and don’t be shy. Try recording tutorials for practice and make necessary adjustments to your banter, explanations, and demonstrations as necessary.
Edit your videos.
Think about what kinds of videos get the most hits.
Interact with your followers.

Give the client what she wants when possible.",How to Be a Hairdresser," Different places have different requirements. If you have to get a license, you will most likely need to have a high school diploma or a GED, along with graduation from an accredited cosmetology school.


All U.S. states require hairdressers to have a cosmetology license.;
, There, you will learn everything from basic hair-cutting to more complex styling and hair-coloring treatments. Be sure to read the requirements of your state or country before choosing your cosmetology school. For example, many states in the United States require a certificate from the National Accrediting Commission Of Cosmetology Arts and Sciences (NACCAS)


Consider taking some classes on other beauty-related subjects, such as makeup and doing manicures.

, The cosmetology exam usually has two components: a written, multiple-choice exam and a performance exam in which you can demonstrate your hair-styling skills to an evaluator. You can study for the exam through books, online study programs or software-based study guides. A good way to practice for your physical exam is by giving haircuts to your friends and family.

, This position is often a paid six-month or yearlong position at a salon, where you will be trained by hairdressers. There, you can practice the techniques you're learning from your cosmetology-school textbooks.

, The exam usually takes place at a state-assigned testing center. Once you've passed the exam, you will likely become a strong candidate for open positions at many salons.

, The best time to do this is while you are getting your hair cut, so that you don't distract your hairdresser from other clients. You can also try to set up a meeting with your hairstylist on a time and day when both of your are free. Be sure bring a pad of paper, something to write with, and questions you want to ask. Here are some ideas:


Did you have to take any special classes? If so, where?
Did you have to get a license? What can I do to prepare for it?
How long/how much did everything cost?
Is there anything you can advise me on?

, Make sure that you have a neat, clean appearance. A pair of black slacks and a black shirt will look the most formal. Consider getting your nails done, and go easy on the makeup. Be sure that your hair is done as well. You are, after all, applying for a job that deals with making hair look great.

, Potential clients will have troubles trusting your abilities if they see that you have messy, unkempt, or damaged hair. They may assume that you do not know how to take care of hair and may hesitate entrusting their precious locks to your hands. You do not need to style it extensively every single day—just make sure that it looks clean and healthy.

, This is a great way to get experience and will help prevent you from falling into the ""you need experience to get a job, but you need a job to get experience"" spiral. The internship may even lead to a job offer, depending on your performance, how much they like working with you, and whether or not you have finished your education.

, The hair salon can only do so much when it comes to getting clients for you. Even if someone does walk into the salon, he or she may not pick you as their stylist. By using social media, however, you can tell more people about yourself and your work, and thus get more clients that way. Here are some ideas:


Consider creating a Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or Pintrest account. Use these to post photos of your work, and mention any specials you might have going.
Create a website or blog, and use it to tell people about yourself and your work. You can post your work address and prices, along with some photos of your hair cuts.
Encourage satisfied clients to visit your sites and post feedback.

, You may be a talented hairdresser, but making certain mistakes can cause you to lose clients. Many hairdressers rely on returning clients. When you get a new client, you want to give her a pleasant experience so that she will return to you the next time she needs her hair cut. This section will offer you some guidelines on how to keep your clients, as well as how to make first-time clients into life-time clients.

, This might mean that you will have to go back to school and take some classes to learn new, specific techniques that were not in fashion or even available when you first went to cosmetology school.

, Not everyone likes chatting while getting their haircut, but many people do. When striking up a conversation with your client, listen to her replies. If her replies are short and terse, she may not like the subject or she may not feel like talking. Consider changing the subject a few times. Great conversation topics include school, work, friends, hobbies, and weekend plans.


Ask more questions about your client instead of talking about yourself.
Be sure to face your client and avoid talking to her through the mirror; this will help build the trust between you and your client.

, Do not insult your client about the state of her hair, and always ask her before touching her hair. She may be at the salon to get her hair touched, cut, styled, or dyed, but asking her something like ""May I see your hair?"" will help her prepare mentally and emotionally for this.

, You will be close to your client for long periods of time. A strong perfume or body odor can be off-putting and deter your client from returning to you. Be sure that you shower every day and wear deodorant. If you tend to get sweaty throughout the day, consider bringing a fresh shirt to change into.

, Not only is this important for hygienic reasons, but your clients will also appreciate it. A messy counter implies that you are messy in other tasks as well, including haircuts. Make sure that your tools are very clean and that there is no leftover hair or product them. The seats, aprons, and the floor should also be clean.

, Not only is this good customer service, but it shows your clients that you really do care about them and that they can rely on you. Do not act upset or annoyed when a client changes her appointment. Smile, even if you are talking on the phone; it will make you both sound and look friendlier.

, Don't do anything you think might look good if she doesn't want it. If the client really wants something that you know will be a mistake and look awful, try to suggest something else. Be sure to start with the smallest suggestions first, instead of the larger ones. For example:


If a client really, really wants straight-cut bangs, but she has thick, curly hair, ask her how she'd feel about you thinning the bangs slightly and explain that they would still look straight, but that they will have less body.

Establish some basic rules.,
In order to perform and enjoy the lap dance you must feel comfortable with your body.,
Choose an outfit that makes you feel hot and sexy and the rest will follow.,
Select 2 or 3 sensual songs that you both enjoy.,
Don't feel pressured to start at the beginning of the song.,
By setting aside a selection of 2 or 3 songs, you won't feel pressured to rush because the song is coming to an end.,
For beginners, you may want to start out by taking your time, work your way into a seductive groove.,
Seduce your lover with passionate looks.,
Add a few accessories to your dance routine, items that you enjoy playing with.,
Create the perfect atmosphere.,
Clear the space where you’ll be dancing so you don’t bump into anything.,
Send him a seductive text message or e-mail with a cryptic clue of what’s to come later in the evening.,

If you’re feeling a little bit naughty and cruel, move back towards him like you’re about to take him with all the passion you can muster but instead lean over him, kiss him on the cheek, move back and gracefully put your clothes back on.,
Try it a few times with different outfits, routines and music and you’ll soon become an expert in the sexiest dance of all.,
At the end you should take off all of your clothes and tell him that your body is his for a set amount of time.,
Sex is always an option after the lap dance.",How to Perform a Lap Dance for Your Boyfriend or Husband,"


At no point during your entire performance is your partner allowed to touch you. You can touch, lick, rub and caress him all you want but play it cool. A slow seduction is a sure recipe for lap dancing success. The whole point of a lap dance is to drive your partner crazy with anticipation and desire.
You are in charge. Take your time, take control, and take pleasure in teasing them.
If they reach out in your direction or starts to grind back, slap their wrist and let them know that if they do it again, the dance is over, no exceptions.;
, You won’t look sexy if you don’t feel sexy. Accept and enjoy yourself regardless of your shape or size. Any woman can perform a great striptease or lap dance regardless of whether they’re shy or feel their body is not the ""perfect shape"". It’s all about attitude. Not all lap dancers have supermodel figures, they just behave like they do. This is your time to be seductive, to nurture and release your sensual spirit. Drop your inhibitions and throw caution to the wind. You are a sexy goddess.

, There’s a wide variety to choose from. From erotic dance-wear to bras, panties, garter-belts, stockings, chemises, robes, teddies, swimsuits, club-wear, fetish-wear, over-sized button-up shirts and so much more. The key is to build up a collection of layers that are easy to remove. Be daring, you’re performing a tease, so a bit of flesh is essential.


Start by selecting underwear first as these items will be the last to come off. A sexy bra, g-string, stockings (stay-ups are easier to work with) and perhaps suspenders.
Panties should frame your cheeks while the back of your panties should reach too high over your cheeks. Try full bottomed panties, thongs, g-strings and booty shorts to see which works best for you. Panties that leave lines on your body after you take them off are probably too tight and should be avoided.
Thigh high stockings worn with or without garters are a sexy addition to almost any outfit. Try a pair that’s one size smaller for sexier movement. If you plan to keep your stockings and garter on for the duration of your dance, wear your panties on the outside of the straps so that they can be removed without having to unhook your garters.
For the top layers, try little hot pants, an innocent sheer robe, sexy high-school teacher/student uniform, be a dominatrix, a desperate housewife or for something different, a classic red or black evening dress with some retro lingerie underneath.
Avoid corsets or clothing that’s too tight and difficult to slip out of. Clothing with zips at the back or many straps that take time to put on will of course be difficult to remove.
For shoes, high heels and stilettos usually work best with any outfit. They make your legs look toned, sleek, and longer. Even if they’re slightly uncomfortable, give them a try because you won’t be wearing them for long anyway. If you can’t walk in heels, rather wear something you’re comfortable in. If all else fails in the shoe department, go barefoot and try the Barefoot Strut.
Remove as much as you are comfortable with. You may choose to end up totally nude, topless, in sexy lingerie, a lacy gown or remain fully clothed. Your lover however must remain fully clothed.
If your choose shoes with buckles, consider how you’ll remove your clothing without taking off your shoes. Stretchy clothing or flowing dresses can be taken off over your shoes, but check first. If all else fails in the shoe department, the bare-foot stripper strut (on your tip toes) is also very hot.
If you’re doing it in heels, don’t take them off (except to remove stockings - or better yet, keep your stockings on). Perhaps put the heels back on once the stockings are off. Strapless shoes can be removed more gracefully than shoes with straps or buckles.
If you chose something that needs to be removed by slipping it over your head, seductively slip it off by pulling it from the bottom on the sides while standing up tall, don't hunch over.
A shirt with buttons can be a very sexy item of clothing to remove. Play peek-a-boob with each side. When you’ve undone the last button, turn around posing at an angle, expose your one shoulder then the other and then let is slip down to the floor.
Tight trousers or jeans can be difficult to remove. A pencil skirt can easily be unzipped and pushed down Do this while bending forward with your back or side to him and then step out of it. Skirts can be removed with your shoes and stockings on.
Practice removing your stockings ahead of time. For extra balance (and teasing), place your toes between his legs or on the arm of his chair while you push each stocking down - or slowly roll or fold them down the length of your leg.
Don’t forget to tease. For beginners, take your time with each layer. Pull your skirt up or your underwear down a few inches before removing. Tuck a thumb or two into the sides of your trousers, skirt or underwear, lower the item of clothing slightly and tease.
Push your bra straps off your shoulders before turning away to unclasp. A classic stripper routine is to hold the bra against your breasts, turn around with your back towards your man and drop your bra on the floor or, when standing with your back to him, hold your bra by the straps above your head before dropping it onto the floor. Keep the heat up by keeping your arm and hand over your breasts then slowly turn around and slide your hand across and away from your breasts for a sexy reveal.
When taking your bottoms off, try slipping them off over your shoes or bare feet while standing straight-legged. Do this by bending over from the waist and guiding them off all the way to the floor and then stepping out of them. If this isn't easy for you, try bending your knees or taking your bottoms off while lying on your back. Don’t squat down too low…
Don’t get completely naked until the very end — and even then, tease him with a back view until he can’t take it anymore.

, Think smooth and seductive. Avoid songs with high pitched vocals. The crooners and divas of the 60s are a good place to start if you want something romantic. A sensual rhythm or beat will guide you through your dance. It's best if you can relate to the music and feel comfortable moving to its beat. Start by setting aside 2 or 3 songs.


Song one is for the warm-up. This is your time to lead your partner to the chair, strut about, pose, explain the rules to your lover and begin to slowly ease into your seductive performance.

, Take your time, start when you're ready, walk around your lover, touch him, drag your fingers through his hair and feel the beat.

, You’re free to decide, short ‘n sweet or long & languishing. You'll probably find yourself deep in the throes of passion by the end of it so consider choosing a dozen songs and enjoy the fun at the end.


If possible, burn all the songs onto a CD or set them as a play-list on your portable music player. Don’t stop to change CDs.

, Close your eyes, feel the music, enter the trance and begin to sway.


Try setting aside 30 minutes or so a day before to get familiar with your clothes, your body, the poses and the moves. Dance on your feet and on the floor. These may be things you’ve never done before. Try sliding down a wall and then back up. Walk around on the tips of your toes.
On the floor, try opening and closing your legs or leaning your knees from one side to the other. Experiment with different angles. Sit on a chair. Caress your thighs, your neck, your belly your feet. Close your legs and then open them using your hands to part your thighs. Re-discover your body. Close your eyes if you’re shy.
If you feel uncomfortable ‘dancing’ think of your performance as a slow aerobics session. Stretch, bend, split. Use your hands, stretch them out to the sides, and stroke your outstretched arm with the tips of your fingers. If you’ve practiced martial arts, yoga or Pilates, modify the posses that you’re familiar with to create your very own sexy moves.
Think of your dance as a T'ai Chi session at the gym. Slow movements and a general sense of well-being.

, Your expression will reflect those sexy thoughts you have in mind and intensify the sexual tension in the air. Look at your body, touch it, enjoy it and then look at your lover drawing his eyes to yours and to your body. Maintain eye contact at all times. If your back is turned to your partner, glance over your shoulder.

, You’re doing this for your pleasure too.


A blindfold will help keep your lover's senses alert - itching to know what will come next.
A pair of handcuffs or a silky scarf can be used to keep your lover’s hands down if he breaks the no touching rule.
Use a soft feather to brush up against your lover’s body or yours. Sit on a chair and while holding your body upright and tall, slide your feet and legs apart and slowly brush yourself from your neck to the inside of your thigh.
If you’re wearing a button up shirt, consider also wearing a tie. Loop it around his neck to pull him closer to your face or cleavage or tie his hands up with it if he breaks the no touching rule.
If you’re the kind of girl that likes to be naughty, have your favorite toy at hand for your pleasure and his torture.
Tease him with a shawl or a silky wrap or use it to cover up if you feel more comfortable being a little less exposed.
Use your hair. While standing up, kneeling, or sitting, stretch your torso while you pull your hair up and let it fall again. Use it to brush up against him.
Use an ice cube from your cocktail. Place a cube in your mouth and run it along your lover's body or brush it across your nipples to set them firm.
Your lips and your eyes are powerful seduction accessories. Try the classic pout or smile. Play with facial expressions.
With a bit of practice, a hat, scarf, cane or rider’s crop can be used in sexually seductive ways.

, Dim the lights, perfume the air and light some candles. Mix candlelight with floor lamps or fairy lights. candlelight adds a soft, warm glow to your body. Indirect lighting is both flattering and more intimate. Avoid fluorescent or white LED lights.


See that your room temperature is comfortable - feeling too cold or too hot will distract you.
Turn off all possible distractions – TV and mobile phones etc.

,


Check that the chair your lover will be sitting on can accommodate the both of you. Sit on it and imagine yourself in his position and then you on his lap.

, The invitation will set his mind alight and prolong the torture across an entire day. Alternatively, spring it on him as a surprise. Either way, you’ll need to spend a some time setting the scene and calming your nerves if it’s your first time.

, Have him sit with his legs closed. Start by staring him straight in the eye with a teasing smile on your face. Walk around your lover, touch him, drag your fingers through his hair and feel the beat. Strut about, pose, explain the rules to your lover and begin to slowly ease into your seductive performance.

, Run your fingers through your hair, down your neck, your chest then down to your hips and around your butt. As you move your hands across your body imagine your hands are his hands. Enjoy the touch of your (his) hands on your body. Keeping your hands in contact with your body let them ride up your sides and back towards the nape of your neck. Look him in the eye and try a slow and gentle head roll (head falls forward and then rolls back up), letting your hair fall at the same time.

, Move towards him so your crotch is almost against his knee then lean in like you're going to kiss him for just long enough that he can smell your perfume then pull away.

, Think sexy and feel sexy. Begin moving your hips to the music in a soft circular motion. Close your eyes for a few seconds and enjoy the moment. There's no-one around, just you and your lover. Take your time, then, slowly step towards your partner, one foot in front of the other, cat-walk style. When you're near enough, take your lap dance to the next level.

, Turn around and position yourself between your lover’s legs. Bend down to sit on his lap and grind your bottom slowly (and gently) into his lap.

, Top first...Seductively and gradually remove another item or two of clothing (perhaps your skirt or hot-pants) then move back towards your partner again. Get so close you'll practically be sitting on your lover's lap. Sensually lean in towards your lover's ear breathing your hot breath over it, let out a soft aching moan. Softly nibble or brush against his neck, breathing your lover in as if you were getting high off their scent.

, Keep eye contact and keep caressing yourself from different angles and perspectives. Move into the crawl and then mount him again for another grinding session.

, Move away for brief moments. Remember that eye contact is very important. Let your eyes transmit all those sexy thoughts and don’t forget to smile.

, Then move on to another part of the house or go for a walk. You may have to run...

, The possibilities are endless and the results are always great.

, He will love that!

, Make sure to use condoms though!

Brand yourself.,
Have a strong opening line.,
Learn to hustle.,
Attract regulars.,
Cultivate relationships with the other staff.",How to Increase Your Stripper Income1," The only thing you’re selling in a strip club is yourself, so it’s important to make your product stand out. If a guy only has enough money for one dance, it’s important he chooses to spend that money on you and not another girl.Choose a name that reinforces your brand. If you’re marketing yourself as a sophisticated woman, try a name like Gigi or Isabel.
If you’re going for more of a girl next door vibe, try Nicole or Ashley.
Let your song choices reflect your brand image. You’ll make the majority of your money on the floor, but a compelling stage set can set you apart from other dancers.;
, Strippers generally approach the customers and most of the time, they lead with, “Wanna dance?” Set yourself apart from the crowd by having several go-to lines to start conversation and convince patrons they need to buy what you’re selling.Ask a customer if he minds letting you rest on him for a second because your heels are hurting your feet. This will make him feel chivalrous and can open the door to further conversation and possible dance opportunities.
Lead with a compliment. If you make your customer feel like the most important person you’ve ever met, they’ll be more likely to ask you to stick around., Strippers are, by definition, independent contractors, which means their take home pay is directly tied to their work output. The more dances and private room visits you can accumulate in a night, the more money you make.Set clear, achievable goals for yourself each night. Decide you want to work for a set number of hours and get four dances per hour.
Show up to work well rested and well fed. You won’t be able to focus if you’re tired and hungry.
Don’t hang out on the floor by yourself or with other strippers. If you don’t look busy and in-demand, your value on the floor decreases.

, If you want to increase your income, having regular clientele is a surefire way to do this. Attracting them, however, is far more difficult. Treat your clients like people: ask them about their days, their job and their hobbies. Connect with them on a personal level and they may take a liking to you.Regulars treat their favorite dancers better, but it goes both ways. If you have regular customers, offer them discounts to incentivize them to keep patronizing you.
Be careful not to blur the line between regular customer and something else. Keep your relationship respectful and chances are they’ll hang around a lot longer.

, Bartenders and wait staff have a clear view of the patrons, so they know who the big spenders are. Make friends with the wait staff and they might share tips with you about which customers to target.Make sure you show your appreciation at the end of the night by tipping your friends who helped you out.
Pay it forward among your fellow strippers. If a guy is looking for a specific type and that type isn’t you, refer him to a friend of yours. She may return the favor someday.

Invest in multiple outfits.,
Don’t let personal hygiene slide.,
Invest in top of the line stripper shoes.",How to Increase Your Stripper Income2," One of the most common misconceptions about stripping is that the clothes don’t matter, since most of them end up on the floor. In actuality, your outfits enhance your brand and set you apart from the other dancers on the floor.If you’re going for a “Young Girl” look, don’t overdo it. Pair a cute bikini with some clear open toed shoes and one young looking accessory, like hair clips.
If you’re going for the “Edgy Girl” look, keep it dark and keep it casual. A black romper with a chain link g-strip and some black heels is all you’ll need.
If you’re going for the “Lingerie Goddess” look, choose an expensive lace bra and underwear set. Keep the accessories minimal.
Have various outfits on hand each time you work. Sometimes, changing an outfit mid-shift is all it takes to go from broke to bank.

, Your body is your product and your income will reflect this. Get regular haircuts and blowouts. Pay for teeth whitening if necessary. If you hate shaving, invest in laser hair removal. Don’t skimp on anal bleaching. When the black lights are on, every part of you is under a microscope.Chipped nails are not acceptable and may result in you being sent home from work.
It is not a requirement that you get plastic surgery, especially if you aren’t comfortable doing so.

, Your shoes are one of your most important assets as you’ll spend most of your night on your feet. Spring for the most expensive and high quality pair – you’ll most likely make your money back in a single night.


Always wear shoes with straps, otherwise you risk your heels flying off and hitting someone in the face.Use a hairdryer to heat up the insides of your heels – this will help mold them to your feet.

"
Push the VIP room.,
Hit up different clubs.,
Go to Vegas.",How to Increase Your Stripper Income3," Some clubs have VIP rooms where customers pay upfront to spend time with the girl of their choice. VIP rooms are huge moneymakers – you know exactly how much you’ll be making upfront and depending on the guy, you may have to do very little work.Sometimes, all a guy wants to do in a VIP room is talk. If so, indulge him. The better the conversation, the longer he’ll stay and the more money you'll make.
If a patron ever tries anything in a VIP room that you aren’t comfortable with, you are fully within your rights to shut them down and get out.

, Stripping in the same clubs can be great – you can foster relationships with the club owners and build your client roster – but sometimes you need a change of scenery. Go on a road trip to a new city or state and try out the clubs in that area.Most strippers are able to pay for their travel using money they make on the road. Stripping is a profession that lends itself very well to a nomadic lifestyle.
Research conventions, major sporting events and festivals. Any time there are large numbers of men gathering, clubs hire additional strippers to staff their clubs and you have the opportunity to make a lot of money.

, If you’re already a successful stripper, making the move to Vegas is the next logical step in your career development. Vegas has the largest number of strip clubs per capita and is a prime destination for men looking for a good time.Vegas is also one of the most competitive markets for strippers, so if you’re going to make the move, prepare to hustle hard.
Be smart about your money. It’s very easy to blow your cash on cars and drugs, but you’ll burn out fast and end up with little to show for all your work.

Take a pole dancing class.,
Practice your dance moves.,
Take a business class.",How to Increase Your Stripper Income4," In recent years, pole dancing has become a legitimate sport, and classes are popping up everywhere. If you feel insecure about your pole work, take a class to learn some new tricks and brush up on some old techniques.In addition to being a useful skill-set, pole dancing also transforms your body and helps keep you in shape.
Most classes have specific dress codes, so make sure you check the website for the class you're taking.

, Most girls are able to catch on to club dancing fairly easily, but if you're insecure about moving your body in public, practice. Take a dance class or show up early to the club to run your moves in front of the mirror.If you don't feel like committing to a regular dance class regimen, try looking up dance moves on YouTube.
To increase your flexibility and agility, stretch your body every day while you're watching TV.

, Since strippers operate as independent contractors, a great deal of your income will come from selling customers on your services. In order to do this effectively, you need to learn how to upsell your customers and how to position your brand as the best brand in the club. Business classes can help you do this.Business classes will also give you a leg-up in effectively managing your income.
If you don't want to take a class in person, look for online options.

Understand where the money comes from.,

Begin by collecting your tips from stage dances.,

Supplement your money from stage dances, with money from private dances.,

Add your two sources together.",How to Predict the Amount of Money You Will Make as a Stripper or Exotic Dancer," The two main sources of money you’ll earn will come from (1) stage dances and (2) lap dances. The term lap dance, table dance, private dance, and personal dance can all be used interchangeably.
, Your first source of income will be from stage dances. This is the money you collect after you’ve performed on stage. You should try to collect tips from everyone sitting on and in very close proximity to your stage and who might have seen you dance. Because most dance sets are made up of two 3.5 minute long songs, the club will have approximately eight girls dancing per hour. Keep in mind that there is at least a 30 second interval between dancers, so there is a chance that only seven girls will go up on stage per hour/per stage. Depending on how many stages there are in your club, how many girls are on the rotation schedule, and how many customers there are, you’ll most likely make between $10 and $50 per stage show., Most lap dances are between $10 and $20 per dance, so the key to making a lot of money is to keep your customer buying dances from you once you’ve already got him in your chair. The best thing to do is make your lap dance the most seductive during the last 30 seconds. When you can hear the song starting to end, ask your customer if he wants you to continue. If you’ve done it right, he’ll want more!, Taking the money you make off stage dances and adding it to the money you can make by getting customers to buy lap dances from you, you can make between $80 and $100 an HOUR. Of course, this amount may vary… some nights you’ll make more and some nights you’ll make less, but this is the average you should expect."

Bring your money box on stage.,
Collect tips customers may have thrown on your stage.,
Bring the money you’ve just picked up off stage to your money box.,
Collect tips from customers sitting directly at your stage.,
Pay attention to who gives you what.,
Remove some of your tips.,
Collect tips from customers sitting around your stage.,
Store your money.",How to Successfully Collect Tips from Stage Dances As an Exotic Dancer," How you choose to store your money can vary, but the most common is to store it in a money box. A money box is usually a makeup box or some sort of plastic container with a handle. You want to avoid using a regular purse to store your money because it can easily blend into the dark lighting and it can look similar to a purse that a customer who is a woman might have brought in. When you bring this box on stage with you, make sure it is out of the reach of any customer sitting at your stage. You don’t want to have someone steal it during your show.;
, Gather up any dollar bills customers may have thrown on your stage while you were dancing. Doing this in a sexy manner can give customers a little extra incentive to tip you when you come by to collect individual tips.

, Once you’ve gathered tips customers may have thrown on stage, make sure you go to your money box before you continue collecting tips. Shove all your money in there without straightening or unfolding any bills… you can do this later.

, Once your set is over and you’ve put your clothes back on, put your garter on one of your thighs. Always start at one side of the stage and systematically go to each customer. Stick the leg with the garter on it out to the customer and with one hand hold the money you’ve already collected to one side of your thigh, and with the other pull the garter out so that the customer can place the money inside your garter. Always smile and say thank you to the customer for their tip.

, This is the time to evaluate which customers can be potential sources of money. The customer who tips you $1 probably isn’t going to buy a lap dance from you, but you can always ask. However, the customer who gives you a $5 bill is more likely to accept your offer. It’s very important that you look at what he’s wearing and any distinguishing features so you can find him again. Don’t try to remember the customer by the place he’s sitting, he isn’t going to stay in the same seat all night.

, When you finish collecting tips from customers directly on your stage, remove some of the tips from your garter. Depending on how much you have in your garter, you’ll want to remove between 20%-50% of it and put it in your money box. When you go to collect money from customers sitting around your stage (as opposed to sitting at it) you want them to know you just got off stage but not make it look like you already have plenty of tips. It sounds silly but customers tend to tip less if they think you’ve already made ‘too much’ from other customers.

, After your stage set is over and you’ve collected your tips from customers sitting directly at your stage, try to collect tips from customers around your stage. Try not to think of this as a free for all where you ask every single guy at the club for a tip. Be reasonable and know which customers were actually watching you dance and which ones were getting dances from other girls, in the restroom, etc.

, Once you’ve collected all your tips, ‘shove’ all your money in your money box. The reason to ‘shove’ your money in is to prevent customers from seeing how much money you’ve actually collected and the amount of money you currently have in your box. You don’t want others to see how much money you have for safety reasons. You can straighten out your bills, count your money, etc. in the back room where you have more privacy.

Remember that leaving the club at night can be dangerous.",How to Decide if You Should Become a Stripper," It’s a common misconception that you need to have a “perfect” body to become a stripper. In fact, strippers come in all different shapes, sizes, and body types. With that said, you will need to be physically fit to a certain degree to keep up with the demands of the job. Dancing is physically taxing. Add in a pair of very high heels and it gets even more difficult! Make sure you are prepared for the physical demands that stripping requires.You don’t necessarily have to possess any dancing experience or skills to start off. Watching some other girls perform to get an idea of what a good routine looks like is a good idea.;
, At first, you may have to work every night to try and establish yourself and earn back money you have already invested to start. You will also have to adjust to working late into the night, which can really interfere with any daytime job you have and plan to keep if you pursue stripping.


Things won’t happen overnight, especially when it comes to feeling comfortable on stage and while giving private dances. You will need some time to really decide if it’s the right profession for you, and to see how well you can do with it.

, Many dancers fall victim to the allure and constant presence of alcohol and drugs inside strip clubs, and end up squandering their earnings on them. There is also danger involved with being intoxicated at work. You will need your wits about you if you plan to stay safe and be paid the amounts you’re owed for things like private dances.There are strippers who manage to have a few drinks on the job without getting drunk, or who use drugs occasionally but don’t become addicts. Realize, though, that this is still risky behavior, and if you have an addictive personality, you might be more prone to developing alcoholism or drug addiction.

, Being a stripper isn’t always full of people throwing cash at you. There will be some clients who don’t find you attractive, or who might outright reject your advances. As a stripper, you will need to “sell” yourself to make your money, so being able to work like a salesperson is important, and salespeople need some thick skin to make it through.Some patrons might be rude, as well. Just like any other job, you might have to deal with people who aren’t especially nice or cheery, but as a stripper, you will be dealing with them in a much more vulnerable and intimate setting. Make sure you’re prepared for that.

, As a dancer, your co-workers will be your competition, since you will all be essentially competing for the attention of the patrons inside the club to get tips and be asked for private dances. Don’t expect close friendships with everyone you work with, and be prepared for the possibility that your co-workers may behave rudely towards you.Consider that, for example, one of your co-workers might be willing to allow more physical contact during private dances, which might bring her more business than other dancers. Things like this can cause friction and tension among co-workers.

, Requirements are different in different areas, but you will most likely need to get a license to be an adult entertainer or exotic dancer. This license will cost you varying amounts in application and licensing fee. For example, the city of Denver, Colorado requires exotic dancers to get a business license, which runs about $175 with all total fees, and also requires a criminal background check.The requirements for licensing will vary depending on where you live and where you’re trying to work, so make sure you look into the requirements, if any, in your city and/or state.

, Before going in for your initial audition, you’ll want to have your outfit ready. It might be a good idea just to buy one at first, just until you have a job secured. There are many online shops that offer outfit sets, separates, and bikini options. Choose the style of outfit that fits your personality. For example, if you plan to dance to more upbeat pop or hip-hop songs, you might not want to put on all black and try an edgier look. Go for bright colors, sparkles, and sexy silhouettes. If you want to dance to rock music, go for that edgier look, with dark colors and chrome or metal accents.These outfits can range in price from $30 - $100 for a complete set—with some exceptions that are cheaper and more expensive. Choose an outfit that fits your budget. Save the more expensive or fancy outfits for down the road when you’re bringing in steady cash.
Depending on what kind of club you’ll be dancing in, your outfit might cover more or less skin. For example, if you will be dancing at a club that allows full nudity, just topless nudity, or bikinis only, you will want to choose your outfit accordingly.

, As a stripper, you won’t be wearing sneakers on stage. Strippers are known for their sky high heels, so you’ll need to grab a pair of those. Don’t put on a standard pair of black pumps, though. You’ll want a heel of at least 4 inches. Buy a pair made for dancers. Think of those clear, see-through platforms you may have seen on dancers in movies. You can usually buy these shoes from the same shop where you purchased your outfit. Some online shops might offer deals on complete outfits, like discounted or free shipping, for example, so take advantage of that by buying everything in one place.A good pair of high heels might cost you even more than your outfit, most likely somewhere between $60 and $200. Stick to the lower end of the price range for your first pair, and wait to buy more until you’re making steady money. Consider buying a pair that might match with multiple outfits.

, Many clubs will actually charge dancers a nightly fee to work. Dancers are usually considered independent contractors, so you will essentially have to pay “rent” to work. The club’s house fees will vary, based on the club you work at, as well as the night you work. For example, the fee on a weekend night might be higher than on a weeknight. Fees could range from $10 a night to $200 or more a night, depending on those previously mentioned factors.You’ll also probably need to tip out your bouncers/security guards, the bartenders or servers (as they might send you clients), and even the DJ that played music for your set.

, Choosing to pursue a career in stripping or exotic dancing can certainly cause other people to cast you a negative look. Stripping isn’t always seen as a worthy or moral way of making money, no matter how pure your intentions may be. Many people also have stereotypes and ideas about strippers in their mind that they will apply to you, even if you don’t fit them at all. You will need to be prepared for how your job will negatively affect your reputation and even your personal relationships.As a stripper, you may have trouble finding stable, lasting romantic relationships, as it might be difficult to find a partner who is okay with you being nude in front of others, or giving lap dances. If you are already in a relationship, you will want to talk things over with your partner and make sure your job won’t negatively affect your relationship., Since your pay will essentially be based on others finding you physically attractive, you might end up basing your own self worth or self esteem on your appearance, as well. Some strippers end up feeling negatively about themselves, or end up being highly critical of their appearances, which can be difficult and taxing. Consider whether or not you would be able to handle this kind of issue coming up if you take a job as a stripper.On the other hand, some strippers find stripping to be especially liberating and a constant source of self-confidence. It all depends on your individual personality, and what kind of feelings you’re prone to.

, Because you’ll be fronting a good amount of cash right away for licensing, club fees, outfits and shoes, you might just barely be breaking even for the first few nights or even weeks. Tipping out the staff and paying nightly club fees can cause you to go home with almost nothing, while on another night you might still go home with a few hundred dollars. The money you make will be varying, at best, as you will be relying mostly on tips and clients paying for private dances.The better salesperson you are, the better chance you might have at making better money. Private dances will likely earn you more money than tips from stage performances alone, so if you aren’t comfortable with private dances, then stripping may not be for you.

, Unfortunately, some people who go to strip clubs believe that strippers are open for business—any kind of business. You may end up with clients who get very touchy or even aggressive during private dances. You will need to be able to stand up for yourself and set boundaries that you will stick to when it comes to those private services. You are never obligated to do anything you aren’t comfortable with. Tip your bouncers well and make sure one is always nearby when you are dancing or giving private dances.If any aspect of being a stripper makes you nervous or uncomfortable, you may want to stay away from it as a profession. You don’t want to end up in a situation where you feel uncomfortable and aren’t prepared to say no when you want or need to.

, Some of your co-workers or clients may use or sell drugs. This, of course, isn’t guaranteed, but you should be prepared for the possibility. If you yourself are prone to drug abuse, you may want to avoid becoming a stripper, as the temptation to use might be higher. You also run the risk of becoming involved in illegal activities, especially if you use or buy drugs while at work.Using drugs or being drunk while working as a stripper can make you vulnerable to sexual assault, or to being swindled out of money you’re owed from private services. It’s important to stay sober and alert while working, so you may want to avoid stripping if you aren’t sure you can do that.

, Walking alone at night can be a risk at any time, but leaving a nightclub where people have been drinking is especially risky. You run the risk of being attacked, assaulted, or robbed, especially since people near the club will probably assume you’re carrying cash on you. If possible, you’ll always want to ask a bouncer or co-worker to walk you out to your car to ensure your safety.When talking with potential clients, don’t give out any personal information. This includes where you live, other places you might work, or even where you go to school if you’re a student. Don’t tell them if you have kids or if you’re in a relationship. Keep those conversations light and simple.

, Once you've found a club, it's important to bring cash with you. Bring a decent amount $40-80 to cover for cover charges, dances, and drinks. Most clubs require a drink purchase every 30-60 mins. While most strip clubs have ATM's, the fee is very high, so bring enough cash with you.

, It's important to make sure you throw down $1-5 while a girl is on stage. You don't have to do it for every girl, but if you just sit around you will be hounded to buy drinks/food or even asked to leave. So actively participate but within your budget.


Despite what you may have heard, most strippers are not there to have sex with you or date you. It's important that you understand that this is just how they earn money and they don't want to go home with you.

, A lap dance is just a private dance that takes place in a separate room. Most dances cost about $20 plus a $3-5 ""DJ"" fee. They usually last one song and no you will not get anything extra. It's a dance.

, If you make eye contact with a dancer, they might take that as sign that you are interested, so don't be surprised when they come sit down by you and want to talk. But remember: they're trying to earn money, so if you don't plan on buying a dance let them know so you don't waste each others time.


If you plan on buying a dance from a girl you like, make sure to wait until you're about to leave. If you only buy one and refuse a second (yes, you have to pay again) they will disappear and move on to the next guy.

, Strip clubs are an awesome way to relieve stress or go hangout with friends. Just make sure not to blow your paycheck!

, If you have missing or stained teeth then get them sorted.

, Male strippers have a confidence that most woman love (even if they don’t admit it). There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance, cross the line to arrogance and you’re back to being a 1 out of 10.

, Long term girls mean that the club is keeping them happy. It is a really good sign.

Choose your music.,
Practice your dancing.,
Choose your stage name.,

Join a reputable agency - Choosing the right Male Stripper agency to represent you is vital in your quest for success.",How to Become a Male Stripper," The first thing you want to consider is how comfortable you are going to be working mostly-naked in large crowds or around rowdy, drunk people. If the thought makes you cringe, you might want to consider another career.;
, Strippers help people visualize their fantasies, and most people fantasize about someone fit and toned. Work to enhance your natural body type - if you are naturally lean and athletic, do low-intensity exercises and high reps to improve your physique without getting bulky. If you're more stocky, focus on building muscle. In either case increase the width of your shoulders and depth of your chest while slimming your waist. Remember to eat accordingly; cut your fat, sugars, and salt, but make sure you're eating enough healthy calories to build muscle. Having a fit body will help you feel confident stripping.

, Tear-away clothing is a popular option for male strippers. A tailor or seamstress can help you add snaps to clothing. Make or buy flashy and enticing underwear.

, Devise routines to different tempos--fast, medium, and slow. Most strippers favor songs with strong bass or drum lines. Burn a CD of 3 or 4 songs for a routine and make several copies of the disc. If you work a private event, you'll leave your disc behind when you depart.

, Work on your routine 3 times a day. Focus on making your movements look languid and effortless, and on keeping your facial expression oriented to the experience of your audience. Some male strippers also dance on poles; you can expand your skills by having one installed in your house.

, Your stage name should be shorthand for your stripper persona and communicate what sort of experience people can expect from you. Pick something alluring and exciting.

, Take a black and white photo of yourself and start emailing or posting it to agencies. Be aware that some agencies will try to charge you to put your photo up and call it a fee.

, There are many good reputable ones out there, but there are also some very bad ones out there that are looking to make a quick buck and not care for it's Performers or Customers. When joining an agency make sure they are a registered Ltd or PLC Company and have full public liability Insurance. Public Liability Insurance can only be obtained by a registered Ltd or PLC Company, there are many agencies out there who are a one man band running their business from their bedroom so to be safe ask the agency you are thinking of joining for their Company Registration Number, their VAT Number and also a copy of their Public Liability Insurance, this way you will be 100% safe and know that you have joined a reputable agency.

, Your relationship will be different with each of these key people. Always keep it professional and respectful.

, This can be tricky. Make sure you are not overly friendly. Because of the competitive environment,there is a tendency for girls to think you are after something when you are too friendly. Keep it cool and respectful. Do not be too keen on making friends. It will come naturally over time.

, You cannot predict how much money you will make and every girl has bad nights. Be sure to save when you do earn.

, 99% of clubs require that you pay a fee to work there. This means that if you've had a bad night, you could be in danger of missing rent. A self-motivated stripper will be a successful stripper. Be proactive work the crowd. Keep the action up for your entire shift.

, Keeping a diary will help you save, monitor what you are spending, maintain a record of your accounts.

Get a website.",How to Be an Exotic Dancer," You must be motivated and driven as with any occupation. Take it seriously, it's a job, not a night out or an opportunity to show off. Go in on time and make sure you behave professionally and in line with the rules of the club. You will also need to know the law and be familiar with following local, state, or federal laws as the apply in your location. Some clubs require a background check and fingerprints as well as ID and a social security or national insurance number. Be prepared to provide these.;
, Are you in reasonably good physical shape? You should be healthy, and while clubs are generally looking for someone slim and toned, there is room for all types of body shapes. A lot of girls worry about not having the right shaped body parts, there is no set size or shape for an exotic dancer.

, You should have heels, 4-inch at minimum. Ask the other dancers or the club owner what they like performers to wear. Many dancers start off with platform heeled shoes to aid stability. Remember, stiletto heel shoes make your legs look thinner, so they might be a better bet when picking out shoes. Not all exotic dancers want the focus to be on their legs. Wear footwear you feel is appropriate. You'll also need a g-string or thong made of sturdy material, probably. The exact details of what you may or may not be allowed to wear will vary depending on where you are working. Online shopping might provide better materials than those at a local boutique. The laws vary, so make sure you check. Make sure you are waxed from the neck down; shaving will NOT do, especially if you have darker hair. Specialist exotic dance venues and those in Europe may have different preferences regarding body hair. No everyone wants to see stubble, and waxing will eliminate razor bumps in the bikini area. If you cannot stand waxing or are in between waxes, you can use make up to help cover anything. You'll want to learn to apply makeup well.

, You can call the club and ask to set up an appointment to audition or simply stroll into the club of your choice (check the Strip Club List online for clubs in your area), and off you go. Make sure you are of age to dance erotically in your district. Some clubs have audition nights or amateur nights where you can go and try out. It is always best to call the club before and find out if this is their way.

, this will be your alter-ego for when you are at work. The most commonly used ""stage names"" are: Precious, Diamond, Barbie, Ferrari, etc. Instead of using one of the more common names listed, try being unique and think outside the box. Be creative with your ""stage name"". Come up with a name that is unlike all the rest. possibly one that no one else might possibly be using.

, Moral judgments aside, it makes it harder for dancers to make money when this happens. Also you will be fired if the club finds out. Prostitution is a highly punishable crime in many areas and many clubs will have undercover cops. Make sure that you understand that even words can get you arrested even if you have no intentions of doing anything for extra money. YOU ARE AN ENTERTAINER, not a hooker.

, Society can be very anti-sex worker, so because you are working in this field, it requires mental resilience. Customers will insult you, you may lose friends and family... but that reflects more on them than it does on you. Make sure you feel good about what you are doing and see it as a positive thing, this will allow you to stand strong against others.

, When you start working, make sure you learn from the other girls and respect the way they work. Do not become overly friendly with them just to make more money, as they will see right through you! Expect that you will not do so well at first, but don't get disheartened. Learn one thing and get up and do it again but better!

,, Getting a website of your own can make you much more popular and raise your tip value. Mention the clubs where you work, and customers will come in just to see you, and they will save their biggest tips for your show.

Visit clubs you'd like to work for.,
Ask questions.,
Find the manager or house mom.",How to Become a Stripper1," It's a good idea to take a week or two and go around town to scope out the places you're considering auditioning for. Go incognito and grab a male friend, if possible; you need to get the feel for the atmosphere and the clientele before you dedicate your time there as an employee. If you see that a club is letting too many rules slip, go to another club. You do not want to work in a club where there could be harm done to the girls or they are not treated respectfully. There are three different types of gentleman's clubs:



Upscale types. These types of clubs have dress codes and you are often expected to wear a long gown that falls somewhere between evening wear and lingerie. They often have high house fees and support staff that you are expected to tip out -- generally speaking, an average of 10-20% of your total nightly income. These clubs are often filled with business men and city dwellers who prefer more upscale establishments, so expect to match their demographic (and spend lots of money) with gowns, rhinestone jewelry, and the whole nine yards. For the record, these clubs tend to be large in size and have a lot of entertainers working nightly.

Neighborhood Clubs. These types of clubs are a little more laid back and often attract locals or tourists, depending on the location. You can be a little more flexible with your costumes and themes at this type of establishment. This is usually a good place to start if you are new to dancing as well. Some of the clubs are located in industrial areas and others are like neighborhood bars with topless or nude entertainment.

Third tier or dive bars. These are usually located in very rural areas of town and often have less than average clientele. They are usually very lenient with the hiring process and attract a rougher crowd.;
, Once you do find a place you can see yourself working at, ask a girl about her experience working there. Do they charge to work there? Is tipping out required? (That's where you give part of your earnings to the club/staff. If so, how much do you have to tip out? Forking over 50% of your cash every night probably isn't worth it. Different clubs vary and can change nightly also.


If you've the time and interest, consider asking a couple girls their take on the work environment. The wider a sample you get, the more likely you are to get the truth.
And don't forget to ask them where they buy their clothes!

, If the employee you're talking to makes the venue sound promising, ask her to point you in the direction of the manager. Once you find them, you can let him/her know you're interested and would like an audition.


Ask him/her all the necessary details: when the audition is, how long it would last (i.e., the number of songs), what you should wear, and if they're the manager on duty that night. Once everything is established, feel free to stay and win them over with your charming personality and ask more questions about protocol to put your mind at ease. If you're feeling particularly inquisitive, ask the same questions you asked of the employees to verify what you've been told.

"

Assemble your wardrobe.,
Get a good grasp of the situation.,
Be comfortable with having no personal bubble.,
Get in shape.",How to Become a Stripper2," You can find stripper-wear in catalogs, porn stores, and various places online. Just make sure your outfit is easy to take off while wearing heels. Make sure you're aware of the laws of where you are working; some states expect you to wear a certain type of underwear. All things considered, here's a list of what you should buy:


High heels (generally, you're looking at a 3"" minimum)
A thong (find out the laws where you live; most exotic dancers wear ""regulation"" g-strings)
Lingerie or legitimate dance costume

, Sit down with yourself and a cup of coffee and think about if this is really what you want to do. Some women have found that they're ostracized in any and all circles for being a stripper, or even just having been one in the past.Are you armed to deal with the psychological consequences as well?


What's more, money is not necessarily a guarantee. If you are good, you can expect to make up to $500 during a day shift or up to $1,000+ on night shift (location depending). But if you do not know how to handle yourself and ""sell"" your services, you may go home with no money and in debt. It is not carved in stone that if you walk into a strip club and look good you will make money.
Keep in mind that competition is fierce. Yes, the job is based partly on looks, but there are girls who look like supermodels who can leave the club in the red. Most girls who start stripping do not realize that stripping is a sales job where they are selling their time, their attention and dances for money. You can't just show up and ""phone it in"" to make a decent wage.

, When at work, you will be constantly gawked at, touched, and possibly feel violated. You will need to get used to being naked around strangers and strangers trying to touch you in ways you may not want to be touched. Though it sounds rather daunting, it does get easier with time.


Customers will try (or will grope you against your will) the most if you are in a contact club. There are also non-contact clubs where the no-touching rule is strictly enforced. By law in pretty much every state, customers are not allowed to touch you, but that doesn't always prevent it from happening. You have to have a strong backbone, stand up for yourself, and enforce the rules for the club at times.

, Though the entire world seems to revolve around looks and sex appeal, this is one industry when it takes the throne and runs laps around the competition. If you're not in shape, you'll probably make less money, point blank. You by no means have to be perfect! No girl is. But it's a good idea to start toning up your body -- you'll feel more confident on stage, too, and confidence is the closest thing to having a miracle worker in your tool belt. Start eating healthy and exercising, if you're not already conscious of these lifestyle habits.


Strippers come in all shapes and sizes; there is no prerequisite when it comes to dancing. Like noted earlier, if you can't sell yourself (regardless of how beautiful you are), you won't be able to make a career out of this. Toning up is just one (albeit an important one) of many steps needed to be competent and successful in this industry.

"
"
Practice your routine before you show up for a club audition.,
Pick the right songs.,
For beginners, stay away from pole tricks.",How to Become a Stripper3," Make sure to wear your heels while you're practicing -- the same routine done barefoot will feel completely foreign when done in heels for the first time. Dancing and stripping simultaneously in high heels will be the most challenging part of your routine. Having a mirror or a video recorder will help you see what you look like and what areas you need to improve upon (or nix entirely).


If you have an upcoming audition, consider calming your nerves and dancing at an amateur night at a different strip club. Practicing alone in your room or in front of your boyfriend will not offer you the same experience as legitimately dancing for strangers. Getting a night in beforehand can seriously take the edge off your anxiety.

, Usually, you'll be looking at a three-song set up of fast, medium, and slow tempo music. Find a song that fits each category (that you like and know well!) and develop a basic routine. You can deviate from each one a bit, but having the basics down will help keep you confident.


Try not to do anything that's too repetitive; you might come off as a one-trick pony if you repeat the same move too often. Each tempo should set you up with a different vibe and thus each song should be orchestrated differently in your movements.

, If you haven't practiced them beforehand, most likely what you try to do will not be sexy. You will learn them in time, so relax -- you don't need them for your audition.


The best way to learn how to pole dance is to watch videos online. Then, copy the easier moves. Another alternative is to take pole dancing classes. Of course, wikiHow sheds some light on the topic, too.

"
"
Choose a stage name.,
Bring the appropriate belongings.,
Go for it.",How to Become a Stripper4," You don't want to become infamous using your real name, so pick an appropriate pseudonym for yourself. And make sure to have an alternative or two! More than likely the name you pick will already be taken. Stay away from over-used names like Angel, Diamond or Rose. There are two ways to proceed when picking a name:


A name that sounds relatively normal. Pick something that fits your personality, like Grace, Summer or Hope.
A name that's slightly exotic. As a stripper, you are an exotic dancer. Why not pick something exotic? Gia, Amira or Ayesha would stand out.

, For some auditions you may need to just bring your outfit in a bag, go to the club, and say you want to dance. Hopefully they'll ask you for your ID to make sure you're at least 18. Others won't let you near a stage until they look you over either in your street clothes or in your outfit -- so both looks need to sell you!


If the manager wants you to ""audition"" anywhere other than the stage, get out of there! Places like this are either looking for ""extras"" girls or the manager is a pervert who tries to take advantage of the girls. Most clubs will put you on a satellite stage to audition. If you asked the right questions initially, you'll know how the procedure works.

, You've got your sexy lingerie on, your hair and makeup is perfect, and your nails are manicured to perfection. Now all you can do is feel the music, smile, and get your groove on. If they like you, great! When can you start? If they don't, don't take it personally. After all, who even knows your real name?


If you're really set on working at that establishment, ask them how you can improve and when you can audition again. They may have more general audition nights or amateur nights. If they're completely uninterested, just go down the block!

When you are deciding if you want to be a stripper, make sure you think of all the consequences.,
You can make great money if you go to a good club.,
Make sure you have some saved money if you are going to start stripping.,
Before you start working in a club, make sure you visit it to see if you feel comfortable and to see the way the girls are behaving as well as management.,
Ask a few of the girls who work at that club if they like it and see what they say.,
When you start working at the club, keep yourself quiet and out of the way.,
Be careful what you tell the girls when you start working.,
Once you start working,talking to customers will become second nature to you.,
Always make sure you look after yourself on the way home.",How to Be a Stripper Who Knows What She is Doing," Stripping has been known to be a place for girls who are desperate to make money, so future consequences will not be thought of. If you are going to do it make sure of the main future effects, 1) Your family and friends can and may find out 2) Your future employers may find out 3) it may affect relationships with a partner;
, Girls who make money, know it takes time to learn techniques, confidence and skills required to make money. If you are thinking of walking into a club and making thousands, that is very unlikely. Smile and remember these guys will not approach you very often. Walk by them, mess with their hair or run your hands across their back. If they are reluctant massage them, touch their neck and chest. Let them open up to you, and don't be afraid to build their ego.

, This will make you more prepared, and allow you to learn how to make money and do it well. Stripping is like any other job, if you do it well you will get paid. If you take away the stripping part which makes it not seem like a normal job, the underlying principles are EXACTLY the same as other jobs. You will require dedication, self motivation and a good moral ethic.

, Ask yourself, Do these girls look like they feel safe? are the customers treating the girls with respect? This will tell you if management are enforcing rules for customers so that the girls are being treated well.

, You will get a really good idea if a lot of girls have been working there for a long time and rave about it.

, Do not be the life of the club or start trying to be every girls' friend. This will make the girls suspicious of you and will make them doubt your motives. Just watch the flow of the way the club works, so you can blend in and learn your trade.You will make friends, but due to the nature of the work, it takes time. If you think about it, you are competing for money with every single girl in the club.

, Although most of the girls in a club are absolutely great and probably like you, there are some shady characters which you would not normally bump into in your real life. So although you shouldn't lie to these girls, just be vague with details you give about your life until you know them a little better.

, It does not matter how close you feel to these people, remember, you do not know them and they see you as the hot stripper girl, even though it feels like they are your friends. Be careful with giving your personal information. Many girls have made the fatal error of revealing real details that has come to haunt them later.

, Many girls have had customers following them to find out where they live. Be careful about the taxi you take or who you get a ride with. always carry a phone with you and keep a personal alarm.

Before you even consider to audition at a strip club, make sure you are toned.,
Phone local clubs you are planning to work for.,
Be prepared.,
Check out Amateur Night.,
Dress for the job you want.,
Prepare what you will wear to your audition.,
Buy some good stripper shoes.",How to Audition at a Strip Club," There is a lot of girls who think you must be ""perfect"" to work in a strip club. This is not the case. You do not need to be perfect or anywhere near. You do however need to be toned. Most clubs will accept girls who have cellulite and stretch marks. So hopefully this puts your mind at ease. If you are unsure of your body, diet and exercise in a healthy way to get the figure you need. It is possible for almost anyone to have a body like the girls who work in strip clubs.;
, Ask them what their audition process is like and what you should wear including the type of underwear.

, Most clubs have an audition process where you turn up and dance on stage to song/songs and remove your clothes while the club is closed. If you do not know how to pole dance, don't worry, most girls don't know how to pole dance when they first start. Just sway and move sexily to the music using the pole to turn around and support you. Some clubs will want you to choose the music you want to dance to. Plan for this and choose songs which allow you to move sensually. A good genre of music to dance sexy to is urban music. Do not pick something too rock and roll or non sexy. It will be hard for you to get into the ""role"" of the sexy dancer and move seductively.

, Other clubs have auditions where they hold ""amateur nights"". This is a night where girls who want to be hired turn up and dance on the stage while the club is open and has customers there. They then are judged depending on how the audience reacted. Some even have competitions where you have to ""win"" a place to work in their club.

, Other clubs just ask you to turn up and eyeball you in your street clothes and tell you immediately if you are hired. If this is the process for the club you are going to, wear clothes which show the shape of your body. Something like skinny jeans and a tight top would be fine. 

, When you call the club to ask about their audition process, make sure you also ask them the dress code. Some clubs are strictly gown clubs and others are bikini clubs. So make sure you buy and wear the appropriate clothes.

, You can get them online or at local adult shops. Make sure they are at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) high and that you feel comfortable in them.

Before you take your pictures, you're going to have to decide whether you want them professionally done.,
If you decide to go professional, find a reputable company that specializes in artistic modeling photographs.,
Once you have chosen, schedule a date and time for the shoot.,
Leading up to the shoot, make sure you eat healthy and continue with hair and acne care as you always would.,
If you are taking non-professional pictures, you're going to need a good backdrop.,
Apply a little or no makeup- just a small amount of eyeliner, mascara and smudge of blush.,
When you stand in front of your backdrop, smile!,
Have the photographer take plenty of pictures, with varying positions.,
After you've finished shooting, import your photos to a computer and select which ones you'd like to use- you can generally have a couple, but it's better to have a few REALLY good ones than many mediocre ones.,
Print your photos.,
Congrats!",How to Take a Headshot," This can be rather expensive, and especially if you are just starting out in the world of modeling, they are not required. The average professional headshot photo shoot can cost $600-1,000, depending on the number of wardrobe changes and photos taken.;
, Take a look at some of their previous work and decide whether the place is right for you. If you decide to avoid high prices and go non-pro, find a friend or family member that is a moderately good photographer. You want to make sure they own a good camera - preferably an SLR-style camera from a brand like Canon, Nikon or Panasonic.

, Make sure it's a free day when you have nothing else planned - you don't want to rush to or from the shoot, it could affect the quality of the pictures you get. You'll also want to select your outfit. Headshots are meant to focus on the face, not the wardrobe, so go for something simple and non-distracting. Avoid spaghetti straps, although tank tops are okay. The best shirt is a solid color that complements your body and face. Stud earrings are okay, but stay away from necklaces, dangle earrings or other jewelry.

, Take super good care of your face, it's the only one you have. On the day of the shoot, eat a good breakfast and get plenty of sleep! No one wants baggy eyes! If you are doing pro photos, head off to your appointment early and arrive ready to smile!

, The best are gray, white or black, or a very simple home or nature setting. The focus should be on your face, not the stuff behind you! Make sure you have good lighting- natural is best, but studio will do. Avoid dramatic shadows on your face.

, Try to look as sophisticated but natural as possible. Hair should be worn natural- don't straighten or curl. The agency wants to see the natural YOU!

, Let it be natural- have a friend tell a joke or a funny story if you are having trouble. Look at the camera. If you like, you can turn sideways, but always have your head facing the camera straight-on. It is generally best to not have your body straight-on, though- turn at a slight angle to the camera.

, Always get the whole head in the picture, with the face generally centered. You'll want options later on, so take lots of photos to choose from! You can even change wardrobe or backdrop if you like, so more options are available.

, You can do some extremely minimal editing- adjust light, slightly crop- but overall the pictures should be left natural.

, Some people prefer black and white, and others color. See if the agency has a preference. If not, go with what suits you best. You can print your pictures with or without a border and that's also your choice. Remember, an agency isn't going to reject you just because your pictures don't or do have a border.

, You have completed your head shots!

"
"
Shoot outdoors unless you have a near-professionally lit indoor space.,
Choose a bland, basic background.,
Ensure your model is evenly lit, without any dramatic shadows.,
Do your best to make the model comfortable, happy, and willing to play.,
Make sure you cover the three ""essential"" photos before you start getting creative.,
Always retouch photos before sending them back to the model.,
Send the model the retouched shots for approval.",How to Take Male Model Portfolio Pictures1," You will save yourself 100's of headaches if you just shoot outside, aiming for the 1.5 hours after sunrise or before sunset. This is known as the ""golden hour,"" when sunlight naturally diffuses through the atmosphere for soft, appealing shadows and well-rounded lighting.


Overcast days are great shooting days, as they provide naturally soft lighting as well. You should still avoid shooting from 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM, when the sun is directly overhead, however.
If you do have to shoot inside, turn on every light and open every window. The more light, the better.;
, A great scene or setting in the back simply distracts from your model. A modeling agency doesn't care about the setting of the photo, they care who is in it. A plainly colored wall that the subjects ""pops"" from is your only concern.


Don't match the model with the background. A black man shouldn't be on a dark brown background, and a woman in a bright dress shouldn't be flush against a yellow wall. You want contrast.
When taking photos, leave the background out of focus, making the model pop out even more.

, While a hard shadow looks great in a regular photo, the fact is modeling agencies need to see as much of the model's body as possible.While you want some shadows for definition, you need to aim for clarity above all.


Pay careful attention to the face, particularly the eye sockets, for dark or distracting shadows. A reflective bounce or weak light on the face can usually eliminate any issues.

, Taking modeling photos is a creative endeavor, and it should be a lot of fun. This isn't just to have a good time -- a happy model is a relaxed one, and relaxed models always look better on camera. The best way to do this is talk -- find out what kind of shots they want, their general personality, and the type of modeling they're interested in.


Don't feel bad about ""taking control."" People, especially on camera, want to be told what looks good. So move the model around, make them smile, and give direction., The following are your can't-miss shots: the three images you must have good copies of in order to get the bare minimum. Luckily, they are simple, easy shots to set up, and you've seen countless examples of them in ads and magazines.



Full Body: Simple and easy, you capture the model from head to toe. Good posture, is key, as is shooting slightly from below the subject -- it makes them seem bigger and more manly.

Half-length: From the mid-thigh up. Hands can be up, in pockets, or out. Again, shoot from below for the best results.

Waist Up: Particularly necessary for shirtless models, this cuts right at the hip. If shirtless, make sure that no fabric is showing. Again, a lower angle makes everyone look hotter., Even if you're not particularly practiced as a photo editor, you should still take a little time to work on the photos before sending them. It doesn't matter what program you're using, you should, at least, take a look at:



Crop: Crop the image so that model takes up most of the frame, and isn't cut off in any way. You want the shot to be pretty tight like it was a full-page magazine ad

Brightness & Contrast: Make sure the darkest parts of the picture (there shouldn't be many) are a nice deep black, and there are no nasty, bright white glares.

Hue Saturation: This changes some basic color settings. It can be useful for balancing images. For example, if there is a distracting red glow coming off a red dress, you can lower the saturation of the ""red"" slider to faintly tone the reds in the image down. You can also boost overall saturation to add some more color ""pop"" into the picture.

Clarity: Usually offered on only higher-end programs, this catch-all setting for sharpness and image quality is useful when bumped up 8-12. Don't go above 20., To go the extra mile, send them copies of each shot in black and white as well (which may require a retouch of Brightness & Contrast), so that they have the option to use either. Ask them if there were any other shots they liked, or if they have any comments on these. From here, you can always re-shoot, re-edit, or send off the shots to an agency.


Most agencies want prints, usually 8.5 x 11"". More and more agencies, however, are converting to all digital submission processes.

Walk with your toes facing slightly outward.,
Keep most of your weight on the balls of your feet.,
Take longer strides than you normally would.,
Adjust your speed to match the music.,
Pose for a three to five second count.,
Turn by pivoting in a graceful, continuous motion.",How to Walk the Runway for Male Models1," As you stride, your feet shouldn’t cross over each other in an “X,” like women's feet do when they walk the runway. Instead, the classic male runway walk is a “V” formation, in which the toes point out slightly. Try not to point your toes out too much, or you might look like you’re waddling.The “V” formation broadens the body, emphasizes the upper torso, and gives the strut a slight swing while preserving masculinity.;
, When your foot lands, try to place the ball of your foot down first, then land your heel. It might feel weird at first, but keep your weight balanced on the balls of your feet as you walk.Keeping most of your weight on the balls of your will make your stride more elegant.

, While your stride needs to be longer than your normal gait, you shouldn’t look awkward or like you’re on stilts. Practicing will help you make your stride longer but appear natural instead of clumsy., As for the quickness of your step, let the music guide your tempo. Try to match your walk's rhythm to the beat of the music.The music that accompanies fashion shows is usually chosen to help the models pace their walks.

, At the end of the runway, pose with your hand on your hip, one leg out, and the other foot forward ready to pivot. Stand still for three to five seconds, then use your pivot foot to turn back for your return walk.Your pose can vary, and you can work with your designer to create a pose that’s suitable for the show.
If you nail your pose, photographers will have a better chance of getting a great shot that you can add to your portfolio.

, After you’ve posed, turn on the ball of your pivot foot as you pick up your other foot and reverse directions. As you pivot, your face should be the last part of body to turn away from the audience.Try not to make a quick pivot as if you were doing a pirouette. Instead, try to make your pose, pivot, and turn in one continuous, fluid motion.

Know the three elements you want to highlight for successful pictures.,
Pick out 3-4 varied, well-fitting outfits for the type of modeling you want to accomplish.,
Focus on loose, confident posture, no matter what pose you're in.,
Take different photos to show both the serious and playful sides of yourself.,
Stay ""in character"" the whole time.,
Work constructively with your photographer.,
Limit your portfolio to your very best 12-16 pictures.",How to Take Male Model Portfolio Pictures2," Modeling agencies are interested in three things -- face, body, and confidence. If you can cover these in your pictures, you'll give them the full impression of you as a model.


Your face structure and shape.
Your physique (muscles etc.) and how your body is built.
If you got ""it"". You have to be self-confident and able to show it. Have no fear of showing your body and have the right look in your eyes.

, If you don't want to model swimwear, then don't wear a swimsuit! If your best feature is your body, don't wear clothes that cover everything up! There are tons of types of modeling out there, so think about what you want to do and are best suited for, then dress accordingly. Have multiple outfits so that you can capture many looks when shooting easily.


The fit of your clothing is the most important thing. If a shirt is really cool, but a size too big, don't wear it -- you'll lose too much body definition.
When in doubt, going one size smaller than normal is usually your best bet, as it stays trim and form-fitting.
Communicate with your photographer ahead of time if they want any particular looks, outfits, or ideas.

, A model must exude sexuality and confidence, no matter what their position. While the rules of good posture still apply to models -- back straight, chin up, shoulders back, hips over ankles-- they may not always apply based on the pose you have to hold.


Take a deep breath and relax your muscles. Don't forget to focus on the muscles around your eyes, mouth, and jaw, which make you look tense when clenched.
Keep your shoulders back. This naturally expands your chest, making you look bigger and more manly.
Avoid looking straight at the camera, which often makes your jawline disappear., A model lives in front of the camera, so now is not the time to be shy. Remember to capture a range of emotions while shooting, even if you don't plan on using them all. A modeling portfolio needs to capture a range of ""characters"" that could be fit into any type of ad, so don't pick one look and stick with it exclusively. Have some fun and start making faces. Some to consider include:


A close-mouthed, serious look
Open and close-mouthed smiles
Laughter
Anger, intensity, or fierceness
Thoughtful or pensive
Romantic or sensual., Once you're on camera, act like the thing is shooting pictures every single second. Photographers often take 3-4 shots a second, and if you are always cracking a sheepish smile, looking away, or changing poses, you'll make it impossible to get a good shot. Make your shots slow and deliberate, and try not to ""break"" because you feel self-conscience or embarrassed.


Remember -- the point isn't to get 100 good pictures, it is to get 10-12 really great ones. So be patient and take your time with each pose, face, or shot., If you have an idea for a pose or a shot, let the photographer know. But you should also trust them and let them guide you -- they are the ones with the lens, after all. Let them, for lack of better word, ""model"" you. When reviewing photos, always temper any criticism with positivity or helpful suggestions. Remember that most models are their own worst critic, and complaining that you ""look terrible"" or ""ugly"" in all of the shots is a subtle insult to your photographer, as well. It makes it much less likely they'll really sacrifice a lot more energy to help get better photos.If you review the photos after the shoot and don't like any, say something! You've got to work together to find a few you like.

, You can even have a few less if it means cutting a few of questionable quality. You do not need to send a ton of pictures to impressive someone at an agency, especially if you're just getting started and haven't gotten any work yet. Instead, you need to focus on quality -- even two incredible shots (one of your head, one of your body) are really all you need to convince someone.


If a shot is on the fence, don't include it. Only submit the very best you have if you want the best jobs."

Keep your shoulders back, chest out, and stomach in as you walk.,
Let your arms sway naturally as you stride.,
Focus your eyes straight ahead.,
Keep a natural, neutral facial expression.,
Project confidence as you walk.",How to Walk the Runway for Male Models2," Hold your shoulders back and keep them still, but not to the extreme that you seem robotic. Just try not to let them bounce up and down as you walk. In addition, keep your chest out and stomach in, so you appear broader and taller, which will emphasize your masculinity., Without letting them touch your sides, try to keep your arms close to your torso. That way, your lower arms will sway freely and naturally without swinging too wildly. Further, keep your hands and fingers relaxed, and don’t ball your hands or hold them in fists.Try to keep your fingers naturally straight without overextending them. That way, you won’t look like you’re missing any fingers in photographs.

, Find a focal point directly ahead and lock your eyes on it. Don’t shift your eyes around or look down at your feet. Your head should point slightly downward with your chin roughly parallel with the floor.Depending on your designer’s instructions, you can look away from your focal point to make eye contact with the audience during your pose.

, Unless your designer tells you to, don’t smile during your walk. Without locking or pursing them, keep your lips closed, relaxed, and natural. While your facial expression should be neutral, it should still convey confidence., Confidence is key on the runway. As you walk, try thinking about how great you look. Tell yourself you’re the best looking person in the room and your posture and facial expression will reflect it."

Watch runway shows to see how styles vary.,
Set up a practice runway at home.,
Practice your walk every day.,
Seek out constructive criticism.",How to Walk the Runway for Male Models3," Every runway model has their own style of walking and posing. Watching recorded runway shows will help you learn the basics and allow you to get a feel for how individual models develop their unique twists.You can find plenty of relevant videos on YouTube by searching for “male model runway shows.”

, A long hallway is the perfect place to practice your walk at home. Run a strip of masking tape down the center of the hallway to help you stay in a straight line. If you have one, hang a tall mirror at the end of the hallway, then play some music and practice walking, posing, and turning., If you're just starting out, you should practice your walk, pose, and turn for at least an hour every day. Once you start booking gigs, you should still practice several times a week, especially if your designer wants you to master a new turn or pose.Even the most experienced professional models have to practice regularly.

, Looking natural is a major part of walking the runway, and you can have a friend watch your walk and let you know of any awkward spots. While they can give you basic feedback, you should try to find someone with professional experience who can offer constructive criticism.If you’re friends with any professional models, ask them to watch you walk. If you don’t already have one, look into getting an agent, and consider taking walking classes.

Look away from the camera.,
Keep your chin forward and down.,
Try an open mouthed look.,
Elongate your neck.",How to Pose Like a Top Model1," If you want to pose like a model, do not look directly into the camera. When posing as a model, you'll rarely be striking a pose where your head is pointed directly at the camera. You'll usually have your face turned away slightly. Therefore, it can look unnatural to have your eyes pointed at the camera.It's a good rule of thumb to follow your nose with your eyes. Look straight out over your nose. This will make your gaze look natural.Many people feel they look somewhat bug-eyed when gazing directly at the camera, especially if their head is turned to the side. You also may feel more self conscious when staring at the camera, which can affect your expression in subtle, unconscious ways.;
, If you raise your chin forward slightly, and then tip it downward, this elongates your neck and makes your jawline more pronounced. This can be a slimming look that highlights your facial features.








However, if you're posing from a side profile, this method can make you look like a turtle poking its head out of its shell. Hold your head in a more natural position for side profile shots., If you don't plan on smiling in a photo, open your mouth slightly. This is a small change, but one that can completely alter the feel of a photograph. If your mouth is closed, your jawline can clench. The expression can also look bored and neutral. Opening your mouth gives the picture an intimate, inviting feel.You do not need to open your mouth too much. This can look forced or unnatural. Just open your mouth slightly, parting your lips by less than a centimeter. The effect will be subtle, but can change the tone of a photo drastically.
If you choose to smile for a picture instead, go for a natural smile. Try to think of a happy moment or funny memory to try and provoke a smile.

, It's important you look as slim and stretched out as possible in a model photograph. Therefore, try to elongate your neck when the picture is being taken. Depending on the angle, your neck can easily look smaller and shorter than normal on camera. Stretching your neck outward can prevent this problem.Before the picture is taken, raise your head upward. You may even want to turn your face up slightly.
If you're looking to the side in a picture, try looking up a little. This can stretch your neck out, creating a slimming appearance.

Separate your limbs from your body.,
Create a false waist.,
Keep your hands loose.,
Move your feet.,
Lean forward and hunch your back.,
Emphasize your shoulders.,
Turn your knees inward.,
Cross your arms and legs.",How to Pose Like a Top Model2," Make sure to lift your limbs away from your body slightly. Do this regardless of what angle the photographer shoots from.


Lift your arms away from your body and spread out your legs slightly so they are not touching.
Not only does this give you a slimmer appearance overall, it prevents legs and arms from being squashed against other body parts, causing fat to be more noticeable., For women, a false waist can be a great trick for modeling. If you want to slim down some and add some curves for the camera, try creating a fake waist. To do this, shift your hips out to one side. This enhances your natural curves and makes your waist look more pronounced.Do not shift your hips too far out. This makes it obvious that you're trying to create a waist for yourself. Just shifting your hips slightly to one side is enough to enhance your curves and give you a slimmed down appearance.

, Many people are unsure what to do with their hands in a photograph. You may awkwardly bunch them up without realizing it. Strive to keep your hands loose and relaxed as this has a more natural, inviting feel.


Keep your middle finger slightly lower than your other fingers.Allow all your fingers to curve inward slightly.Avoid showing the back of your hands, if possible. The backs of hands are less delicate than your palms., Many model shoots are done from the waist up. However, if you're taking a full body shot, keep your feet fluid.








You can pose as if you're walking or running. You can also lift one foot up slightly, bending your knee a bit.
You can have a photographer try a few action shots of you jumping or dancing.

, When being photographed, lean forward slightly. Then, hunch your back. While doing this, pull your navel towards your spine. This enhances the appearance of your bust, for women, and is generally a slimming look for people of all genders.







, This is a trick that works well for both men and women. If you do something to emphasize the appearance of your shoulders, this will make your hips look narrower for women. For men, raising the shoulders can enhance existing muscle. Raise your shoulders slightly in pictures. When taking a photo from the side, turn your shoulders towards the camera, increasing their apparent size.As you raise your shoulders, you may want to move them back slightly as well. This can have a slight slimming effect.

, Another way to make your hips look slimmer is to turn your knees inward. Not only is this slimming, turning your knees inward can create the appearance of a thigh gap. Most people do not naturally have a thigh gap, but it is often sought out in modeling.You can also bend one knee forward. This can look cute as a pose and also creates the illusion of a thigh gap.

, Many male models cross their arms in photo shoots. This is a fun and casual pose that can give you a devil-may-care persona. If you're a male model, try incorporating this pose.


Cross your arms, but lift your arms forward slightly as you do so. This will allow you to slim down your arms as you pose.Cross one leg in front of the other when standing. Allow one leg to support more body weight so the photo does not look awkward."
"
Keep your personality in mind.,
Keep it simple.,
Pay attention to your whole body.,
Do some research.",How to Pose Like a Top Model3," Certain models are known for their distinctive personalities, which they bring into every photo shoot. If you want to be a top model, choose a pose that emulates your distinct attitude.


Dorian Leigh was known for her distinct brand of femininity. Twiggy was known for her charm and girlishness.Jon Kortajarena was known for sex appeal. Sean O' Pry was known for his coy attitude.What is unique about you? Do you have a special personality trait you can use as a model? Say you're a little quirky. Maybe you can smile more widely or laugh during pictures. Are you a brooding, serious type? Consider gazing off screen during pictures. Try to make it look like you were lost in thought when the photo was taken.

, Remember, the primary focus of the picture is you and not the pose. You want your expression and looks to speak for themselves. Do not get too caught up fancy footwork or weird arm movements. While it's okay to have fun and be creative when posing, your pose should not overshadow you. Sometimes, a simple pose is great.Try to relax. Practice taking a few pictures of yourself standing in a way that feels natural. Smile or give an open-mouthed gaze at the camera. Remember your personality. If you're a serious person, give a serious look. If you're fun-loving, offer a grin. See what works and what feels natural.
For example, say your realize you look great from your left side. You can simply stand, with your left side turned slightly to the camera. Place your hands on your hips, slimming down your waist and arms. Turn your head towards the camera, remembering not to look directly at the lens. Then, offer an expression that suits you. Smile if you want to smile or open your mouth slightly while gazing into space thoughtfully. This is a simple pose that can allow your personality to shine.

, Modeling is stressful. When striking a pose, it can be easy to forget certain body parts. For example, you may unconsciously clench your fists when nervous. Try to pay attention to your whole body as you pose.


Right before the photos begin, do a quick body check. Move from your head, to your neck, to your shoulders, and so on, making sure everything is posed accordingly.
The hands are often neglected. Remember to keep your hands loose and your fingers bent slightly. Also, remember to bounce your shoulders up a bit. This is another body part that is often forgotten when focusing on getting the right expression.
Pay attention to your feet and legs if you're doing a full body shot. Remember, standing straight up can look awkward. Try to bend your knee a little, lifting one foot off the ground. If you're doing an action shot, move as if you're running or walking.

, Before choosing a pose of your own, doing some research can help. Browse advertisements and websites like Pinterest and Instagram, looking for pictures of models and photo-shoots. Pay attention to how models are posing.


Vogue, Glamour, and V Magazine are great places to look for poses. Pay attention to how the models use their bodies. Are they turned directly to the camera, or slightly to the side? How do they hold their arms? How do they use their hands? Are their legs held stiff or bent slightly?You can also Google image things like ""pose"" and ""models."" Practice emulating some poses in front of a mirror. Have a friend help, asking him or her to tell which poses look natural and fun for you."

Switch poses.,
Study other models.,
Stay relaxed.",How to Pose Like a Top Model4," If you're taking a series of model photos, strike a lot of different poses. Experimenting with different photos can help you find your best angles. If you plan on modeling professionally, you also want to have nice photos of you from a variety of angles. This allows a potential agent or employer to get a sense of your range.







, Modeling is like any other craft. You can learn a lot by studying what came before you. Look through magazines ads, websites, and other places where you're likely to find models posing.


Study their expressions. It can be hard to figure out how to do a model look, but watch how professional models hold their eyes and mouth. See if you can try and match that expression.Look at models you admire. If you're not a fan of a particular model's aesthetic, it'll be hard for you to follow in that person's footsteps. Just like a writer whose idol is William Faulkner wouldn't try to imitate Hemingway, you shouldn't strive to emulate a model whose taste you dislike. Find models you find personally inspiring and try to learn from them.

, If you feel nervous during a modeling shoot, this apprehension may show up in photographs. Strive to stay relaxed throughout the shoot. Your pictures will turn out more natural.


Try to breathe slowly and deeply. This can help your body slow down and stay calm.Take breaks as necessary. If you feel yourself getting agitated, stop for 10 minutes and take a short walk to relax.

Develop a passion for fashion.,
Assess your strengths.,
Choose a career path.,
Apply for an internship with a fashion company.,
Seek an entry-level job.,
Seek internal promotions.",How to Work for a Fashion Company," There are many jobs in the fashion industry, but 1 thing that most fashion employees have in common is a desire to keep up with the trends and changes in the industry. Foster this love by reading fashion magazines and blogs and going to fashion shows in your area.;
, You do not have to be a designer to work for a fashion company, so assess both your aptitudes and past experience. On a sheet of paper, list your skills and experience so you can see what fits best when you assess jobs.

, In order to choose your education and training path, you should decide which of the following departments in a fashion company would be best for you:


Fashion publicity. A fashion publicist helps a brand or company to communicate its message or brand to its target audience. If you're a communications professional or just have a way with words and people, then consider going into public relations. Your expertise in turning a phrase, creating a press release, talking to reporters or organization can help you to work as a fashion show producer or event coordinator for a fashion company. Seek a bachelor's degree in public relations with a minor in a fashion design or merchandising.
Fashion designer. If you enjoy sketching, sewing and producing your own creative designs, then you will be part of a competitive field. Much of the energy that goes into the fashion industry is provided by this creative and driven set of people. It is a good idea to attend a fashion design school, where you will learn about the industry and skills needed to make it as a designer.
Fashion management. If you would love to be behind the business end of fashion, then a career in fashion management is a good choice. Seek a degree in business administration or marketing with a minor in a fashion subject. Fashion companies small and large need account executives, store managers, project managers, production coordinators and human resource departments. Strive to be professional, highly motivated and ambitious.
Fashion retail store manager. If you have worked in apparel stores and you like the environment, then consider becoming a store manager, area manager and general manager. Many of these positions are filled based on experience and proven success, so the first step is to work in retail and go for any promotion you can apply for. Store managers can improve their chances by getting an associate's degree or bachelor's degree in business administration.
Fashion merchandising. This department includes a group of highly trained fashion professionals who know fashion trends, textiles and industry-specific production information. They oversee how a design is produced and successfully marketed to a target audience. Seek an associate's or bachelor's degree in fashion merchandising from an art or business school.
Visual merchandising. This competitive position creates the window displays and brand marketing in stores. It requires a person to possess knowledge of fashion and communicate emotions with a product. It is a good idea to seek an associate's degree or bachelor's degree in visual arts with some schooling in marketing. Volunteer to do window displays for people in order to develop an excellent portfolio.
Fashion photography or graphic design. Visual artists who have sought schooling in photography or graphic design can position themselves to work for fashion companies. Do research on the latest trends in fashion photography and fashion graphic design. After completing your schooling, keep a professional portfolio that emphasizes your paid or spec work with fashion companies.

, Few people break into the fashion industry without taking an internship to gain experience. Although these internships can be unpaid or low-paying, it is important to pay your dues and learn the industry from the bottom up.


Apply for internships while you are still in school. The best way to get a head start on your career with a fashion company is to start working in the field as soon as you are able. Check to see if your school has any connections to internships at larger companies. Keep applying if you fail to get an internship right away.
Pay attention to the way you dress. Perhaps no other industry has the same emphasis on matching company culture through dress. Dress professionally but stylish for the interview, and then adjust your clothing to what will help you become a part of the company's image.
Ask questions. The best way to avoid making large mistakes is to ask before doing something for the first time. Many interns worry that they will offend fashion professionals by asking too much. Ask the question and then prove you are a fast learner.
Take advantage of doing the grunt work. Doing small jobs well is the best way to prove your worth. Although you might be capable of more, the aim of an internship is to prove you are a hard worker with an aptitude for the business.

, Most fashion companies have a very traditional structure starting with internships and moving up to entry-level positions. The following are some good jobs to apply for:


Sales representative. There is no better way to learn the fashion business than to work in sales. You are exposed to the company, the clients, marketing, public relations and all the lingo necessary to make it in a fashion company. Apply for a sales job with a fashion company and strive to meet your quotas and keep your customers happy.
Store manager. If you want to work in retail or management and you have schooling, apply directly for these positions. Successful store managers can work their way up to corporate or area manager positions.
Personal assistant. Many fashion executives employ personal assistants, in any of the departments listed above. You will be required to run errands, organize and work very hard. People who succeed at this exhausting job can be promoted within the company.
Junior visual merchandiser. If you want to break into visual merchandising, you need to start by getting this job and learning to carry out a senior visual merchandiser's designs. It is likely that you will work late nights to get the store ready for business hours. As you prove yourself, you will be given small projects to design and complete.
Design assistant. Before you can become a full-time designer, you may need to spend a few years as a designer assistant. You will help sketch, make and produce designs. The job may also include travel to trade shows and helping with event production.
Marketing assistant/junior marketer. In this position, you will be responsible for staying on top of fashion and online trends. Many junior marketing professionals are asked to work with social media and small marketing projects where you can show your creativity and consistency.
Assistant buyer. If you have a degree in fashion merchandising or a similar field, you can apply to aid a buyer as they make their seasonal decisions for a company. You will be able to submit reports and opinions on trends. As you prove yourself, you may be given a budget and several buying projects.
PR assistant. You will need to work your way up before having your own account in a fashion PR firm. Assistants help to create a PR package and keep clients happy on a day to day basis. You will work up to handling your own PR campaigns.

, Many entry-level fashion jobs are very hard work for less pay than managers or executives. Show you are motivated by applying for promotions and communicating that you are dedicated to your company.

, If people are saying that you are voluptuous, then it is a good sign. This is because there are very few plus size representatives within the fashion industry in the United States, so you will certainly stand out for all the right reasons.

, After you create a basic profiling of yourself with professional photos, apply to agencies for positions to model in the plus sized categories.


If you have a friend with a professional quality camera, ask them if they could take a few head-shots and portfolio type pictures to create a profile that can be handed out to potential agencies.
If however you don't have access to this type of equipment, you can attempt to get in contact with local photographers.

Research the company where you are applying.,
Evaluate the job description.,
Place your contact information, including name, address, email, telephone number and fashion blog at the top of the page.,
Write an objective, or executive summary, section.,
Place an education section at the bottom of your resume.,
Detail your experience in reverse chronological order.,
Focus on your accomplishments.,
Insert action verbs at the beginning of each bullet point in your job summaries.,
Include professional organizations on the bottom.,

Proof your resume repeatedly.,
Print your resume on quality paper.",How to Write a Resume for a Job in the Fashion Industry," Background information in the industry, type of fashion, corporate culture and where the company is headed is essential. Focus your resume on this information, giving priority to experience and education that support it.;
, First, establish that you have the qualifications to do the job. Then, underline any qualifications, keywords and accomplishments you should address in your resume.


The fashion industry is well-known for making its professionals climb up the employment ladder. It is good to raise the bar for yourself, but applying for a senior position before you are an assistant is unlikely to get you hired.

, A surprising number of people forget to include this information. You can also split your information between top and bottom, if it fits your format better.

, This 2 to 5 sentence section describes who you are, where you want to go and what you have done so far. Focus on your professional goals, rather than your personal ones.


For example, Merchandise assistant with 3 years of experience producing accessories. Talented and efficient professional with the ability to manage projects independently and problem-solve. Looking for a position with room for growth to senior merchandiser.

, Highlight any accomplishments at the bottom, but keep it short. If you know the company has a connection to a former profession, you may want to put ""supervising professor"" at the bottom and go into more detail in the cover letter.

, Use both internships and jobs in subsections leading to when you graduated from school. If you do not have extensive work experience, focus on your accomplishments and skills gained during internships and editorial work, like blogging.

, Most people fill their work experience sections with skills they have gained, but they should be focusing on promotions, increases in efficiency and sales and increased responsibility. Use specific numbers, project names and times to support your experience.


If possible, allow the accomplishments to show off your skills and your hard work. For example, ""Created Facebook marketing initiative that increased sales by 43 percent."" This accomplishment shows that you know how to do social media marketing, but also shows you proved your worth to the company.

, Action verbs are more descriptive than ""was,"" ""made,"" or ""had."" The following are some excellent verbs to use in fashion resumes:


Contracted, developed, executed, improved, supervised, produced, purchased, operated, prepared, arranged, negotiated, promoted, adapted, critiqued, systematized, organized, solved, operated, trained, designed, illustrated, planned, originated, shaped, researched, budgeted, assessed, represented, expedited, wrote, founded, solicited and modified.

, If you are a member of any professional fashion organizations or you have created your own fashion site, place this on the bottom under your education section. It should be short, naming the organization and your involvement.


For example, ""www.thefashionpassion.com, Founder 2005"" or ""Council of Fashion Designers of America, Member since 2008.""

, Once your information is on the page, edit it down. Look for extraneous words or job explanations that can be condensed.


Make sure to use a popular professional font, such as Times New Roman, and no less than 11-point font. Hiring managers can be in their 20s or in their 60s, and you want everyone to be able to read your font.

, If possible, ask other people to proof or edit it, because they may find things that you did not see. All formatting, spelling and contact information should be reviewed for accuracy.

, Keep an online version, but always print out a few copies to have on hand.

Educate yourself.,
Be healthy and beautiful.,
Get an agency.,
Start actually working.,
Cultivate an image for yourself.",How to Make Yourself into a Modeling Icon," Find out what's happening in the fashion industry. Agents look for a serious interest in modeling, so don't look stupid! Do your homework. Read high-fashion magazines like Vogue and Elle, or just look up the top designers, agencies, and models on the internet.;
, You should have a good body, eat nutritious low-fat foods and work out regularly. Drink 8 glasses of water a day, take your vitamins, and eat healthy things like vegetables--avoid fattening junk food. Pilates or yoga is a good exercise program for getting that lean, toned physique. Go to the doctor for regular checkups. Also, take good care of your hair, skin, and nails, and keep them natural. Agencies do not like to see blemishes, lots of makeup, a ratty mane of hair, or gaudy fake nails. Do not try to make yourself anorexic just to please the agencies.

, An agency's job is to get work for models. Some models are freelancers, but most successful ones are not. Be prepared to face a lot of rejection and to keep trying through it. Remember, success does not come to those who give up after the first try, and it only takes one good agent to start a great career. So be determined, polite, professional, and smart.

, You won't get the greatest jobs at first because you're a newcomer, but if you do those jobs well, you will develop a reputation as someone who is good to work with. Also, make sure you are unique and interesting.Fashion is fickle, and the industry is always looking for the next new star, so be that star. Always do any job you get perfectly-if you are in a runway show, wow the crowd and 'sell' your look.If you get a print job, make sure your photographs are stunning.Be professional, organized, on time and pleasant to be around. Never behave like a diva or a spoiled brat-no one will want to hire you!Above all, be yourself, work hard, and have high standards for yourself.

, What do you want to be known for? Be that person at all times.

Consider whether you really do want to do modeling as a career.,
Read biographies by models and those in the modeling industry.,
Read fashion magazines to know what is current.,
Do your research to find a good agency.,
Treat your portfolio in the same way as a resume.,
Work on your confidence.,
Work on developing a natural look that doesn't rely on makeup.,
Know your client.,
Expect rejection.,
Expect challenging situations to arise.,
Do not sign a contract without reading it first.,
Budget sensibly and budget for the future.,
Think about your future.",How to Mentally Prepare for a Career in Modeling," It's a tough job that comes with long hours, many demands and a paucity of work until you're considered bankable. Even then, for many models it's a short-lived career. and winning a few talent shows isn't the same as living a modeling career, so be sure you're truly ready for what it will involve, even if you already think you've got what it takes.;
, Some of what is out there isn't pretty to read about but you should be aware of. Go into this industry with your eyes wide open.For example, read The Vogue Factor by Kirstie Clements. It will help inform you about some of the issues models face, along with magazine and publishing expectations.

, Apart from that, you won't learn much else. Do not rely on the glamor shots in these publications as an indication of what modeling is all about; there is much more involved than looking amazing (which can take hours of effort in itself!). Modeling is hard work, often challenging and at times, will likely force you to cross your comfort zone as you are expected to perform in ways that might scare of or overwhelm you. For example, you might have to deal with jobs that include heights, walking quickly in high heels down many stairs, holding scary animals, diving into deep water, wearing clothing you feel exposed in, and so forth––you just never know what stunts you may be asked to cope with. However, these experiences can present a fun challenge if you have the right mindset; only you can make that choice.

, There are good agencies and there are also shoddy agencies, as with many other career assistance out there. Research the agency online and find comments others have left. Also ask existing and past models for their opinions. Best of all, find a mentor who can guide you in making good decisions, including which agency to use––preferably choose someone who has been in the modeling industry (or associated with it, such as a magazine editor, fashion writer, etc.) for decades.


Find financial information about the agency - is the company solvent? Does it have a good financial reputation?
Does the agency have a good reputation in general?
Which models are already with the agency?
What clients does the agency attract?
Read the fine print of anything you sign with an agency (see below). Know what you're getting yourself into.

, It is your brand, your promise and your ticket to new work opportunities. Be sure to have complete control over the brand you're presenting. If you do not know how to get this aspect right, speak to people who can assist you to do it properly. Again, be guided by your mentor or adviser on the right places to get assistance from.


Look at other model's portfolios. What do you see that is effective and what do you see that doesn't work? Avoid copying but do be ready to use the general ideas of what is a good portfolio. Aim for a unique presentation and look.
Use a commercial photographer with a great reputation to prepare excellent shots of you for the portfolio.
There are reputable courses and portfolio producers but they are not a promise of work; participating in courses and getting a portfolio together can only start you on your way. Be wary of paying for ""work opportunities""; paying for courses is one thing but not for the modeling jobs themselves! And if you do pay for courses, get advice first and ask previous students if the course was value for money.

, Every person who wants to work for someone else has to get used to doing interviews. This isn't anything new; what is different is that you need to present a brand (your appearance), as well as your skill set.


If you act confident, even if you don't feel it, this will help you to grow in confidence. Knock-backs are inevitable but they do not need to diminish your self worth unless you permit this.
Work on your assertiveness. In this industry, you will need to speak up politely. There is no space for a diva who argues all the time or a pipsqueak who doesn't say anything until her or his hair is on fire from that crazy fire shoot. Find an assertive balance that lets you be heard and that gets you known as the person who will speak up when needed in constructive ways, without resorting to complaints and always willing to use initiative to overcome difficulties.
Remind yourself that clients are after a certain look and the reality is, that won't be your look all of the time. However, you can help yourself by refining your niche, such as choosing swimwear, catwalk or fashion shoots because you have the look that the specific niche is after.

, Treat makeup as an enhancement; the simple fact is that many clients will book you based on your natural self, expecting makeup to enhance what they already like about your look, poise and style.


Don't overdo the makeup for interviews. Keep your hair natural too (no obvious hair product in it); this lets the stylists see the potential for your hair without artifices in the way.
Wear neat, casual clothing that isn't out of keeping with current fashion. Simple clothing that shows your silhouette, shape and look, is best.

, All job seekers must know the company's background, mission and achievements. It is no different for modeling, except that you will need to check this background information out more frequently. Fortunately, the internet makes this easy. Do not neglect to do this homework; knowing the background to the product or service and what the ethos of the company you're modeling for can help win you the job, as you'll reveal a better understanding of what's expected than models who have failed to do their homework.

, It is a standard part of the industry. Pick yourself up each time, learn from it and realize that you often just don't have the right look for that particular campaign or show. It is not that you aren't a good model; it's simply that clients are free to choose from many types of models, male/female/transgender and this is just part of what modeling is all about. If you give up early on, then this isn't the right job for you.

, Be prepared, not ambushed. Sometimes there will be lecherous, advantage-taking and backstabbing people in the industry, just as there will be people you can trust. Avoid seeing everyone as a potential untrustworthy person but keep your wits about you. Consider the following:


How will you fend off unwanted sexual advances (sexual harassment)? While it is to be hoped you will never have to do this, do not be naive. For example, if you sense something isn't right about a situation or person's expectations of you, put yourself ahead of the job, always. Report sexual harassment to your agency and the police.
Consider what you will do to avoid unsafe situations. For example, if there is a suggestion that you turn up to a photo shoot alone and in the middle of nowhere, ask why it is so secretive and if you don't like the explanation, or your agency cannot satisfy you that it's safe, turn down the job. If you're under 18, always have a chaperone, such as a your parent or an older sibling. If you're in your late teens and 20s, a chaperone still won't hurt until you know enough about the industry. And have the phone numbers for the police and people you trust on speed dial on your cellphone (and always take the phone with you).
Consider how you will cope with the pressure to be pin-thin. The extent of thinness expected will vary depending on the type of modeling you choose to do. For example, Paris thin for the catwalk can be alarmingly thin, while many fashion, beauty, editorial and sports shoots may be a healthier slim weight; plus-size modeling is also an option. You need to make up your own mind about losing weight for modeling but you do need to face this expectation rather than hoping it won't be an issue. Ultimately, if it gets to the point that you're starving yourself constantly, you'll have no energy, you won't be a healthy role model for women or men who see your image and it can most certainly end up damaging your health.
Consider what you will do if you're asked to wear/promote something that conflicts with your personal beliefs or values. What if you have an ethical dilemma about the company whose product or service you're promoting? What if you're asked to do a photo shoot that you find clashes with your beliefs? These ethical or moral issues may confront you, and it is a good idea to know ahead of time what you will choose to do. Some people might say ""it's all part of the job"" and suck it up, while others might say that your longer-term values that allow you to sleep well at night matter more. You decide.

, Even better, have someone with legal or contract-vetting knowledge read it over for you first. Ask questions before signing, and be sure you understand both the terms and conditions of the contract and any verbal explanations you are offered.


Beware any changes made to the contract in handwriting, with crossing out, or changes to what is usually a ""standard"" contract.
If you do not understand the contract, do not be bullied into signing it. If someone makes a comment that plenty of others are willing to sign it without bothering with its clauses, walk away. There will be other jobs with people who are willing to let you read it and understand it. You have a lot of life ahead of you; do not base decisions on a moment of undue pressure.

, Modeling is, for many models, a hard career in terms of regular cash flow. There may well be no regular cash flow, so you will need to make the money you do earn work harder and last longer. Have a really good budgeting system in place, avoid splurging and always think ahead to the future.


Keep some of your money in an investment account for ""emergencies"". Try not to touch it unless the need is dire.
Draw up and follow a budget based on your average earnings.
Avoid splurging. This can throw out your budget for months to come.

, Consider what you would like to do post-modeling. Many models will not still be modeling beyond their 20s, 30s or 40s. Many reasons are behind this, with the most potent probably being the never-ending commercial pressure to only feature the youngest faces and looks. But realistically, many things can cause you to want to leave modeling, such as wanting a steady income, having children, disliking the travel/hours/dieting, pursuing a new passion, and so forth. By thinking ahead, you can safeguard your future, as well as enjoying your modeling now.


Do you want to do a certificate, diploma or degree course by correspondence, part-time? Having a qualification behind you makes good sense and can be part of your longer-term plan for continued financial independence and following a satisfying career path.
Perhaps you're more business-minded? If so, consider what you'd like to do by way of offering goods or services when running your own business. Do some night classes or do an online part-time course in business management, entrepreneurship or similar. Start making business plans; it's never too early, and who knows, you may wish to juggle both modeling and running a business.
Consider working in a related industry. Perhaps acting, TV or publicity events are of interest to you. You might also consider being a host for parties, a speaker, a club owner, etc. Consider work where your appearance, poise and confidence form an intrinsic part of the role.
Write books. Models such as Miranda Kerr and Heidi Klum have written books about beauty, personality and similar things that play to what they know well. Or Tara Moss, who made a conscious decision to try out modeling for a time, but who has always loved writing, and is now a world-renowned crime writer."

Keep your shoulders squared to the camera.,
Tighten your core.,
Work on the strolling pose.,
Lean against a wall.,
Put your hands in your pockets.,
Touch your face.,
Use one hand to adjust your tie.,
Cross your arms.,
Narrow your eyes with a bit of a squint.,
Extend your chin forward and down.,
Show some teeth with you smile.,
Look past the camera.",How to Pose Like a Male Model," One of the primary rules is that generally you want to look broad and large as a male model. If your shoulders are angled away from the camera, it slims your profile. Keep your shoulders relaxed and facing forward.To enhance the look of your shoulders, lean forward about an inch or two (2.5 cm to 5 cm), bringing your shoulders closer to the camera.
There are times when you’ll be photographed from the side or that you’ll want angled shoulders, but most of the time squared shoulders are best.;
, If you have any amount of gut, you’ll want to pull it in slightly by tightening your abdominal muscles. Make your stomach as flat as possible without sucking it in too much. This will slim your waist and also push your chest out a little. It also helps to straighten your posture, which lengthens your core muscles., Walking is a common “pose” for the male model. Practice walking with your body straight and your head held high.The pose requires one leg extended forward with the toes about one inch (2.5 cm) off of the ground. The back foot should be up on the ball of your foot. One arm is extended slightly forward while the other is slightly back.Lengthen your stride slightly beyond how you'd normally walk. This helps emphasize the pose, especially if you tend to take small steps.

, You have many options for how to lean, which are variations of leaning with your back to the wall or with one of your shoulders to the wall. If you lean with your back to the wall, bend one knee and raise your foot against the wall. Leaning on a shoulder, cross the foot that is closer to the wall over the other foot.If you lean with your back to the wall, you don’t have to raise one leg, but don’t keep both legs completely straight. Bend one leg and have one forward and one back a little bit.
When you are leaning, stay almost straight up and down. You don’t want your feet so far from the wall that you are at a significant angle.

, This is a classic pose of confidence and calm. You have two options: either put your whole hand into your pocket, or put about half of your hand into the pocket leaving the thumb out. Hook your thumbs around your belt loops for a variation.Another option is to only put one hand in the pocket. With this hand position, it's good to place your other hand on the opposite shoulder or run it through your hair.

, If you want to show relaxation or thought, place your hand somewhere on your face. You have many options with this. Put your forefinger and thumb around your chin or curl your fingers and place them against your chin.Your hand on your face gives you a lot of looks to work with. Test out different hand positions to see which seems to convey what you are looking for.

, If you are wearing a full suit and tie, putting one hand to your tie is a classic and classy pose. Place your thumb and forefinger so that one is on each side of the knot of the tie. You don’t have to actually move the tie at all. Placing your hand there will give the appearance of movement.A slight variation to this pose is to put your second hand about halfway down the tie. If you were going to tighten it, this is how you’d look, but this pose is distinctly different from the one hand look.

, For a serious or commanding pose, cross your arms as you normally would. To adjust the pose for modeling, place both of your hands on the opposite arm, rather than tucking one of the hands under. Keeping both of your hands visible looks better.A variation on this look is to leave one arm hanging straight down and grabbing around the elbow with the other hand. It’s a way to cover part of the torso but gives a different impression than both arms crossed.

, Wide eyes are not generally right for male models. Raise your bottom eyelids slightly in a squint. This gives you a look of deep thought or careful consideration. It evokes confidence and poise as opposed to fear or confusion., If your chin is resting, you’ll often show extra skin under it. Push your head forward so that your neck extends. Don’t raise your chin revealing your nostrils, but angle it downward about 10% lower than normal. This removes the double chin and it also hides a portion of your neck.If pushing your chin forward does not give you the right look, think about pushing your ears forward. This will move your whole head in the way it needs to go.

, A winning smile for a male model must reveal some of your teeth. Don’t smile so big that your mouth is spread wide, but don’t keep your lips pressed together. Open your lips just enough to reveal your teeth., Unless the photo specifically calls for direct eye contact with the camera, choose a point above and beyond the camera. Look at an angle toward the left or the right of the camera or look at a point just below the camera.


These give the impression that you are thinking deeply. It also gives you a bit more of a natural look than if you are looking directly at the camera.

This background research is an essential part of developing your deeper understanding of what does and does not work when designing and it will also help you to gain an insight into the sorts of things that customers are inclined to buy rather than simply marvel over.;
, A merchandising strategy looks at fashion collections from the viewpoint of the store owner and professional buyer. Buyers are concerned with how a potential collection will sell in their store; they do not want to be left with product that doesn't sell or has to be heavily discounted. By developing a merchandising strategy, you can address the concerns of retailers as to what makes your collection likely to sell, including its price, quality and likely appeal to customers.


You can find more help on developing this aspect of you business by reading How to develop a marketing strategy and How to design a successful promotional product strategy.

, Technical design sketches are not mere renderings! These sketches describe cut angles, stitch patterns, fit and trim placement. They help you to be more aware of what is possible and what might end up being too expensive or even unrealistic. Do not cut corners on this part of your design process, it is the foundation for proving the worth of your designs.

, Most budding designers overemphasize the value of a fabric’s look and appearance. Remember to consider fabric’s impact on your production costs and how it handles repeated laundering and wear. Be aware of what customers are most interested in, such as no need to iron, forgiving drapes and plenty of ""give"" in the fabric.

, Ensure the fabrics can hold the print effectively. Get test swatches done and keep working on the pattern and print designs until you're absolutely happy that they're unique to your design range.


Make use of digital tools to help you develop patterns. You might even consider borrowing a 3-D printer to help with creating inexpensive samples.

, Look for such trims as buttons, zippers, and metallic strips that give your pieces an edge over the less well-made competition. Ensure a match between fabrics, prints, and trim, so that the pieces remain firm and will endure repeated washing. If your clothing line becomes known for its durability and reliability, this will be an absolute plus for future sales.

, Sample makers specialize, so find the one that really does click with the designs you're developing. Do not expect a sample maker to be effective at both company uniforms and swimwear. Always choose the one that matches appropriately to the designs you're making.

, The technical packet is the “order” that a sample maker understands. They follow, to the letter, the instructions in the technical packet. If you're not that great at writing instructional or technical content, hire someone who can do this well. This will only be a small investment and it's well worth it. You might also consider using basic instructional diagrams and drawings if these assist in a complete understanding and avoids confusion.

, The designer must check each item of clothing for correct stitching, fit to body, and patterns. Mistakes are annotated on the technical packet and returned to the sample maker. It is very important that you are personally across this aspect and do not leave it to anybody else. Only you will be able to spot the finer issues that you consider need remedying to be worthy of your clothing line, so make time to do this and do it with care.

, Look Books explain the unique features of your sales samples to potential fashion buyers. The Look Book can be a few pages of collages of images showing how your collection is to be worn, and by what type of consumer. Use someone who is good with book and graphic design; a good book designer will support your own good design.


If you are good with graphic design and using software programs, you may be able to do this aspect yourself.

If you’re designing a professional portfolio, you may not have explicit directions. Generally, you should include creative investigation, drawings that show your ability to translate 3D into 2D, color studies, and, if relevant, photos of 3D work that you’ve done.


Do tailor your portfolio to the specific application or the type of work that you want to do. You may want to put together more than one portfolio if you’re applying for different positions.;
, Whatever you do, you should probably try to keep different parts of one project together as much as possible. So, for example, if you explored organic structures like feathers and leaves for one project and tribal or folk art for another, try to keep the various parts of those projects together. Ultimately, you need an organizational principle because you'll have to choose how you want to present those projects.


Do you want to tell a story, showing the links between the different angles you have explored? Do you prefer the simplicity of chronological or reverse chronological order? Think about the work that you've done and see if there are any particular connections that you want to highlight.
Remember that whatever you come up with, it should be clear to a viewer what you’re trying to communicate. If you're really unsure about this, just stick with something simple, like presenting your most recent work at the front to capture the viewer and then dedicating the rest of the portfolio to showing how you got there.
Note that for professional portfolios, you should arrange your work with the most recent pieces first and put older material in the back.

, As with any project, it's easy to become so enthusiastic about an idea that you don't really plan out how you're going to execute it. Before you know it, you're overwhelmed by everything you didn't plan for. The point of this step is to make sure that you've maximized the presentation of your work and that all the parts will be as clear to an outsider as they are to you.


Don't just think about what your storyline is: assess how each part fits into that story. Play around with different arrangements and think about how each arrangement affects how your works will be perceived. You may create a diagram or an outline to illustrate why you organized your pieces in a certain way.
Show or explain your idea to someone who has worked with you throughout your creative development. Ideally, that person should be a mentor, such as a teacher or someone close to you, who has some experience with building portfolios and can provide feedback on how effective your ideas will be.

, Base your materials on the guidelines provided by your specific program. Color samples, fabric swatches, investigative pieces, sketches, photos: everything. You’re not going to put all of these items into your portfolio, but do start with the complete collection.


Note that you usually can't include actual pieces that you've made, like a corset or a pair of a shoes. Instead, have professional-looking photos taken of those pieces and include the photographs in your portfolio as exhibits of your work.

, You may not have the resources to make what you're designing, or you may not have all of the skills yet--that's okay. The person looking at your portfolio wants to see how you think and create, so show them your pen and ink sketches or your charcoal drawings. You need to have a couple of different examples of your work represented as well as figure drawings that will demonstrate your ability to represent three dimensions on a two dimensional surface. Anything more than that is bonus material.

, These pieces may be a combination of things that have inspired you, early work that you did, or first steps in a developed idea that will reappear later. Try to pick out two or three pieces for each project that you've explored.


Do include casual side projects if you’re not making a targeted professional portfolio. These unofficial works show the diversity and range of your talents. Plus they offer some insight into your interests.
If you have a large volume of work, try to select primarily from your most recent explorations. Include some of your older work to show your development, but emphasize where you're at right now, especially if you're making your portfolio for professional advancement.

, You definitely want to include your best work in your portfolio. Aim to have between one and two pieces of really high quality work per project. Go for pieces that represent your personal style and approach to design. Maybe you tend to focus on designing for a certain demographic (young, fashion forward women, androgynous men, active children, etc) or around a certain theme. You may then include pieces that illustrate your ideal customer or consumer. You may select pieces that have also been well regarded in your design classes and considered some of your best work by professors and peers.


Make sure that these works incorporate a range of different types of styles or approaches to fabric and materials. You shouldn’t include more than two pieces from one style or approach. For example, maybe you have two pieces that showcase your ability to work with leather. You should also include one to two pieces that show off your ability to work with a different material, like silk or jersey. This will illustrate that you are able to work with several different materials and in several different styles.

, You may want to begin by laying things out side by side or on a table, just to play with the order. If you choose to have separate sections for each category, figure out how you want to organize the pieces within a particular section.


Ask yourself questions like, does a chronological order make sense? Do you have clusters of works that you should group together by subject or by medium?
If you discover that something doesn’t fit well with your arrangement, don’t include it. See if you have a different piece works better with the other parts of the section. You want everything in your portfolio to fit well together.

, You can find both portfolios and presentation cases online or at good art supply stores, especially if you already live near an art or design school. Which one you need will depend on the pieces you’re presenting. The case should be neat and clean, but if you're a student, it doesn't need to be high end as long as it is functional and effectively displays or stores your works. You may want to invest in a nicer case if you are presenting your portfolio in a professional setting.


Presentation cases are like zip binders, in that they generally include sheet protectors and are best for smaller works. They are literally meant to ""present"" your work, so they're probably your best option if you're just starting out.If you have larger pieces, like paintings, you may want to invest in a portfolio, which is larger and intended more for transporting works than for presenting them. Rather than presenting your works in a ring binder-style setting, you'll probably end up with loose sheets and works stacked together securely inside.

, Often your investigative pieces, like interesting textures or structures, will involve a lot of small samples and clippings. Ideally, the person who reviews your portfolio should just be able to flip through it, so collage all of the smaller pieces on letter-sized sheets of paper to make them more readily accessible. Group items by type, or arrange them in a way that makes sense. Provide labels like ""color work"" or ""experimental glazing methods"" as needed, and add small explanatory lines or paragraphs if it is necessary for you to show the reader what you were doing.


You should use high-quality, acid free paper. Use high-quality glue with a brush that you can apply to the edges of the collage pieces and attach to the paper. Try to avoid rippling of the collage pieces when you adhere them to the paper by using one finger to gently smooth out each piece. Keep your work area tidy so there are no glue trails or sloppy edges on the collage pieces. You want the collage pieces to look professional and clean.

, You should already have laid everything out in order, but if you haven’t, start there. Check again to ensure that everything makes sense the way that you have arranged it. Then tuck all of the pieces into your case.

, You are primarily emphasizing visual design elements and obviously your main communication is through that work. However, if you want to label your creative investigations or each of the stages in a project to make it clear how you progressed, then do so. Just make sure that the label is neat and placed so that it is not covering anything important.


Use a computer to print your labels if you have poor handwriting.

, Requirements vary widely, but depending on the program, you may need to include an essay or an artist statement. Usually, the program will supply its own guidelines for an essay. Artists' statements are less program-specific. An artist statement essentially summarizes your influences, direction, and creative inspiration in a paragraph or two. If you have never written an artist statement before, How to Write an Artist Statement is very helpful.

Personalize the front cover by drawing a design or making a collage that matches the theme of your fashion collection.;
, Find regular #2 pencils with erasers that you can sketch your designs with. You may want to incorporate color into your fashion design notebook, in which case you can also purchase colored pencils, watercolors or markers., Make sure your pens use archival ink, which means it won't fade on the page over time.These pens are used to make your pieces pop. Fine black pens with pigment ink are especially useful for drawing patterns., Get fabric swatches or print out patterns that would make pretty fabric. Also, be sure to purchase fabric glue so you can paste the fabric onto the pages.

, Your sketchbook is going to make an individual statement about you and your ideas, so start by personalizing it. Reveal yourself by gathering materials that are special to you, including mementos of places you've been, and photos of family and friends., You can use one sketchbook for a whole collection or one sketchbook for several collections. If you're using one sketchbook for one collection, write the name of the collection on the front cover.If you are doing fancy prom dresses, try something like “A Night to Remember.”

, Make a list of your outfit ideas that will go on each page before you begin to sketch in your fashion design notebook. For example, write down your ideas for dresses, blouses, skirts, etc., and the details of each piece, such as what materials they'll need., If you can't freehand draw the shape of a man, woman, boy or girl, get a thin sheet of paper to lay overtop a model-like picture from a magazine or book. Cut it out so you'll have a stencil you can use for each model you draw in your sketchbook. Your fashion designs may vary depending on which size, shape and gender you use for each, so you may want to create a few different shaped stencils.Make sure your figure is creatively posing to show off your fashion design better.You can also use premade stencils for ease of use.

, Lay your stencil on top of the first page of your sketchbook, and lightly trace the outline of your model. You'll want to press very gently with your pencil, as the outline of the model should look faint so your outfit design stands out., Lightly sketch the outline of your outfit idea over the figure. Then, lightly sketch every detail of your outfit design, such as folds and ruffles, and erase any errors.Once your design looks the way you want it to, trace over it, pressing harder this time so that the outline of your design appears darker.

, Use colored pencils, water colors or markers to color in your fashion designs. Sketch patterns with a pencil, then trace over the pattern with a fine black pen to make it pop!, Attach them to the page of your sketchbook with the outfit they correspond to, and label label what type of fabric it is. Apply the glue sparingly to the page and wait for it to get tacky before pressing your fabric on top of it. You wouldn't want the glue to seep through the fabric.In the collection, make sure the outfits all match the ""mood"" of the colors. For example, red, orange and yellow could be a mood of summer or the leaves on the trees in autumn.

, You may want to label each piece with specific qualities of the garment. If you'll be sewing your own garments, leave space on the page or use the backside of the page to write down notes on the outfit measurements."

Accept an intern position.",How to Get a Job in Fashion," When you imagine your future career, you likely have some kind of idea as to what area of fashion you want to be in. Once you’ve got a basic idea, determine what kind of education is necessary. While many careers don’t technically require a degree, it is a rarity for people to make it big without the experience that comes with education.Think outside the box. If you’d like to branch into fashion by becoming a hair stylist, you can skip a bachelor’s degree and go straight to a technical school. If editing a magazine sounds like something you’d like, you may want to consider working towards a degree in communications. If opening your own store sounds like your dream job, skip the design classes and trade them for a business degree.If you’re unsure what kind of education is needed, hunt down job postings for your desired career. They will often list prerequisites and required education. Consider also reaching out to mentors within the field and ask what they recommend. Experienced people within the industry will have a better sense of what is appropriate and what to avoid.;
, Fashion schools aren’t located on every city block. The quality ones will often come with a high price tag and be at larger cities. The name of the institution may be worth the extra cost. Less expensive schools may not offer the immediate prestige of a higher profile school. By considering the total cost of your education, you can weigh the pros and cons of attending a high profile school versus a community college.When analyzing the cost of education, ensure that you consider what exactly you are paying for. This includes, but is not limited to, tuition, student fees, books, material costs, and all living expenses such as rent and food., Before enrolling to get a fashion-related degree, determine if the institution is reputable or not. Ask yourself basic questions such as if the school is well-known and respected, and who has previously graduated from it. Also consider if the school is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design.A good way to check out the respectability of a school is to look at who the alumni are. If you find many of your mentors have come from a certain institution, it is a sure sign that the school is respectable.Picking a reputable school is as important as anything. Going to school may be considerably expensive and lengthy. Wasting your precious time and money on a degree from an awful institution will come back to haunt you.Always ensure that you have put in the groundwork to find an institution worth investing your time and money.

, A portfolio is an investment into your future and should reflect the highest quality that you are able to produce. Protective sleeves should not only conserve the quality of your work but should also allow you to change the content easily. Keep the content neutral as trends change quickly. Your portfolio should evolve with your changing fashion sense.Create a budget for your portfolio and do not present it unless you are absolutely satisfied with your work.
Depending on what type of fashion you want to get into, your portfolio may either have a focus or be neutral. For example, if you want to focus on men’s athletic gear, you won’t include pink bows and lace.
Be mindful that your actual portfolio will be looked at as well as its contents. Fashion is an industry that focuses on style so present your contents in a stylish portfolio or any potential employers may make a snap judgement and not even open it.Focus on your strengths. For example, if you have difficulty spelling, make sure you have someone proofread your work. If you excel at illustrations but do not have an eye for presentation, ask a graphic designer to help you with the layout., Find someone who you would like to emulate in the industry. Whether it’s through a school or just sending emails to a company that you would like to work at, finding a mentor can be difficult so you must put in the time to show your passion. Often a mentor will be very busy and have others asking for her time and advice so make yourself stand out.Do not limit yourself to only one mentor. You may have several people giving you advice on different parts of the fashion industry. Moreover, you may have mentors outside of the industry as you can still gain valuable knowledge and skills that you’re able to translate to the fashion world. For example, you may find a mentor in marketing to help you market yourself to potential employers.

, Fashion is a very competitive industry to break into so you must pair hard work with your creative talent. There may be a lot of applicants for a single job posting so check in daily so that you’re the first to apply.Let your creativity guide your perseverance so that you stand out from the rest of the competition. Showcase your creativity with writing samples, mini-magazines, blogs, or your own fashion site. Be entrepreneurial so that potential employers see both your passion and get a sense of your sensibility., Attend events and read fashion blogs to immerse yourself in the industry and meet people. The more people you know the better chance you have at finding a job that’s suited for you. Give out your contact information with a business card or ask for a business card. Someone more established in the industry is less inclined to reach out to you after only a short chat whereas you will be motivated to seek a more in depth  conversation.It is very important that you look your best and exude your fashion sensibilities when you are attending events. Dress for the occasion and prove that you belong in this world.

, Let your personality shine to show your potential as you may not have the industry experience to get you noticed. For example, if you’ve studied in Milan or are understand how to incorporate ‘’smart’’ technology into garments, showcase what makes you unique. , Prepare yourself by researching potential questions and writing down your answers. Ask your friends or family to test you with these questions by creating a mock interviewer. Much like an exam or presentation for school, you will be less likely to fumble on your words or be nervous if you have rehearsed and studied.For example, if you are applying to a magazine the employer may ask something like, “What was your favourite article of last month’s issue and why? What section do you think you can contribute to this month?” Be prepared to go through scenarios of how you can immediately contribute to the position as well as long term. Employers are not just looking for your individual talent but also how it fits with their brand., Be passionate about the job you are applying for and the company that you are hoping to join. Employers do not want to add individuals who do not have the company's best interest in mind.Get your foot in the door by being open to a variety of positions. If you are passionate about the fashion industry, you will be able to work yourself into the position that you truly want. Be flexible with job offers as you may not see the potential that your employer does. She may see your tenacity and fashion sense eventually moving you up within the company but that you obviously lack the immediate technical skills the employer needs.

, Internships may be unpaid but garner you valuable experience and a chance to expand your network. Work hard and keep a positive attitude. Internships may lead to full-time employment if your employer sees you as a valuable asset. You must be reliable and treat yourself as an indispensable member of the team."

Also be sure that your theme can be easily conveyed through outfits, decorations, and overall feel.;
, Start with the date of the actual show, then choose the dates of designer calls, model calls, and volunteer calls. Make a save the date flyer! That way people can plan ahead and know there's something exciting happening that day. The key is to start as early as possible, it takes time to locate all the necessary people to make this show happen!

, You'll need a designer committee, model committee, volunteer committee, outreach team, decoration committee, and a financial coordinator. Assign 1-2 people as leaders for each committee or team to keep things organized. Define the duties of each section, and give deadlines to report progress.

, Your budget is the biggest factor in this step. Decide what locations are feasible with your budget according to your financial coordinator, then pick which one best suits your audience and theme of the show. At this time you should also book rooms on campus for practices and meetings.

, Now that you've decided the dates and locations, your public relations team can create flyers to advertise your meetings for designer, model, and volunteer calls along with the show flyer. Post the flyers to social media accounts and also have them printed to hang in high traffic areas around campus. (Ex. student union, eating areas, dorms)

, Once you've had your meetings for designer, model, and volunteer calls, you need to select who will actually be in the show. Choose designers that can work with the vision you've created with the theme, models that will be dedicated and show up to practice, and volunteers you can rely on to follow instructions the day of the show and help put everything together.

, You haven't put all of this together for nothing! The outreach team should call local photographers, journalists, and bloggers to be at the show for publicity. That way your school and community will recognize your organization for a fabulous fashion show.

, The day before the show is the day to bring everyone on the same page. Designers and models need to do final fittings. Models need to know who is walking, when they're walking, and what they're wearing. Volunteers go to their assigned group whether that's helping designers, models, or decorations.

, All of your hard work has come together. Your designers have beautiful pieces, your models walks are flawless, and your volunteers are making sure everything runs smoothly. Sneak a peek from backstage and look at everyone in the audience enjoying the show you put together!

This isn’t written in stone, so if a new opportunity or contact presents itself, be flexible so you can incorporate a new direction.
Reevaluate this plan every year or two. Determine if you’re on track or if you need to make adjustments.;
, There are many paths you can follow in shoe design. For example, you can design shoes for women, men, children, athletes, and so on. What appeals to you most?


Consider which aspect of the shoe design process appeals to you most. Do you love designing shoes but you don’t care about actually making them? Do you want to actually make your own shoes? Do you want to work for a big company like Adidas or Nike, or do you want to own your own boutique?

, While it is not necessary to get a degree,a degree can help you develop skills and contacts that will be useful for succeeding in the industry. Enroll in a 2- or 4-year program at an accredited institution.Your degree doesn’t need to be in shoe design. Any degree in an art- or design-related field will be applicable. These might include shoe design, industrial design, graphic design, art, product design, fashion design, and accessory design, among others., A great shoe designer will have an interesting and original look to their designs. You can start developing your own style and brand immediately.


Limit the elements that you can use, such as restricting yourself to three colors, or two types of fabric or material. This will force you to be imaginative and innovative.
Give yourself assignments. Design shoes for different types of people, for example. What are some similarities that resound through each design?
Challenge yourself to create something new every day. Design a new shoe every day for a month. You may start to see themes in your shoe designs.

, You may have a tendency to look at other shoe designs and designers for inspiration, but this risks replicating designs. Look for inspiration in other areas of art or the world. Christian Louboutin, for example, has drawn from archaeology to influence some of his designs., There is more to shoe design than just drawing pictures. The industry is roughly divided into three parts: design or creative, manufacturing, and retail.Design/creative: This is the division where you create your design. But this involves more than sketching a shoe on paper; it also involves pattern making, and for some designers, using or making original lasts to determine shoe fit (lasts are reproductions of the foot, usually made of high-quality plastic or resin).Manufacturing: This is the division that turns your design into an actual pair of shoes. Learn about the chain of manufacturing, from selection of materials to production.

Retail: This is the division that sells your shoes. Understanding the retail side involves understanding what consumers are looking for; these are the people who will be wearing your shoes. Who are the consumers you’re hoping to target? Also consider what stores and buyers are looking for and how your shoes might suit their needs.

, Following the industry and trends in shoes will help you figure out where you can be cutting-edge and stand out. This is a competitive industry and being on top of trends is a necessity.Read design and fashion magazines to keep up with trends.

, One of the most important skills that a shoe designer has is the ability to envision something and translate that onto paper. The goal here is not to replicate what you can already see. Rather, you should imagine a shoe and sketch that out.


Sketching doesn’t have to be done on physical paper. You might use design software to create your shoe designs.

, Shoe design is not all done with pencil and paper sketches. You will need to know design software, such as the Adobe Creative Suite. This includes PhotoShop, Illustrator, InDesign and other programs. Be able to recreate your pencil sketches on the computer.


Also learn how to use computer-aided design (CAD) programs. These will enable you to create 3D digital designs.

, When you learn the different parts that go into creating a shoe from a design sketch, you will understand more about the entire shoe-making process.Make patterns for different types of shoes.

, Assemble your best shoe designs that demonstrate your skill and versatility as a designer. Aim for about 20 designs for a physical portfolio and 30 for an online portfolio. Keep the content fresh by updating your portfolio once in a while with new work.


Include a designer’s statement, in which you talk about your influences and inspirations. Also include an up-to-date resume.

, An internship is a chance for you to work with a designer and assist them in the everyday work of creating shoes. This may also expose you to other roles in a shoe company that you hadn’t previously consideredCheck with your favorite companies to see what their internship requirements are.
Some internships are not paid, but they may offer college credit in exchange for your work. It is best to receive some remuneration for your work if possible.

, Working in a shoe store or the shoe department of a major department store will expose you to all kinds of customers and salespeople. These are, after all, the core people who will come in contact with your shoes on a daily basis when you are a designer yourself. Get to know the business from the ground up by having some experience on the retail side.

, Just like in retail, working in manufacturing will give you a lot of insight into how shoes are produced. You might witness how decisions are made and how the shoes are actually put together.


This might also give you good contacts for manufacturing your own shoe designs, when you get to that point.

, A design assistant, pattern maker, sketching assistant and production assistant are different types of entry-level jobs that allow an individual to work directly with shoe designers. Through these positions, you can help convert the shoe designers' ideas into drawings and actual patterns.

, Start attending openings, trade shows, trunk shows, professional gatherings and so on. Dress smartly and introduce yourself to people. Don’t be pushy, but do focus on chatting with people in a friendly way.


Bring business cards with your contact information printed on them. This will help people remember your name and make it easy to contact you if an opportunity comes up.
You may not want to restrict yourself completely to shoe-related events. Art events more generally, for example, will be gathering places for artistically minded people who may be in a good position to help you move up in the industry.

, An informational interview is a chance to talk to someone who does the kind of job you want to do. Contact a shoe designer and set up a time to talk about the industry and their job.


Be sure to plan a time and location that is convenient for the designer.
This is not an interview for a job. You are presenting yourself as someone interested in learning more about the industry, rather than as someone looking to be hired on the spot.

, A professional organization is a network of people who participate in a similar profession. These organizations often host conferences, advocate policy, promote education and professional development, and give awards. Most are member-based, and you will have to pay an annual fee to join.


Some examples related to shoe design include: Industrial Designers Society of America,American Institute of Graphic Arts,American Apparel and Footwear Association,and Association of Sewing and Design ProfessionalsMany professional organizations have regional or local chapters and student chapters.

, Talking regularly with someone who has a solid career in shoe design can give you good insight and advice as you progress on your trajectory. You might find a mentor through a professional organization, an internship or through a university design program., Do your research on finding a good, reliable manufacturer who can produce the quality of shoe that you are looking for. In addition, their manufacturing must produce a shoe that is representative of what you have designed. Manufacturers can vary greatly, even in terms of the types of shoes they typically produce.


For example, thin-soled shoes with thin leather are more often manufactured in Portugal, while heavier-soled, rounded shoes are more often made in England or Hungary.Shop around for a manufacturer. Take your design to a few different manufacturers and ask them to make a sample shoe. Compare these to find the best choice for you.

, A trunk show is an event where you sell your work (shoes, accessories, and dresses are sold at most trunk shows) at a boutique or store. You attend the trunk show as well, talking and selling to customers. This usually lasts from a few hours to a couple of days, and offers special deals on your items that may not normally be available in stores. They are excellent promotional events, helping get your name out there., Find a local boutique that has an aesthetic that complements your shoe design style. Ask if they will carry your shoes in their store. The store will normally ask for a percentage of the sales in exchange for selling your shoes.

, Set up an online shop, either through your own website or through a storefront website, such as Etsy. This is usually an easier first step to selling your own shoes, rather than opening your own store.

The headshot is useful for submitting to most companies, because it shows your face in the clearest way. The full body shot reveals your body structure, important when marketers want to produce a particular type of image.


Neither of these photos need to be professional. You can even take them on your phone. Just make sure the image is clear and free of shadows.
Do not use a photo of you in a group setting, as this makes it difficult to determine which one you are.
Do not make a face in any of these photos. Not a “duck” or “kissy” face, not a modeling “hard” look. Instead, use a photo in which you are smiling and appear friendly and approachable.
Use a tasteful photo in the full body shot, making sure you aren’t wearing revealing clothing or are attempting to be “implied nude.” Wear a tasteful, attractive outfit.;
, For modeling photos and interviews, the clothes should not be center-point of your photos. Modeling is about selling the person in the clothes, so the viewer should not even feel like commenting on the outfit because they are so drawn to the individual.Wear only solid colors. No prints, images, or words.
Make sure the clothes fit properly; not too tight or too baggy.
Don't wear jewelry. Large jewelry especially is distracting and can be seen as tacky.

, You don’t need modeling experience to come up with a good resume for modeling. Instead, if you have very little or no experience, begin the resume with your personal stats followed by experience that suggests you enjoy interacting with people. The final portion should showcase any special skills you have.


You should find an example of a modeling resume and fill it in with your information.Personal stats include shoe size, dress size, hair color, eye color, face shape, body measurements, and any other physical detail you feel would be useful for promoting products. Don’t lie about these things; since you appear in person at gigs, the lie will quickly become obvious and tarnish your reputation (not to mention lose you a job).The experience section includes any time you have hosted an event, done public speaking, bartended, worked in customer service, performed or assisted at a trade show, and any number of socially-oriented tasks or work.
Special skills useful on a modeling resume include speaking another language, singing, MCing, DJing, fighting styles, and anything that could be used in a promotional setting.

, For your resume, you need honest and accurate measurements. This is because model recruiters are looking for specific sizes, and if you show up not fitting the outfits they have for you, you lose a job. Instead, take good measurements and put them on top of your resume.For women: measure your height barefoot, the bust, smallest part of your waist, the largest part of your hips and bottom, and leg from crotch to ankle.For men: measure the neck at the Adam's apple (loosening it slightly with one finger), your height barefoot, waist and hips like women, chest below armpits at the fullest part, inseam from crotch to ankle, and sleeve from middle of the neck (between shoulders) and over the shoulder and elbow to the wrist., Although it is tempting to reach out directly to companies to find gigs, most jobs come through third-party modeling agencies. These agencies partner with companies to supply them with models.You should register yourself on the website of these agencies before approaching the companies themselves.


Some reputable modeling agencies include Fusion Event Staffingand Cosibella Promotional Modeling.Find modeling agencies in your area by asking local models that you have met. You can also find them by using internet search engines and using terms like ""modeling agency"" with your city name.

, The next place to discover real modeling gigs is craigslist. This is especially helpful for finding work in your local area. Look in the sections titled Gigs, Talent, or Job, and search for positions such as “brand ambassador” and “promo girl.”You can use other classifieds websites like Bookoo.com and Freecycle.com, as well as searching the classifieds section of your local newspaper in print or on their website.

, Facebook is a convenient forum for gathering people of like minds. Joining Facebook groups in your area with “promo girl” or “promotional model” in the title will most likely list promotional gigs quite frequently.


For example, search for a group title like “Brand Ambassadors of ________”, inserting your city name. If the group exists, you will likely find plenty of work right in your town.

, You can of course always use good old Google to find local gigs. Use search terms like “promo girl” and “brand ambassador” followed by the word “agency” or “company.” It’s always best to apply to agencies, not directly to companies, since companies outsource their modeling hires to these agencies.

, There are also portfolio websites where you can post your information for agencies to look up. Just fill in a profile with one of your prepared photos, and agencies might reach out to you.


Websites like Model Mayhemand One Model Placeare popular portfolio database websites.
A profile should include a good head shot, your age (important for when agencies look for specific ages), your measurements, personal website, location, information about your experiences and what you enjoying modeling for, and others things that the website prompts you to enter.

, Instead of focusing on networking with agency managers, look to other promo models to help you find work. Although some models might not give you a referral because they fear losing work themselves, many will be happy to tell you where to find their booking agencies.


Ask other promo models who helps them book gigs and whether you should fill out an online form or contact the modeling agency manager directly. Remember, this is not the same thing as talking to a company owner—you are looking for the agency who books the models, and whether or not this agency can be networked in person.

, When applying for direct positions you have found in your job search, have a cover letter ready to go with your resume. This letter should include details like what things you do to remain professional, why you are easy to work with, and what makes you a good promotional model.This goes for both internet and in-person applications, although it is likely most of your applying will be done online.
If you are headed to an event where different companies and promo models will be present, it is wise to bring along your resume, cover letter, and promotional photos. Then you can hand them over if you get the chance to meet a modeling agency manager.

, Many promotional modeling gigs require brand-identifying outfits or costumes. If they don’t give you clothes to wear, they usually want you to dress in a particular way. You should always check into the type of clothes required for the gig before signing a contract. If you’re uncomfortable with what is required of you, back out.


For example, many beverage girl gigs require revealing dresses or tight outfits. Since these girls are usually hired to promote alcohol at events with men present, the commitment to such outfits might inspire flirtation. If you are uncomfortable with attention like this, you shouldn’t sign up.

, You can’t just stand there and “look pretty.” Promotional models have to be energetic, outgoing, and interactive. They aren’t like the models on game shows who just stand still and press buttons. The goal of most promotional gigs is to pass out samples or flyers, often getting consumer information in return.


You must be able to get people involved in events, and get them excited enough about products to purchase them.
You should be able to enjoy yourself in crowds. If you look like you’re having fun, the consumer will too.

, Since many promotional models must travel to events, making sure you don’t rely on public transportation or a lemon car is key. On top of this, you will probably be shipped any number of promotional materials needed to showcase at an event, and you must be able to transport them safely.


Promotional materials may include free samples, flyers, and character costumes, and you will most likely end up at malls, events, and various stores in your local area., Since most models are contract workers, this means they have to pay taxes from their earnings on their own. Models must also come up with their own health insurance, or pay the annual fee for not having health insurance.


The 2016 health insurance penalty was 2.5% of household income, and this rate is rising each year.Go to the HealthCare.gov website to find an insurance plan if you don’t have one yet.
You will receive a 1099-MISC from the agencies you model for each year. The sum of earnings on these forms is what is taxed by the IRS. The 2016 self-employment tax rate was 15.3%, and that is how much you should save from each paycheck throughout the year.One modeling agency that does provide a W-2—meaning they pay the taxes—is Across the Nation, a rarity among promo modeling agencies."

Create a portfolio.,
Make a photo book.,
Work for free at first.,
Get an internship in fashion photography.",How to Become a Fashion Photographer1," This is essential if you want to become a fashion photographer. You will need to create a portfolio that showcases your professional work.


These days, many photographers are creating websites in order to showcase their best work. You can do this for free through sites like WordPress or get a website professionally done.Make sure that your website is updated with your freshest work and shows a variety of what you can do. You want to display your fashion photographs. If you have none to display yet, you need to work on taking some photos before you seek to book a shoot.;
, Many people will want to see what is called a book. In this photo book, you will reprint your best photos to show to agents and magazines.


This book generally includes 4 X 5 inch transparencies to show off the work. Generally, you want to include 20 photos you’ve done in your book. Choose pictures that show your personality as a photographer. If your work has actually been in a magazine, show this.
Choose the images to match the job you’re seeking. You will want to tailor the choices and book for different jobs. Throw a few images into every book that demonstrate you have range, though.

, This is a great way to build a portfolio. You may have to do a few shoots for free for awhile. This is just the way it works. Many aspiring models would love to have you take photos of them because they are trying to make it in their field, too.Don’t do this forever or let yourself be taken constantly advantage of. However, you should consider working for free to practice and build your portfolio when you’re just starting out. Try to work alongside networked and very talented people.
How can you find places to work for free? Contact modeling agencies and non-profit organizations and offer your services. Use word-of-mouth to find aspiring models who need photos taken or advertise your services online (some people may be wary of such offers, though, so be prepared to provide your existing portfolio and explain your training in college and so forth). You could also ask a college fashion design program or beauty school if you could take photos.
Even if you’re not getting paid, you will learn a lot and make valuable connections that could lead to paying jobs. Networking is extremely important if you want to make it as a fashion photographer. If you work for free, you do gain the benefit of retaining creative control, and this can sometimes allow you to do your best work.

, Another way you can build your portfolio when you are just starting out is to obtain an internship.


You can find many sites that list internships in fashion photography online. Simply Google the term ""fashion photography internships"" and many will come up. You may need to take a related internship in photography if you can't find something in fashion photography immediately.The typical posting for fashion photography may require you to have some portfolio samples (even if these are things you have done for free or through a college class) and they will often ask you to have your own equipment. You may need to relocate to New York or overseas for the best internships."

Do your research.,
Get a photo agent.,
Market yourself.,
Start a fashion blog.",How to Become a Fashion Photographer2," Before cold calling a photo editor in an attempt to get work, you should do your homework. Understand, for example, what the magazine does.


Know the name of the actual photo editor, rather than just referring to him or her generically. Call the magazine, and ask for the name and title. Pick a magazine that suits your style.
Label everything. You will want to make sure you include your name and phone number when sending in your work. Don’t send in original photos. Include a stamped, self-addressed envelope if you want to get the work sent back to you.

, There are agencies that exist solely to help sell photographers’ work to clients. They can help get you jobs. The goal is to be booked for shoots, but some magazines will buy your stock photos too.


Some agencies will represent people who are just starting out. Getting an agent can save you time so that you can focus on your craft and let them do the negotiations.
Agents will often try to resell your work in different markets, too, and they may know the markets better than you do. Research the agent, and find one who doesn’t represent photographers who do exactly the same kind of work as you do. Otherwise the other photographers might feel too competitive. Act like your first contact with the agent is a job interview.

, These days, good photographers get their work seen and get jobs by using social media as well as traditional portfolios.


Have a professional social media presence in which you focus on creating a brand for yourself and in which you present some of your best work.
Only put your best work out there into the world, though, whether it’s through social media or in a portfolio book. You must market yourself constantly in order to make it as a fashion photographer.

, A fashion blog is a great way to showcase your work and to even start branding yourself by building an online reputation for yourself.Pick your own domain name and make the mission of your blog clear. Keep the blog focused on your latest and your best work.You can create a blog through a free service like WordPress. Make sure you keep the blog up-to-date. It can help you come up when people search keywords. Make sure the blog photos are consistently professional, using proper lighting and backdrop. Think of it as an extension of your formal portfolio."
"
Exhibit your photos in an art gallery.,
Focus on quality.,
Consider supplementing your income.,
Consider moving.",How to Become a Fashion Photographer3," This is one way to get the attention of professionals who will pay you for your work or hire you for jobs.


Create a relationship with a photo gallery first. You can find listings of photo galleries through Photograph, which is a bimonthly listings guide, and through the Association of International Photography Art Dealers.Typically the photographer gets 50 percent of the photo sale proceeds.
Telephone the gallery, and ask about submission policies. Galleries have different rules. Some will only review submissions several times a year. If they are interested, they will want to see a portfolio. When you are starting out, your work might be publicized as inventory versus getting its own show.

, It’s important that your work be consistent. This is very important. You should focus on making every photograph, especially those in your portfolio, the highest quality.


Be creative, though. Make trends, don’t just follow them. Create your own signature style that is true to yourself. Make sure to capture your subjects' emotions and personalities in your shoots. Your work will stand out more if you have a consistent style that is your own. You want people to know photos are your own simply because they have your own look.
Invest in good equipment to ensure quality. If you don’t have a good camera, you’re not going to take professional quality photos. Buy a few quality lenses, and learn to work with natural light. Be careful with the details. The clothes shouldn’t be wrinkled. The backdrop shouldn’t be dirty, and so forth.

, It can be really hard to make a living as a struggling photographer when you’re starting out.


It’s often a good idea to have back-up plans to make money while you’re trying to get off the ground. You could take corporate photos or photos for weddings, for example.
You should assume you won’t make money for awhile, and you should consider whether this is the career for you as a result., Let’s be honest. If you really want to make it big as a fashion photographer, it’s the coasts where you will probably need to be.


New York and Los Angeles have thriving fashion scenes. Europe does too. If you want to stay in your small town, you’re probably not going to have many opportunities.It’s possible in some midsize cities to get work for catalogs or local modeling agencies, but being on the big city scene is the best way to network if you want to break it big.

"

Take college courses.,
Learn editing.,
Be persistent.",How to Become a Fashion Photographer4," You may need to get professional training in fashion photography to learn how to advance from being an amateur to a professional. Schools in big cities with thriving fashion scenes, like London and New York, will be more likely to offer courses in fashion photography.Most university offer photography classes, and some also offer photography degrees. Research a university in your area and sign up. Professors sometimes also have good contacts in the industry. Some schools also offer fashion photography certificate programs.You will be trained in every stage of a fashion shoot, from model direction to marketing.
Fashion photographers are not required to have college degrees, but you can learn a lot about lighting, digital photography and how the field works at university or trade school.

, The best fashion photographers are experts at editing their photos to meet client needs, not just at taking the photos.


You will need to learn how to use computer software to crop photos, correct flaws in them and to alter images. You will need to be able to communicate clearly with clients about their needs and desires. Most professional photographers use editing software to improve the look of their photos.
You can learn these skills by taking a class in photo editing at a local college or technical school, unless you can find a way to learn them on your own.

, There are a lot of people who want to become fashion photographers, so you should be aware that you will likely get a lot of rejection at first. Fashion photography is not an easy field.


Keep at it. Send out your work to many magazines and agents. Keep trying. Improve your photography with more practice to increase your chances of acceptance. Network!
Get a recommendation. Some magazines will only look at portfolios from people they know. So network! You can find someone who knows people in the places where you want to work if you become involved in the industry and industry functions.

Ask your friends what they think of your designs and get their opinions.,
Have extreme passion, and drive to become a fashion designer.",How to Become a Fashion Designer when You Are a Teen," Write down your ideas, or draw sketches on paper, so that you have a better picture of it.


If you have an idea for a design, sketch it! Paper and pencils are not difficult to find and it is better to do this before you forget. Modification is the biggest step.
Carry a sketchbook around with you at all times. Pin in fabrics you like, label colors and fabrics you will want to use. Note down anything you find inspirational.
Make a portfolio to hold your designs. You might need them later on.;
, Keep up to date with the latest fashions by checking out books, subscribing to fashion magazines, checking fashion sites, etc. Learn how the business works.


Spend some time digging through old and new fashion magazines; you can get some ideas and inspiration from previous designs. Look at sewing patterns and clothing catalogues too.

, To be a fashion designer you will need to have some experience in actually making clothes.

, Go through department stores and fabric shops hunting for fabric that you love that is not too expensive.

Maybe even start your own website for your fashions, or get a friend who is good with computers to help you do so.
Start a YouTube channel to show off your latest clothes!
Ask the teachers and administrators at your school to consider doing a fashion show to raise money. Design your own creations and show them off! Wear your fashion and be your fashion.

, Ask them if you should add anything or remove anything to make your designs better.

, A lot of devotion, time, stress, and effort goes into becoming one; and it doesn't happen overnight. It's something you work at, and don't give up on. It has to be something you love and want to be and have success in.

, Grab hold of all you can about fashion. This includes reading about the history of fashion and biographies of fashion designers. Also read about how to do fashion designing, to find out the sorts of challenges, pitfalls and tips you need to know.

, If you're not yet old enough to attend a design school, at least get drawing or art lessons. These will help you to discover good drawing techniques and will allow you to perfect styles that work best for you. Tell the art teacher what you're hoping to do and they might help you do more fashion-related projects. Eventually, it is a good idea to aim for getting a qualification in fashion design; it's a very competitive world now and education can set you ahead of others. It's not for everyone but it certainly can help.

, If you don't already know how to do this, get some lessons. It will be invaluable to know how cloth works in relation to stitching, texture, cuts and flow, etc. and only someone able to sew will truly get a feel for this. Fashion design is both art and hard slog, so don't be afraid to get deeply involved with your sewing machine. It'll be quite some time before you can order someone else to do the sewing from your designs!


Knowing how to read, use and design patterns is an essential part of being a good fashion designer. Start with reading and using, then move to making your own. The more comfortable you are with pattern-making, the less tempted you'll feel to reuse stale ideas.

, Fabrics are diverse and include both natural and manmade, and mixtures of the two. There are modern and vintage fabrics to learn about too, and you should make a decision as to which you prefer.


Knowing how fabric handles is essential for a good designer, and the earlier you learn this, the better. There are good reference books in libraries about fabrics you can borrow from the library; these will teach you about the weft and weave, about textures, strength, behavioral qualities of the fabrics, etc.

, All artists are inspired by prior artists; it is how art grows and changes over time. However, it is also important to find your own expression and not fall slave to certain styles or fads that won't stand the test of time and won't let you stand apart.


Allow yourself to develop over time. You can't expect to have your style emerge overnight; it will take time and it will also require constant noting of the things you like and how you'd use them within your own designs.
Keep secret Pinterest boards. Add the fashion inspirations to it as you come across them. Use this to keep a track of things that you think would be good to evolve or merge into your own designs.

, Use the cloth, the colors and the patterns to inspire you and bring forth creative and unique ideas.

, You will find that your ideas change over time; that's good, it keeps your designing fresh. However, you might like to come up with a ""signature"" element to your designs that can be carried through your works over the years. Think about what element that might be now––it might be a particular cut, a color or pattern, an addition to one part of the clothing, etc.

, Explain what you're hoping to do. Ask them if you can see what they do and maybe even ask for work experience. You may need to sign a confidentiality agreement saying that you won't share what you've seen or copy anything; that's standard, as it protects them.


If you offer to intern, you might end up with an employment offer if you're good at what you do.

Make note of the colors of costumes and the materials they’re made out of, and practice recognizing factors that influence these decisions.


Time periods and character personalities are just a couple of the different factors that influence costume design.;
, Do whatever you can to expose yourself to a costume designing environment. This can mean being an unpaid backstage helper at a local theater or working on a project with the film club at the school you attend. Keep taking these opportunities while also applying for internships and entry level jobs that can potentially get your foot in the door., Each employer has different educational standards, but you’ll most likely need at least an associate’s degree to have a shot at entry level employment. While getting a costume design degree, you’ll learn about drawing, tailoring, fashion history, stage makeup, pattern design, and more.You can also get into costume design with a degree in graphic design, visual art, or fashion design.
If you’d like to get a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree, this will only improve your value and skill set.

, Having a solid portfolio is essential if you want to start a career in costume design. Potential employers are going to want to see proof of your creativity and design skills. It’s best to have your portfolio in more than one format.


Consider having both an online version and a photographic version of your portfolio., While design itself doesn’t require that you be flawless with a sewing machine or phenomenal at drawing, building skills in relevant artistic areas such as these will make it that much easier to properly execute your costume ideas. Practicing these creative skills can also teach you to pay attention to detail and develop a better awareness of the world around you., While the overall goal of costume design is to design, you can’t do that unless you first develop a thorough understanding of who is wearing the costume and why they’re wearing it. Study the characters forwards and backwards before you start the designing process.

It’s helpful to have specific references to become inspired by and base your vision on., Good communication skills are absolutely vital to efficiently designing and creating costumes.You’re the one with the vision, and you’re the one who will have to communicate that vision to others clearly and effectively in order to have a strong end product.

As a designer, you’ll often be in a leadership position where you rely on others’ help.Whenever you find yourself in this role, do your best to direct others in a clear, respectful, authoritative fashion.

, As a costume designer, you’ll often be working under pressure. Plays, films, and TV shows all have showtimes and air dates that can’t be delayed, as well as money limitations. Take any opportunities to design costumes within a time frame or with a tight budget.

When doing your own projects, commit to a date it’ll be done by and a maximum amount of money you’re allowed to spend on it. This will help you learn this skill before actually having strict budgets and deadlines to adhere to., As a costume designer, you’ll be expected to think creatively and have an eye for detail.Whenever fun or even outlandish ideas come to you, sketch them in a drawing notebook and develop them more over time. Then, start attempting to put your sketches to life one clothing item at a time with a sewing machine., While you’re a design student, do your best to make and keep in contact with successful people in your field. If you make strong connections with fashion designers, playwrights, and others, you may be able to use them as references later on.Attend any relevant events, including local plays, fashion shows, etc. that you hear about and can network at.

, One of the very best ways to get a start in costume designing is simply by saying “yes.” Accept any and every small opportunity that comes your way and one of them may eventually lead to a big one., Once you’ve learned all about costume design and have developed a skill set, try selling some of your work.

Do prom dress alterations for students at the local high school.Consider designing, making, and selling halloween costumes for people on Etsy.

, It’ll take some work in an entry level position to set you up for costume designer jobs. Use your connections, volunteer work, and personal sales to apply for any of these positions that you hear about. Doing this will give you necessary experience and also give you even more networking opportunities., The Costume Designers Guild was established in 1953 and now has nearly 750 members.

While deciding upon a username, make sure the one you choose is also free on Twitter and any other social networking site you might want to promote yourself on. Having the same username will make it easier for you to promote yourself and bring new members to the webcam site you are on.

,


Upload high quality pictures of yourself. They should be colorful, taken from different locations, and able to grab a member’s attention. A picture says a thousand words, make sure yours are saying things to attract members.

Have a MINIMUM of 7 pictures spread over 3 albums. We see time and time again that you will get more visitor and make more money the more high quality photos you have.


Pick your best attention grabbing picture as your main profile picture. This is the picture that will be listed when you are online. When members are looking through the gallery of online models, you want that picture to entice them to enter your room.
Fully fill out your description. Explain in detail about yourself (not personal information!) and what you are willing to do on cam in private chats. Make sure to mention your kinks or fetishes, so members who search for those specific kinks and fetishes will find you.
Some sites give you the opportunity to place text at the top of the chat box. It’s a good idea to use this as a sales opportunity – saying what you are willing to do and for how many tokens. When you get signed up you can look at some of the other models to get ideas about what to say here.

,


Use a high quality webcam. A 1 megapixel webcam could work, but the better your video quality, the more money you will make. Most sites list which models have high quality cams, so they have more traffic in their rooms. A standard high quality webcam accepted on all cam sites and used by many models is Logitech 720p Webcam Pro 900. Another one is the Logitech HD Pro Webcam C910 which is very high quality and HD. The demand for models with HD video streams is growing and this cam delivers.
Lighting, lighting, lighting! Make sure you have enough lighting so you show up on webcam. Have at least two light sources, but three or four can help prevent your face from having shadows on it. Just make sure you aren’t lit up like a Christmas tree. Too much lighting isn’t good either.
Clean your work area. Make sure the area around you and behind you are clean and clutter free. You can do a little decorating to make your surroundings attractive and to set the mood, but you want the focus to be on you, not on the items and objects in your surroundings.
Make sure any toys or props you may use on cam are nearby. You don’t want to leave people waiting by going off cam to find something, and if a toy or prop is within reach, you can show it to those viewing to entice them to take you to private chat since they know you have it.
Be dressed in something alluring and that highlights your assets. Also make sure to have any extra outfits nearby. Some people like to role play, so if you have other outfits handy, they will take you to private chat if the outfit fits the role they want.
Plan ahead! When it comes to props, toys, and clothing, think about what you will want to use, what might be requested, and have them all ready. You can also plan any games or contests you may want to play with the members in your room (If you are on a site that allows tipping).
Groom yourself! Before you go on cam, shower and get yourself clean. Shave. Do up your hair and put on any makeup you wish to. Remember, you are the product, so the better you look, the more money you can make.
Take a deep breath and relax. It will be okay. Being nervous can show up on cam.

,


Take a deep breaths and relax. Then go live. First and foremost, while appearance was stressed in the Pre-Show, you don’t need to have super model looks. The most important part of webcam modeling is your personality. People want to get to know who you are. Don’t be afraid to be yourself.
Have fun! Don’t start a show thinking you will make money. You will, but models who are just on cam to make money, aren’t nearly as fun as those who are trying to enjoy the job. People will pay for time with you if they find you fun and entertaining. So let out your wild and fun side. If you’re not having a good time, chances are your viewers aren’t either.
Know your limits. Viewers will often times want to get to know you on a personal level. Make up a fake name, location, ect. Pick a location that is in a similar place – if you live in Oregon, say you’re from Nevada. The viewer really doesn’t know. If you don’t want to show your face, then wear a mask or carefully adjust the camera. “Know thyself.”
Browse through a few cams and get an idea of what they’re offering. Think about your “room” as a business but remember customer service, great products, and don’t let it get too boring. No one wants a waitress or waiter who is grumpy only looking for tips – they want an experience. Give it to them!
Camming can be fun! Make it fun.
Thank people for their tips and nice comments. Make conversation. People want more than masturbator, they want a connection. Virtually.
Know the rules and regulations of the site. Some cam sites don’t let you smoke on screen. Some (most) often ban you from giving out your Skype or PayPal. Abide by the rules or be always worried about having your account and funds frozen
Make use of your audio. People prefer to hear you speaking than typing. You can also say a lot more with your voice, since you can use different tones and inflections that aren’t available by type. People will get to hear you giggle, you whisper, and your moans. That’s part of the package they will want to pay for.
Always be friendly and polite! If someone decides to act disruptive in your room, politely ask him or her to stop. If he or she doesn’t, don’t get into a fight, just kick or ban the person. Getting into it with the person will only take your attention away from those who want to pay you for that attention.
Acknowledge and chat with everyone. Those who are paying members of the site should hold more of your attention, but free guests can sometimes be turned into paying members. So don’t ignore anyone.
Learn nicknames or real names of the people who regularly visit your chatroom. The more they feel like you know each other, the more likely they will return and continue to take you to private chat. Make sure to always be welcoming to new people though, they could take you private, and become new regulars. The more regulars you have, the more time you will spend in private chat making money.
If someone asks if you are single, tell him or her you are, even if you aren’t. This gives the fantasy in his or her mind that someday you two could become involved in a relationship. Of course it never will happen, but the fantasy could keep the person around as a paying regular.
Beware of Beggars! You will encounter people who will beg you to do something in free chat. Usually it involves showing a part of your body or you doing something. Sometimes they will even promise to take you to private chat, but usually won’t. It's nice to be responsive to members, and as you gain more experience, you will realise which requests are good to follow through on and which other ones are best left till someone pays.
Don’t be afraid to make use of the toys and props you have at the ready! And do let those in your room know, what you have at the ready. That will lead to more private chats.
Take the time to get up every so often. Dance around a little, keep your blood flowing and your enthusiasm up. If you are just sitting there looking bored, you will find it much harder to get paid for private chats.

,


Most websites show to their members which models are new, so you will be getting people coming into your room to check out the new model. During this period, do your best to turn those curious people into regular members. Following the tips listed above will help.
Set a Schedule! Before you even begin your first show, decide upon the schedule you want to have for your times on cam. This will make it much easier for those who want to find you later, since they will know when you are on next. This is one of the most important keys to being a top paid model. When your paying regulars know when you’ll be online, they will more likely be online, so you’ll spend more of your online cam time in paid private chats instead of in free chat.
Use Twitter. When first starting out, search for the Twitter accounts of popular models. Then begin to follow their male followers. No more than 40 per 8 hours. Although Twitter supposedly lets you do 1,000 follows a day, take it slow and steady. Some of them will follow you back, so within a few days, you should have a large amount of potential clients to advertise to. For example, when you are online, send out a tweet! Send status updates, pictures, promotions, and/or discounts. Just don’t over tweet.
On your Twitter account make sure you have a picture of yourself that will encourage people to visit you on cam. Also tweet regularly. You don’t need to be on Twitter all day but 3 – 4 tweets a day will make sure you show up in feeds.

Show your personality in your tweets, you should be tweeting when you are going online but if this is all you do people will feel they are getting hard sold to. Tweet pictures of yourself, what you are doing with your day, stuff you like etc etc


Promote in your profile. You can do this on Twitter or other social network sites. Add a link to your website in your profile. This way, when you add people and they come to see who you are, they may click. Use bitly to make your links small and customize their looks.
Create your own website about yourself and your webcam activities. Although make sure you don’t include personal information that will allow people to find you. Also make sure to get privacy for the domain, so people can’t look up your information. A well-made website could provide you with more traffic from Google and other search engines. It also allows you to have another place to interact with potential clients and regulars.
Make a Facebook fan page. Just avoid linking it with your real Facebook account. On the Facebook page, you can interact with people as well, turning some into regulars. You can also promote your online times or when you come on cam unscheduled.
Make use of all of the webcam site’s features! Some have fan clubs, which gives you more ways to make money. Others let you sell pictures and videos. Take advantage of those things and promote them on your social networks.

But never forget that this is a sex job and you're in the business of selling sexual fantasies. While it is ultimately up to you what you do during your paid performances, in order to get into a paid show you have to keep the chat room topic all about sex.;
, You want chatters to think that you aren’t there for the money but you’re just horny and you get off on being watched. You can put this in your bio or express this idea through comments you make to the group as a whole.

, Always be flirty and slightly evasive if someone is asking you directly if you’ll do something in a private show that you’re not comfortable doing rather than coming right out and saying no. “No” is a turn-off and will cause chatters to exit your room.

, Instead of badgering, pleading, or nagging chatters to take you into a private show, you should offer subtle or not-so-subtle incentives. For example, “I can’t wait to take my clothes off in private!” Or hold up toys that you want to use on yourself during a private show. And don’t forget to show off sexy outfits you’ll try on for your lucky private show customers, too.

, Frequently update your bio and pictures to keep yourself fresh and exciting to your regular customers in this safe sex work.

, Many internet model jobs allow you to write diary or blog entries. This is a good way to build up relationships with your regulars. You can put updates in there throughout the week about your real or virtual-persona life.

You can usually find promo codes for these and other sites that let you create a free profile. If you can't find one, email them asking for one. It can't hurt to ask.;
, The talent must be polished and confident enough to do the job with little or no direction if needed.

, Does your portfolio or resume show you have worked and trained successfully in the past?

, Often they have to make a hiring decision within 30-60 seconds. If they cast you and they have not worked with you before they are taking an educated risk. A good impression is made by being early, prepared, looking like a professional and having amazing charisma!

, Can you think quick on your feet? Sign of an experienced professional. Can you make the adjustments they ask for?

, Are you worth the money they are paying? If the client is going to pay a rate of $400-$1500 a day, you must show them you are worth it. They have to account for every dollar spent.

, When auditioning many models or actors it becomes hard to differentiate between each talent. You need to make a creative statement and lasting impression within the context of the project.

, It is natural not to feel natural. (That is why it is important to constantly be practicing and training).

, This business is all about networking and exposure.

, Ability takes time. Be patient with yourself and your agent. You can spot an experienced model or actor a mile away. You cannot fake it!

,, Track what happened, how you did, things that worked and things you need work on. How you adjusted to each audition, who did you meet with, etc.

, When you book a job, always make a note on what the project was, what part you played and who the production company, casting director or client was. Update your resume and make copies for your agent and yourself. That may land you your next job.

, After all, it is a business.

, That is why most actors and models fail! Circle yourself with positive people who are also in the industry or support you in your passion. At the same time, don't fall for the hype or for over-glossing of other people's virtues. Be strong-minded and self-trusting.

The more classes and experiences you get as an actor, the better the chances are for success.",How to Get Started in the Acting and Commercial Modeling Industry," You'll make mistakes - that is part and parcel of getting started.;
, If you want to get acting work, then creating a head shot will be the first photo you need. If commercial modeling work also interests you, then you will need a composite sheet. Commercial models, unlike fashion models, have no weight, height or age restrictions. Commercial models are cast for all of the non-fashion ads you see in magazines, newspapers, direct mail pieces, on billboards, posters, product boxes, the side of a bus, the internet, etc.

, All actors will need a head shot at some point. This is a photo on an 8X10 piece of paper, with a resume on the back.


Some commercial models begin their career using an actor's head shot.
At some point, commercial models will want to produce a composite sheet, also known as a comp or Zed card. This card which can be any size (although it is typically 5X7 or 6X8), has multiple photos showing the different looks a person can portray.
Not understanding how to create the right type of photo is where most people make huge mistakes. Not having the needed photos will cause people to spend a lot of time and money unwisely. This is one of the main reasons for people to drop out of the industry because they can’t get the representation work they desire. Quite often the lack of work is not due to their look, but instead it is because they don’t have the correct materials.

, Don't make the mistake of doing what most people do and just stand in front of a camera and have pretty pictures taken of yourself. Generally those pictures get thrown away by agents and photographers. The way to get an agent's and photographer's attention is by showing them photos that tell a story.


Make the photos look like ads. Bring props (items that help make the photos look like an ad).
However, you never want to use a logo or a brand name in the photos you are creating. You want to create at least 3-4 shots for a composite sheet. Your photos should show a variety of expressions and emotions. You can get wonderful ideas for your photo session by looking at existing ads in non-fashion magazines.

, Once you know what shots are needed, and how to create them, then you will need a photographer. There are many ways to find a local photographer. One way is to go to www.asmp.org. It is a great organization (American Society of Media Photographers). At their website, you should be able to find photographers and even assistant photographers at their site.

, Once some photos are shot, then you want to show them to agents. Contact as many agents as you can, until you decide who will be your best agent. Here are some ways to find great agents:


Go to the local community theater and ask the actors after the play which agents you should be contacting.
Try calling photographers in the area and ask them which agents they deal with when booking models. You can try the same question at advertising agencies.

, However, sometimes even with great experiences, it can be difficult getting hired if your photos do not sell you well.

But if you don't meet all of these standards, don't be too discouraged; if you've really got ""the look,"" then you may be able to find work even if you're below the average height or above the average weight for male models. Here are some points to consider as you decide whether or not you should get in to male modeling:Industry standards are between 5’11” and 6’2” in height.
Unlike female models, who are mostly out of work by the age of 25, male models can find work well into their 50s.
Men from 15 to 25 make up the “young men’s” market.
Men from 25 to 35 are the “adult men’s” market.
A typical weight for men is between 140 and 165, but this will depend on your Body Mass Index.
Average measurements are 40 regular to 42 long.
Typically, the modeling industry doesn't go for overly hairy men in the chest and arm region. Be prepared to do some waxing before you pursue your career.;
, The type of modeling you do can influence the way you look for work, the type of photos you take to get work, and the approach you take as you start off in your modeling career. For example, you will have to meet different standards to look like a runway model instead of a catalogue model, who is supposed to offer a more realistic view of men. Here are the types of modeling that you may pursue:


Fashion models promote clothing and apparel.
High fashion models work with the famous fashion houses or designers.
Editorial models only work for certain publications.
Runway models work at fashion shows.
Showroom models display clothing at fashion parties or boutiques.
Commercial print models are photographed for magazines, newspapers, billboards and other print ad materials.
Catalogue models are hired to appear in catalogues.
Promotional models work in conventions or trade shows.
Specialty models specialize one part of their body such as hands, legs, neck, hair or feet.
Character models are used to portray ordinary people.
Glamour modeling focuses more on the model than the actual product.

, Though you can skip this step and move right on to trying to sign with an agent, it couldn't hurt to have your face out there and to have some modeling experience so you have something to point to when you approach agencies. Try to appear in local newspaper ads, TV shows, magazines, or even fashion shows. You might get the attention of the right people without even appealing to an agent directly.


However, this does not mean that you should get absolutely any work you can. Remember that you're trying to build and maintain your image, so don't do something that is completely below your dignity, not taken by a real photographer, or which doesn't represent who you are at all.
Do not shoot in anything less than your underwear unless you're getting paid. You may be told that you should shoot nude or an implied nude to get some free photos, but you should avoid these kinds of offers like the plague. Don't shoot nude unless it's for a professional, reputable, and established company that pays you for your work. If you take nudes with sketchy photographers, who knows where they will end up.

, Though you'll be able to develop your portfolio after you sign with an agency, getting some professional photos taken beforehand will make you look professional and will give you something to point to if you catch the eye of someone in the industry. Don't just get your photo taken by someone with a cheap camera who only has experience taking yearbook photos; get your photo snapped by an above-average photographer so that you look, well, above average.


Make sure you get a Model Release form signed by every photographer you work with. This will ensure that you know exactly what happens to the photos that are taken of you.
Don't waste your time with a ""portrait"" photographer. You want to take modeling shots, not your senior year photo.
Make sure that you have a standard headshot and multiple full body shots.
Because people needing your services will probably want to see what your body type looks like, include a full body shot in shorts or underwear and a tank top.
Include an additional shot in casual clothing, and a third shot in business casual or a full suit.
Get black-and-white and color photos.

, Unfortunately, scams are all too present in the modeling agency. You can get scammed during pretty much any step along the way, from being tricked into taking expensive photos from a shady photographer or getting ""signed"" with a fake or disreputable agent. Here are some things to be wary about as you move forward:Photographers who charge ridiculous rates for getting your portfolio together. Once you sign up with an agency, you'll be able to fully develop your portfolio, so avoid the pushy photographers who offer to sell you a portfolio for thousands of dollars, claiming it's the only way for you to approach an agent.
Agencies who charge exorbitant up-front fees. If an agent asks you for a large registration or portfolio fee, run for the hills. Agents shouldn't profit until they get you a gig and get a cut of your profit. These untrustworthy agencies will typically not have many clients, be new in the industry, and won't have the connections necessary to get you work.
Expensive modeling schools. Keep in mind that there are no certified schools for modeling. Sure, they can help you learn how to walk, pose, and manage your facial expressions, but you may be better off learning these skills online or from reading a book. These schools may claim to get you work, but don't get sucked in to them unless they can really prove that they have helped other models get work.
People who approach you out of the blue. Sure, the occasional model has a story about being randomly approached at an event or even at a nightclub being told that he has ""the look,"" but most of the time, this is done by shady characters who think they can get money just by stroking your ego.If these men ask for shady methods of payment, this is even more of an indicator that you should stop contact with them. Of course, if these men prove to have real connections, then you just got lucky.
People who offer you money for your personal information online. Avoid any online sites, such as Model Mayhem, where people may offer you money in exchange for your credit card information and other personal information. This makes you a target for identity theft.

, If you're really serious about being a male model, then you can't live in a town with only two traffic lights forever. You should move to one of the big modeling cities, such as New York City, Los Angeles, London, Milan or Paris. You might also find regional work in other cities such as Chicago or Miami. Don't feel like you can't be a model if you can't afford the move right away; try looking up model searches in your area or contact agencies directly from home (more on that later).

, An open call is when a modeling agency lets anyone come in to their office to audition. You'll have to wait in line with many other models until you're called into a room individually to have the agents take a look at you and see if you've got what they're looking for. Often, you can wait for hours just to be seen for less than a minute. This may be a bit nerve-wracking, but hey, it's what you're signing up for., A model search is like an open call except it is held by agencies that travel to small towns searching for models. Since they do make the effort to travel to your location, you will have to pay a small fee to be seen, which should cost somewhere around $25 dollars. This is a great option if you live in a smaller town where there are less modeling opportunities. Just like a modeling call, your chances of getting selected aren't high, but you could make some valuable connections., Though these are hard to win, if you do manage to win a modeling competition, it really can jump start your modeling career. Make sure it's a reputable contest run by a reputable establishment, and that you don't have to pay a ridiculous entry fee. Many of these competitions will even get you signed with an agency if you win. And even if you don't win, it'll be another way to put yourself out there.


Make sure you look in to the specific requirements necessary for entering a modeling competition. It's likely that you'll need to be prepared with a set of pictures.

, This is a perfect way to get some exposure as well as to meet other professional models and agents. Unfortunately, it can get pretty expensive to attend one of these conventions (typically around $200 - $4000) so if you do, you have to make the most of it by acting professional and meeting as many people as possible.

, That's right. Another way to get signed by an agency is to get in touch with them yourself. Search the Internet for lists of reputable modeling agencies, such as Elite or Major Management, and get their email addresses. Then, send them a professional email with some professional photos of yourself in a variety of poses. Though this will require you to build a portfolio beforehand, it can pay off.

, This is a good and relatively cheap way of putting yourself out there and not having to do all of the advertising work yourself. Find a reputable company, such as www.modelscouts.com and www.minxmodels.com, and pay them from between $60 - $150 dollars to help you find work. You'll have to submit your profile to them and they will forward your information to major agencies.

, Once you've jumped through the hoops and found an agent who likes your look, it'll be time to sign your contract. Again, make sure the agent doesn't ask for any money up front. A real agent should only make money after he or she makes you money. And even if the agent seems legitimate, make sure you have an attorney go over the contract with you to ensure that you're making a fair agreement.When you're speaking with the agent, you can ask about any unions you're allowed to join and also ask if you can take modeling jobs on the side.
If you've signed with a top agent and have a chance of making some serious money, you can also think about meeting with an accountant to talk about how you will track your earnings.

, Once you've signed with an agent, you will build your portfolio, which will help you get hired. The agencies will help you get the chance to go to modeling interviews, which are also known as go-sees. So, start going to the go-sees, act professional, and don't get frustrated if you don't get a gig right away.


The agency can't guarantee you work; but a good agent wouldn't take you on if he or she didn't think you had a solid chance at finding some great work.
Have perseverance. You won't get a gig with Calvin Klein on your first go-see, despite what you may hear.

, Whether you've made it big or are just starting out, you don't want to develop a reputation for being ungrateful, rude, or even late. If you want to last in the industry, here are some things you'll have to do to meet the standards of the profession, just as you would with any other career:


Be prompt to appointments.
Be courteous and professional to everyone you come in contact with.
Consider investing in a personal trainer to help you stay on a balanced diet and to attain exercise goals for optimal muscle tone.
Take a meticulous approach to your grooming and skin care regimen.
Retire for the evenings early on the nights before you have to work. Plenty of sleep will help you avoid dark circles under your eyes and give you a more rested and healthier appearance to those you are working for.

, Though everyone hears the story about the male model who was discovered on a Russian cargo ship or just when he was hanging out at a bar in Vegas at three in the morning, the fact of the matter is that most male models don't just instantly get discovered and have to keep working hard even after they sign with an agent. This means that unless you are among the very few lucky male models who can solely survive on their modeling income, you'll need to keep your day job or find another source of income to keep you going.


If your day job is too much work, just find another source of income that works for you. Many male models are part-time waiters or bartenders.

, Though the male modeling industry is slightly less grueling than the female modeling industries, male models fall victim to the same problems that plague female models, such as having a low self-esteem, feeling deeply insecure, or worse, having an eating disorder. Here are some things to keep in mind as you try to stay healthy during your career as a male model:Make sure you continue to eat healthy, get exercise, and remind yourself that you're a worthy person; don't let the modeling lifestyle get you down.
Rejection is part of the game and if you're already prone to insecurity and self-loathing, then male modeling may not be the best path for you.
Though part of the modeling lifestyle may require you to go to parties and schmooze with lots of people, don't become addicted to drugs or alcohol. Not only will this cause great pain for you mentally and physically, but it will have a negative effect on your physical appearance.

Find a happy place while you're taking the picture.",How to Have a Great Photoshoot1," This takes a lot of work, but it will help you avoid that awkward picture where your forearm is blocking half your face. If you try this enough times, people will be shocked to hear that what they see is a self-pic and not a professional photo.


If your arms get tired, you can alternate between holding the camera at arm's length, and changing into different outfits or looking for a new background.;
, This can add a new perspective, and will show that you're proud to be taking a selfie. It will also show that you don't take yourself too seriously--you're just having fun.


Remember that the mirror will also reflect whatever is behind you, so make sure that you're in front of something that is fun but not too distracting.

, The wrong angle can ruin a perfectly good picture, so it's important to try as many looks as possible to learn what works.


Remember that the angles that work when others take the photo may not be best for a self-pic. While you may look flattering from the left side when your friend takes your photo, you may find that a different angle works best when you're the boss.
Avoid taking photos from below--you'll look longer and more flattering if the camera is posed slightly above you.
Avoid taking photos head-on. This will keep you from looking boxy, and will add a more interesting look to your photo.

, Since you're the photographer, you have nothing to lose!


Pose in as many different outfits as you can to see what looks best.
Take photos with different backgrounds, whether you're in different locations of a city or different parts of your house.
If you found a location you love, try taking photos at different times of day to see how the lighting changes your look.

, You may look more composed if you're not worrying about operating the camera, and will be able to hit just the right expression.


Set the timer to give yourself enough time to get settled in your pose--you want to avoid running back and forth between the camera and your location, which will make you look frazzled.
If you really love the timer method, you can invest in a camera remote so you don't have to run back and forth at all.

, If you're feeling happy and surrounded by your favorite things, it will show in your photo! Since you're already taking pictures of yourself, you might as well indulge in some of your favorite things.


Bake cookies while you're taking the picture. The delicious smell--and the sugar high from the occasional snack--will make you glow in the photo.
Listen to your favorite ""pump up"" music. This will put you in a more energetic, playful mood, and may lead you to try new poses you wouldn't have considered otherwise.

If you can't afford a professional, find a trusty friend with a great camera.

, It's important to take it easy on the day before the photo shoot so you look your best when the time comes. If you look tired or indisposed, your photo shoot will fail, no matter how much you've paid your photographer.

Get plenty of rest the night before so you don't have bags under your eyes. You don't want to look like you had a hard night of partying just because you only got four hours of sleep.

Show up with a garment bag of trusted outfits you've worn before--which you're confident make you look your best.
Bring a few props you've worked with--a phone, a bouquet, but nothing too distracting.
Keep your makeup natural. Even if you've been dying to experiment with your new pink eyeliner, it's best to save your project for another night.

You're selling yourself, not your brand of eyeliner or lipstick!

, The background should emphasize your best attributes.

If you're outside, pick a place without distractions and color. It's important to make sure you stand out--not the weird lamp lurking in the background.

, This will make your features and figure look their best, and will add a gentleness to your expressions.


If you're indoors, try to position yourself by a window.
If you're outside, shoot early in the morning or late in the afternoon so that the sunlight isn't stealing your show.

, Agencies want to see that you're capable of trying on many different roles. You should show that you can adapt to any situation or environment to avoid getting typecast.


Show off a range of expressions, from playful to sultry. Avoid having the same goofy high-school-yearbook smile in every photo.
Wear a range of outfits. These can also show off different aspects of your personality.

, Though you should have fun during your photo shoot, this is ultimately a career move, just like typing up your resume. Remember that your goal is to get hired, not to get asked out for a drink.

Remind your significant other of what makes you so amazing.,
If your special someone has given you a photo-friendly gift, show it off.,
Add a personal touch to the photo before you give it to your loved one.",How to Have a Great Photoshoot3," Though you want to remind him of what he's missing when he's away, remember that this photo may be something he wants to hang up--without having his friends snicker every time they pass his office or school locker.


If you're a girl, avoid showing too much cleavage, or exposing your bra straps.
If you're a guy, keep your shirt on.

, Use this as an opportunity to show off what he loves most about you--not to try a new look. Save your experimenting for another day.

If your girlfriend gave you a nice sweater for Christmas but you haven't had much of a chance to show it off yet, this may be the time.

, This will remind him or her of what they love about you other than the way you look--and will be something else your loved one can treasure while you're away.


If you're female, you can leave your sweetie a note on the back of the photo, or add a touch of your favorite perfume, to make sure he's thinking about how much he misses your smell and cute handwriting.

Pick a location that is meaningful to both of you.,
Wear the right outfits.,
Avoid using cheesy props.,
Show how your relationship really works.,
Know when to quit.",How to Have a Great Photoshoot4," If you put a lot of thought into where the photo will be taken, everyone will see how special your relationship really is.


Take photos at the place where you fell in love. If you went head-over-heels for your man during your summer jobs at an amusement park, have fun taking a silly photo on a carousel. If the beach is where you began your courtship, some photos by the waves can show what you love about each other.
Pick a location that shows how you've developed as a couple. If you recently bought your first home, your backyard may be a special, but simple background. If he proposed to you during a ski vacation, then some snow-covered mountains may make more a great background.

, You should look well-groomed, but still leave some room to let loose and have some fun with your clothes. Your clothing should be tasteful, but not completely bland.


Don't wear clothing that is too distracting. If you've wanted to show off your new pink heels, this may not be the time. You want people to see how much you love each other--not how much you love your new shoes.
Wear what you would normally wear--even if it's a nicer version. Remember that you still want to be recognized in the photo. You don't want everyone to think that you've changed completely for the sake of your relationship.

, Having the wrong prop can really ruin your photo. If you're bent on using a prop, practice taking pictures with it before the shoot so you'll know if you can pull it off.


Minimize the gag-factor. Holding a string of heart balloons or stuffed animals that say ""soul mates"" may make people laugh at you and will keep them from seeing how much you love each other.

, You want your friends and family to see your natural ease with each other and should avoid looking too sentimental or just not like your real selves. Before you take the photos, take some time to consider what makes your love so unique.


Remember to be yourselves as individuals. If you're known for your goofy smile while your boyfriend is more stoic, you don't have to both be grinning ear-to-ear in all of the pictures.
Show off your dynamic. Be natural and have a light conversation to have the photographer take some candid shots. That way, you won't be so focused on putting on a show for the cameras and your true relationship will shine through.
If you're taking an engagement photo, make sure that it passes the ""laugh test"": if your friends see a fridge magnet with your couple photo on it, will they smile because it reminds them of what makes your love so special, or will they laugh because you just look so cheesy, sentimental, or worse--nothing like yourselves?

, If your significant other really doesn't want to take the photo, don't force him. If your man hates being there, it will show in the photo, and it'll be a waste of time. Remember that taking couple shots--just like marriage--isn't for everyone.

"
"
Coordinate your outfits.,
Pick an appropriate background.,
Make sure that everyone is equally enthusiastic.,
Have a sense of humor.,
Show off your family dynamic.",How to Have a Great Photoshoot5," The photo will really shine if everyone in your family is dressed appropriately so that your picture isn't distracting--or just corny. Your clothes are one of the first things people will notice, so it's important that your look is just right.


Avoid clashing. You may love your teal pants, but they could clash with your mother's yellow sweater and ruin your family photo.
Your clothes should match. Wearing clothes in the same palette, such as greens and browns, or blacks, reds, and silvers, will look great together. Having the parents were one color scheme and the siblings wear another, or having the boys in the family wear one shade and the girls wear another, is a great technique to spice up your look.
Your clothes should match--but only to a point. If everyone is wearing the exact same sweater in your family's holiday photo, you may not be able to emphasize your unique personalities and may just look silly in the process.
Pick the right outfits well before the photo session. It could help to take a mock-photo wearing the outfits you have in mind a few days before, so you can see if the outfits look good together.

, The background should emphasize your family's strengths and should add unity and fun to your photo. You should think about it well in advance to avoid any last-minute location changes.


If you're taking an outdoor Christmas photo in the fall, make sure you find a patch of woods where the leaves haven't changed colors.
If you're taking your photo in front of the fireplace, make sure there aren't any goofy photos on the mantle that may distract your audience.
The background could reveal something about your family. If you all love spending your summers at the beach or at a ski resort, having the right background can emphasize what you love most as a family.

, If some members of your family are more excited than others, this may make people laugh or could just look strange. Check in to see that everyone is feeling positive before the shoot.


Showcase all members of the family equally. Even if your little brother is feeling lukewarm about the photo, you should avoid having him sulking behind the Christmas tree while everyone else is showing their million-dollar smiles.

, Everyone will know if you had fun taking photos with your family, or if you saw the occasion as a chore. Know that a family photo may be inherently a little cheesy, so it's okay to roll with it and make it your own.


Remember to laugh during the photo shoot, which will keep you from looking formal or stilted.
Tell some jokes during the photo shoot. Even if your dad's jokes are as corny as can be, they may still lighten the mood, and will make everyone look more fun in the photo.

, Use the photo as an opportunity to show what makes your family unique. Millions of families have had their photos taken before--what makes yours different?


Brainstorm some ideas for how to approach your dynamic in the photo. This can make your family grow even closer--and laugh in the process.
Show off your family's love for your pet. If everyone knows your sister is a bit obsessed with the family dog, she should be the one holding him in the photo.
Show off your family members' love for each other. If your two brothers are inseparable, they should be standing next to each other.

Take your measurements.,
Decide what type of modeling you want to pursue.,
Have professional pictures made.,
Make composite cards.,
Create physical and digital portfolios.",How to Get a Modeling Job1," Since most modeling jobs have particular types of models in mind, you should have a clear understanding of your own physical attributes. If you’re a woman, measure your chest, waist, and hips, and verify your height and weight. If you’re man, measure your shoulders, waist, and inseam, as well as your height and weight.


Keep track of these measurements over time, especially if you’re a younger model. Men in particular continue to add height into their early 20s.;
, As art comes in many forms, there is a wide range of modeling options. Your headshots and portfolio should emphasize your physical attributes and personality, based on the type of modeling jobs that you want to pursue.


If you’re interested in becoming a fashion model, the most exclusive type, the physical standards are quite strict. For example, female models must be “fashion-industry size-standard”, which means you must be 5’9” to 6” tall, have measurements of 34-24-24, wear clothing size 0-4, and weigh between 105-130 pounds, proportional to your height.
An “alternative” or “alt” model, on the other hand may not fit the industry standard. Many have tattoos and piercings, as well as atypical hairstyles.
Catalog models can be a range of sizes and shapes as well, depending on the clothing designer and retailer., Find a reputable photographer who specializes either in model photography or in headshots. Make sure that you have access to the negatives, too,so that you can build your own composite card and portfolio.


Ask the photograph to help you to keep them simple and natural. Modeling agencies and clients are looking for confident models who seem relaxed in front of the camera, not potentially awkward poses or false “glamour.”, A composite is an important marketing tool, much like a business card, that agencies and clients will keep as a reference for you. It consists of a single page, often a 5x7 card, and sometimes a full 8.5x11 sheet, that has your headshot on one side and several photos with your vital statistics (physical characteristics and personal qualities) on the back. , Use your photographs to create an attractive portfolio to carry to go-sees, cattle-calls, and agency interviews. This portfolio should represent the range of your expressiveness and emphasize your personal style and physical attributes.


For instance, if your emotional expressiveness is your best quality, then select images that highlight the way you show emotion in different lights, with different make-up, and in different contexts.
A digital portfolio, such as a DVD or flash drive, might be a useful investment, especially if you’re interested in modeling for television or the catwalk. You can include video footage of your walk or your previous video modeling experience.

However, if you live in a small or mid-size city with a population of less than one million, then you may want to consider working as a freelance model. While agencies in large cities will often cover the cost of things like headshots, agencies in smaller cities will not and they may also charge more for their services in order to stay in business.Keep in mind that working as a freelance model will mean that you are in charge of your own booking, development, billing, and dispute resolution.

Take care of your skin and body.,
Make an appointment for a haircut.,
Choose casual clothing.,
Arrive early and prepared.,
Show your sunny personality.",How to Get a Modeling Job4," After reading the casting call, take some time to go over your photos and portfolio. Ask yourself: does my portfolio meet the expectations of this client? Do my pictures seem to fit with the client’s style? If you answered “no” to either question, then consider taking new pictures or, at least, updating your portfolio and composite to be more specific for this job.

, Even if you feel confident in front of a camera, applying for a job is a stressful situation.

Try to schedule your hair appointment for a few days before the casting call. This will allow your new haircut to settle and give you a chance to play around with it as well.

, Most potential clients want to see someone with a natural look that they can dress up or down. Try wearing nice jeans and a t-shirt with medium-heels. Wear minimal make up, such as blush and lip gloss, so that they can see your face as a palette.Avoid trying to appear “glamorous,” as that might not be the style they want, and many aspiring models may not yet be able to pull of that look.

, Have your portfolio and composite on hand, as well as knowledge about the agency’s and the client’s styles. Modeling can be fun, but it’s also a professional industry, so treat every call as a serious job interview. If you take yourself seriously, the client will, too.

, The successful models are not self-involved diva-types. In fact, the most highly recognizable faces in the industry are genuinely friendly and open with photographers and other members of the profession. In the call, have a positive attitude about modeling, about yourself and your willingness to learn, about the agency, and about the client. This attitude will help you survive the many rejections, but also let your potential client know that you’ll be enjoyable to work with.Be as warm and genuine as you can. You don’t need to be falsely charming to get a modeling job. Instead, be the best version of yourself: natural and relaxed in any context.

Fashion modeling is the most common type of modeling that people know about. To be a successful fashion model requires a certain height. In the larger markets, such as New York, the minimum acceptable height is 5’10”, while in the smaller markets the minimum is 5’8”. Fashion models must also be quite thin. In terms of looks, a wider range is acceptable, from conventionally beautiful to striking.
Commercial print modeling is a catch-all for models who appear in advertisements in magazines and newspapers. It can range from swimsuit modeling to portraying a specific role, such as businessperson, doctor, or representative of a particular demographic. Appearance requirements vary with the type of job. For instance, swimsuit models need to be curvy, yet show good muscle-tone, while representatives of a particular demographic simply need to be attractive examples of that demographic.
Body part modeling showcases a particular body part, such hair, legs, or hands. If you have lustrous hair, graceful hands, or legs that go on forever, consider this modeling type.;
, Call some local modelling agencies and find out who they use. Photographers who work in the industry will have experience with models. They will likely also know what agencies generally look for in portfolio pictures and are able to advise you accordingly.

, If you are lucky, the photographer will sort this out for you, but remember to ask if the cost of the make-up artist is included in the fee, or if you have to pay extra. If the photographer isn't providing one, ask the local modelling agencies to recommend one. As with the photographer, make-up artists in the business will know what’s expected.

, Look through magazines to find poses that inspire you. Don’t be afraid to alter them a little to make them your own. Practice them in front of a mirror and change the angle from time to time. Ask a family member or friend to critique your poses as you practice.

, It’s important to realize that the purpose of your portfolio is to sell you.Eliminate anything that distracts from that purpose. To that end, keep your clothing choices simple. Choose solid colors and stay away from prints and patterns. Opt for clothing that you know fits you well: avoid anything that’s too tight or loose. Your portfolio is also not the place for “fashion-forward” outfits.


You will need several outfit choices since you don't want to have pictures of you in only one or two.
If you intend on going into commercial print modeling, it's a good idea to bring a swimsuit, too.

, Having a number of looks suited to the type of modeling for which you are suited is essential. If the photographer is good, he or she will know what types of pictures and looks you will need.


Headshotsare images where the model's face is depicted clearly. Usually coming in 8x10 sizing, the picture is typically of the model's head and upper torso, taken at close range. It's important that the headshot focus on the face. They are also usually taken with minimal make-up, so that the model's facial structure and skin tone are evident. Every model needs one in his or her portfolio.
Beauty shots,on the other hand, are artistic images, that like the headshot, are of the model's head and upper body. However, unlike headshots, the model is made-up and may be posed dramatically. If you want to work as a commercial print model, this photograph is a must for you.
Fashion shotsare exactly what they sound like: photographs of the model wearing different outfits, with the focus being on the clothing. Even the model's make-up complements the outfit. These images are for fashion models.
Swimsuit shots showcase the model's body. This is another photo that you'll need for commercial print modeling.
Another photo that's important if you want to go into commercial print modeling is the editorial shot.Centered around a story, here's is where you'll be playing a character in a particular narrative.
Make sure you have your outfits ready at least five days before the day of the shoot.

, Looking your best at your photo shoot is crucial to your success as a model. Accordingly, perform any routine maintenance on yourself as you need before the big day. For example, have a hair-cut or get a manicure.


The day before the shoot, make sure you get a good night's sleep and stay away from alcohol.

, Before leaving the house, make sure that your bag is packed and that you have money for transportation costs and parking fees. Aim to arrive 10 minutes before you are due. Carry the photographer's number on you and give them a call if you realize you might be late.

, Good communicationbetween model and photographer is essential for great pictures. Listen carefully to what the photographer wants. Try not to be nervous, but do acknowledge that the feeling is normal...even models who have been working for years get nervous.

, You want your pictures to capture the essence of what you can bring as a model: your vivacity and ability to portray varied characters and moods. Don’t be afraid to show off. This is your time to shine.

, It’s important to build good professional relationships with your photographer and makeup artist. Be sure to write both of them thank you notes after the photo shoot is over.

, Remember quality matters more than quantity. Select 12 to 16 of your best photographs. Enlist family and friends to help you out.


Make sure that your photos show you in different outfits and in different locations. Also important is including images of you in different lighting, for example, indoors and outdoors.
The standard photo size is 8x10 inches. Other sizes include 9x12 and 11x14

, When a potential client opens your portfolio you want to wow them from beginning to end. Accordingly, include your best pictures, two in the opening and two in the closing pages of your portfolio.

, Your photographer may offer this service. If not, any photo printing place can do it for you. They can also create a disc of your portfolio, too.


Another option in addition to a printed version is an online portfolio. It's best to hire someone to design a website to host it rather than trying to do this yourself. Otherwise, it will appear amateurish.

, As you get modelling jobs and gain experience, add this to your portfolio. Keep “tear sheets,” usually magazine pages or photos from a photo shoot. These demonstrate your success as a model.

, Your profilewill list important information about you. Include the types of work you’re willing to do, your statistics, for example, your height, weight, hair and eye color, whether you have any problem areas on your body, for instance, tattoos or scars, and finally, any relevant skills you have, such as knowing a sport, or how to play a musical instrument.

However, some shows and competitions like to get creative with the runway. If possible, find out what this shape will be in advance so you can prepare a few different poses. When in doubt, prepare a few different poses just in case.


Some runway competitions have a shoe height requirement. Make sure you know about this in advance and bring the proper shoes.
Do an internet search to find videos of past competitions to get an idea of what you’ll be doing.;
, If you walk with a slouch you will make yourself look heavier than you are. Plus, walking with good posture shows off your figure and can make you look weightless as you move. First, straighten your back and your neck. Pull your shoulders back, tuck your stomach in, and lift your chin slightly.If you’re having trouble keeping good posture, you may need to see a chiropractor.

, There are many great poses to choose from. However, the most common pose involves standing with your leg out and your opposite hand on your hip. When you reach your last step down the runway, step forward with one foot and then extend the opposite foot to the side. Place your hand on your hip and push your hips forward.

, After posing, turn by pivoting on the balls of your feet. Keep your face towards the end of the runway as you turn until you’ve turned around completely. Step forward again with your lead foot and return to your starting position. Depending on the desires of the show director, you may need to pose again. Turn by pivoting on one of your feet and strike a pose. Pivot again and leave the stage.When you reach the end of the runway you may have the opportunity to do more than one pose. If so, keep pivoting and shifting your weight back and forth to keep the maintain your rhythm.If you have a long train, walk in a semicircle around the end of the runway instead of pivoting to show off the garment., Put full length mirror at the end of a hallway and walk back and forth.As you walk, ask yourself if you look graceful and confident. Experiment with alternate poses and walking rhythms. Walk until you can confidently walk forward without looking down or tripping.


Watch videos of popular runway models walking. Take note of how they position their bodies and show a walking rhythm.
Ask a friend to watch you walk and give you feedback.

, Wash your body and hair thoroughly before the competition. Make sure any unwanted hair is plucked, shaved, or waxed away.Pluck or wax your eyebrows to highlight the arch. If your skin looks ashy or dry, exfoliate yourself with a loofa or exfoliating scrub while you shower. Lastly, get a trim if your hair has visibly damaged ends.


Most models have long hair. However, there are many successful models with pixie cuts. Wear what makes you confident!

, Unless your competition says otherwise, try to only wear the essentials. You want to show off your natural beauty. Apply some concealer and powder to even out your skin tone and highlight the apples of your cheeks with a natural-looking blush. If your eyebrows are too light, darken them a little bit with eyebrow makeup and shape them with wax or hairspray. Last, apply some mascara. If you have naturally dark hair, use black mascara. Otherwise, use brown mascara.Don’t wear colorful nail polish. Instead, clean your nails and apply a coat of clear nail polish.

If you are allowed to choose your own outfit, pick something that is flattering for your body type and makes you feel confident. However, many competitions have strict clothing requirements. For example, the Charleston Fashion Week competition requires that models wear black tank tops with black leggings and three inch heels.If you’re having trouble choosing something to wear, see if you can find any pictures or videos of past winners to get ideas.
When in doubt, don’t wear jewelry.

, Walking with a slouch won’t flatter your figure at all. Straighten your back and square your shoulders, pushing out your chest slightly. Keep your chin up and look forward. Bend your knees slightly as you walk.Use good posture even when you aren’t walking on the catwalk. Practice makes perfect!
If you have trouble maintaining good posture, visit a chiropractor.

, Take a step, keeping your hips stationary and your feet pointed forward. Instead of swaying your hips while you walk, move your shoulders. Keep your back and hips straight and swing your arms slightly. IF there’s music playing, try to walk in time to the music.Watch videos of successful male models on the catwalk for tips and inspiration.
Look forward as you walk, not down.

, Make sure you stop for three to five seconds. There are a lot of great poses to choose from. However, the most common pose for men is the “c” pose. Place your left hand on your hip and arch your back away from your hand. Point your right toe out towards the audience and turn your face to the right.Watch videos of popular male models on the runway to find new positions.
Balance your weight on your back foot when you pose., Pivot on the balls of your feet and walk back to the beginning of the runway. Keep your face forward as you turn. When you reach the end of the runway, you may have the opportunity to pose again. Pose for three to five seconds then exit the runway.


Your face should be the last part of you to turn away from the audience., Most male models wear natural looking makeup that highlights their skin and eyebrows.Choose a foundation that matches your skin tone and apply a thin layer on your face with a foundation brush. Next, brush a thin layer of translucent powder over your face to hold the foundation in place. Lastly, groom your eyebrows. Pluck any stray hairs and darken your eyebrows with brown eyeshadow if they’re too light.


Apply a moisturizer thirty minutes before you put on makeup. This will make your skin look full and healthy.
Make sure to blend the foundation really well around your nose and mouth. These areas are easy to overlook.

, First, get a haircut. Before the competition, get a haircut at a salon or a barbershop. These days, most male models have short haircuts that are faded on the sides, although there are always exceptions!Additionally, make sure you wax or shave any chest, shoulder, or back hair before the competition.


Practice doing your hair in the weeks leading up to the competition. If you do, you won’t be nervous about doing it when it matters.
You may need to buy products such as hair wax or combs to style your hair properly.

, Each competition will require different clothing. Some competitions let you choose your own outfit. If so, try to wear something that’s flattering to your figure. However, most competitions will ask you to wear flat shoes, black leggings, and a black tank top. If you’re not sure what kind of clothing flatters your body type, visit a nice men’s department store and talk to an associate to get fashion advice.
If you don’t wear the proper attire you will most likely be disqualified.

, Many cities host local versions of famous modeling competitions. For example, Austin, TX hosts an “Austin Top Model” competition every year.Most of these competitions don’t require any previous experience modeling and can lead to modeling contracts with large agencies.


Make sure you fulfill the physical requirements for the competition. Many competitions have a height and clothing size requirement.
Research the application process in advance to make sure you have everything you need. Some competitions have applications and fees.

, Research the company hosting the competition. There are many companies that try to take advantage of aspiring models by tricking them into bad contracts. Look online for reviews of the company or of the competition to find out if it’s a legitimate competition.


It should be easy to find photos of past winners and reviews of the agencies hosting the competition. If you can’t find these things, the competition might be a scam.
Similarly, many “modeling schools” are scams as well. Be prepared to do heavy research before signing up., A “headshot” is a professional photo that highlights your natural beauty. Not all competitions require a head shot with your application. In fact, some competitions include free headshots as a part of the package. However, if you need to get headshots done, go to a professional photography studio. A professional photographer will know how to take photos that fulfill headshot requirements and flatter your figure.


Be prepared to pay between $100-$700 for professional headshots. This is an investment in your future!Wear minimal makeup when getting headshots done."

Be patient.",How to Become a Webcam Model," Make a list of 3-5 companies you will inquire further about. The legitimacy of companies like or I-Camz has been backed by many users. However, it is still advisable to thoroughly review each company you might consider working for and to check that the company is indeed reputable., Not only is this a way to get any questions you may have answered, it’s also a way to see how responsive the company is. A legitimate company will respond to your call promptly or message you back within a few days, whereas a scam will not respond. In fact, scam sites may not even have contact information posted.

, Scams are common in the camming industry and could be harmful to you. They could damage your reputation or even threaten your safety. There are several ways you can recognize scams:


Beware of companies that reach out to you first. Legitimate cam sites will advertise, but they will never contact you first. A cold contact through social media, messaging, or email is likely a scam.
Reputable companies will ask for verification that you are over 18, since this is the legal age requirement for adult work of an explicit nature. A scam will not ask for such documentation.
If a company requests nude pictures or an interview via webcam, this is most likely an attempt to get a free show. No legitimate company will ask for such an interview or for nude pictures. Instead, a reputable company will ask for a full body picture and a headshot.
A company with a registration, application, or processing fee is rarely reputable. If anything, your initial investments will have to do with purchasing a quality webcam, lingerie, or novelty items.
If the company guarantees a certain income, it is most likely a scam. Webcam models make money when customers pay, and that is a variable factor.
The company is most likely a scam if it says it uses PayPal as a payment service. PayPal has a zero tolerance policy for adult services., Typically, users pay tokens - credits or “tips” - which allow them to interact with cam models. Webcam models, in turn, make money when the host site, the middleman, distributes the tips. Every camming company will take a different percentage of the tips, so find out exactly what the rate is. Some sites, for example, will allow you to keep 50-60% of the profits from tips.You should also find out how frequently you will be paid. Some companies will pay you twice a month, some monthly, a very select few daily. Factor this into your considerations for what company you will sign up with.
Know that as an independent contractor, you will still owe taxes to the IRS. You will have to pay these on your own through quarterly estimated payments or by filing a tax return at the end of the year., Being a webcam model involves incurring certain expenses on your part. These can range from buying a variety of outfits and lingerie to purchasing high-definition equipment. Consider whether these are costs you are willing to bear up-front in order to in turn potentially earn money in the long-run.


Making money as a cam model is not guaranteed. You could have days when you don’t make any money. Determine whether this is acceptable to you prior to signing up for a camming website.

, You can do this by doing a Google search of camming site reviews. Multiple favorable reviews will likely mean the company can be trusted. However, you should always use your own discretion to determine if this is indeed the case for each particular site you are considering.


You can also watch YouTube videos by webcam models to get their insight into the webcam industry.

, You must be age 18 or older to be a webcam model. Any webcam content involving a performer under age 18 is considered child pornography given the often explicit nature of the cam modeling industry., Every company will have a different application process, but all legitimate companies will ask you to fill out required paperwork. This will include a model contract and release form.


Recall that a reputable company will never ask you for a webcam interview or for nude images.

, Once your paperwork has been processed, you will receive an email notifying you that you can begin to update your profile. This will include choosing a username, which should be simple and easy to remember. A simple username will make it easier to get repeat visitors and is also something you could use to promote yourself on social media sites like Twitter or Instagram.

, This should include information about what you are willing to do on camera as well as any talents you may have, such as dancing or speaking foreign languages. Do not offer to do anything you are not comfortable with. At the same time, know that your willingness to fulfill requests and perform a variety of acts can set you apart and increase your earning potential.


Never reveal any personal information about yourself in your description.

, This image should be eye-catching and colorful so as to entice viewers to click on your profile. If possible, upload multiple pictures to your profile. Once you upload your images, your profile will go through an approval process. Once approved, you can begin hosting live shows.

, A live broadcast is your show. You are the one who sets the rules. If you don’t want to show your face, don’t. If you would rather perform without audio, do just that. The same goes for if you don’t want to perform fully nude. You are the one with full control over your broadcast.

, Do this prior to signing up for any camming company. Being a webcam model involves potentially exposing yourself to scams, blackmail, or various forms of exploitation. Furthermore, your videos are accessible by practically anyone and have the potential to remain on the internet forever. Your true identity could also be revealed.


If you fear that somebody you know might stumble across your video or that a potential employer might notice your cam activity, carefully consider whether camming is the right profession for you.

, You can use the camera on your laptop if you have a solid, high-speed internet connection. The better the picture quality, the more users your broadcasts will attract.


If you have dedicated, loyal viewers, you could create a wishlist that includes an HD webcam to improve the quality of your stream. A regular visitor might gift this to you.Check whether your laptop’s audio and microphone are working well, if applicable.

, Choose a single area as your workspace and use this as your background every time you broadcast live. You should also set up the room in a way that attracts visitors, so clean the area around you, consider performing in front of a brightly-colored wall, and choose a room with good lighting., Groom as you see fit and dress as you intend to perform. If you want to have a seductive broadcast, choose an alluring outfit. If you want your broadcast to be more casual or low-key, choose an outfit that is less revealing but still cute. If you plan on accepting role-play requests, have a few costumes on hand in case you decide to switch to a private show.

, If you decide to be a kawaii anime girl, be a kawaii anime girl during every broadcast. You want the vibe in your room to be the same every time users join your broadcast. This will create a feeling of familiarity and comfort which will attract regular users.By putting users at ease with a consistent persona, loyal viewers will likely tip you generously or help you create an even better page if you don’t have experience with photo editing or HTML., Be outgoing, smile, and engage in conversation with the users. Talk to them, the goal being to keep them entertained and in your room. Look directly at the camera to create a more intense and realistic connection with your users., Many sites, like I-Camz, will spotlight new models. You can leverage this additional exposure to boost your earnings and to begin establishing a regular clientele., This will allow you to estimate approximately how many hours a week you should be working and how many regular clients you should have so as to obtain your desired income.

, You can do this by establishing an active presence on social media. Twitter and Instagram are great ways to extend your fan base and to attract new clients to your page. You could also use Twitter, for example, to announce to followers at what time you’ll be doing a live broadcast that day.

, This is a simple yet fantastic way to establish a regular clientele. When clients know at what time you’ll be online, they can log in as well. Be online when you say you will be and you could start to develop regular clients.


Once you have established a regular clientele, you could consider creating a fan club membership with a monthly subscription. This is another way to earn extra cash.

, Becoming a successful webcam model takes time and dedication. Stick to your schedule, be enthusiastic and engaging when doing a live show, and create a connection with your clients. Slowly but surely, you could start earning regular profits.

"
Obtain consent from your subject, or for very young children, from their parent.,
Remove unnecessary people from the location.,
Don't touch.,
Be respectful.,
If you have to walk around your model when their personal areas are exposed, explain yourself.,
Consider the lighting when shooting in nude subjects.,
Talk constructively when shooting nudes.",How to Behave As a Nude Photographer," Never force anyone to let you take their photograph, when they are undressed or otherwise. It’s their choice. If parents choose to have their baby's photo taken with the baby naked, on his or her tummy on the classic lambskin rug, it's their choice.


When photographing a consenting adult, make sure your subject knows your intention is to photograph them in the nude and ensure you both have the same definition of nude - with or without flesh coloured underwear. Do not rely on information from anyone else such as a model agency or PR company. It is unwise to only have in your defence what ""the agency"" told you on the phone about your subject. If you and your subject agree to a different type of photo shoot when you have already stated you were expecting a nude shoot due to what ""the agency"" told you, things could get uncomfortable, potentially for the entire session. The last thing you want is a scared or uncomfortable face in your images, so make sure you're on the same page for a successful nude photo shoot.
If you wish to photograph a minor child nude, in addition to obtaining consent from the parents, be sure to familiarize yourself, beforehand, with your local laws regarding child pornography. Depending on the country, state, province etc where you live, it may be illegal to photograph a minor child nude, even for a bona fide artistic purpose. In any event where you do photograph a minor child nude, only do so for a bona fide purpose free of any sexual, lewd or predatory intent, and NEVER make the depiction be or appear to be sexual in any way.;
, Models pose and act differently when people hang around staring at them, especially if that person is disrespectful. A male photographer shooting female models should always have a female assistant and vice versa to ensure appropriate behaviour and to act as a witness if any accusations are made.

, If your model needs to reposition themselves, tell them or the parents. If you don't have an assistant, and the model can't achieve what you want, ask permission to touch and position them, or show them using your own body what position you need them to be in. Let your model know what you are doing -- don’t leave them guessing. You'll end up with a confused face instead of relaxed. It's always about the face, regardless what your subject is wearing, or not wearing.

, Give space to change. That's private space. If you don’t have a place to let your model undress at your location, or you are outdoors, excuse yourself and leave the area, or at least turn your back. Then knock, or wait to be called. And have a robe for your model to wear when needed in case they forget to bring their own. Understand that being the subject in a nude photo shoot is not the same thing as being at a nudist beach or resort, and many nude photo subjects would never even want to go to such a place. Therefore, it’s unprofessional and unethical to have your model walk around nude when not shooting, unless your model doesn't want to wear a robe between shoots.


Respect your model's comfort zone with the poses (s)he feels okay to make. Remember that his/her body is his/her own. If you ask your model to make a certain pose, but (s)he is not comfortable making that particular pose, respect his/her choice and don't force him/her to make it.

, Let them know you're going to walk around, and do so only after they acknowledge you. Keep it a respectful walk around -- for example, don’t stand behind them for an unnecessarily long time if they are on their hands and knees. Do a U-shaped walk around, shooting along the way, to give you plenty of angles to choose from.

, People don’t walk around with 3000W illuminating their body. Keep it simple: everything flows better without a ton of lights and the heat associated.


The best shoots are done with one light. Keep it stationary, or shadows on walls and props might appear.
Alternatively, you could use all natural light.

, Give confidence, compliment the models looks and figure, and tell them how photogenic they are. Tell your model how gorgeous and beautiful they are and crack occasional mild jokes. Jokes cause people to laugh, and laughing helps relax the facial muscles. Models rely on your positive feedback.

, However, do remember that if you don't meet certain requirements, the work available to you will be incredibly limited, and you may have to compensate in other departments (reliability, technique, etc).


Plus Size Model: If your body is full and curvaceous, you may be able to be a plus size model (for example, Crystal Renn).






Runway Model: Most women on the catwalk are at least 5'7, very skinny, and small-breasted (for example, Magdalena Frackowiak and Sasha Pivovarova). Men are mostly between 5'10 and 6'2 (for example, Clement Chabernaud and Sean O'Pry). Except this does not quite fully pertain to Victoria's Secret models.






Print Model: Most editorial female models are at least 5'7, but a beautiful face with great personality are really important for print models (for example, Charlotte Free and Barbara Palvin).






Underwear Model: For women, this requires large breasts but small hips (for example, Adriana Lima and Candice Swanepoel). For men this requires broad shoulders but slim waists.






Other Types of Modeling: If you don't fit any of the face or body descriptions, perhaps you can be a foot, hair, or hand model. There's also the option of being an alternative model.







, There is more of a curvy California look, a svelte and sophisticated New York look, a waif-like European look, girl next door, swimsuit or lingerie (usually requires the bust to fill out the suits and a very thin waist)... Know what you're equipped with, but also work to pull off other looks.

, There is a lot you can learn from reading books and articles on modeling. Reading quality guides, articles, and books will both help you to improve important skills (like posing) and to better understand how the industry works (how to find an agent, etc.). Realize that it's tough. The modeling world is jam-packed with pretty faces. Just because you are good looking does not mean that you can succeed as a model. In the modeling business, it is not just about looking great. You have to fit the need of specific jobs just in order to get a chance. Modeling is only for serious people who carry unique looks and characteristics. Since there are so many people trying to become models in today's world, it's very challenging to get a breakthrough and will only come with patience and perseverance.

, With a lot of effort, however, you may reach that supermodel status. One of the most important things to remember is to never be shy and don't apologize if you mess up! Yes, some models tend to act ""stuck-up"" and ""overly confident"" but as long as that makes you feel good, go ahead! Be yourself, and remember to act. Modeling requires a lot of acting skills so acquire a little attitude.

, This doesn't mean candid shots of you and your friends, but rather shots of you up close without a lot of makeup and on a plain background. You should shoot them in nice natural light without a lot of distraction in the photos. These are meant for agencies to get a look at you in a raw state. Consider a head shot, a body shot, and profile shots. Most body shots are swimsuit shots or in tight fitting clothes so the designers and agencies can se exactly what you look like.

, Professional photography, even if it is expensive, will give you a better idea of what kind of look you give off. You may eventually need these photographs to snag an interview, so think of it as a worthwhile investment! Get your favorite professional shots printed into 8x10s. Save these in case you are asked to leave a photograph anywhere before you have professional ones done.

, Bring this portfolio with you to castings or to agencies.

, These will help modeling agencies place you.

, It is also helpful to know bust, waist and hips for female models.

,,,, Almost every major city has multiple modeling agencies, and almost every agency has ""open-calls"" where they look at new talent.

, They will often ask you to walk or pose for them. They may take a headshot or take your measurements as well. If they reject you, don't get disheartened; often an agency is looking for a diverse set of models, so you may just not fit their model lineup right now.

, So many people don't know about the business and end up getting conned. No agency should be asking you for more than $20 when meeting you. The agency will some of your money when you model, but shouldn't get much up front. If they ask for hundreds of dollars beforehand, walk away. Don't take their offer.

, Don't say you're skinnier than you are just to get a shoot. Once there, the stylist will have problems and you will get found out. Word will get around and you could find yourself without a career!

, Remember that, even though you're not working in an office, you need to be professional. Treat the people you work with respectfully — you never know who they know or what sort of a recommendation they might give of you. Never look down on anyone. You may be a model, but that doesn't give you the right to be snooty, affected, or pompous.

, If you're late or rude, word soon gets around and then nobody will want to work with you.

, Models often get called off places at the last minute and have very busy days. You need to be on top of things if you want to succeed. Buying a day-to-day planner can really help.

, Not those kinds of relationships! Professional relationships. You help the photographer look great, and they will help you look great. It's a win-win situation, so be sure to treat photographers with respect.

, Girls that don't take it seriously have small chances of succeeding in their modeling career. Realize that it is harder than it appears and there's a lot of work behind all that glitz and glamour at fashion shows. Modeling is a full time occupation that requires constant attention. One week away from it and your career can be over. Understand that modeling has only a small window of opportunity, and even if you take a short break, you may never be able to return. Models can only work in the business for a maximum of 5 years. If you become famous inside of the business, it might be otherwise.

, Sometimes you are expected to bring certain things with you (such as base foundation) and if they don't have a makeup artist booked you need to prepare accordingly.

, Photographers want to see you pose in various works, work for the camera, and interact with the world around yourself. Runway coordinators want you to put attitude in your walk (or very specific emotion).

Not only will this save you money, but it’ll also help you understand all the ins and outs of the creation process. This knowledge will be crucial as you start to pick manufacturers and sources for your materials.Staying involved in the production process lets you be in control. What better way to make bags the way you want them to be made than to do it yourself?
Keep expanding your skill set as you continue designing. If you’re designing cloth bags, you may want to learn how to weave. You’ll also almost certainly need to know how to sew zippers into your bags.
;
, If this is going to be your main money-making job, attend a two- or four-year fashion design program at an accredited school. When you begin pitching your ideas to stores and manufacturers, this could make the difference between a “yes” and a “no” for your designs.These programs will teach you basic design, production, and art techniques. Some schools may also have courses in business and marketing that could be useful for you.While you’re in the learning phase, you can also apply for internships with big-name handbag designers or other companies in the fashion industry.A fashion degree doesn’t guarantee success, and it’s not necessary if it’s out of your budget. It’s even more important to be passionate about your creative and unique designs!

, As you set out on your design journey, it’s important to know what’s out there and what people like. Become an obsessive follower of fashion magazines and shows. Take note of popular colors, shapes, sizes, and styles to think about where your own bags would fit in the handbag world.Ask your friends and family what they look for in a bag. See if they use multiple bags for different occasions.

, While you should have a good idea of what’s already popular, you want your stuff to be surprising. Think about what features you would most want in a handbag, and start from there. You’ll be most comfortable designing what makes you happy.Maybe the whole reason you got into handbag design was because you couldn’t find the exact bag you wanted. If you’re struggling to find that perfect purse, you can bet other people are too.

, Whenever you see a picture of a bag, outfit, or something else that jumpstarts a designing brainstorm, pin it to a wall or bulletin board. Sit next to the board while you use pencil to make some rough sketches of a bag. You can then make the sketch more detailed with pen and colored pencils, or use a computer program to create a digital sketch.Don’t underestimate the value of starting with pencil. Because pencil marks can be easily erased, this low-pressure tool will give you the freedom to draw and create without worrying about messing up., Prototypes are early-stage products that allow you to make changes to bags before you mass-produce and sell them. Don’t spend too much creating these “scrap” bags. Save the big spending for the product you’re ready to share with corporate buyers and your devoted customers.This may mean using synthetic leather instead of real leather. If you’ll be sewing on jeweled or fine-metal embellishments for the final product, use fake embellishments for the prototype.

, You’ll only be able to do some of your editing on a sketchpad. The best part about prototypes is that they let you refine a concrete product. Be critical of the bag and ask yourself how it will make customers happy, and if there’s anything that could disappoint them.Is this a fancier bag that will get scuffed up or damaged with lots of use? Is there a way to make it sturdier? Is it comfortable to carry? Does it fit all the essentials, including a phone, a wallet, and some makeup?

, Manufacturers quickly produce lots of products using your exact specifications for design and material. They’ll create both prototypes and - even more exciting - samples. Prototypes help you revise and fix your design, while samples get products ready for mass production. The samples allow you and the manufacturer to estimate the costs of production and pricing, to provide an example bag to give to marketers and buyers, and to have something to photograph.Find a manufacturer by looking online. Start by searching for producers in your area, and expand your search depending on what you need from your manufacturer.

, You and your manufacturer will likely spend a lot of time discussing the costs of production and the best price to make a profit off your bag. While you’re having this conversation, do research online and in fashion magazines to compare your prices with those of similar bags. You don’t want your bag to be either too expensive or too cheap to appeal to your customers., Contact local and big-name retailers and have your samples ready to send out. Do some online research about your potential sellers to make sure your product fits with what they currently offer to their customers.Start with local retailers. Since you’ll be selling in your community, this lets you receive detailed feedback from customers and store owners.Send pictures of your samples to popular online fashion blogs to drum up some excitement for your bags. Retailers want products that customers want to buy., Especially when you’re starting out, you need to keep track of how much money you plan to spend, and how much you’d like to make. It’s also important for you to spend some time thinking about who your customers are and how your products will thrill and dazzle them., Once you’ve got an established line or set of products, use every possible online platform to get them out there into the world. Social media is a wonderful way to let thousands and even millions of people around the world know that you’re ready to create the perfect bag just for them.Make a website or write a blog documenting your entire process. People will love seeing how you’re getting started and watching your bags move from nonexistent to finished and beautiful!
Start an online store through a website like Etsy. This already-established platform is easy to use and reliable. It can also give you some good exposure.
Use Instagram to share great photos of finished products or the production process.
Use Twitter and Facebook to send out fun messages to give your brand personality along with the products.
Use LinkedIn to develop the professional side of your business. People may use LinkedIn to see if they can work with or even for you.

, Look for a weekly market in your town or city. Especially during the summer months, these fun, outdoor exhibits are staples in most localities around the United States. These are great spots to test your your early designs.Starting small allows you to keep your initial costs low, since you can probably make the first several batches of bags on your own. This will let you avoid working with a manufacturer until you’re ready.Ask people what they think about your bags when they visit your spot. Even if no one buys your stuff, craft shows are perfect for getting good, honest feedback.

, Don’t let a bad photo taken on your smartphone be the reason your career as a handbag designer fails! Even though a session with a professional photographer is expensive, it’s worth the investment. Your bags deserve pictures that show them off in all their glory.If good photos are really out of your budget, ask your friends and family if anyone owns a nice camera. Lots of people do photography as a hobby, and close buddies may be willing to lend a hand for a free (or heavily discounted) bag.
This goes for your website, too. Nothing makes a website look unprofessional like bad pictures.

, PR and sales agents help you market to more customers and get better deals from retailers. They take a percentage of your profit, so wait until you’ve got an established income from your bags to hire these folks. Do research online to find agents who represent sellers similar to you, as this means they’ve got direct experience with your specific market., Having your work appear at fashion shows means that fellow designers, celebrities, and models will get to see your work. These extravagant affairs are highly publicized and glitzy, so they’re a perfect spot for showing off unique, new products.While some fashion shows may ask emerging designers to present their work, you can also pay venues to allow you to exhibit your bags., Offering your bags as gifts or raffle prizes at charity events not only allows you to get involved with causes you believe in, it also introduces your work to new people. These elaborate balls and galas often attract the who’s who among the rich and famous. If a celebrity wins and wears your bag, you’ve just gotten a boatload of free publicity!"

Alternative models often have piercings and tattoos, but you should not alter your appearance just to become a model. You should change hair or acquire body art because you desire them, and/or because they are meaningful to you. Alternative models typically look alternative on a daily basis, rather than dressing up for photo shoots.If you are under 18, you must have a parent’s permission before getting a piercing or tattoo.;
, There are several categories of alternative models. Some of the categories are similar, but some require completely different looks. Some categories are emo, hipster, punk, Goth, Lolita, burlesque, and for the heavily tattooed, a walking piece of art.Goth and emo are each distinct styles, but they share many similarities. Goth and emo styles are both known for black clothing, black or brightly colored hair, dark makeup, and a lot of accessories, like chokers and corsets. Punk is a style that is related to Goth and emo, but it is more focused on punk music, like band t-shirts and vests with pins attached.Hipster style has become very popular in recent years. “Hipsters” often wear flannel shirts, ironic shirts, beanies, and skinny jeans. Men often have beards, and women sometimes dye their hair in pastel shades.Dita Von Teese is perhaps the most well known celebrity that wears a burlesque style. Burlesque is a style deriving from the 1800s, and it is often associated with stripteases. Velvet clothing, red lipsticks, corsets, garters and stocking, and high heels are associated with burlesque style.Lolita derives from Vladimir Nabakov’s Lolita that was originally popular in Japan, but it is now popular all over the world. It is typically a “cutesy” style that strives for the wearer to appear youthful, like a young girl., Don’t be afraid to dress in a way that doesn’t follow the social norm. Alternative models often model for goth, hipster, and emo brands. You can find these types of clothes at stores like Hot Topic, Vivienne Westwood, Jeremy Scott, and Moi Meme Moitie. Some types of clothes and shoes to wear are:Big boots. Doc Martens or platform boots.
Gothic Lolita dresses
Black clothing
Pastel clothing
Accessories with skulls and pentagrams.

, It is not necessary to have an unnatural hair color to become an alternative model, but many do. Pastel colors like light, pink lavender, and turquoise are popular right now. You can also try bright colors like blue or hot pink, as well as mixing multiple colors. If hair color isn’t your thing, consider getting an alternative hair cut.An alternative hair cut could be buzzed, short pin-up style bangs, and spiky hair.
Hair can be colored at home, but it is safer to leave the job to a professional.
Unnatural colors fade quickly, so be prepared to re-dye your hair every few weeks.

, Traditional modeling usually frowns upon an alternative style, but alternative models are encouraged to have tattoos, piercings, and body modifications. You should choose the style, location, and for tattoos, the content. It’s okay to have as little or as many as you want. There is no such thing as too many tattoos for an alternative modelSome areas you can pierce are your ears, nose, septum, lips, and eyebrows. You can also have gauges, which involves putting a hole into your earlobe and stretching it out.

, Traditional models typically are required to be thin and youthful, but that is not the case with alternative models. It’s okay to be thin and youthful, but there is room for all kinds of body types. You can be short, thick, older, etc. Do not try to change your body type to become an alternative model. Chances are, there is a place for the body type you currently have.Only eat healthy and work out to lose weight if you desire to do so for personal reasons.

, You do not have to professional photos taken right away. Social media like Instagram, Facebook, and Tumblr are valuable tools to get your name out there. You should create a social media account for your modeling and have a separate personal account. Take selfies or have someone take photos of you and post them. Post regularly and respond to those who make comments.The photos do not have to look professional at first. Just be sure to have them taken in good lighting and style yourself in a way that makes you feel confident.
Do not give away personal information to anyone who you interact with on social media. If a photographers contacts you, ask to see their website before agreeing to do a shoot.

, You should practice modeling before hiring a photographer. Posing for pictures helps you become comfortable for the camera, and it is a good way to see if you enjoy modeling. These photos can be posted to social media.Try modeling some of your favorite clothing in different areas of your backyard, city, or home.
Pose in some pictures, but try out some candid photos of you walking, moving, or posing with other friends.
Review the photos to see which poses turned out the best and appear the most natural.

, Look for photographers in your area. Many photographers will be willing to do a photo shoot for you. But, it is better to search for a photographer that has experience with models, especially alternative models. Hiring a photographer can be costly, so make sure you have money set aside to cover the entire cost of the session.Look through several photographers’ websites before choosing one. Choose the one whose photos stand out to you the most.
Student photographers will sometimes be willing to do a photo shoot for a lower price. Look for high school and college photographers in your area.

, You should come out of the session with at least one good headshot and photos of you in a variety of angles. It is good to have a straight on photo, photos taken from all sides, and some candid pictures. Take a few changes of clothes with you to the photoshoot., A comp card, or composite card, will serve as your business card. It is a marketing tool that agents will take with them when considering you for a job. Photographers typically will be able to make a comp card for you. The front of the card should have your headshot. The back of the comp card should have about four photos. Include a candid photo, and pictures of you from a few different angles.6”x9” is a good size for a comp card.

, There are websites out there for models that help them network, find jobs, and promote their pictures. Pure Storm and Model Mayhem are two well known sites. Sign up for an account on one or both websites. Then, add your information, post pictures, and search for casting calls. These sites will help you build up a portfolio.You will need to choose a picture for an avatar, add your name, put your location, what you are willing to do, and write about your physical characteristics (tattoos and piercings).

, There are some websites, like Wix, that offer free options for websites, but you will want to buy a domain name eventually. You may want to wait until you have experience to create a website, but it is okay to create one with your photos taken by a photographer when you first start out. You should have a main page, about me, and portfolio section. Most websites will have templates, both free and priced, available, but you can create your own template if you or someone you know is knowledgeable about creating websites.You should have your contact information either on its own page, or in the about me section. Put your email, but avoid adding your phone number unless you think it’s necessary.
Add a resume and update it as you gain experience.
You can buy a domain name sites like Wix, Squarespace, and GoDaddy.

, If you have model friends, socialize with them as much as possible. If you do not, look on websites like Model Mayhem for people to talk to, or for meetups in your area. Making connections is the best way for a new model to find out about jobs and opportunities. Go to concerts, festivals, parties, and events. Make friends not just with other models, but with photographers, stylists, musicians, and actors..


Always be safe when meeting up with people you don’t know. Meet in a crowded area, have your cell phone on you, and bring a friend if possible.

, Working for free is not ideal, but it is often necessary. This is the best way to build up your portfolio when you don’t have much experience. Take every opportunity you can. Offer your services for fashion shows, photo shoots, events, music videos, etc. Even the smallest jobs add to your portfolio., Look for agencies that have and continue to sign alternative models. You can usually see some of the models that are currently signed with the agency. Focusing on agencies that cater to alternative models will increase your chances of finding a place to sign you.Look at the policy for sending in photos to the agency. Also, look for open call dates.

, Open calls give new model a chances to visit agencies in hope of being signed. Look for agencies that host open calls and attend as many as possible. You can attend local open calls, or to travel to attend an open call. Agencies may have different and specific requirements, but you will typically need to at least bring a headshot and comp card. [[


Don’t worry if you do not hear anything back from go-sees at first. It may take attending a lot of go-sees to find an agency willing to sign you. This is not necessarily because of you, but because a lot of people attend go-sees.
Make sure to be on time, dress in the outfit you feel best in, and be able to accept criticism.

, Once you have been signed with an agency, you will need to attend go-sees. Go-sees are meeting that your agent sets up for potential job opportunities. A go-see may be for a fashion show, magazine, music video, or catalog. These are important to attend because this is how you find jobs once signed with an agency.The requirement for a go-see, such as what you wear and what you bring with you, depends on the agency and who you are meeting with.

Check with your high school to see if there are any classes that might prove relevant to the field. At the very least, you should try to take a home economics course. Some high schools may even have more in-depth sewing courses that can teach you about fashion design, hand sewing, and industrial power sewing.Take art electives to help you develop a better aesthetic taste so that you will be more prepared to work with color and style.
Make sure that your classes also help you maintain basic math skills so that you will have no problem working with measurements.
A business class or two can also help if you plan on becoming a self-employed tailor.
Work-study courses can be beneficial, too, since the instructor might be able to help you land work with someone in the fashion industry.;
, Even though you do not need to have a college degree, you can benefit from taking college classes about fashion and design.


In addition to being beneficial for your own improvement, having college coursework or a college degree might make your employer more likely to consider you for higher level jobs. You may even work your way up the chain and be placed in charge of other tailors as a supervisor.
Check with local community colleges and technical schools since they are more likely to have sewing, design, and fashion courses than four-year liberal arts colleges. The classes at a community college or technical school will also be cheaper.
Look for schools that offer a variety of courses at the beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels.
Study matters related to clothing construction, patterns, textiles or fabrics, finishes, detailing, and fit.
Ideally, your classes should provide you with textbook information and plenty of practice sewing exercises.

, Many tailors end up being self-employed. While it is not strictly necessary, you might find it beneficial to take a few business and business finance courses at the college level to prepare you for the responsibilities and duties involved in running your own business.


Look for business classes at community colleges in your area. Pay close attention to general business classes, business finance classes, entrepreneurship classes, marketing classes, and any other class dealing with small business topics.

, One of the best things you can do to prepare yourself for work as a professional tailor is to take an apprenticeship under a tailor who is already established in the business. An apprenticeship will train you in the skills you need to enter the business, and the experience will look good on your resume or CV.


You might be able to find an apprenticeship program working with an alteration tailor, custom tailor, or shop tailor. An official alteration tailor apprenticeship will consist of roughly 4000 hours of work, while apprentices to custom tailors and shop tailors will complete roughly 8000 hours.
The tailor you apprentice under will start you with simple tasks related to sewing, mending, and altering garments. As you demonstrate skill and understanding, you will be given more complex tasks.

, Since actual apprenticeships can be difficult to come by, you can also obtain a little training simply by working with a tailor or in an alterations department doing tasks that are not directly related to the work of the tailor.


If you cannot land an official apprenticeship, try to get hired part-time in an alterations department at a clothing store or other similar workplace. Even if you do nothing but answer phones, tidy up, and schedule appointments, you will at least gain knowledge about the atmosphere you can expect to work in as well as any essential terminology or concepts.

, A tailor will need to work with the public, so practicing your salesmanship and customer service will be beneficial to you in the long-run. Moreover, having retail work experience could actually look good on your resume or CV if you decide to apply for a job with a professional tailor or alterations department.


You need to develop communication and interpersonal skills so that customers will feel comfortable with you as you take measurements and discuss the best ways to improve their garments.
While all retail work will give you some experience working with the public, some jobs are better than others. Part-time jobs in department stores, clothing stores, shoe stores, stores specializing in accessories are preferable to fast food or sit-down restaurant work. Store jobs, especially those just mentioned, will get you accustomed to the fashion retail setting instead of any generic retail setting. On the other hand, jobs at pet stores, convenient stores, and grocery stores have nothing to do with the industry and therefore are not as ideal.

, Official, professional training helps, but if you want to become an excellent tailor, you will need to practice on your own time, as well. If you plan on being self-employed, self-training might even be enough to get you started.


You can browse around at a book store for manuals that can teach you new sewing techniques or more information about fabric types, fashion design, and other topics related to the field.
You can also look for video demonstrations online to learn about different sewing techniques if you need more precise, step-by-step examples to follow.

, No matter how you choose to get your training and work experience in before you start your career as a tailor, you should make sure that you have plenty experience with the actual tools used in that line of work.You must be proficient in using a standard cloth measuring tape as well as other measuring instruments. Measuring tape is usually used for body measurements, but a short ruler is usually used for buttonhole spacing and hem lengths. French curve rulers help tailors work with angled seam lines.
You also need to work with professional level sewing machines and sergers. Learning when use different settings on these machines, different needle types, and different thread types should also be done.
Use a range of cutting tools, including sewing scissors, trimming shears, and rotary cutters. Know when to use each one and for what purpose.

, There are pros and cons for both options, of course, so you will need to review those before making your decision. Prepare for both paths to give your career more versatility, but focus your efforts on the path you desire.


Working for someone else limits the amount of responsibility and worry you need to have over the management or marketing of the business. The downside, however, is that you have less freedom over the work you take and will not reap the full earnings of your work.
If you are self-employed as a tailor, you will need to spend time on marketing and administrative tasks. You can set your own hours and conditions, though, and you can also keep more of your earnings.
It is estimated that 44 percent of tailors are self-employed while 26 percent are employed in retail trade. The remaining 30 percent work for other services and industries., Professional tailors are often hired by department stores, bridal boutiques, and other clothing stores and manufacturers who need someone to make alterations on clothes.


If you do plan to work for someone else, look for job openings with textile and apparel manufacturers, department stores, and dry-cleaners. Any store or manufacturer that works in the fashion industry might be a possibility. You can also check with existing tailor shops to see if they need any additional help.

, Starting your own business as a tailor can be a difficult task, but doing so can give you more control over the work you accept, and you can begin right away without needing to be screened or interviewed by potential employers.


Review the legal and financial requirements for starting up your own business. Make sure that your business is registered and that you can secure financing.

, Your portfolio should include photographs and samples of tailoring-related work you have done, including any work you have done in alterations or design. This portfolio can be a valuable asset when applying for jobs or finding clients.


A portfolio should include sample photographs of clothing you have altered and clothing you have designed. You can also include any design sketches you have, as well.
Try to include samples in a range of clothing styles, from casual to formal, and from men's to women's. Doing so will make you appear more versatile, making your talents more appealing.

, Professional organizations that consist of tailors and those in the clothing industry can provide you with support and additional educational resources. This can benefit you no matter which career path you take, but it is especially helpful if you decide to go into business for yourself.


Professional organizations worth checking out include the Custom Tailors and Designers Association, the Association of Sewing and Design Professionals, the American Sewing Guild, and the Embroidery Trade Association.
Professional organizations can make it easier for members to take continuing education courses. They might also provide tailors with the opportunity to join professional listings, and many organizations also provide marketing resources and networking opportunities.

, Unless you work for a department store that only allows you to do work for its clients, knowing how to attract your own clients is an important piece of knowledge to have if you want your career to thrive.


Make use of traditional advertisements, like newspaper ads, and digital advertisements, like social media accounts and business websites. Additionally, you should never underestimate the power of “word of mouth” advertisements. Happy clients will tell others, thereby spreading the word about your business.

, If you have the passion and talent necessary for the job, working as a tailor can be very rewarding. This field has relatively poor job growth, however, and you should not expect to become too rich doing it.


As of May 2010, the median hourly wage for tailors was $12.77, while the median annual income usually comes to about $25,850.
In 2010, there were an estimated 57,500 tailoring jobs in the United States.
The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics only anticipates a 1 percent growth in employment opportunities for tailors from 2010 to 2020.Aspects affecting the lack of demand for tailors include the fact that most clothes are now produced cheaply in other countries, as well as the fact that the demand for more expensive custom clothing continues to decline.

However, if you’re short but have a fun-loving attitude and strong work ethic, you can still succeed.Officially, there aren’t any weight requirements, but most international fashion models weigh between 110 and 130 pounds (50-59 kg).Depending on who you model for, “plus-size” models can wear between a size 8 (UK size 10/EU size 38) and a size 14 (UK size 16/EU size 44).;
, In most cases, you have to be 16 to 21 years old.If you’re under 18, you’ll need a parent or legal guardian to sign your contract. Depending on the state you live in, you might also need a work permit if you’re still a minor.If you’re over 21 but look younger, you could still have a chance. However, unless you hit superstardom, you’re “too old” by age 23., On the runway, you need to have perfect posture. Square your shoulders and straighten your back. Relax your hands, but don’t let your arms swing too much. When you walk, take long strides, and place one foot directly in front of the other.Once you get the walk down pat, practice walking in high heels. Start in low-level pumps. Then, gradually work your way up to stiletto heels.

, Dedicate about an hour a day, at least four days a week, to your workout. Work all muscle groups to keep your bones and muscles strong. Add some cardio for heart health and yoga for flexibility and relaxation.

, Focus on fresh, preferably organic, foods. Plant proteins, complex carbohydrates, and monounsaturated (“good”) fats are both filling and nourishing.Good choices include legumes (beans, peas, and nuts), dark leafy greens like kale, and whole grains like long-grain rice and barley.


If you want to go on a diet, talk to your doctor first—even if you’re in perfect health.
Never starve yourself. If you think you might have an eating disorder, call the National Eating Disorders Association at 1-800-931-2237 or text “NEDA” to 741741., The average adult needs about 64 fluid ounces (1.89 L) of water per day. If you exercise vigorously, you should drink more.Talk to your doctor for specific recommendations. In addition to keeping you alive and healthy, water also prevents you from overeating.

, A healthy diet and exercise program will minimize common skin problems like acne. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, wash your face at least twice a day with oil-controlling facial scrub. If you have dry skin, use a moisturizing facial wash. Wear sunscreen between 10:00am and 2:00pm, when UV rays are strong. Too much UV exposure can cause premature wrinkles, which are a career killer.Treat the occasional breakout with a dab of tea tree oil. If acne breakouts remain stubborn, talk to a dermatologist about prescription medications.

, This includes alcohol and nicotine. Getting drunk everyday can damage your liver and your ability to think clearly. Smoking leads to long-term problems like heart disease, emphysema, cancer, and premature ageing. Hardcore drugs like cocaine or heroin are equally as dangerous and deadly.

, Seek out professional photographers to create your headshots, profile poses, full body shots, and back shots. Wear simple form-fitting clothing like a tee shirt and skinny jeans. Too many layers will cover what agents and talent scouts want to see.Agents often want to see casual photos in addition to your portfolio. Smile for a few snapshots, but also experiment with other facial expressions., Most models work in only one or two markets, such as New York or Paris. Different markets have different preferences for body types. Search online and read fashion magazines to figure out which markets are right for you., Contact top agencies like Elite or Ford. Each agency has its own rules on how to apply. If you break those rules, they won’t represent you. Check their website before contacting them or sending your portfolio.Typically, you’ll apply as a general model and move to the runway after the agency chooses you.


Expect your agent to have your best interests in mind. They should always treat you like a professional. If you’re brand new to modeling, they should advise you on nutrition and fashion tips. You should also expect them to connect you with the best stylists and photographers.Beware of scams! Investigate lesser-known agencies through web searches or the Better Business Bureau. Avoid agents who ask for money up front or try to sell you modeling classes or photo sessions., When meeting with an agency, just be yourself. Don’t wear clothing or makeup you wouldn’t usually wear. On the other hand, if your usual look is funky and outrageous, go with that! Whatever your usual look, wear simple form-fitting clothes so that the agent can see your body., Contacts get you work in this industry. Go to networking events, and be very sociable. Talk to your agent and co-workers about introducing you to designers and scouts. Go to runway shows with people who could make introductions.

, Attorneys can be expensive, but they’ll protect your interests throughout your career. Research lawyers with a track record of winning cases for models. Ask other models for recommendations., Never sign off on anything before reading it closely. Some contracts try to force models to compromise their morals or health for certain assignments. If the wording is too complex, have your lawyer review it. Negotiate (or have your lawyer negotiate) with the agent or scout if you’re not comfortable with the terms., Speak up for yourself if someone pushes you to do something you’re against. Talk clearly. Don’t mumble or speak at a really low volume. You should also use your body language to show your confidence. Straighten your posture, and make eye contact during conversations., Modeling is a competitive industry, so you should be prepared to handle rejection from time to time. You’ll also have to deal with criticism. Even if you've been winning beauty competitions all your life, agents and scouts might insult your looks if you don’t fit the type they’re looking for. Don't let it get to you. Eventually, you will find an assignment that needs someone exactly your type.

, Like any career, modeling has its down sides. Prepare yourself for working late nights and waking up early the next morning. Get used to last-minute changes in photo shoots, constantly guarding your privacy, and spending lots of time just waiting around. You’ll also have to learn to deal with the jet lag and loneliness that comes with frequent traveling., While you can control your weight to a certain extent, your height is another story. The good news is that not all models are tall and thin. If you’re shorter than 5 feet 5, consider modeling petite clothing. If you have a medium-to-large build, consider modeling plus-size clothing.


You could also model items like shoes, makeup, or jewelry. In these fields, agents and scouts focus on specific parts of your body like your hands or feet.

, Even if things do work out, you’ll likely need something to fall back on by your mid-20s. Don’t wait until you need to make new plans. Start studying while you’re modeling or looking for modeling gigs. If you’re traveling for work, talk to an academic adviser about online courses.

, Modeling isn’t the only career in the fashion industry. With a BA in journalism, you can write for a fashion magazine. A BFA in photography and an impressive portfolio could land you a really nice living as a fashion photographer. If you have a knack for figure drawing and fiber arts like sewing, you should think about becoming a fashion designer.

Assemble a portfolio of your work.",How to Become a Fashion Designer," Successful fashion designers have a wide array of skills, including drawing, an eye for color and texture, an ability to visualize concepts in three dimensions, and the mechanical skills involved in sewing and cutting all types of fabrics.


Get excellent sewing tuition if you haven't already learned this skill well. Being able to sew difficult fabric under challenging situations will stand you in excellent stead throughout your career but you need to work at it - it's a skill that doesn't come easily to many people.
Understand how fabrics move, drape, breathe, react when worn, etc. Your in-depth knowledge of fabric is absolutely essential to using it properly when designing. Also know where to source materials from.
Learn from existing designers, not just who they are, but their backgrounds, their signature style, the learning that they undertook, where they studied. Knowing this will help you to be a better designer yourself, as you can borrow and build on their ideas.
Learn how to create storyboards and product ranges. Be good at researching trends and finding inspiration from social media, comparative shopping and trade shows.
Start developing these skills at a young age. Be prepared to devote hours of time to perfecting your craft. A little bit everyday will make you gain a deep understanding of fashion on the long run if you are planning a career. Trying to do all at once might get you discouraged.;
, If you can, it makes good sense to get a diploma or degree in fashion design or a related program. You'll learn a great deal, make excellent early contacts and have ample opportunity to show off your skills in a less judgmental environment (although still be prepared to be critiqued!) Do one (or both) of the following:


Get a degree in fashion design. Most programs are three or four years long. FIDM and Parsons are two of the most popular design schools in the United States. You will study drawing, color and composition, pattern-making, and draping.In addition to learning practical skills like these, you will also be working with industry professionals who may serve as important contacts in the future and who can give you first-hand advice and feedback on your work.
Apply for an internship or apprenticeship. If school is not for you, or if you simply feel that real-world experience will be of more benefit to you, then find a fashion internship. You will need to have an impressive portfolio to apply and be willing to start at the bottom; interns are often given menial tasks like getting coffee. Again, the connections you make through your internship or apprenticeship will be vital as you pursue your career in fashion, and working with industry professionals will give you an opportunity to pick up important skills first-hand.

, You may need to start at the bottom but you do need to have some goals in mind as to the type of designing you want to undertake lifelong. Are you interested most in haute couture, ready-to-wear, fitness/leisure gear, the mass market or niches such as eco wear? Each has advantages and disadvantages that you'll need to explore before reaching your final decision on which pathway to pursue. Within these major fields, you'll also need to decide on a few sub-set areas for your fashion design. You might wish to straddle a few but to begin with, don't over-extend yourself as it's better to perfect your designing within one area and then experiment when you've already got a good foothold in the industry. For example:


Women's daywear, women's evening wear
Men's daywear, men's evening wear
Boys' wear and/or girls' wear; teenage wear
Sportswear/fitness/leisure wear
Knitwear
Outdoor, adventure, outerwear
Bridal wear
Accessories
casual
Costume design for theaters, movies, the advertising industry and retailers.

, Think about real needs prior to think about fame. Looking cool is fine, but it won't sell garments by itself. If you are planning to become a fashion designer, you will not only make apparel for yourself or for famous people. You can't making a living out of that: they're not even 1% of the population. Even though you see big names in magazines: it's advertisement, not the reality. It doesn't work that way. Designers are especially needed for people with real, imperfect bodies that still want to look their best. Having a snob attitude will blind you from making money. Reality is: you don't design for yourself, you design for others.

, Be realistic: if you happen to live in a very warm country, you will have a tough time selling ski jackets. Look around you. What do real people need and want. For example, if you plan on designing a complete collection, you will need more tops that bottoms because most people have more tops than bottoms in their wardrobe in general. Tops are great to change your looks while a plain nice fitting pant will match most of your tops. Keep it simple and realistic. Extravagant sketches are nice on paper, but great tops and jeans will sell out in more interesting numbers than evening dresses.

, Mass market may not sound as glamour as evening or luxury wear, but it will get you a long way and pay your groceries. If you have to create a style that will be produced more than a hundred times, you need to make it right from the start. It will improve your designing skills as you will have to understand perfectly the garment you are about to sell. Bad styles will get you returns and cost quite a bunch of money to your boss.

, Observe and note the fabric they are using; the zipper size they use (for their garments to be strong enough for its usage); fabric quality for its properties such as impermeability, comfort, breathability or care; colours that sells in your country. Starting from your competitors qualities is not copying: it's observation. With taking the best of every pieces and analyzing it, you will understand what makes a ""favorite"" piece of clothing. They are usually best sellers. Your customers (whether they are buyers for stores or regular people) want something that looks good on them in the first place. Extravagant pieces are worn only a few days a year, they're great, but they may not bring you a salary to live with.

, What is your absolute strength in designing? Perhaps you're a whizz at accessories or a genius with yoga pants. Your passion and skill are an important first part of the equation. Of course, the second part is matching this to what the market wants, which in fashion, is part convincing the market and part noticing what the market is demanding.

, You may love clothes but clothing is only part of the story when undertaking fashion design. You'll also need excellent communication skills, a willingness to work very hard (often 24/7), a tough hide when criticized, an ability to cope with stress, openness to having many different clients and/or bosses, an acceptance that there will be loneliness or isolation on occasion (depending on how you set up your design business or career) and an ability to be a self-disciplined self-starter.


Being a fashion designer is probably for you if: You want to devote your life to this career (it's your ""vocation""), you don't mind uncertainty or insecurity, you are willing to stand up for what you believe in, you have distinct ideas about what is important in fashion, you listen to clients well, you know the fashion industry inside out and you live, eat and breathe fashion.
Being a fashion designer is probably not for you if: You can't manage stress well, you don't like uncertainty or instability, you want a career without too many highs or lows, you need other people to praise your efforts, you need a lot of guidance, you hate being financially unstable and you have too many other interests in life.

, Being a successful fashion designer not only requires talent and creativity, it also requires a sound knowledge of the business and marketing aspects of the fashion world. Keep yourself updated on the happenings in the fashion industry by regularly reading trade journals like Women's Wear Daily and Daily News Record.Many fashion design programs include courses in marketing.Some programs/majors highlight marketing more than others, so be sure to do ample research on the coursework involved in the program you choose. If you've already undertaken a course but missed the marketing/financial side of things, consider doing short courses in these aspects of business.
Learn beyond design. There is an entire supply chain involved in the fashion industry and you need to understand what each person's job is, so that you can see things from their perspective too, in order to make compromises, meet demands and understand where things get held up. Research what others do, such as buyers, merchandisers, pattern cutters, garment and fabric technologists, quality controllers, graders, sample machinists, sales people, PR and marketing people, fashion journalists, retailers, event organizers, fashion stylists and so forth.
Know your customer. This skill is basic and essential and it's one a fashion designer must never lose sight of. Know how much your customers spend, what their lifestyles are, where they like to shop, how they like to shop and what they like and dislike. Know what are absolute needs and what are the things that only get bought when disposable incomes are less tight. If you have done marketing, you should have a solid understanding of how to work out customers' needs.
Know your competitors. Always keep an eye on what other fashion designers in your area of interest are doing. At a minimum, keep up. Better still, surpass them while still meeting your customers' needs.
Trade fairs are an excellent place to develop deeper understanding of how the fashion industry works and what will work for you in terms of meeting customer needs and staying competitive.

, There are various ways to find work in the fashion industry as a designer and it depends on the type of designing you're interested in. In some cases, being versatile will help you a great deal, just so that you get the experience and then jump across to your real passion later. And in most cases, you'll need to be persistent and apply to many different places to get your foot in the door. For starters, some places to apply to include:


Existing fashion houses and designers - look for internships, entry-level paid positions, assistants to designers, etc.
Costume positions with movie studios, theaters, costume stores, etc.
Online advertisements through various online job agencies
Word of mouth––use your college or fashion industry contacts to get you through the door. In an industry that values what people who already are well positioned have to say, this is a good way to get started.

, You may be exceptionally creative but be absolutely certain that if you run your own fashion label, you need to be business savvy. You do need to understand those numbers and the invoices that keep piling up on your table. If you really hate this stuff, there are good options, such as asking your accountant to take care of all things financial but it still pays to keep on top of the whole thing yourself. And if you really, really hate this side of it, look for work as a fashion designer with a fashion house instead of running your own label.


What type of trader will you be? There are many possibilities, including sole trader, partnership, incorporated company, etc. Each has distinct advantages and disadvantages that you should discuss with your legal and financial advisers before proceeding. Be sure that you are covered for liability in all circumstances, especially if you're in a particularly litigious culture.

, You may need to be willing to move to match your market but that depends on how you work and sell. Being realistic means recognizing that it's pointless trying to sell a lot of haute couture to people who only want career clothing in a semi-rural town while it's no good trying to sell bikini to the Inuit. You'll need to focus on where your market is most likely to be and either work out whether it's best for you to live and work in that same area or how to get the distribution from your current area to the place where it's most likely to sell.


Take into consideration the influences around you. As a creative person, part of your creative process is being around like people and sparking off their ideas and suggestions too. It's a lot harder to do this alone or working alongside people who aren't into your fashion approaches.
Remember too that seasonality impacts fashion designing and may have an impact on the type of clothing you're producing and where you wish to sell it.
Consider the power of online selling. Provided you use good quality three dimensional images that can be zoomed and turned, selling your fashion online to anywhere in the world is another realistic possibility nowadays. This allows you greater flexibility in where you'll live and design and can reduce the daily commute to zero. This may be ideal if you plan on staying a small fashion label. Even then however, you should still make allowances for traveling to major fashion shows.
Living in a city with a thriving fashion industry makes good sense for many designers. According to the Global Language Monitor (GLM), the following cities were the top fashion capitals of the world in 2012, in descending order:London, England
New York, US
Barcelona, Spain
Paris, France
Mexico City
Madrid, Spain
Rome, Italy
Sao Palo, Brazil
Milan, Italy
Los Angeles, US
Berlin, Germany.
Mumbai, India



, Your design portfolio will be vital when applying to design jobs and internships, as it is your chance to market yourself and your work. Your portfolio should display your best work, and highlight your skills and creativity. Use a high-quality binder to show that you take yourself seriously as a designer. Include the following in your portfolio:


Hand-drawn sketches or photographs of these sketches
Computer-drawn designs
Resume
Mood or concept pages
Color or textile presentation pages
Any other pieces that fairly reflect what you're capable of doing and evolving into.

The majority of your photos will be done by you (or a friend), but dropping a professional image into the mix every now and then is a great way to get a little extra attention.

Agencies, editors and bloggers are looking for real people of all shapes, sizes, races and genders.
Focus on making yourself look as great as possible in your pictures.
Don’t worry about forcing yourself to conform to preconceived notions of what a model is “supposed” to look like.

Be aware that site models usually work for free.,
Search for legitimate online modelling communities to join.,
Stay alert for possible modelling scams.,
Watch out for unsafe environments.",How to Become a Site Model4," In most cases, site models do not get paid by websites/blogs for their images. This is because the majority of site model photos are considered to be “candid” – which means they aren’t high resolution/professional quality and mostly taken by the site models themselves.Most site models simply enjoy taking photos and are happy to provide them at no cost to websites/blogs for the social/online exposure.
Candid photos are not considered to be copyrighted artwork, so anyone can save and use these photos.

, If you are interested in becoming a professional model, you can use site modelling to get your start in the business. There are online communities and agencies that allow site models to upload their images to be viewed by industry professionals. Modelling agencies, casting directors and photographers sometimes look for new talent through these platforms.


These community websites usually make money by charging you a monthly membership fee in order to upload your photos and participate.Some of them will also require that you pay them a 10% finder’s fee if you are discovered for a contract job through their site.
Be very careful – not all of these agencies are legitimate. There have been reports of sexual assault and even models going missing after showing up to photoshoots set up through them., Unfortunately, the modelling industry is flooded with scams that strive to get money from you without offering any legitimate services. If an agency asks you to pay an upfront fee before they will provide a service, they are not legitimate. Another red flag is if a company requires you to use a specific photographer of their choosing.If you are solicited through an email or Facebook, you are probably being taken advantage of.Never respond if you are asked to send suggestive photos of yourself.


If you are urged to take an opportunity immediately because it’s temporary, it’s usually a scam.
If a deposit is required, which the company claims is refundable, and they only accept cash or money orders – this is a scam.
Do your research and never give a company your personal information until you confirm their legitimacy.

, Never arrange to meet about potential modelling work by yourself or with someone you’ve never actually met. If you are contacted for a shoot and you feel uncomfortable going to it alone, request to bring someone with you. If the photographer refuses, you may want to reconsider the offer. Anyone under the age of 18 needs to bring a guardian with them to contract jobs. If you are denied that, you should be very concerned.If you show up to a shoot and are asked by the photographer to remove your clothing without being told about the nudity initially, leave immediately.
If you feel you’ve been taken advantage of in some way, contact The Model Alliance or go to www.modelalliance.org for more information."

Be careful when signing a contract.",How to Become a Model when You Are a Teen," Before you can decide whether modeling is something that you would enjoy or have the necessary qualities for, it helps to familiarize yourself with what the industry requires. It’s important to understand that there are different types of modeling that you might do, such as fashion, plus-size, and commercial, and you may be a better fit for some than others. Figure out what type of modeling that you would like to pursue.Fashion models typically walk the runway at designer fashion shows or pose for editorial photo shoots. They are usually at least 5’8”, are thin, and not very curvy.
Plus-size models are usually at least 5’8” as well, but typically are a size 10 or above. They typically model plus-size clothing and accessories.
Commercial models pose for everything from print ads to magazines to catalogs. There’s more variety in the size and look in this field of modeling, so you can be shorter than 5’8” and curvy.
Parts models pose to showcase specific parts of the body, such as their hands or hair. You don’t necessarily have to have a certain body type for this type of modeling as long as the body part in question meets the right criteria.;
, Like acting and other careers in the entertainment industry, modeling is an extremely competitive business. It’s also based almost entirely on your physical appearance -- if you don’t have the right look, you aren’t going to be able to make a go of it. That means if you have your heart set on being a runway model and you’re only 5’2,” you may want to reconsider. You can’t count on becoming a supermodel either.Most models aren’t paid very much. In fact, the mean hourly wage for models in 2015 was only $17.91 an hour.

You should pursue modeling if it’s a passion for you, but it’s important to finish school and consider other careers that you might also enjoy.
If you’re in your early teens and haven’t experienced a major growth spurt yet, you may be better off waiting to pursue modeling until you’re a little older.

, If you’re under 18, you need your parents’ permission to begin modeling, so getting them on board with your plans is key. Explain to them why pursuing a modeling career is important to you. You can help show them how serious you are about by sharing some of the research that you’ve done, such as the type of modeling that you think you’re best suited for. You may also need to reassure them that school will continue to be a priority no matter what happens with your modeling career.To help your parents understand why it’s important to you to model, you might say something like, “I think modeling would really help boost my confidence,” or “I feel like modeling would really allow me to express myself.”
If your parents are opposed to you starting a modeling career, it’s best not to fight them on it. Give them a month or two to get used to the idea, and then try talking to them about it again.
To reassure them that your school work and other activities won’t suffer as a result of modeling, you might offer to set ground rules with them. For example, you might agree that you’re only allowed to pursue modeling if you maintain a certain GPA in school.

, If your parents have given you the okay to being a modeling career, you may want to consider taking a modeling class. This type of schooling isn’t necessary to become a model, but it can help you build confidence in front of the camera and get you acquainted with the business side of things. Do an online search for modeling schools and classes in your area to find a good fit.Most modeling classes cost money, so you may need to ask your parents to help pay for it. You might offer to do extra chores around the house in exchange for the classes.
Some modeling schools are scams. Be wary of any that require you to pay additional money for photographs or other add-ons. It’s best to check with the Better Business Bureau, and search for online reviews of the school that you’re considering.

, If you don’t want to attend modeling classes and aren’t sure how to pose in front of a camera, it can help to look at other models in actions for inspiration. Look through magazines, catalogs, and print advertisements to get an idea of the types of poses and movements that work well in modeling, so you’ll have some sense of what to do in front of the camera.

It’s also a good idea to try to recreate some of the looks that you see in magazines and other print materials in front of the mirror. Practice until you feel confident -- and then try to come up with some of your own moves, so you’ll feel more natural and effortless when it is time to pose.

, Even if it’s not in a professional capacity, getting some experience as a model can help you build your portfolio and resume. It can also help boost your confidence and make you more comfortable in front of the camera or on the runway. Check around to see if there are any local opportunities for modeling, such as a small business needing models for a print ad or a charity fashion show needing people to walk the runway.Getting even minor experience in modeling can also help you decide if it’s really a job that you’re interested in. Make sure that you enjoy the experience before you commit to pursuing modeling seriously.
You don’t need to get paid as a model for the experience to benefit you. Even if a friend needs a model for a school photography project, take the opportunity to get familiar with the process.

, Your physical appearance is extremely important when you're a model, so it's important to ensure that you maintain your shape. You don't want to gain -- or lose -- weight and lose your healthy appearance. Depending on the type of modeling that you're doing, your ideal weight may vary, but you should make an effort to eat healthy and exercise regularly.Eat a well-balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains such as oatmeal and brown rice, and protein, including chicken, fish, eggs, beans, and tofu. Avoid foods that are high in saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, and sugar.It's also important to drink plenty of water too. 64 ounces a day is a good rule of thumb, but you may need more depending on the weather or how much you're exercising.When it comes to exercise, try to find activities that you'll enjoy so you'll stick with them. Running, biking, and swimming are all effective cardio workouts, but you may enjoy taking dance or gymnastics classes. Playing your favorite sports such as soccer, volleyball, or basketball can help keep you fit too.
Make sure to get plenty of sleep too. While Photoshop can perfect photos, agents typically want to see someone who’s naturally attractive and healthy-looking.

, Before you can start booking jobs or looking for a modeling agency to represent you, you must create a portfolio of photos. Usually, a model’s portfolio contains pictures of past work, but when you’re just starting out, you likely won’t have any professional shots. If you have the money to pay a professional photographer to take photos, that’s usually the best option. However, you can also have a friend or family member take some shots for you -- just make sure to use a good quality camera and have sufficient lighting.Your portfolio should include some headshots, with your face shot from a variety of angles, as well as some full-length photos in fitted clothing.
You should have a mix of smiling and straight face shots to provide a range of looks.
In some shots, it’s also a good idea to go for a natural look with no makeup so booking agents will have an idea what you look like when you’re not all made up.
There should also be a page in your portfolio with your stats. Include hair color, eye color, height, weight, and other measurements.

, That’s because you get to meet casting agents in person, so you can make an impression with your personality in addition to your looks. If you don’t live in a major city, contact agencies in the closest city and see if they work with any smaller agencies in your area.Make sure to do research on the agencies that you contact to ensure that they’re reputable.
You’ll need to bring your portfolio to your open call. If you haven’t put together a portfolio yet, make sure to have at least a few photos that you can bring to show your range.

, You don’t necessarily have to wait for an open call to contact modeling agencies. Instead, you can send your portfolio and let the photos do the talking for you. Visit the websites of the agencies that you’re interested in, and see what their procedure is for submitting a portfolio. Some will allow you to do it online, while others will ask that you mail a hard copy.If you’re mailing a copy of your portfolio, don’t forget to include your contact information, so the agency can get in touch with you if they’re interested.

, If you’re lucky enough to score a meeting with an agent, it’s important to show that you understand that modeling is a business and will act professionally. That means you must be on time and prepared for the appointment. You shouldn’t be rearranging your portfolio in the elevator on your way up to the office -- it should be ready to go the day before. It’s also important to make a good first impression, so dress appropriately too.Your portfolio isn’t the only thing that you should bring to your meeting. Some modeling agencies may want to see more casual shots as well, so you may want to bring a few candid snapshots or Polaroids with you as well.
A modeling agent wants to see the real you, so wear little to no makeup and keep your hair natural.
You don’t have to show up to your meeting in fancy clothes, such as a gown or suit. Casual clothing works well, but make sure that it fits well. A pair of skinny jeans and a fitted tank top or t-shirt make an ideal outfit.
It’s a good idea to read up on the agency that you’re meeting with before your appointment. Learn what models they’re currently working with and who they’ve worked with in the past, so you have a better feel for the company.

, Your looks aren’t the only thing that are going to impress modeling agents -- they want to see that you have a fun, engaging personality as well. The best models are confident and can express themselves easily, so speak your mind at the meeting without being rude or unprofessional.Agents want to be sure that you are genuinely interested in modeling and not just being pushed into it by your parents or others. Make sure to convey your passion for being a model. You might say, “I really love the opportunity that modeling provides to express myself,” or “I never feel more confident than when I’m in front of the camera or walking down the runway.”

, When you're meeting with modeling agents, you don't want to appear nervous or self-conscious. That's why your body language is so important. Stand and sit up straight and hold your head up high to look more sure of yourself. It also helps to maintain eye contact and smile throughout your meeting too.Try to limit nervous gestures, such as bouncing your feet, fidgeting with your hair, or tapping your fingers on the desk or table. Staying still and relaxed projects a more confident image.
Try to avoid crossing your arms over your chest. It can make you appear defensive.

, Because modeling is such a competitive industry, chances are good that you’re going to hear many no’s as you try to land jobs or an agent. You have to learn not to take it personally -- sometimes, you just don’t have the look that’s required for a particular campaign. Even successful supermodels have been rejected at one point or another.


Remind yourself that you have to have plenty of persistence and determination if you’re going to make it as a model.

, Having a modeling agency offer you a contract is very exciting. However, if you’re under 18, your parents are usually legally required to sign the contract on your behalf. They should definitely read it over before signing it, and they may even want a lawyer to take a look at it. Make sure that you understand everything that’s in the contract as well -- it is your career after all.Don’t be afraid to ask questions about the contract -- to your parents or your agent. It’s important that you’re clear on all of the details.

Some headshots are taken outside, and others are shot indoors at a studio. Both of these can be effective, if done by the right photographer.

, Talk to friends in the modeling world to find out if they have any connections to a modeling agency. If not, go online and research nearby modeling agency. It is better to pick an agency that is close to you as opposed to commuting over an hour.

Distance cannot stop dreams.Many times your photographer will have contacts with a modeling agency. Some agencies will even look through your photographer's headshot portfolio if they need someone urgently.

You don’t have to move to L.A. or New York to become a model, although it doesn’t hurt. If you live in a small or rural town, research the nearest city.


For example if you live in Carbondale, Illinois, you could move to St. Louis or Chicago.

, While you’re first starting out, it is important to take modeling jobs to add to your portfolio. Unless the job offends your moral outlook on life, you should take the job. Having modeling experience will also show future employers that you know what it means to be a model.

Network.",How to Become a Plus Size Model," Depending on what kind of modeling you plan on doing, i.e., print, runway, fit modeling, the ideal height and size measurements will vary. For print modeling, models are usually 5’8” and up, and are sizes 12 to 18. For high fashion or runway modeling, models are usually 5’9” and up, and sizes 10 to 20/22. For fit modeling, models are usually 5’5” to 5’9” and size 18. And for commercial modeling, models can be any height, and are sizes 12 to 18.Although these height and size measurements may seem rigid, there are always exceptions. If you don’t fit these criteria, commercial modeling, fit modeling, parts modeling, and modeling for local and specialty boutiques are good alternatives.;
, Models need to have healthy skin, hair, teeth, and nails. Plus sized models’ bodies also need to be toned and in shape. Take care of your body by drinking plenty of water, getting regular exercise, and eating healthy.


It is recommended that you drink eight 8 oz. glasses of water per day, i.e. 2 liters (0.53 US gal) or half a gallon.
It is recommended that you get either 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. Examples of moderate exercise are brisk walking and swimming. Examples of vigorous exercise are running. Or, aim for a combination of both moderate and vigorous exercise.Prioritize healthy fruits, vegetables, meats, and grains over processed foods, fast food, meats with a high fat content, and sugary foods.

, Having confidence is crucial to being a successful plus size model. You need to know your body shape, and you need to be comfortable with your body and its size. If you are uncomfortable with your appearance, it will show, and becoming a plus size model will be much more difficult.


Be body confident by practicing positive self-talk. Remove negative self-talk, such as “I am fat” or “I am not good enough” with positive self-talk, such as “I love my body,” “My body can do amazing things,” or “I love my curves.”Focus on the things that you love about yourself. Pick a body part; it could be your hands, breasts, thighs, or even your freckles. Then, talk out loud about that body part in a complementary way, such as ""I love my thighs in these jeans.""
You can also focus on what your body parts allow you to accomplish versus how they look. For example, instead of talking about how bad or good your legs look, be grateful that your legs allow you to walk, exercise, dance, and can take you from place to place.

, Find out what agencies there are that contract plus size models. Not all agencies do, but it is becoming more commonplace for agencies to have plus size model divisions. For example, modeling agencies Ford and Wilhelmina have plus size modeling divisions. Additionally, look into the plus size models they have already contracted and make a log of their statistics, i.e., height and measurements, in order to see if the agency is right for you.It doesn’t hurt to study and learn about the top models, photographers, and stylists in the industry. For example, learn about the world’s first plus size model, Melissa Aronson. By having this knowledge, you will have a clearer picture of what the industry looks like. This also shows the agencies that you are serious about modeling and that it is something you have taken the time to look into., Always make sure that the agencies you are looking into are reputable agencies. Visit the websites of top agencies to get a feel for what a reputable agency is like. If someone wants a payment upfront in order to see you, this is a red flag, and most likely a scam agency.Never pay a manager or agent to be a part of a ""Lookbook"" or to find work for you. Agencies that are legitimate work on commission and receive their commission only after they have booked a job for you.
Beware of talent promoters and internet agencies online who say they will promote you or list you on their website for free or for money.

, As an aspiring plus size model, photos are your resume. Be sure to get some quality testing photos. Testing is when a model has a photographer take photos for their portfolio. It is also recommended that you have a professional make-up artist and hair stylist for the photo shoot.Depending on the photographer, it will cost around $200 to $500 dollars to develop a quality modeling portfolio. You need to have two main photos: a headshot and a body shot.


A headshot is photo of your shoulders and your head. You can have bare shoulders in the shot, or you can wear a simple tank top, lightweight cardigan, or button down shirt.A body shot is a full-length shot that shows your figure. You should wear clothes that accentuate your figure, as well as your hair and skin tone. Your policy on deciding what to wear in these shots is simplicity. Your outfit should be simple, i.e., one solid color and no logos. You hair and make-up should also be very simple and natural., Before going to an open call or taking photos for your portfolio, you need to practice. In order to practice, you need to know your body shape and how to move. You need to find out what your good sides are, your good angles, and the shapes that accentuate your body.Your mirror and lighting are your best friend here. Stand in front of the mirror to learn how your body shapes so you can perfect your poses. Play with different forms of lighting, i.e., bright, dim, incandescent, and color, in order to see which lighting brings out your skin tone. Also, play with angles, i.e., above, below, front, to the side, in order to see which angle accentuates your facial features.Remember to always hold your limbs slightly away from your body in order to create a separation. This will create the illusion that your limbs are slim and toned.Remember to elongate your neck, angle your jaw toward the camera, and learn how far you can turn your head before your nose ""breaks"" your cheeks. Practice these poses in front of the mirror regularly until they feel natural.

, Find out if the agency has open calls or castings and attend one! Additionally find out what the specific requirements are for that agency, i.e., what you need to bring and what you need to wear. For example, wear your best outfit. It could be simple jeans and a tank top or a simple dress. Try to avoid anything too loud.


The agency might ask you to bring two or three of your best outfits. They also might ask you to bring various copies of photos. Never give them your original photos however, because you usually do not get the submitted photos back.

, If the agency does not have an open casting, then you will most likely submit your portfolio online or through email. You usually only need to submit a couple pictures, your measurements, and how you can be contacted.


Remember to include your name, height, weight, bust, hips, and waist size, age, hair color, eye color, and contact information (phone number, e-mail, and address) on the back of your photos., If you are really serious about becoming a plus size model, networking is a key asset. Try to attend recruiting events or conferences where top agencies will be attending. You can introduce yourself to their representatives and get a feel for the agency. Networking will also enable you to meet other plus size models. If you are able to establish connections with other models, then you can possibly establish connections with other agencies, and get insider tips on how to succeed in the industry.Always be professional when you speak with an agency or its representative. Introduce yourself and tell them a little bit about yourself, for example ""Hello, my name is Jennifer Owens. I have been in the modeling industry for a year already, but I would like to take my vision in a different direction. Your agency seems to fit my profile. Can I leave my information and photos with you?"" Or, ""Hello, my name is Jennifer Owens. I have heard great things about your agency (you could possibly name some photographers and stylists the agency works with here), and I would love to have the chance to work with this agency. Can I leave my information and portfolio with you?""

Present the information in a packet.",How to Become a Model if You're Short2," There are several different types of modeling jobs that are inclusive to shorter people. While the high fashion modeling world is reserved for the tall and skinny, but there’s still plenty of other options. Consider some of the following options while complying your portfolio:


Editorial print
Commercial print
Catalogue modeling
Plus size modeling
Glamour modeling
Body parts modeling
TV commercials
Real life modeling (TV/film extras), For a beginner model, you should include 5-8 photos for your portfolio. The key to having a successful portfolio is it’s ability to convey the range of modeling you can do. If you have a few photos using one photographer, reach out and work with other artists. The beauty of photographs is that they rarely convey your height, unless you stand next to something that shows a scale.


Avoid any photographs with other people if they are much taller than you.
You should show your ability to demonstrate different characters. One way is to try an array of different wardrobes and makeup styles.If one of your photos is in black and white, but you think it is a great picture that is different from the rest, include it to the portfolio.

, There are several examples you can find online of modeling portfolios. Examples will help guide you in your presentation, but will also show where you can add more personality. Consider adding a high quality photo of you engaging in a hobby of yours. For example, if you are passionate about cooking, include a tasteful photo of you in the kitchen.


You should make sure to include a wide array of photos, but don't feel like you can't include any personal photos.
Include a unique attribute about yourself that isn't inhibited by being short. For example, you can portray a range of faces. This type of attribute will show your skills and agencies might be less concerned with your height.
Sometimes personalized photographs will stand out more for agencies.

, Print the photos in high definition in your preferred size. Most metropolitan markets accept the standard size of 8x10” or 8.5x11”. Some firms require smaller prints, while others ask for large prints (9x12”). Include on the first page some of your information:


Your name, local address, and contact.
Brief information about your work and goals.
Any relevant skills like second languages, acting, singing, etc.

There is plenty of room in the modeling world for short people, but there isn’t any room for models without work ethic. To keep a high level of work ethic and determination, you’ll need to be in good health. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.


Exercise at least twice a week.
Limit the amount of alcohol and drugs you consume.
Consume plenty of vegetables, grains, and eat organically as much as possible.

, Concentrate on your eyes, and learn how to project different emotions without moving the rest of your face. Follow other models on social media and see the range they can portray. Spend time in front of the mirror practicing different looks and body poses.


You should be able to portray an emotion if a photographer asks for it on the spot. Work on developing faces that express some of the quintessential emotions like being happy, sad, frustrated, confused, or awe-struck.
Develop subtle and exaggerate versions of each emotion to widen your range as a model.

, Instead of going to modeling school and spending money, attend a convention full of agents and talent scouts. Do a quick search to find the closest one to you and prepare for the convention. Before going to the convention, bring several copies of both your portfolio and headshot.A credible convention you can attend is ‘’Faces West’’. This is a good convention for an aspiring model without an agent.

, If you market yourself properly, you find jobs that are seeking small and petite models. Some firms will hire you as a teen model, even if you're 25 years old because of your height and proportions. Some other avenues you can choose are body parts modeling and face/beauty modeling.


Evaluate what parts of your body you find the most appealing. For example, if you think you have above average feet, market them.
If you are constantly being complemented for your eyes and beauty of your face, market your face as a platform for make-up modeling., Even after working as hard as you can, sometimes your height will truly limit your options. You need to seek out realistic jobs instead of striving for the runway. The runway is not as realistic for a model under 5'6. There is, however, plenty of other types of jobs doing commercial, catalog, and print based modeling.


Strive for your goals as a model, but if certain avenues don't pan out, seek out more attainable jobs.

Decide if you are girly, alternative, earthy, punk, etc. Showing off your personality through your appearance can draw attention to yourself, and lead people to focus on something other than your height.


Wear clothing that sets you apart from the crowd. Don’t be afraid to divert from popular fashion.
Try out a hair cut and color that flatters your face and gives you a distinct appearance.

, Opportunities to become a high fashion runway model are not impossible, but they are limited. Modeling for magazines, catalogs, and print ads are your best options for petite modeling. Specifically, consider parts, swimsuit, lingerie, and commercial modeling.Parts modeling involves modeling specific body parts like hands, feet, teeth, and eyes. Height does not matter for this type of modeling, as long as you meet the aesthetic requirement for the desired body part.
Body type matters more than height for swimsuit modeling. A fit and curvaceous body is desired more than a tall height for women in swimsuit modeling. For men, a fit and athletic body is more important than height.
Lingerie and underwear modeling have similar requirements to swimsuit modeling. The women should be fit and curvaceous, and the men should have an athletic figure. The model being comfortable with his or her body is important in this type of modeling.
Commercial modeling is aimed towards selling products. These products might be jewelry, cosmetics, cars, etc. The average height for a female commercial model is 5’4”, and a male commercial model is around 5’9”. Commercial modeling is a great field for petite models because the aim is to sell a lifestyle, and models of all ages, sizes, and ethnicities are sought after.

, Look for publication that you would like to be in someday. This will give you an idea of the types of jobs to pursue. Remember, that high fashion modeling may be difficult to pursue, so look for publications that show off petite models.Local magazines and newspapers are good places to start modeling. Pick up local publications and browse through their advertisements.

, There have been quite a few famous models that didn’t even reach 5’8”. Some of these models are Devon Aoki (5’5”), Eva Pigford (5’5”), Twiggy (5’6”), and Kate Moss (5’7”). These women have walked the runway and modeled for print publications. A few of them, like Twiggy and Kate Moss, are some of the most famous models in history. A short stature may make modeling success more difficult, but it’s not impossible., Find out whether or not your city is a good location for petite modeling. If there are few agencies in the area, you might need to relocate to a bigger city. You may only need to relocate if you desire to become a part of a larger agency, or in an area with a lot of opportunities. If you only want to do commercial modeling, a smaller city could yield enough opportunities.At this point, you should only consider making a move. Do not move until you have a portfolio, and you are confident that you will be successful enough to maintain a living by modeling.

, You will need to at least have some headshots taken. Look for photographers in your area that have done photo shoots with models in the past. Remember that having photos taken can be expensive, so make sure you have enough money set aside for a photo shoot. If you are on a budget, you may find a photography school with students willing to take pictures for free to build their portfolios.Browse the website of photographers in your area. It is important that you see their work before hiring them to take photos.

, If you see inspiring pictures in a magazine or catalog, find out who the photographer is and try get in touch. He or she might be interested in taking your picture, especially if he has new creative ideas for which he needs a model. This may be limited only to photographers in your area, however. Famous photographers will probably not have the time or incentive to respond.Send a polite email or social media message. Do not harass the photographer with repeated messages if he or she does not respond.

, A comp card, or composite card, is a marketing took used by models for self-promotion. This is akin to a business card that you can send to agencies interested in petite models. A comp card allows industry professionals to judge you based off of more than just a headshot. This is what your agent would send in to submit you for print work. It should have a headshot on the front, three to five photos on the back, and your measurements. A good size for a comp card is 6”x 9”.For a comp card, you should have photos showing you from every angle. Have one photo showing you facing the camera directly, and a few photos taken of you from various angles. It is also a good idea to include one or two candid photos.
Examples of comp cards can be found in a quick online search.
If you are a parts model, or a model that only shoots specific types of photos, then you will not need a typical comp card. Include photos of body parts if you are a parts model. Include photos of you in swimsuit or lingerie if you plan to be a swimsuit or lingerie model.

, This is a big book of photos that you will bring with you when seeking an agency or petite modeling gig. Superior photos can override a shorter height in the modeling industry, so make sure that you only include your best photos. Your portfolio will grow larger and change over time as you gain more experience., Research each agency that you are interested in to ensure that they have signed successful petite models. Many agencies let aspiring models know who they have signed in the past, though you can also search for the agency name online to find out more. Focusing on agencies that are interested in petite models will heighten your chances of finding work., Open calls are times when new models can visit a modeling agency to find out if anyone is interested in representing them. This is a good way to find potential representation if you do not yet have an agent. You can look for local calls, or choose to travel to attend an open call. Though it depends on the agency’s requirements, typically you will need to bring a headshot, comp card, and a swim suit.Open calls usually attract a lot of other aspiring models. Don’t be disappointed if nothing comes from your first few open calls.
Make sure to dress nicely, be on time, be able to accept criticism, and have a working phone number if the agency decides to call you back.

, Find out if there is something you can change to get accepted in the future. Some agencies may not want to answer questions, so do not push your questions if the agency is not willing to comply.


Send an email or thank you letter to the agent. Even if you are rejected, it is a good idea to send an email thanking the agent for taking his or her time to meet with you. The note or email should be short and thank them for their time. You never know when you will encounter this person in the future, so it is good to leave the person with a pleasant memory of you.

, Sign with the agent that seems most interested in you and offers the most opportunities. Make sure the agency can further your career before you commit to it. This may mean looking up reviews for the agency on the internet, asking others in the industry, and seeing if they have any successful clients.Be sure to review the contract carefully before signing it. Don’t make a commitment that you can’t stick with.

, Go-sees are meetings with professionals in charge of fashion shows, magazines, and catalogs. These are very important because they are what determines if you get a job. Go to every go-see that your agency books for you to elevate your chances of finding a job. What you do and what you wear to a go-see depends on the requirements of your agency, and the company you are meeting with.Never do anything during a go-see that makes you uncomfortable. A job is not worth risking your safety or personal values.

Ask them for the number of the local administrative office and the name and title of the person you need to speak with regarding modeling opportunities. Be sure to be polite (say please and thank them for their time).;
, You need to find out whether or not your local JCPenney is looking for new models, and how they go about hiring models. Ask if they cast for the models themselves, if they will only take models that have agents to vouch for them, and whether or not they go through a particular agency in the area. If your JCPenney hires directly, ask for an email or snail mail address that you can send a portfolio to and find out what specific requirements they have for talent submissions.


There is a high likelihood that your JCPenney will only take models from approved agencies for both their catalogs and printed ads, so be prepared to ask for the names of the agency or agencies that they have a professional relationship with, as well as their phone numbers and physical addresses.Ask questions to find out the criteria that they are looking for in current models; the look a company is looking for can change over time.

, If you've been told that your JCPenney only does business with select agencies, you will need to go through one of these organizations in order to work with JCPenney. If you live out in California, there is a list of approved agencies that JCPenney uses online. They include:Elite Management

Pick an agency that JCPenney works with.,
Pick an agency not contracted with JCPenney.,
Follow submission guidelines.,
Have a good attitude.,
Submit your portfolio.,
Sign a contract.",How to Become a JCPenney Model2," If you are legally a minor (that is, under 18 years old) you will have to get your parents' approval before you can sign on with an agency. There are a lot of benefits to having your parents' approval as well, like emotional support for stress management and the ability to get to your assignments.


Have a discussion with your parents. Explain to them why you want to be a model, and why you need an agent. ""I think that I could have a lucrative career as a model for JCPenney. They have a good reputation and there are stores across the nation, so I could live and work with them anywhere in the future. However, in order to work for them, I have to have an agent to get me into the door, and I can't sign any contracts until I'm 18. Please help me get an agent and start my modeling career.""
Talk with them about what their support will mean for you on a personal level. ""I know that what I want to do is going to be very time consuming and demanding on me. Without your support to take me places and help me manage my homework and professional life, I will have a very difficult time succeeding. This means the world to me.""
If you don't get what you want initially, treat the conversation with maturity: don't yell, cry, or otherwise throw a tantrum. You want to show them you're mature enough to handle working, and this is part of that. Instead, ask when you might be able to revisit this conversation with them in the future.

, There are many illegitimate agencies out there looking to take advantage of individuals' hopes and dreams. A real agency won't ask for money from you unless you're making them money, and that includes signing fees or costly modeling classes or workshops. You should look for agents that have long-standing reputations and are large and well-known.The top 10 modeling agencies are Next Model Management, One Management, Women Management, Storm Management, Elite Model Management, Marilyn Agency, DNA Models, IMG Models, Model Management, and Ford Models., Ask the nearest administrative office for JCPenney which agencies they work with. Since you want to work specifically with JCPenney, it will be quicker if you can successfully apply to an agency that works with them.


Do not get discouraged if you are initially rejected from the agency or agencies that JCPenney works with. You can always apply again in the future after you have built up your portfolio more.
Let them know, after you have signed with them, that you want to work with JCPenney as much as possible and that you would appreciate their assistance in achieving that goal.

, If you are turned away by an agency that works with JCPenney, apply to other agencies first in order to get jobs that will help build your reputation and name recognition before trying to switch representation. In addition to the top ten agencies listed before, you can find more modeling agencies and casting calls listed at Backstage.com and Models.com.


Be prepared to take jobs that are not related to JCPenney's work. Building your skills and name recognition is not a bad thing, and doing so will make you a more attractive applicant for your real end goal.

, Every agency has different requirements for desired looks and guidelines which you will be expected to follow perfectly. Some of these guidelines may prohibit things like hats, bows, sunglasses, and food or face paint on your face, but these are just examples and not an exhaustive list.The changing market will have an effect on the demand for models; currently many clients are seeking models with more ambiguous features that reflect the diverse populace as opposed to blonde-haired, blue-eyed models.

, It is important that you be very well-behaved, polite, discreet, and flexible, with the agency during any in-person meetings during the application process as well as once you are contracted. No one likes to work with a diva, so a bad attitude or an inability to make it to an appointment on time (or worse, failure to book any appointments due to distance) can cost an agency (and yourself) opportunities. It can also cause them to lose face with a client and make them reluctant to use you, and done enough, potentially drop you.If you are a minor with parents, or parents seeking representation for a minor, this also includes the parents.
Do not brag too much or exaggerate your abilities: be honest about what you can and can't do.
Modeling is a career that is notorious for last-minute jobs. Be prepared that if you want to pursue this career, even if your eventual dream is to work with JCPenney, you will have to deal with this.
Because of last minute tendencies, agencies often prefer to work with talent that lives close so that if work comes up at the very last minute, their talent can still take the job. Being more than 45 minutes away from the town with most of the work could pose a problem.
Always bring a positive attitude to a set because you never know what connections the client you're working with might have within the industry., Either submit this to the appropriate email as provided on the agency's website online, or submit it to a physical address. Because of how busy agencies are, it's generally recommended that you wait patiently and do not contact them with phone calls or emails to ensure that they've received your submission. Instead, if you haven't heard from them within six months, try again.If you are submitting documents to a physical address, be sure to send copies of all of your documents to them and not the originals. This is in case you need to resubmit or decide to submit to another agency later on.
It can take a long time to hear back from an agency due to the volume of applications they receive. Be patient; if you don't hear anything back within 6 months, resubmit, but do not try to call or email the agency about the status of your application.

, Before you sign anything, make sure that you read the contract carefully. Do not read it alone, but with your parents or legal guardian, and maybe even a lawyer if you all are struggling to understand anything. Be sure to ask questions about anything you don't understand. Once you have signed with the paperwork, the agency will start signing you up for auditions and assignments.


You can ask for a copy of your contract for your own personal records.

Find a photographer.,
Get some pictures.,
Take your measurements.,
Make composition cards.",How to Become a JCPenney Model3," You're going to need someone to take pictures for you. Although many cameras these days are high quality, it's preferably to take DSLR grade photos over selfies with point-and-shoot or phone cameras. Photographers are trained to understand framing, lighting, and can help direct you in posing for optimal shots.Ask them if they'd be willing to do ""time for print,"" which means that you allow them to use any photos that they take of you for their professional portfolio as well. This can be a mutually beneficial arrangement for all parties involved as it spares you the cost of having to pay for professional shots.
Look in the phone book for small photography studios or go to a local college and ask around the art department for photography students. You can also try doing a search on the internet in a search engine like Google or Bing using keywords like ""photography near me.""
If you can't get a professional or even a student photographer to do your photos for you, you could ask a friend or a relative who is good with a camera to take shots of you.

, You will need both headshots and three-fourths shots (that is, photos from your thighs up) for this. For each shot, you should get pictures that feature two looks: minimal to no makeup on and a styled and made up look.Explain to your photographer exactly what you're looking for before you start shooting so that you don't waste their time.
Take your pictures up against a plain, white wall. Your skin color will look different depending on the surrounding colors, so it's best to make sure you have a neutral color framing you.

, You will need to take your measurements at your waist, bust, and hips. Although an agent may be able to make a general guess if you are within the size range that they are looking at for girth, they won't be able to tell precise measurements (which they'll need to refer you to clients) if you don't tell them. The same is true for your weight, height, dress size and shoe size, all of which they'll need.Wear your regular underwear or a bathing suit to get the most accurate measurements (since you will have to wear underwear underneath any clothes you're modeling).
To get your bust size, measure with your arms down across the fullest part of your bust. This should be located under your arms and go straight and even across your back and shoulder blades. Be sure not to pull the measuring tape tight.
To find and measure your natural waistline, bend slightly to the side and find the area that creases in your abdomen (it's usually somewhere around the belly button). Loosely measure the circumference here.
For your hip measurement, first stand with your feet together. Then wrap your measuring tape around the fullest part of your hips. Keep the tape straight and snug to avoid drooping, but not so tight that it will slip up or squeeze into your skin.
Ideal measurements for adult models are usually 34""-24""-34"", but depending on what kind of modeling you want to do there are a range of acceptable measurements you can fall into., Also known as ""comp cards"" and ""zed cards,"" these cards are basically a model's business card. It will include your stats that agencies might want to know, like your name, height, weight, age, and hair color, as well as your headshot on the front and smaller images on the back. They should be 8 ½ inches wide by 5 ½ inches tall and printed on quality cardstock.You can get these made at a printing company or stores like Staples or OfficeMax where there is a professional printing station inside the store.

Be persistent.",How to Become a Child Model," Being a model may seem like an exciting and glamorous job, but it actually requires a lot of hard work. It’s important to determine whether you will really enjoy the experience before you give up your free time that could be spent playing with friends to commit to modeling. Ask a friend or family to do a practice photo session with you to see if you have fun posing.Practice photo sessions won’t just help you decide if you’ll enjoy modeling; they can help you feel more comfortable in front of the camera too.
Make sure that your friend or family member gives you direction on how you should look in each photo because that’s what a professional photographer will do at a modeling photo shoot. For example, your friend might tell you to look calm and thoughtful in one shot and excited in another.;
, Even if you believe that you’ll enjoy modeling and posing for the camera, you should also figure out if you have the right temperament for the job. Many kids are shy around strangers when they’re young, but if you’re modeling, you must be confident and outgoing. You can’t be uncomfortable when you’re working with new agents, photographers, executives, and other crew at each photo shoot.If you’re not sure whether you have the personality for modeling, ask yourself if you really like being the center of attention and are able to be yourself even when you’re around people who you don’t know very well.
It’s almost important to be able to take direction from others and to have enough patience to remain still for as long as 15 minutes when you’re a model.

, Once you’re sure that you’ll enjoy modeling and have the personality for it, you should talk to your parents about it. Explain to them why you're interested in modeling. You might tell them that you believe it will allow you to express yourself or that you think it will help you feel more confident. You can even just tell them that you think it will be fun to pose for photos. Just be honest and enthusiastic.It’s important to understand that allowing you to model requires a big commitment on your parents’ part. They’ll have to take you to casting calls and shoots, and wait around with you while you’re working so they’ll be giving up their time too.
If your parents are actually the ones who bring up the idea of modeling, be sure that it’s something that you really want to do. Don’t let them push you into being model if you’re not genuinely interested in it.

, As a child, you’ll need your parents’ permission to become a model so you have to get them to agree. They may have concerns about how modeling will affect other parts of your life, so make sure to tell them that school will still be a priority and you’ll continue to get all of your chores done.Consider making a deal with your parents that you’re only allowed to model if you get certain grades in school and do your part to help around the house.
Many states require work permits for children under 18 who work as models or in other entertainment fields. When you meet with agencies, they can help you and your parents figure out what documentation you need to work., Modeling seems like an exciting job, but you should go into the process understanding that it’s not all fun and games. It may take hours to get just a handful of shots done, and you'll need to give maximum effort the entire time. Shoots often have a lot of downtime too, which means you will probably be sitting around a lot as you wait to pose.Some clients may try to have their photos shoots during the evenings and weekends, but many jobs will be during the weekday. That means you may have to miss school to model, so if you’re already behind in your classes, it may not be the best fit for you.
Other photo shoots may require getting up very early and working before school, so make sure you’re willing to change your schedule to model.
Because of all the waiting around on shoots, you should be sure to bring supplies to keep you busy. You might bring some schoolwork to do or books to read. It’s also a good idea to bring your favorite snacks and drinks.

, Modeling is very competitive, so you’re going to go up against many other kids who also want to models. As a result, finding an agency to work with you and jobs may not be that easy. You can't count on being an instant success or making big money, so you shouldn't go into modeling just for the fame and fortune.Talk to your parents about the expectations for your modeling career. It's important that everyone is on the same page.

, Unlike teen or adult models, it’s not necessary to have a professional portfolio when you’re trying to become a child model. That’s because kids grow and change so quickly that photographs become outdated in a hurry. Most modeling agencies require only a few photos for submissions. While it always helps to have photos taken by a professional photographer, it’s not necessary. You parents can take the photos of you -- just make sure the lighting is good and use the best camera available to you for clean, clear shots.Your photos should be in color, and a headshot, a full body shot, and a couple of candids.
Try to look natural in the photos. Don’t wear any silly costumes or hats.
Some agencies may ask for a composite card, which is a card that contains several small photos.
Make sure that your parents write your name and theirs, as well as your age, hair color, eye color, clothing size, and address, on the back of each photo.

, Because most clients who are looking for child models don’t do the casting themselves, you’ll need to sign with a modeling agency that can identify jobs you’re right for. It’s important to find agencies in your area, though, because you’ll be expected to travel where the shoot is. Ask your parents to help you do an online search for “modeling agencies” and the name of your town or the closest city. Make sure that the ones you find are registered with the Better Business Bureau (BBB), so you know they’re not a scam.While a modeling agency will take a certain percentage of the earnings that you make for a particular job as their fee, no reputable agency will ever ask for money upfront.
In addition to a BBB rating, check the agency’s website to see their portfolio. You want to know that they’ve worked with impressive clients, whether local or national.
If you don’t live in a major city, such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, chances are that you’ll be working with agency that books jobs with smaller, local businesses.

, Knowing that an agency is well rated with the BBB is important, but hearing about other models' experiences with the agency can be even more helpful. If you know other child models, ask them how they like working with their agency. Have your parents talk to their parents too, so they can have some of their questions answered.When you're talking to other child models about their agencies, ask how friendly the agents are and how comfortable they feel with the people from the agency. You should also ask how many jobs they've been able to get through the agency.

, Once you’ve found some reputable agencies in your area, it’s time to submit your photos. Visit the agencies’ websites to determine what their submission process is. Some agencies will allow you to submit your photos online, while others require you to mail hard copies of the photos. You will probably need to write a letter of interest to go with the photos, so ask your parents to help with that.If you’re mailing your photos to an agency, you may also need to include a self-addressed, stamped envelope for a reply.
In most cases, you can expect to hear a response from the agencies you’ve submitted to in a month or so. They’ll either send a polite rejection letter or email, or contact your parents to set up a meeting.

, If you’re lucky enough to get a meeting a modeling agency, it’s obviously important to make a good impression. The agents already like the way that you look based on your photos, but they want to make sure you have a fun, outgoing personality to match. That doesn’t mean you should fake it, though. You won’t be able to keep up an act on all of the castings and photo shoots that you go on, so be yourself and let the agent know who you really are.If you’re nervous at a meeting, try to pretend that you’re just talking to a friend and not an modeling or casting agent. That may help take some of the pressure off.
Your parents can sit with you for meetings, which may help you feel more comfortable.
It may help to do a practice meeting or interview with an adult other than a family member. Your parents might ask one of their friends to ask you some questions, so you’re more comfortable for your appointment.

, If you want agents and casting executives to believe in you, you have to let them know that you believe in yourself. At your meetings, try to use your body language to convey how confident you are. Maintain eye contact with the people that you're meeting with, and sit and stand up straight. Avoid fidgeting too.Another way to ensure that you give off a confident vibe is to go into meetings with a positive attitude. Assume that it's going to go well, and the people who you're meeting with will be able to feel that.

, If a modeling agency likes you, they will want you to sign a contract. The contract lays out the terms of your agreement, including what type of fee the agency will take for your assignments. Your parents will ultimately decide whether the contract is in your best interest and sign on your behalf. They may want a lawyer to read over it before they sign to ensure that it’s a good contract.Most agencies take approximately 20 percent of models’ earnings as their fee.
Unless an agency wants you to sign an exclusive contract, which means you work solely with them, you can sign with multiple agencies. That can increase your chance of getting work.

, When an agency finds modeling jobs that they believe you’re a good fit for, they’ll send you on go-sees, which are meetings with executives from firms that are looking for models. As with your meetings at modeling agencies, the casting agents want to make sure that you don’t just have the right look for the job, but the right personality too. Handle it just as you would a meeting with an agent -- be confident and friendly, but be yourself.You may have an appointment for a go-see, which means you can be in and out in as little as 15 minutes. However, if there’s a line, you may wind up waiting around for much longer.
Because go-sees are necessary to get jobs, you must attend all the ones that your agent sends you to. Some days, you may have two go-sees, and other times, you may go weeks between go-sees.
In some cases, you may receive a modeling job right after you attend a go-see. But it’s not uncommon to have to wait a couple of weeks to hear back.

, While modeling can be a lot of fun, there is a part of it that no one likes -- the rejection. Because the field is so competitive, you’re going to be going up against hundreds of other kids who are trying to land a modeling agent or a modeling job. In some cases, you aren’t going to be the best fit for what the agent or client wants. You shouldn’t feel bad about yourself if it takes a while to get a job or if you don’t get a job that you really want. It only means that you aren’t right for that particular job or agency.In many cases, advertising firms and other clients are looking for very specific types of children. For example, they may want a redhead with freckles. If you don’t have that look, it doesn’t matter how cute or bubbly you are -- you’re not going to get the job. It isn’t a reflection on you.

, If modeling is really something that you want to do, you will need to maintain your confidence even if you aren't getting as many jobs as you'd like. Having success as a model usually requires persistence, so don't give up even if things aren't working out as quickly as you'd hoped.You should only continue to pursue modeling if it makes you happy. If the process stops being fun at any point, talk to your parents.

Keep them simple.,
Use a lot of light.,
Position the camera for ideal shots.,
Take a variety of photos.,
Label your photographs.,
Include a cover letter.",How to Become a Playgirl Model2," Don’t worry about achieving professional-level glam shots for your audition photos. Expect editors and casting directors to value regular, unfiltered photos taken with an everyday camera over studio-produced portfolios. Use whatever camera you have handy. Assume natural poses, rather than mimic those seen in Playgirl spreads or other publications., For best results, take your audition shots outdoors if possible, during the day, with clear skies and the sun shining. If you take them indoors, use 100-watt bulbs in every available light fixture. Remove lampshades for extra brightness. Avoid posing in any shade or shadows.Again, don’t worry about creating professionally artful lighting rigs. Just make sure that your body is well lit so editors can see every detail.

, Maintain just enough distance between camera and subject so that the subject fills the frame. Keep the focus on you by remaining front and center in each shot. Hold the camera vertically so you can capture all of your body without disappearing into the background of a wider shot.Use a tripod if possible to ensure steady shots without blurring.
If you are taking these photos by yourself and don’t have a tripod, set your camera on a steady surface roughly four feet off the ground.

, Playgirl expects at least a dozen images of each subject.Show off your body at various angles. Take close-ups of particular areas. Focus on your best features, as well as any that are both distinctive and visually striking (like tattoos) to set you apart from other candidates. Also include the following:Headshots: one close-up of your face in profile; one close-up of your face while smiling, taken head-on; another one of your face brooding, also taken head-on.

Full body shots: one taken from the front; the other from the back.

Body close-ups: one of your upper body (face excluded); one shot of each leg in profile; another profile-shot of your buttocks.

Penis: two shots of your penis while fully or semi-erect; one in profile, the other head-on.

, If you are submitting your photos online, retitle each file with a combination of your own name, the date or month of submission, and the file's number in the series of photos. If you are submitting photos via mail or in person, label the back of each print with your name and contact info. Ensure that editors will be able to identify you even if your files or prints become separated from the original email or cover letter.An example of a way to title image-files is: “AlanSmitheeJuly2016-1,” “AlanSmitheeJuly2016-2,” “AlanSmitheeJuly2016-3,” etc.

, In addition to the photos, send a cover letter introducing yourself with your complete contact info. Provide the editors with your physical measurements and other information. Include the following:Personal info: age; ancestry; location

Physical info: height and weight; chest and waist size; inseam; penis length (both erect and flaccid); eye and hair color.

Prioritize compound exercises.,
Focus on weight training.,
Make the most out of cardio.,
Drink water.,
Maintain a proper diet.,
Sleep well.",How to Become a Playgirl Model3," Maximize your time and workout efficiency. Concentrate on exercises that target the most amount of muscles at once. Burn as much fat as possible in the shortest amount of time while sculpting multiple areas of your body simultaneously.Popular compound exercises include chin-ups, deadlifts, dips; pull-ups, and squats.

, Burn more calories and build more muscle by favoring weight-lifting over cardio exercises like jogging or bicycling. Opt for free weights instead of machines. Lift dumbbells and barbells to strengthen both the primary area (such as your biceps when doing curls) as well as stabilizing muscles located elsewhere in your body (like your core and legs).Start with a weight that you can actively control not only during the lift itself, but while lowering it as well. Work your muscles during both components to each lift, rather than allowing gravity to do half of the work for you.

, Continue to do cardio workouts for overall health if desired. However, to utilize it for the sake of sculpting your body, design shorter workouts. Exercise with maximum effort during these. Allow plenty of rest in between each rep so your body can recuperate fully, ensuring that you can tackle the next one with 100% effort. This way you will burn more fat than you normally would with slower, more sustained workouts.For example, instead of going on long, evenly-paced jogs each day, run sprint workouts at top speed on the track.

, Make H20 your beverage of choice. Avoid sugary drinks, including juices. Eliminate the spikes of energy and inevitable crashes that come from sugar highs. Stick to water to maintain more control over your energy output for more effective workouts.For more flavor, infuse water with berries or slices of lemon or lime.

, Forget whatever the latest craze in dieting is. Control your calorie intake by sticking to the proven components of a healthy diet: grains, vegetables, and lean meats (or other protein sources, like beans, if you don’t eat meat). Make regular routines of grocery shopping and cooking for the days ahead to preempt the risk of succumbing junk food when the fridge is empty.Allow three hours between your last meal and bedtime. Your metabolism will slow down with sleep. Give your body a chance to break that food down before you turn in.

, Make a nightly practice of allowing yourself eight to nine hours of sleep. Maintain healthy levels of testosterone and other hormones so your workouts don’t suffer. Ensure a stronger metabolism so your body continues to process sugar effectively. Allow your muscles, tendons, and joints time to recuperate to avoid injury during workouts."

Classes can also help boost confidence, so if you have extra time and money, consider joining a modeling class in your area. If anything, it will help provide insight into the industry.Modeling classes are not a prerequisite to becoming a model. Some models are discovered in public and asked to join agencies with little to no modeling experience. However, it never hurts to know more about a career before you pursue it.;
, While it may be tempting to get all dressed up for pictures to send to an agency, many agencies want to see what you look like as your raw, natural self. Have someone with a good quality camera, or even a professional photographer, take pictures of you that you can use in a portfolio. Try to take pictures in different outfits so that you have lots of variety, but keep the outfits simple -- bikinis, fitted t-shirts and jeans, etc.The industry will be able to envision what you look like with all of their styling options and don't need you to send them pictures with tons of makeup and styling done. They want to see you as you naturally are so they can really see your beauty.
Once you have a good amount of pictures, compile them into a clean, organized portfolio. Make sure your portfolio has enough variety that an agency or company can see your potential. Don't go into an interview without a portfolio -- companies want to see your work., Just like many companies, your success in modeling depends a lot on who you're connected to. Getting your foot in the door with agencies by meeting them, even if it doesn't go anywhere, is a great way for people to become familiar with your face. Even people who aren't directly in the agency, but are connected to it in some way like photographers, retail store owners, and those who work in fashion can be a great resource.Try to be outgoing in settings where you need to stand out. Network with the people around you until you get connected with someone who can give you a job. Be active on social media, as well, as this can help get your name out there.

, So many companies try to scam you by requiring you to pay fees to model for them. Other times, you may find an ad on Craigslist asking for models. Either way, be careful when you are looking for modeling jobs that you don't fall into traps or place yourself in dangerous situations. Some things to look for to know if an agency isn't legitimate are:You have to pay a fee to an agent before they do work. Legitimate agencies won't charge you a fee for you to work for them. They get paid when you get paid, meaning they take a certain percentage of your paycheck. If you encounter an agency that requires you to pay them, don't work there. Also, don't confuse agencies with modeling schools. Modeling schools may claim to provide instruction on how to model, but after you take their classes you are on your own.
You have to take the opportunity now or it's gone. Most agencies will give you time to explore their company and learn more about them. If they give you an offer today, it should still be good tomorrow.
Their website doesn't look legitimate. If you aren't sure if a company is trying to scam you, look them up online. You can type in the name of the agency with the words ""scam,"" ""rip-off"" or ""complaint"" to see if anything comes up.
They can't give you references. An agency with working models should have a list of people you could contact or look up to show that they aren't just scamming you. An agency may have pictures on the walls of models they didn't actually represent, so try to ask for phone numbers or emails if possible.


If someone says they are an agent or scout of a certain modeling agency, contact that agency. Some agencies will even have statements on their website saying that there are scouts claiming to work for them when they actually don't. These agencies may have specific numbers you can call to figure out if the person you talked to works for their agency.As tempting as it may be, never respond to a Craigslist ad looking for models unless there is a reputable source connected to that ad. If they don't list their company and it sounds ""too good to be true"" it's probably not a good source for a job., Applying to an agency won't do you much good if you're unheard of. Apply to a variety of shoots and jobs. If a job seems legitimate, take it even if it's small time. Anything you can add to a portfolio or resume can be impressive when seeking representation. Work on maintaining relations you have with co-workers and peers in the field. Any connection, even small, could get you in contact with a bigger agency or agent down the road.

, Different modeling agencies are looking for different people. Check out a variety of agencies to find one that works for your needs. Bigger, reliable agencies can be found on websites like models.com.Keep in mind that if you've never had any modeling experience you probably won't be called in to work for one of the top agencies. However, you can still explore their websites and contact them if you have any questions or need insight to enter the modeling business. Even if they aren't interested in hiring you now, talking with agencies will help them become familiar with you. After you've had experience they may consider hiring you on. Stay in contact with anyone who reaches out to you. Even if they're sending you a rejection, send a follow up e-mail or phone call thanking them for considering you. Mention if they have something that works in the future, you would still be interested.
If you google top modeling agencies you can often find a website with a list of all the agencies in the nation or world. Then, you can usually find an email for a specific agency or you can call them. There may also be a link to submit your portfolio, which is a great way to get your foot in the door.Also, it's not common to find a modeling agency solely for swimsuit models. Often times agencies use their models for multiple things, some of which may be modeling for the cover of Sports Illustrated. On a local level you may be able to find agencies solely for swimsuit models, but the major companies represent their swimsuit models in the same divisions as editorial and commercial models., The more agencies you apply to, the better chance you have of getting an agent interested. Make a list of agencies you think you may be interested in and start making time each day to work on your applications.


Some basic information should be included in your application. You'll need to list your hair color, eye color, dress and shoe size, as well as your age. Some models include information about their passion for modeling or how they always dreamed of being models. Do not include this information. The agency does not need to know this information and workers going through applications may toss out applications that include unnecessary information.In general, less is more in an application. If you have extensive experience, it is worth mentioning in a cover letter. However, do so as briefly as you can. If they're interested, they'll review your portfolio. Some agencies may ask for specific information, like your interests or passions, but only include this information if you're asked directly.Include contact information. You don't necessarily need to include your address, but a phone number is vital. An e-mail also might be helpful as a lot of modern communication is electronic.You should never request an agency contact someone else to get information about you. The agency will want to talk to you directly., You will probably be asked to include pictures when applying to a modeling agency. Know what kind of pictures to include if you want to get a call back.


Do not use casual pictures. Photos from vacation or from when you were hanging out with friends are not appropriate for a portfolio. Use pictures specifically taken to be used to apply to an agency.You don't need to spend a ton of money on expensive photo shoots. Ask a friend or family member to help you shoot some nice looking photos of yourself, using a nice camera. If the agency asks for a video, you can make a simple 60 second video on your own. Spending a lot of money on photos won't necessarily result in a call back. An agency is just trying to get a sense of how you look and whether your appearance works for their current needs.If you have any professional photos from modeling shoots, send them in unless the application explicitly forbids this. Professional photos from a bigger magazine or website will be very impressive to a modeling agency., Modeling is not all about your looks. People are more likely to hire those who connect with others. Develop a social media profile and share silly, personal, or inspirational posts alongside photos from modeling shoots. If you're called in for an interview with an agency, be polite to everyone there. You're more likely to get hired if you seem like someone who would be easy to work with., If you look at any bikini model you'll see that she usually has a flat tummy. Part of this is produced by eating the right kinds of food, but you can also exercise to create a flat stomach. Some exercises you can do to improve your core and abs are:Plank: Lie face down on the floor. Place your hands under your shoulders and your feet shoulder width apart. Then, lift up onto your hands and your toes, straightening your arms. Engage your ab muscles by keeping your back straight and your butt in line with your back. Hold for one to two minutes, or longer if you can. Repeat this twice.
Side plank: Get in the same position as plank and lift yourself up. Then, turn your body and lift one leg and one hand off the ground so that your weight is solely on one side of your body (your right or left). You can stabilize your lifted foot on top of the foot you have on the ground. Press your torso up so that your hips aren't dipping. Hold for 60 seconds and then return to regular plank. Repeat on the other side. Then, do two more reps on each side.
Boat pose: Sit on the ground with your knees bent. Lean your upper body back, keeping your back straight, and slowly lift your legs off the ground. Extend them straight out in front of you and then extend your arms straight in front of you. Hold this position for five slow, deep breaths, and then lower your legs. Repeat twice.
Swaying warrior: Stand with your legs spread out in a wide stance. Shift one foot so it is pointing forward. Then, bend your front knee so that it is over your ankle and hold your arms out to the side. Lift your back arm straight up over your head and place your front arm on your bended knee. You should feel a nice stretch. Come back to center and repeat on both sides three times, but on the last time hold the position for three to five breaths.
Scale pose: Sit in a cross legged position. Place your hands on the ground next to your hip bones. Tighten your pelvic floor and your core and then push into your hands to lift your body off of the ground. Hold this position for three breaths and repeat three times.

, To fit in those small bikini bottoms, you'll need a toned and lifted butt. There are a number of exercise you can do to tighten your butt:Heel sky raise: Start on your hands and knees and then move to your elbows so that they are underneath your shoulders. Put one leg straight out behind you and flex your foot. Lift your foot until it is in line with the rest of your body. Do this slowly, pausing at the top each time. Do three sets of 12 reps on each leg.
Single leg ballet kicks: Start by standing straight up and tucking in your belly button so you have engaged your core. Then, slowly lean over, keeping your chest up and your back straight. Try to lean all the way over into a table top position without arching or curving your back. Then, lift one leg up to be in line with the rest of your body and as you do that, reach the same arm down to touch the floor. Slowly move back to starting position, but try to keep your leg from touching the floor. Do three sets of 12 reps on each leg.
Lower half lunge: Start in a lunge position, with your left knee bent in front of you, and your left leg behind you, with your knee bent and touching the ground. Then, slowly lift up so your back knee comes off the ground. Try to lift only your knee and not the rest of your body. Lower back to the ground and do three sets of 12 reps on each leg.
Bridge: Lie on your back with your legs in front of you and your knees bent. Slowly lift your lower body up until your knees form a 90 degree angle and your thighs are in line with your upper body. Squeeze your butt at the top of this position and then lower back to the ground. Do 15 reps.

, Last but not least, bikini models always have slim thighs. Butt exercises will likely work your legs and your butt, but you can also add on some thigh exercises to really tone up your legs. Some exercises you can try are:Inner thigh lift. Lie down on your side. Then, lift yourself up onto your elbow, keeping the rest of your body on the floor. Cross your top leg over your bottom leg and bend your knee so that your foot is pointed away from your body and resting near your hips. Then, lift your bottom leg up, with your toes pointed down and then lower it back to the ground, but don't let your foot hit the floor. Do this move 40 times on each leg.
Inner thigh side raise. Get into the same position as the inner thigh lift, but instead of crossing your top leg over, leave it straight. Bend your bottom leg so your knee is bent somewhat. Then, lift your top leg as high as you can without turning your body. Lower it back down until it almost touches the ground. Do four lifts on each side.
Plie squat pulses: Stand in a wide stance with your toes pointing outwards. Hold your arms out straight and slowly lower into a squat. Stay in that squat and pulse up twenty times.
Scissors: Lie on your back with your legs out in front of you. Slowly lift your legs up, keeping them straight until your legs and body make a 90 degree angle. Then, allow your legs to drop to the sides opening up into a wide V, but keep them at the same angle to your body. Bring them back up to starting position, crossing one foot slightly over the other, and drop them back down again. Do 40 reps.

, Instead of just cutting out carbs, or cutting your calories in half, why not focus on eating calories that are good for you? Losing weight is really about burning more calories than you take in during the day, so it is important to watch how much you eat. However, you don't have to starve yourself to lose weight. Some foods that are healthy for weight loss are:Beans: Not only are they inexpensive, they are also filling and versatile. Beans are packed with protein and fiber, and because they take longer to digest, you may feel full longer.
Soup: Starting a meal with a cup of healthy soup may prevent you from eating more through the meal. Try to aim for a soup that is packed with vegetables and is broth based-- not a creamy, baked potato soup.
Dark chocolate: So you still have your sweet cravings, but you don't want to eat brownies or ice cream. Dark chocolate is a great alternative because it is relatively healthy for you and will satisfy your sweet cravings with just a small amount. Snack on a square or two of dark chocolate anytime you want to reach for the cookies.
Pureed vegetables: You can add these veggies to any meals that are more unhealthy, to help you cut back on your calories as well as get the proper nutrients you need from the vegetables. Add them to a meal that may not be super healthy, and you'll probably eat less, or add them to an already healthy meal for more nutrients.
Eggs and sausage: Eating this in the morning will keep you fuller throughout the day because it's packed with protein. If you are looking for a healthier alternative, eat turkey sausage.
Nuts: These are a classic healthy snack, because they are packed with protein and fiber and are good to munch on. Eat a handful of these when you want to reach for junk food.
Apples: Eating whole fruits instead of fruit juice or pureed fruits, like apple sauce, will help curb cravings better. Fresh fruit is packed with more fiber and it can help meet that sweet craving you may be feeling.
Yogurt: Greek yogurt is packed with protein and can help with digestive health. It is also good for bone health as it is packed with magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium., Many people will eat three medium to large sized meals a day, but this isn't always good for you. Eating smaller meals throughout the day can help boost your metabolism, which in turn will help you lose weight. Aim to eat five small meals a day. You can have three meals that are a bit heftier, like chicken and veggies for dinner, but then in between the heftier meals eat smaller snacks like nuts, yogurt, or fruit.You can also follow a bikini competitors diet plan for a diet that will help you lose a lot of weight. However, this diet really isn't sustainable for a long period of time. You might consider doing a week or two of this plan every now and then for a detox, though., If you are really trying to get bikini ready, keeping a log of the foods you have eaten will help you know if you need to continue cutting back. After each meal, log the type of food you ate, how much you ate, the nutritional information, and how you felt afterwards. Then, overtime log the weight or inches you have lost.If you find that you aren't losing much weight after a few weeks of eating healthy and exercising, you may need to change something up. Check your portion sizes for your food to see if they are accurate. Often times we give ourselves more food than what one portion actually is. You may need to sacrifice certain foods if they are unhealthy for you.

, Water is not only good to keep you hydrated throughout the day, it can also help you lose weight by keeping your fuller, and can be good for your complexion. Aim to drink six to eight ounces of water a day. Recent studies have shown that you should just let your body tell you when you are thirsty, so listen to your body to know how much water you need., Many models live unhealthy lives, trying to sustain a below average weight by not eating enough or the right foods. If an agency wants you to get to a certain size that you believe is unhealthy, don't do it. Working as a model isn't worth the health risks that might be associated with it. Stay fit by exercising and eating healthy, but if you are only allowed to eat 11 grapes a day to maintain the size your agency wants, get out.Don't be discouraged or let someone tell you you are ""too fat."" Modeling is a business full or criticism and nitpicking, so you have to grow thick skin when you work as a model. Also, remember that the images that you are promoting through your agency are those that young girls and women see constantly. If you're promoting the image that you have to be super skinny or look a certain way, it's going to cause girls and women to feel insecure about themselves. Always strive to promote positive body image.

Prepare for the big day.,
Pick out the perfect outfit.,
Get your beauty sleep the night before.,
Bring two forms of identification.,
Do your hair and makeup before you get to the casting call.,
Know what will happen at the interview and photoshoot.,
Be patient while waiting for a call.",How to Be a Playboy Bunny1," You can either run an internet search to find out when a casting call in your area might happen, or you can go on to the Playboy website--they have a map that shows where the ongoing casting calls are happening. If there are no scheduled casting calls in your area and you think you have what it takes to be a Playmate, you can travel to the areas that do have casting calls to audition.


Having modeling experience isn’t required--the photographer at the audition will guide you through the photo process.;
, In the weeks leading up to your audition make sure you maintain a healthy eating and exercise regime. Playboy is looking for the sexiest girls around. Get to a point where you feel confident and comfortable in your own body. After all, a big aspect of Playboy is feeling comfortable being nude.


You may want to practice some poses in a mirror to know what flatters your figure the most. Practice your best ‘smoldering temptress’ look. Learn how to flirt with your eyes. Get a friend to take pictures of you posing in different ways to see how each position looks.

, You are required to either wear lingerie, a bikini, or a swimsuit with heels. Go shopping before the casting call and find your perfect outfit. Look for a sexy, unique wardrobe that will show off your best assets. Pair your look with the perfect heels--these should match and make you look like you have legs that are a mile long.

, While you might be wide awake with nerves, excitement, or a combination of the two, you really should get some rest the night before. After all, you want to be on your A-game for the audition, bright-eyed and lively. However, don’t take anything to make you fall asleep--things like sleeping pills can make you groggy the next day.

, Playboy requires that you bring two forms of identification to the casting call proving that you are 18 or older. One of the IDs must be government issued and have a photo, your birth date, and an expiration date (like a driver’s license, passport, or state ID). The other does not need to be government issued but should have your name and birthday on it (this could be your birth certificate, social security card, voter registration card, etc.).


You don’t need to bring a portfolio with you. However, extra photos will be accepted and added to your bio form. Keep in mind that these photos won’t be returned to you.

, Playboy requires that you have your hair and makeup done already before your show up for your casting call. Remember, less is more! Aim to look your absolute best--if your hair looks best with a curl in it, curl it before you get there.

, When you get to the casting call, you will have to show both of your IDs and complete a bio form. You can also fill out a model release form, but this is optional. You will then change into your lingerie or bikini, put on a robe, and wait to be called. The interview will be casual, during which time you will have a professional photographer take photos and a video of you. This interview and photo shoot will last 15 to 20 minutes. Show ‘em what you got girl!Keep in mind that you are auditioning for Playboy and should be alright with nudity, even during the interview--a certain level of nudity is actually expected of you.

, Playboy may take four to six weeks to get back to you after your casting call. Playboy states on their website that they will not accept calls about your audition status. If you do get selected as a Playmate, Playboy will give you specific instructions to follow. You will sign a contract and have your own spread in their magazine. Plus, a playmate is a playmate for life! That means attending parties and entering into the running for Playmate of the Year.


If you haven’t gotten a call from a Playboy representative within six weeks, it means that there isn’t an open position for you in the magazine at this time. However, your casting call audition will be kept on file and considered in the future.

You also have the option to post links to any online presence you might have, including your website, Facebook page, or Twitter ID.

, When you apply for a model position as a Playmate at Playboy, your application automatically gets sent to other modeling sectors of Playboy.

Fitness is important. Consider working with a trainer who works specifically with models. Tell him about your modeling goals and how you want to look, and ask for a tailored exercise regimen that will support those goals.
Eat right. Contrary to what some people tell you, you should eat healthy foods, as well as healthy amounts of food. Veggies, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats, and proteins should make up the basics of your diet. Sugars, starches, empty carbohydrates, and unhealthy fats should be avoided as much as possible.
Be sure to drink a lot of water. Avoid sodas (even diet sodas) and minimize your alcohol intake.;
, Take care to make yourself look healthy and well-groomed. What you wear and how you carry yourself are important as well, but you should have a routine that supports the health of your skin and hair.Focus on keeping your skin clear and glowing. Wash your face in the morning and at night, exfoliate once a week, and remember to wash your makeup off before you go to sleep.
Keep your hair shiny and healthy. Some agencies and managers prefer the ""natural greasy look,"" so it may be okay if you prefer to minimally shower.

, Technically, anybody can be a model. However, if you don't meet certain requirements, the work available to you will be incredibly limited or you may have to compensate in other areas (reliability, technique, etc).A Plus-Sized Model: If your body is full and curvaceous, you may be able to be a plus size model.

A Runway Model: Most women on the catwalk are at least 5'8 and commonly small-breasted. Men are mostly between 5'11 and 6'2.

A Print Model: Most editorial female models are at least 5'7, but a beautiful face with great personality are the most important features for print models.

An Underwear Model: For women, this requires large breasts but small hips. For men, this requires broad shoulders but slim waists.

An Alternative Model: Some agencies hire alternative models: models who do not conform to the industry “standards” of beauty, height, and weight. Additionally, having a specific passion or cause that you’re working towards can help open doors that may be closed due based on a body feature that does not “fit industry standards”.Other Types of Modeling: If you don't fit any of the face or body descriptions, perhaps you can be a foot, hair, or hand model.

, If you do not think the runway or magazines are the place for you, look into other types of modeling. Companies use models for special events or to promote specific products. There are fewer restrictions on body type and more emphasis on personality for these modeling jobs.



A Promotional Model: Some companies want their customer base to interact directly with models who are generally attractive with likable personalities to promote their brand. You may see these models in grocery stores, events, or clubs promoting things like food, liquor, or new products.

A Spokesmodel: Spokesmodels are hired to be consistently associated with a specific brand. Contrary to popular thought, spokesmodels don't always have to verbally promote the brand.

A Trade Show Model: This type of model is hired by companies or brands to advertise to attendees at a trade show tent or booth. These models are typically not employed by the company but hired as ""freelance"" models for the event.

, The look that you communicate can be made up of both your body type and your style. There is more of a curvy California look, a svelte and sophisticated New York look, a waif-like European look, and a boy- or girl-next-door look. Know what you're equipped with, but also try to pull off other looks.

, Learn as much as you can from reading books, blogs, and articles about modeling.Reading quality guides, articles, and books will help you improve important skills (like posing and posture) and better understand how the industry works (such as how to find an agent).


Also research reputable agencies that place models in high-profile places, such as magazines and fashion shows., The modeling world is jam-packed with pretty faces. Being good looking does not equate to success as a model. The modeling business is not just about looking great; you have to fit the need of specific jobs just in order to get a chance. Modeling is only for serious people who carry unique looks and characteristics. Since there are so many people trying to become models in today's world, it's very challenging to get into the industry. Success will only come with patience and perseverance.

, You will have to promote yourself and look for opportunities to step up and prove your abilities. Standing back and being “polite” will not get you where you are going. Be yourself, let your personality shine, and have a confident attitude.If you don’t feel confident, fake it; modeling often requires acting skill as well!

, You should include professional-looking headshots: shots of you up close without a lot of makeup and on a plain background. You should shoot them in nice natural light (but not direct sunlight) without a lot of distraction in the photos. These are meant for agencies to get a look at you in a raw state. Consider a head shot, a body shot, and profile shots.


The most important thing to communicate in a portfolio is that you are able to present a range of “characters” and looks.

, Though professional photography can be expensive, it can make the difference between being passed over and getting an interview. Think of professional photography as a worthwhile investment in your career!Get your favorite professional shots printed into 8x10s. Save these in case you are asked to leave a photograph before or after an interview.
If you've got enough good professional photos, consider compiling them into a portfolio. Bring this portfolio with you to castings or agencies.

, This information can help modeling agencies place you.Knowing the information off the top of your head will help you seem professional when you are speaking with an agency or potential client.


The most basic measurements to know are your height, weight, and shoe size.
You should also know your clothing measurements such as dress size, hip, waist, chest/bust, etc.
Your personal stats include information such as hair color, eye color, and skin tone.

, Almost every major city has multiple modeling agencies, and almost every agency has ""open-calls"" where they look for new talent.Bring your photographs and/or portfolio. Be sure to have your (accurate) measurements as well.
You may be asked to walk or pose for a headshot or other photos during an open call interview.
If an agency rejects you, don't get disheartened; often an agency is looking for a diverse set of models, so you may just not fit their model lineup right now.

, Try to research the reputation of a modeling agency prior to an open call or interview. Too many people don't know about the business and end up getting conned. No agency should be asking you for more than $20 when meeting you. The agency will charge you a commission when you model, but shouldn't get much up front. If they ask for hundreds of dollars from you before you do any work, walk away.

, A client may ask you to sign paperwork or consent forms. Before you sign, be sure to ask for a copy to share with your agent. You do not want to sign a form that gives a photographer or client more power over your actions or images than they should have.


Similarly, do not sign a contract with an agency unless the agency and the contract both seem legitimate. If you are not sure whether the contract is good, have an attorney or an experienced model read over it for you.A good agent should have your best interests in mind. She should help you navigate the legal issues in any given contract. , Don't say you're skinnier than you are just to get a shoot. Once there, the stylist will have problems fitting you and the truth will come out. You could potentially lose future jobs due to word of mouth, and you could find yourself without a career!

, Remember that, even though you're not working in an office, you need to be professional.Treat the people you work with respectfully. You never know who they know or what sort of a recommendation they might give of you. Never look down on anyone. You may be a model, but that doesn't give you the right to be snooty, affected, or pompous.


Always show up on time to any appointment or shoot. If you're late or rude, your reputation may precede you and nobody will want to work with you.
Be organized. Models often get called to places at the last minute and have very busy days. You need to be on top of things if you want to succeed. Buying a day-to-day planner can really help.
Develop professional relationships with photographers. You help the photographer look great, and they will help you look great. It's a win-win situation, so be sure to treat photographers with respect.

, Individuals who don't take it seriously have small chances of succeeding in their modeling career. Realize that it is harder than it appears and there's a lot of work behind all the glitz and glamour you see at fashion shows. Modeling is a full time occupation that requires constant attention. One week away from it and your career can be over.


Understand that modeling has only a small window of opportunity, and even if you take a short break, you may never be able to return. Models usually only work in the business for a limited amount of time. If you become famous inside of the business, you may be able to extend your career.

, Sometimes you are expected to bring certain things with you (such as base foundation) and if they don't have a makeup artist booked, you need to prepare accordingly. You may want to keep an emergency makeup kit with you so that you can do your own makeup if necessary, even if a MUA is supposed to be present., Photographers want to see you pose in various poses with different props and backdrop. Changeability is key, so work for the camera and interact with the world around yourselfListen to the photographer’s recommendations, but don’t be afraid to try your own poses or attitude as well. Similarly, runway coordinators want you to put attitude in your walk or to project a very specific emotion.

Meet the requirements for being a nude model.,
Prepare a resume.,
Find work as a nude art model.,
Discuss the details in advance.",How to Be a Nude Art Model1," Being a nude model doesn't require you to look like you're ready for the runway or to meet some unrealistic standard of beauty.Nude models help artists learn to draw the human body and understand its nuances and structure.
Artists don't necessarily look for models who fit a stereotype and are open to models of all sizes, shapes, and ethnicities. People with unique body types and asymmetrical bodies are actually sought after. An important requirement for being a nude model is being comfortable with your body.Before you model nude, you should be comfortable enough to pose nude without blushing, covering yourself up, or trying to only show off the most flattering parts of your body.;
, Not every artist or art teacher will ask for a resume, but you should be prepared with one anyway.


You can still fill your resume even if you haven't been a nude model before.
Providing a resume will give the artist or art teacher an idea of who you are. This is important for getting to know you as modeling for an art class is an intimate setting for both the artist and model that requires trust. Include any previous modeling experience, performances, art schooling, acting, dance, yoga, or other activity you have done which would benefit an artist model.

, If you're committed to being a nude art model, then you need to start looking for work.


Contact your local art school or college to see if they are hiring art models. You can start with the art department, but ask if there is someone in particular assigned to hire models for all classes. Sometimes each instructor hires his or her own models.
If you want to pose for a photographer, also look on any one of a number of websites that link models to photographers.
Free online classified advertising websites also often post ads for nude models.
You should first find work modeling for a class and only consider doing some private modeling once you have a better understanding of the nude art modeling world and know that you're working with a legitimate artist.

, When you are hired, it is best to iron out payment, time commitment, and schedule.


Typical nude art modeling sessions run about three hours, including a number of breaks and a variety of poses held for 5, 10, or 20 minutes.
Discuss average length and number of poses, the types of poses, and the amount of breaks you'll be given.
Discuss payment or hourly sitting rates, which can vary greatly but generally are between $15 and $25 for drawing -- though fees for a photographer will generally be higher.

Prepare your poses.,
Be expressive.,
Be prepared to hold each pose for a specified amount of time.,
Put together a ""modeling bag."",
Prepare your body.",How to Be a Nude Art Model2," Nude art models are typically expected to strike four basic poses during their sessions. These are standing, seated, reclining, and semi-reclining or prone.
The standing pose requires you to stand in a variety of ways with your arms, legs, hands, and feet engaged in various ways. You might have props to hold or have to hold a particular facial expression.
The reclining pose will typically require you to lie down on your back on a sofa or couch in a comfortable position.
The semi-reclining pose will require you to lie down on your stomach while lifting your chest, as you would do to read a magazine at the beach.
These are the four basic poses, but there is a variety of movements and gestures that you can make when you hold them.
It is important to note that when in a standing pose, not to let your knees lockout (doing so may cause you to pass out).

, Draw on any personal experience to think of poses that are interesting or inspiring. Any physical activity may be a source of good poses.


A good model must be able to be expressive from the bottoms of their feet to the tips of their fingers. Art is dynamic and your poses should be as well! Many models are inspired by the poses depicted in classical works of art.
Yoga poses are often used because they engage the muscles in interesting and dynamic ways.

, Different kinds of poses can be held for short or long periods. It is best to be prepared to hold still for a long time. The time required for a pose can be described by any of the following three terms: gestures, short poses, and long poses.
Gestures are poses lasting less than three minutes.
Short poses last three to twenty minutes, and long poses which are held in multiple 20 minute intervals with a short break in between.
The latter is generally the norm for painting and sculpture; drawing classes will require a number of shorter poses.
Any class may begin with a few gestures as a ""warm-up"".
If you're in the middle of a long pose and need to move, someone will use tape to mark the position of your body. Just ask, ""Can someone please tape me?""

, You should come prepared to your modeling session so you don't need to trouble the artist by asking for anything and maintain your professionalism.The most important thing you need to bring is a robe so you can wear it between poses or to use the bathroom.
You should also bring a towel or blanket to sit on for hygienic reasons.
Bring slippers or sandals to slip in and out of quickly on breaks.
You might also want to have water or snacks with you.
Always bring a date book and pen (or your phone) for booking future sessions.

, You will want to be clean and look natural. Before you leave for your session, shower and apply lotion to soothe dry skin, which could cause you discomfort while posing.
Wear minimal jewelry unless otherwise requested.
You shouldn't put in a ton of hairspray or wear make up unless requested. You should look as natural as possible.

"
"
Remove your clothing.,
Remove your robe and slippers.,
Follow the artist's directions.",How to Be a Nude Art Model3," Once you meet the artist and get comfortable, it'll be time to remove your clothes. A private changing room will likely be provided or there may be a folding screen that you can change behind.
Use the privacy to get centered and ready for a nude art modeling session. Remove your clothes and put on your robe and slippers.
Step up to the modeling area. Step up onto the model's area holding only your timer to mark the time passed in each of the posing sessions.

, Your artist will designate an area for you to place these items during your session. If sitting or lying down, it is best to do so on a towel or sheet. The artist may provide one for you, or you can bring one of your own.
If you do not have a towel, it is hygienic and highly recommended that you place your robe beneath your bottom for sitting poses.
Some artists even enjoy drawing the additional ""drapery.""

, Keep your body and eyes very still. Listening to your artist is key for a successful session.It is useful to fix your gaze on one spot; do not make eye contact with any artist unless specifically directed.
Relax into the pose, but not so much that you move from your original position.
You may be asked to time your own poses or the artist may tell you when you're finished.
If you're not sure about what the artist means, don't be afraid to ask for clarification. This is far better than striking the wrong pose.
If you're told to hold a pose that is too challenging, it's better to speak up than to try to hold it.
The artist would rather have you hold a pose that you can maintain for the duration instead of having to start over.

"
"
Get dressed.,
Be prepared when you say goodbye to the artist.,
Follow up with your artist.",How to Be a Nude Art Model4," When you are finished with your session, put on your robe and return to your private changing area and put on your clothes.


Make sure you don't leave anything in the studio.
You should wear comfortable clothes.
It is a good idea to have a bag for your dirty robe or towel so you can wash these after your session.

, You will want to discuss any further sessions at this time. Have your date book and pen handy when you come out of the change room in case the artist would like to work with you again.
It's also a good idea to prepare a business card to hand to the artist.
Ask for feedback from the artist.
Once you've worked with the artist a few times, you can even ask for a letter of recommendation that you can use to help you find future work.

, You want to show initiative and enthusiasm if you want to be hired again. Call or email to confirm a time and date for your next session.
If you don't book another session right away, contact the artist in a few weeks after your session to see if they need any more models.
Ask your artist for other contacts if you have developed a good working relationship.

Those are wonderful signs that you have good looking hands. Make sure you have a smooth, even complexion. Don't assume makeup will, well, make up for your imperfections. Birthmarks, freckles, moles, scars, crooked fingers, and irregularly shaped nails will severely limit your progress as a hand model. Pay special attention to your thumb; it'll play a huge role in many hand shots, so it needs to be good-looking.Here are some other things to consider:Inspect the back of your hand. If you're a woman, it needs to be narrow.Though women are more often hand models than men, men can be hand models too. Just make sure you don't have hairy knuckles.
Don't get discouraged, though. There are a number of different types of hand modeling looks such as beauty, mommy, product, and older hands.;
, This is just as important as having nice-looking hands. Can you hold an object for an extended period of time without leaning on anything and without shaking? Any movement will translate into blurry pictures, so if you find that you can't keep your hands steady, modeling might not be the best use for them.


Shooting TV commercials or ads for your hands can take several hours. A 30 second spot can take upwards of 12 hours to shoot and you have to be ready at all times and prepared to do take after take of small actions.

, If you want to be a hand model, then you have to prepare to hold your hands in the exact same position for hours on end. This means that you have to deal well with boredom and have really, really steady hands. If you're addicted to caffeine or chocolate, you may have to curb your addiction, because these things will only make your hands shake more. You can even practice holding your hands steady for long periods of time so you'll be more comfortable when the time comes.Patience and the ability to always hit your mark can be the most important thing. Once the camera and lights are set, you have to be able to set the product down in the exact same place over and over.

, If you have the money to spare for a portfolio for your hands, then find a photographer you trust to get you started. If you find a photographer who is just starting out too, then they may work with you for a small price, or no price at all, since you'll be helping them build their portfolio too. Make sure you get a professional manicure before you take those photos. Here are some other things to consider as you put your portfolio together:Learn common hand poses. Study magazine ads and commercials to see how hands pose and move. Mimic those poses and movements for your portfolio.
Include at least one photo showing your face so that if they need a shot that includes someone's face, they'll consider you (and also so they can recognize you when they meet you).Include a straight on shot of the back of your hands and the palms of your hands.

, Tell them that your are specifically interested in hand modeling and request an interview. Some agencies may have a separate department for hand modeling, or some agencies will be parts agencies specifically. Tell them that you have a portfolio and if they ask whether it's professional, be honest but specify that they simulate professional ads.Be politely persistent until you get an interview.

, If an agent thinks your hands have the look they want, then congratulations! You have made it through a tough hurdle on the hand modeling trajectory. Once you've got the offer from the agent, however, you have to make sure that it's the right for you. First of all, the agent has to be legitimate. A legitimate agent won't charge for money up front and will only get paid if you get paid. Agents typically receive a percentage of your pay, so they are motivated to find you work. Make sure to meet the agent or speak to them at length before you make a decision.



Look good for the meeting with the agent. Even though you're modeling your hands, you still want to give off a professional impression, and that means looking neat and nice. They might send you out on calls (more interviews) eventually, and they'll want you to represent them well.If all goes well, they'll send you to do test shots with a local photographer to see if you've got what it takes.
Once you've met with the agent and have gotten a positive vibe from them, as well as proof of the agent's legitimacy (names and samples of the work of other clients, for example), then carefully study the contract you are given and sign it when you're ready.

, Once you've signed with the agent, they will provide you with some places to go to look for work. These are called go-sees, just like in the world of traditional modeling. You will have to go from place to place, show off your hands, and see if you've got what they're looking for. Your agent won't be able to say, ""Hey, I found you a great gig"" -- they can get you to the gig, but you'll still have to work for it.


Once you've found some work, you'll be able to add it to your resume. And the more experience you have, the more luck you'll have in future go-sees.
Be persistent. You may have to go to a number of go-sees before you find work. But if your agent thinks you've got the look, then you should be able to find work eventually.

, If you think your hands have got what it takes, treat them like assets. You should be careful not to do anything that could damage your hands, from cutting vegetables to handling a bouquet of thorny roses. Here are some things you may have to do on a regular basis:


Visit a manicurist to make your hands look their best. If you become really prominent in your field, you'll be getting regular manicures for free before your shoots. And you'll be able to expense any manicures you get on your own. Sound good?
Have a proper diet and drink enough water so your skin is healthy. Also, some vitamin imbalances can show up as undesirable white spots on your nails.

Moisturize your hands on a regular basis. Some hand models even sleep with gloves on at night.You can apply lotion and then wear latex gloves to make your hands extra soft.
Keep your nails trimmed and clean. Ideally, you should always file them and never clip them.Avoid scratching, burning, or creating any marks on your hands.

, Sure, if you're a top hand model, you'll be making enough to live on, but most hand models do the work to supplement their income, or even for the fun experience. Be prepared to have an additional income as you grow more prominent in your hand-modeling career. Don't be discouraged by this; it's simply a reality of this job and all other modeling jobs.

, You don't have to move to New York to be a hand model. But if you're really serious about the work you do, then you should move to a big media city to have an edge. You shouldn't drop everything and move hundreds of miles away to a big city before you even take your portfolio shots, but if you've already gotten some gigs and want more opportunities to grow in your career, then consider moving to one of the following cities: New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Atlanta, San Francisco, or Chicago., Even if you're holding a book or a cutting board, you should treat it like it's the most delicate object in the world if you want to succeed. You should treat every item gingerly and with the utmost caution. This will make the object look even more desirable and special in the photographs or advertisements. If you grip anything too hard, then your hands won't look as delicate, either., Don't think that all of hand modeling requires you to just hold a purse or another simple object. You may have to hold a book open for hours, or even lie on your back holding a camera for a long stretch of time. You should be flexible and be prepared to hold your hands in unusual positions for a number of hours. This may get exhausting and will require you to have both mental and physical strength, but it will lead to some unbelievable photos., If you've really made it as a hand model, then the perks of the job are endless. You may end up being a hand double for a celebrity, for example; Julia Roberts used a hand double during The Pelican Brief because she simply didn't have time to shoot a scene with just her hands. This will lead you to meet celebrities, directors, and other interesting people.Kimbra Hickey, the hand model for the world-famous Twilight cover, has become famous in her own right. She tours with Twilight conventions, re-creates her cover pose for fans, and signs thousands of autographs. Though this type of fame is hard to come by, if you're lucky enough to find yourself in this position, live it up!

Meet the people. Generally, if you love the people, you love the scene.

, Having the necessary gear to present the community with quality music is very important.


Think about the bare minimum of equipment that you need to present yourself in a professional way. That way, people's ears won't be bleeding. Think about overall sound quality, ease of access, safety and setup. These things are crucial to good a production, whether live, online, or through a club's speakers.

Another option is to make a stack of business cards and start handing them out! Your DJing options include high school dances, college parties, wedding receptions.

, The local music scene is all about music and people, too. Hang out with the musicians and get involved. The more connections you have, the more opportunities you will receive.

For young musicians, this seemed like a dream come true. The music business was indeed a mighty empire, a slick machine that was oiled by profits and balance sheets...not the love of music itself. Musicians were merely 'assets' owned by 'suits'....lawyers, accountants, publishers, managers, etc. Now, thanks to the internet and digital downloading, you can make your dream come true yourself by cutting out the middlemen and being in total control of your product. Here's how.;
, There are lots of them, and making your own songs and making covers helps it to have a great music career.

, When you do this, you can link in to your other sites and vice versa, so you can gain maximum exposure and increase your web traffic.

, There are lots of free information sites with loads of tips.

, The books aren't cheap, but they are a worthwhile investment. Also, try to find tips or obtain books that contain information about royalty payments and general copyright laws.

, You can send your songs to yourself by special delivery, you sign it when it returns but you don't open it. It's just a guarantee that you copyrighted the songs on a particular date...actually, a song is copyright after its committed to paper and signed and dated.

, Age? Preference? No use playing heavy metal to a crowd of emo lovers or pop fans! Social network sites are great finding them because people who stop by will usually click on your tracks and if they like what they hear, they will email you to say, so...eh voila....you have found a fan!

, Now that you've found your fans through your social network sites and through playing live...how do you keep them interested. The secret is to give them a stake in the business...make them feel a part of the band! Enlist their help for tours, gigs, merchandising, get ideas from them, ask them what they'd like you to do next...involve them and you have them for life. Offer free tickets and discounts in return for their help in promoting you...there's nothing more effective than the 'carrot' at the end of the stick! Got some gorgeous girl fans...get 'em modelling your merchandise, take some photos and stick 'em on your sites.

, As stated previously, merchandising goes a long way towards your band promotion, badges, hats, t-shirts, stickers, freebie cds, these are all worth it and you can also sell your stuff at gigs...just remember to give some of your profit to the dreaded tax man!

, As well as doing live gigs, having various networked sites, what else can you do to raise your profile...well, you can include blogs, video blogs, podcasts and videocasts. If your band writes about social injustice, then find related sites and blog on them, leaving your website address clearly visible, do charity gigs for good causes, remember live aid, comic relief, look for local festivals and get on stage and strut your stuff. Put free ads on the net offering freebies or contact your local newspaper with articles about the band, but put a new slant on it....something unusual (within the law of course) will get you into print...human interest stories go down a treat...""local band adopts badly injured dog as their mascot"" or ""Local band visit hospital radio and speak to fans""....get the picture?


So, now you have all or most of the information that can help you organize your own music career and be your own agent, manager, publicist, etc. Nobody said it was easy, but at least you can decide the level of fame you want, where, when and what you'll play and manage your career in stages and at a pace that suits you. All that's left to say is good luck!

You should understand music composition and theory. Comprehending sheet music would be very beneficial. Aim for one of the following four common band instruments:


Pianos are perfect for any genre and any song. With newer pianos and synthesizers, any number of sounds can be made to reproduce the desired sounds. But in terms of just melody, a piano is perfect to work on a song, accompany a voice, or find pitch.
The drums are key to timing of music. The drummer should be the band’s metronome, and all others should follow that lead. With a bad drummer, the performance is sure to suffer.Guitars are in pretty much every band. Find out which chords are most popular/common, and learn to play them. Being able to pick guitar chords out of a song shows a good musical ear.
Playing the bass is a classically overlooked skill. The bass is often the tempo for the rhythm section, and is a great foundation for any song you may produce.;
, Part of being a good producer is knowing and understanding why a song needs to be changed. Finding the subtle nuance that makes a song memorable or exciting is a talent that must be fine-tuned. Your skill must be such that you can propose a change to an artist’s song and make it better. Here are a few possible ways to change up your arrangement:


Try changing up the choruses from time to time.
Experiment with unorthodox instruments for a unique sound.
Drop the music and let there be a vocal focal point for a moment., Knowing about music is one thing, but having an ear for hits is another. Gathering ideas for song selection, as well as session musicians, is critical when finding the next big thing. Analyze trends in music, top hits, and songs getting lots of airplay.


Study the top ten religiously. Look at the types of songs that are hits.
Research which song-writers have the ear of the public at the moment.

, Being immersed in music production means you are up to date on all facts about the industry. You’ll learn the best ways to record, the best songwriting techniques, and you’ll be better prepared to identify talent if you are more educated in the field.,



Future Music and Sound on Sound"" are magazines specifically targeting music production.


, Most of the digital software is very advanced, and tracks a variety of items like volume and range. Knowing how to read and exploit the meters – for instance, K-Meters identify greater range use, and VU meters display average volume – helps use dynamic range better, calibrating music to sound better and be heard more easily.One popular recording software is Pro Tools, which controls just about anything necessary in music production., You could take a class or clinic to learn all the ins and outs.You must understand how to use microphones, speakers, amps, mixing boards, and a variety of other supplementary items. A few other typical items to consider:


Compressors are used to make recordings sound better. They keep the levels between soft and loud sounds better tuned for the human ears.Preamps take a signal coming from a microphone and prepares it by boosting, cleaning, or adjusting the signal before it gets to the actual amplifier.Using an equalizer works to clean up the signal. It handles some bass/treble functions, and reduces feedback., At times a producer must inspire and provoke an artist towards greatness. It’s not always about mixing music and the technical aspects. Some producer skills could be based purely on motivation and drawing out the best in each performer.Spark their intrinsic motivation desires by providing songs they like or are good at.
Motivate extrinsically by promising more studio time or pay bonuses for completing songs on time or for practicing consistently., You’ll have to find the right studio, book it, pay for it, schedule the timeline for usage, and work out all the additional details. You’ll need to pay the studio’s sound engineer, and work out financing for any additional equipment that needs to be brought into the facility.There are a few details that are crucial before getting into the studio.


Determine the focus of the recording session. Is the purpose to record a hit single or an entire album?Ensure all the writing is done before getting into the studio. You don’t want to waste everyone’s time, and a lot of money, waiting on specific lyrics to be worked out. Make sure all your equipment is functional. Waiting on an equipment malfunction to be fixed is not ideal, and finding a replacement in time could be very expensive. Plan for any sort of compatibility issues. Bring all plug-ins, conversion tools, and whatever else you need to simulate your home studio. , Whether it’s an old-school record scratch or the blending of a midi sample, digital producers often have to remix sound. Balancing levels and sending sound between speakers (i.e. spanning) can make or break a song. Make the instrument and sound balance perfect for each song through expert mixing.Select excellent gear (e.g. microphones, studio monitors) that make the music sound as clear as possible.
Choose a location that is acoustically brilliant. Tailor the room to amplify the sound ability.
Work through the songs to weed out the bad takes and highlight the good takes. Finding the best performance is critical.

, There are a ton of details to the mastering process, such as equalizing volume between tracks and keeping a consistent volume. It’s not all about simply putting the tracks in the right order. Use the following list to start your mastering process:


Shave off the unnecessary headers and footers to the songs. Just like a good DJ, finding the right groove between tracks is difficult and can be thrown off by too much empty space.
Clean up any other oddities or deficiencies, like feedback or clicks. , Successful producers are not only makers of entertainment, they are consumers. Attending lots of performances will help you separate the real talent from the weekend warriors, and will show you which bands and performers consistently attract large local crowds. Your constant presence will also show you’re a fan of the musician(s) you wish to sign.

, Musicians typically have a favorite location to hang out. Find the locations they like to wind down at and gain their trust. Once you learn their tendencies, likes, and dislikes, it’s more likely they’ll have a positive image of you.

, Just because you can remake songs doesn't mean you are cut out for the industry. As in any service industry, particularly a highly competitive one such as this, you must offer a reason--and an easily discernible one--why a client should hire you rather than someone else.


Leverage a connection to a famous musician. It may be enticing to a new artist to potentially rub elbows with someone who has already climbed to the top.
Display your superior knowledge of a specific music genre. If you know everything about the industry, a new client may be prone to pick you. Try to memorize everything there is about the industry, including top hits, singers, timeframes, collaborations, and anything else that will sell your knowledge.
Outwork the competition. Show your dedication by always being available and answering all your client’s needs.

, Build a focused client base by narrowing down the clients you’d like to sign. For instance, if you’re in Nashville, you’ll have a much wider talent-base to choose from if you steer towards country music.

, Working with talented performers requires knowing those performers. The best way to gain this information is to reach out to friends, family, and acquaintances to see if they know anyone in music. Introduce yourself to people in the industry. Talk to as many people as possible, finding extroverted people along the way who have already made the connections.

, Knowing your market well is paramount to success. Knowing your market means knowing its venues and its local talent. Immerse yourself in the ""scene.""

, A simple call to a studio can often get you a chance to attend a recording session. This will help you learn the recording process and the differences between different recording studios. Find out their prices, their specific equipment, and which performers record there. After visiting a few locations, you’ll know which is the preferred recording studio in the area with the most up-to-date technology.


If a professional producer is at the session, watch how they interact with the talent and the engineer. Being a producer usually involves mediating between the talent and the technicians. Good producers get results by making everyone comfortable so that they can do their best.

, Be sure to sell your ability to bring in quality talent that makes the venue profitable. Let the venue manager know why you’d like to book their location. There is a great variety of information you can glean from a venue manager.


Determine the cost to book. You won't negotiate prices for your talent, but gathering information here is important. Not only can you get the range of cost from the single location, but once you’ve been to a few venues, you’ll have a better understanding of which are overpriced and which are values.
Ask about their saturation. Find out whether or not they are consistently booked and you can not only find out whether you’re able to fit in, but also if they are a popular location.
See what nights are their busiest nights. Figuring when they are the busiest will give you a good idea of when you’d like to book your performer(s).
Query if there are any showcase events coming up. Maybe a festival or something similar? See if you can get into an event like this and put your act as an opener for a big name.
Ask about any specific policies for booking agents. If they have any minute detail that needs to be followed, forms to be filled out, days to meet with ownership or management, you’ll need to know all the details.

, This may seem like an obvious step, but you can gain very helpful information by talking to multiple performers at multiple gigs. Hand out business cards and ask a variety of questions.


Ask them about their pay for a gig. After a few answers, you should have a decent gauge on the going rates in the area.
Ask where they refuse to work. Learn which venues are considered too dirty or unprofessional to work in.
Find out which places have the best acoustics. Ask the musicians which locations they like the best. Ask which place really belts out the sound. This will help you steer towards the right venues and venue managers.

Polish your music.",How to Contact Record Labels," You need to know a lot about the industry before you start submitting music to record labels. It is intensely competitive, and record labels are interested only in new artists who have the potential to generate revenue.


The vast majority of musicians never land a record deal. Since most people think of the life of a celebrity musician as glamorous and rewarding, you face many of obstacles and a lot of competition. This doesn't mean you should give up, but having a practical understanding of the industry is vital. You should be able to accept a series of rejections without letting it break your spirit in order to be a success in the music industry.
As an artist, your only hope of being signed is if you have the potential to make money for the label. There is no other way to get a contract. Being a great artist is not enough. You need a new sound, an attractive style, a fan base and a celebrity persona. Combine these with some professional awareness, and you'll demonstrate the potential to make someone some money. ;
, Getting a label to sign you to a contract is every musician's dream, but it's actually a rare event, and you have to do everything you can to increase your chances. That means you want to find a label that matches your style.


There are comprehensive record-label lists online. Search for the ""record label directory"" for your country. This should help you narrow the search.
Look for labels that have signed artists similar to you. A record company won't want to sign anyone who's exactly like someone else they've signed, but you want to work with a company you know is receptive to your sound.

, You may not be able simply to send a demo and expect it to be heard.


In most cases in order to be signed to a big label, you have to have a manager, lawyer, or agent who will contact the company on your behalf. If you cannot afford a manager, agent, or attorney, hope isn't lost! Contact the smaller labels while you continue to hone your skills as a musician.

, This will include a demo of your best music. A press kit typically contains a demo song on CD, one or more headshots or group shots of your band, a description of your band and influences, a biography that explains how your band came together or how you came to make the kind of music that you do, and contact information for your agent and band members. You can also include a list of big gigs you've played, awards you've won, or other recognition you've received as an artist. Every document in the press kit should incorporate a band or artist logo to create a sense of unity among the various documents (and to prevent their getting lost).
Your press kit should create a good first impression. It should be eye-catching and professionally designed and edited. This is not the time to type up documents on your computer and print them at home. If you don't have professional-level Photoshop skills, pay someone to create a kit for you.
Check out this helpful wikiHow article for more tips on putting together a press kit.

, Most labels have a website where you can find contact information. This will probably be at the top or bottom of the home page and may be accessible by clicking ""Contact Us"" or ""Frequently Asked Questions.""


Locate information on where to send your demo. Package your entire press kit (including photos, bio, and any other important information about your band) in a padded envelope and clearly label it. Make your package eye-catching but not juvenile. Include a personalized letter that indicates who you are, why you're sending the package, and exactly what you're hoping for in return. Send the package by priority mail. , A&R representatives may get thousands of demos every week. It may be a while before someone is able to listen to yours. In some cases you may never hear back. It's acceptable to contact the representative by email or telephone if you want to follow up on a demo you've submitted, but even this may not receive a reply.

, Sometimes it's better to go with an independent company. Often they're supported by a major label.


Send your music only to labels that work with artists in your genre. Don't earn a bad reputation in the industry by wasting the time of representatives in genres that have nothing to do with your musical niche. , When a record label considers an aspiring artist or band, they consider what kind of potential they have for selling out stadiums in live shows and making a profit in the long term, rather than just what they'll sound like on an album. In the beginning you may have to play free shows just to get publicity for your band. It may help to have a ""day job"" to support yourself financially during this time.
Live shows help you to build your fan base even without records to sell. Connect with your fans. Make them feel valued and special, and they'll be loyal to you and more likely to spread the word about your music.

, Justin Bieber was discovered because of his YouTube videos. While it’s a long shot, it's completely possible to build a fan base online, which can show a record label that you're an emerging, relevant artist with the fans to support a career.


Establish a YouTube page, Soundcloud profile, and Facebook and Twitter presence in your name or the name of your band. Be sure that each profile page links back to your other pages. Invest in some professional photos of you and/or your band, or ask a photo-savvy friend to take some good ones for you. Keep your look consistent across your online profiles and pages. Your pages should contain a digital version of your press kit, including photos, a bio, a description of your music, and some available tracks to listen to. Include up-to-date contact information. Add new recordings (including original songs and covers with a unique spin) as often as you can, and ask your friends and family to share them far and wide. Be sure to create a likeable persona. People are more likely to help you publicize your work if they like you as a person.

, Many great singers and talented musicians get overlooked because their music is not original or their lyrics are clichéd and stale. Focus on differentiating your sound from the rest of popular music in your genre. Get feedback from people who have a good sense of current music and are willing to offer constructive criticism. This should be an ongoing process as you hone your skills as a musician. Learn to take criticism and adjust your work accordingly. Sometimes you will find that criticism is not helpful, and you may choose to ignore it. If you find, however, that lots of people offer similar advice, it might be time to consider changing your approach. For instance, if you keep hearing from your critics that you have a great sound but your lyrics aren't catchy, it's time to put more effort into the writing., You need to invest in your track to make sure it sounds professional and polished before you send it off to record labels in a demo.


That means you'll have to pay to record it in a real studio, and then either mix and master it yourself or pay an audio engineer to do it for you. The importance of sound quality cannot be overstated when it comes to getting the attention of a label.
The first ten to thirty seconds of your demo track are vital to your success in securing a record label. Most record-label representatives have so many demos to hear, they won't listen to a mediocre one past the first half-minute. Yours needs to showcase your skill immediately. "

Using an instrument of your choice, play around with a few different chords and see how they match up together.


Chord progressions are often predictable and simple in the context of pop music. Especially if you are starting out as a songwriter, it's a good idea to start small at first and work from there.;
, It may be helpful to write out the parts of your song down, and attach musical ideas to them as they come. Here is a list of some common parts in songs:


The intro: An instrumental opening for the song that introduces the tone and rhythm of the song. Certain songs, like the Beatles' ""She Loves You"" break typical form and open up the song with the melodic chorus.
The verse: The most common part of a song, where the main body of the lyrics and music tends to go. In Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"" and others, this is where the story is told. The ""summary"" of the song is reserved for the chorus.
The chorus: A repeated section, often the most memorable melody in the song. Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"" uses two verses before its chorus. The chorus uses repetitive lyrics stating the speaker's summary of the action.
The bridge: A change of pace featured later on in the song, often following a chorus. If a fresh idea happens right before a chorus, it may be called a pre-chorus. ""Billie Jean"" uses a pre-chorus after the verse and before the chorus. This is used to build up the tension before letting loose in the song's melodic hook.

, If you play an instrument, noodling around on it every day may lead to surprising new insights and ideas. Give yourself some time to play in a freeform mode on your instrument. Let all pretenses drop, play around and see what happens. If you end up hearing an idea you like, write it down or record it for use on a song.


Practicing and rehearsing songs written by other people can be the springboard for your own creative ideas., This will shed a fresh insight on the music and what it may need. Improve upon the demo version as you see fit. Because songwriting is a constantly evolving process, you may record several demos of the same song before you're done.

, Knowing which notes tend to agree with each other the most may give you a valuable insight if you're stuck on a certain part of a song and aren't sure how to proceed.


Theory books are widely available.
Community colleges also often host classes in music theory.

, The best lyric writers take a notebook around with them wherever they go. That way, when a clever line strikes them, they can record it down before it's lost forever. Make a habit of writing down the random thoughts that come into your head on a day-to-day basis.


Keeping a thesaurus around with you will help as well.

, It is easy to burn out in any creative process. When you come back, you'll hopefully have a refreshing perspective on your art.


Most often, sleeping things over will give your brain time to consolidate your thoughts. When you make up the net morning, you'll have a fresh insight on what you worked on the day before.
If you're getting stressed out over the creative process, go for a walk and take half an hour to relax.

, Although this can be different if you're attempting to ""make it big"", do the best you can to be emotionally invested in whatever music you're making. Even if you're not the one who will ultimately perform the music, you should be communicating an inner part of yourself to your prospective audience.


Taking a page from your own life will make it easier to evoke a real emotional response. Take a life experience that moves you and write about it.

, If there's something noteworthy that happened to your recently, consider writing a track about it. Base your verses around telling the story, while the chorus can reiterate the general theme of what you're attempting to convey.


Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"" tells the story of a man who is accused by a one night stand of being a woman's father. The story incorporates romance and a dimension of tension.

, Rhymes can be very effective when used cleverly, but they can just as easily make lyrics feel amateurish if you're building a song specifically around them. The same idea applies to overused cliches and cheesy sentimentality as well. Although you may feel you need to rely on bombastic emotional insights to get your feeling across, you'll get better mileage by toning it down for something more intimate.


Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"" sneaks in rhyming within the same lines, but the rhymes are only used because they advance the story.

, This is an important psychological aspect of music appreciation. Take the most pithy line in your lyrics and repeat it. A small verse section can be re-imagined as a chorus.


The most repeated lyrics in a song often ends up as the song's chorus.

, Finally, integrate your lyrics with the melody in your song. This may involve tweaking your melody and rhythm to accommodate the lyrics. You should keep in mind however that the music should almost always come first, as it's the thing people will be focusing on the first time they hear the song.


You can stretch vowels and vocal sounds to match the music.If you're writing a hip-hop track, a skilled rapper will usually be able to fit irregular verses into any steady rhythm.

, A song title should catch the audience's eye immediately. Some great titles may be plucked from the lyrical ideas you've already written. While there is no single step-by-step process on how to get the perfect song title, play around with a few words or phrases and decide for yourself which one matches the message your song is getting across.


You might pick a title that captures the essence of your song. If your song is story-based, pick a word or theme that describes what it's about. If your song is about someone, name the song after them. Michael Jackson's song ""Billie Jean"", for example, is named after the primary character.

, Due to the fact that this is what people will initially judge you by, it's important to consider what people will actually be looking out for that kind of music.

, Although people may only skim the first 30 seconds of one of your songs before moving onwards, if someone hears a song and likes it, he'll want to know that it's not just a fluke. Compile a demo collection of a few of your best songs. If you're wanting to make an impression as a versatile songwriter, you might try writing tunes in different sounds.


You can hire musicians or enlist friends to play your songs for you. The performance on a demo can make a major difference.

, Friends are a great place to start with if you have songs to show. Because friends will usually have a genuine interest in seeing you succeed, they'll be able to give you tight constructive criticism about your work. When your work is sharpened up, they can help you spread the word of your music to other people they may know.


If you have a friend who is already associated with professionals in the music industry, you should make an extra effort to show that person your music. Even if he's not directly associated with a label or publishing house, he may know people that could be interested in the music you're producing.

, In an age of social media and easy networking, you can make a big name for yourself simply through word of mouth and link sharing. Provided your material is strong enough, you can post your demos on websites like Soundcloud, Bandcamp and Youtube. From there, people who come across it may be inclined to share it if they enjoy it enough.

, Although these days you can actually make a start in music without ever dealing with the ""industry"", it's nonetheless a vital place to look to if you want to write songs professionally. Mail off your demos and cover letter to a variety of musical publishing houses and record labels. Try to get in contact with people who are already in the industry and tell them what you want to do.


The people in the music industry are quickly desensitized to the number of people who are pursuing their dreams. Don't take it personally if you get the cold shoulder treatment from these people. It's all part of the process.
There are agencies that base their business around helping prospective writers find work Outlets such as Taxi may be of use to you if you're having difficult linking up with the right publishers.Certain genres favour certain regions. Nashville, for example, is largely enough for its bustling country music scene.

, This is especially true once your music is done and it's time to show it to other people. Because there is so much music coming out these days, it may take years to properly get your foot in the door. The only thing that can defeat you is if you give up entirely. Develop a thick skin for criticism, and don't lose a passion for the songs you produce, even if you can't find a market for it yet.

, If you're wanting to get serious as a songwriter, you should get an idea of the direction you would like to take. Some songwriters write music to play themselves, while others work for publishing agencies and have their material used by famous artists. The vast majority of songwriters also have particular genres they're most inclined to write in. Take a moment to imagine the sort of songwriter you would like to be.

, This is because work isn't always available in one style. If you're aiming to make a living from your songs, you'll need to cover the range of popular musical styles. What's more, being versed in a variety of genres will open new doors to be inspired by.


Don't be afraid to listen to types of music you don't normally listen to.

, This will offer you the most dynamic insight into what a ""hit"" is, and how you can replicate that success. Here are a few hit songs you might look at for the sake of a good example:


""Roundabout"" by Yes.
""Yesterday"" by the Beatles.
""Trains"" by Porcupine Tree.
""Billie Jean"" by Michael Jackson.

, Not only will you get to watch an artist passionate interpret a collection of songs, you'll also be able to see the life-affirming effect music has on the listeners. By the time you get back home, you should have a refreshed perspective on the reasons why you want to write songs.

, Even if you're fixated on writing music, the only way you'll be properly inspired is if you are getting out and doing things. Spend time with friends, or go out to see new film. The more fresh stimulation your mind has, the more potential you'll have to be inspired about something.

Most schools contain a wide variety of musical courses you can take including classes such as choir and band. If you are interested in a career as a vocalist (singer) then a choir would likely be a class you would choose. If you want to be in a marching band or orchestra, then band would likely be the place for you. Whatever your interest, there's almost always a class for it.;
, Whether you are in a rock and roll band, or you want to be a music teacher, college is the way to go. Along with providing you with a college degree, it provides you with classes in music that you can specialize in. Often times, colleges contain a wide variety more classes in the musical art than high school. And that isn't just for big colleges. Community colleges offer very similar courses. Do your homework and research what music career path you should go to college for.

, It doesn't matter how good of a musician you are, no one will hire you as a musician (from small bar gigs to major record labels) if you didn't show consistent interest throughout schooling. Your application will get tossed out before you can even play them a G note.

, Practicing is a vital key to becoming a musician. About 99.5% of all musicians play instruments, so you probably do too. Whether you play a 7-string guitar heavy metal, or classical harp you must always practice so you achieve maximum skill levels. The better you play, the easier it will be to get hired.

, Once you land your dream music job, stay passionate about it. Maybe you've had a music teacher who's always a grouch. It's because they lost the passion for they job, and for them it's only about the paycheck now.

Make sure you have something to manage.,
Have something to submit to potential managers.,
Look for trustworthy people with the right skills in your circle.,
Find someone with the right skills to represent you.,
Cold call managers and agencies.",How to Get a Music Manager1," Before you start looking for a manager, you have to make sure your career is worth managing. Take an honest look at what you’ve accomplished so far and what you’re looking to accomplish. If your music career brings in $1000 or less monthly, it might not be the right time to look for a manager.If your career isn’t needing a manager yet, start by managing your own career. Managers typically network for you, negotiate deals and help you hire the right partners.Try your hand at these different tasks, and you’ll known which you really need a manager for.
Managers aren’t the only ones who can help you expand your career. You can look into partnering up with publicists, writers and designers.;
, If you’re going to try contacting a manager, you need to be able to show them your musical ability. Ideally, you need quality recordings of your music, especially your best songs. While recording studio sessions can be expensive, the resulting recordings are crucial for your career’s future.


In addition to studio recordings, you should have footage of any live gigs you’ve performed. This will give a potential manager a better idea of your presence on stage, as well as showing them what type of performer you are.
If you currently have a record deal, working on your record will give you what you need to show a manager.

, Before you start looking for managers and agencies, start by reaching out to friends and family. You might be lucky and know someone who has the right skills and believes in you enough to work for free (at least for a while). Make sure this person can be straight with you; if they can’t be completely honest with you, they won’t be able to manage you properly. When you think “right skills”, think of the following:


They must be trustworthy. You need to make sure you choose someone who isn’t just going to use you as a ticket to fame and fortune. Before you decide to hire them, have interactions with them to determine if they’re trustworthy.
Choose someone personable. This is especially important if you lack skill in this area. Your chosen manager must have the people skills necessary to talk you up and get you the right gigs.
They have to be responsible. Avoid people who tend to deflect blame. If there are any hiccups in your career, you need someone who’s willing to take responsibility and do their best to help you past them.
Choose a business-minded person. Your musical career needs to be run like a business. The manager you choose needs business skills to help you navigate this side of the industry.Depending on the person you choose, and how your career develops, this may be a temporary setup. If you consider this partnership temporary, make sure the person you choose understands this.

, If you don’t have someone in your social circle who can manage your career, expand your search. One of the best ways to do this is to be constantly networking. When you play a gig, build relationships with other musicians and venue owners. If they know you’re looking for a manager, they might point you to someone they trust.

, If you don’t yet have the right connections, the best thing to do is to contact as many managers as you can. Do your research beforehand, making sure you only contact managers that are qualified and have a good reputation. Send emails, make phone calls and reach out over social media. Don’t be desperate to get representation; get the right representation.


The internet is the best place to find people to call. Using Google will help you find agencies and managers in your area, as well as their contact information.
The best way to cold call is to be honest about why you’re calling. Say that you’re a musician who’s looking representation. Be honest about what your career is like at the moment, don’t try to make your career sound bigger than it is or brag.</ref>https://www.engageselling.com/articles/060120article_coldcalling</ref>
Your cold calling strategy could take a few different forms. You can use the phone to gauge interest, speaking to managers before sending your music. Otherwise, you can use email and social media to send samples of your music, so managers can see what you’re about.

Focus on honing your craft.,
Develop your image.,
Maintain a strong social media presence.,
Upload music to online streaming services.,
Keep playing gigs.",How to Get a Music Manager2," If you choose to not chase a potential manager, focus that energy on your music. The mindset with this method is to work on your career until the right person notices. Make sure you have quality music and great performances under your belt when they do. Write songs, find gigs and record your music.


Realize who you are as a band/solo artist. A manager does not have the time to try to figure out who you are as a musician. The less work they have to do, the better. Figure out what music you like to play and what music suits you the best. Figure out what makes you different from all the other artists in the world who play the same music as you.
Create a set list of around 7-14 good songs. You want to have at least 1 hour of material just incase a gig comes up that requires you to play for an hour. Make sure you throw in some of your original songs. Decide what songs go where in order to enhance the viewers experience.
Play at least 7-9 gigs at places with big audiences. Busking on the street doesn't count. You can play at local bars if you are of age or try to play at places where your genre of music is respected. Playing 7-9 shows will look good for your resume and will gain you exposure.

, If you want to be noticed by a manager, you need to stand out. Don’t go out of your way to develop a gimmick or a wacky personality. Find something in your music or your personality that’s unique to you and develop this quality. Some musicians have strong vocals, others are multi-talented and some rely on good looks., Social media plays a crucial role in the business world today. A variety of platforms allow for tailored messages that can reach wider audiences than simple word of mouth. Learn the difference between each platform and use them to their fullest. Don’t forget to engage with the fans you already have and let them know you care about their support.


Instagram is primarily visual. You have both pictures and video at your disposal. The main strength of Instagram is hashtags, which allow your posts to reach people who might be interested in your band even if they don’t follow you. For instance, using the hashtag “#metal” for a metal band can capture the attention of metal fans.
Snapchat is the place to deliver quick, personal content. Content on Snapchat is less polished, so feel free to capture behind the scenes moments, whether you’re recording or just hanging out with your band.
Facebook and Twitter are incredibly versatile platforms, and should be the base of your social media presence. You can create event pages to publicize your gigs, use live video to reach more fans and create photo albums detailing your day to day.Engaging with fans is essentially about caring. Reply to comments they post on your social media platforms and show your appreciation for them through your posts.

, While not all streaming services are equally advantageous in terms of revenue, they can give your music the necessary exposure to advance your career. These services usually take a cut on an income you receive to account for the costs of distribution.Most importantly, these services give your music a place to live if your fans want to hear you outside a gig.

, The gig is a musician’s lifeblood. It provides income, exposure and networking opportunities. You have to carefully choose your gigs; some provide less revenue but important exposure. You also don’t want to always work for exposure, especially if you spend the majority of your time on your music career. The more gigs you play, the more experience you get and the more visible you are.


Prioritize gigs that foster networking. That might mean other bands or members of the media are present. The focus of the event should be the music; for example, if you play at a fundraiser, everyone’s attention is on the cause rather than your music.If you already have a record deal, focus on fulfilling the obligations that go along with this. This will be your best bet to getting enough exposure to bring a manager to you.

String instruments like the guitar will require you to build finger strength before you can play them comfortably.
Learn to play a variety of styles of music. Students may want to play country, jazz, rock or any other type of music.;
, To become a music therapist, you’ll need a degree in music therapy from a university that is accredited by the AMTA (American Music Therapy Association). You'll need to take classes in subjects like music theory, behavioral sciences, disabling conditions and general studies. There's a few different degree plans available depending on what you need.A bachelor's degree program is open to high school graduates and takes at least four years to complete. You'll take classes in music foundation, therapy, human development and general education topics like math and English. You'll have to do field work with three different populations and complete an internship. After you earn your degree, you'll be eligible to take the national certification exam to become a music therapist and you'll be able to work in a treatment team but not independently.
An equivalency program usually takes about two years and is open to people with bachelor's degrees in related subjects. You’ll skip the general studies that you learned while earning your first degree and focus only on subjects involved in music therapy. You'll need to do field work with three populations and complete an internship. Upon graduation, you'll be able to take the certification exam and work in a treatment team but not independently.
Master's degree programs are open to anyone with a bachelor's degree in music therapy. You'll expand your knowledge of music therapy and specialize your skills. You might get a master's in a certain area of music therapy like administration. With your master's degree you'll be able to work independently with clients. You may also be able to teach your specialty in an academic setting or rise to a supervisory position in a music therapy practice.
Doctoral degree programs are open to anyone with a master's degree in music therapy. At the end of your doctoral degree, you'll have to write a dissertation relating to your specific area of study. You might want a doctoral degree in music therapy if you'd like to be a professor of the subject or if you want to do clinical research about it. A doctoral degree can also make it easier to rise to a supervisory position in a music therapy practice.

, To be eligible to be a licensed music therapist, you’ll have to complete a six to nine month internship. During your internship, you must complete twelve hundred hours of supervised fieldwork in a health or education related setting. You should complete your internship over the last two years of your degree.Some places you can look for musical therapy internships are hospitals, schools and rehab facilities.
Make sure your internship is approved by the AMTA.

, The CBMT (Certification Board for Music Therapists) doesn't offer any specific study guides for the certification exam, but it does offer a self assessment practice examination. Take the practice test to get an idea of how well you know the material. You should also read journal articles, any materials you have from your degree and any publications you can find reflecting current music therapy practices. There's a reading list on the website for the CBMT with a helpful list of some reading material to get you started. Some other things you might want to know for your exam are:

the music therapy code of ethics
music therapy methods and scope of practice
music therapy terminology
music theory
types of music
guitar chords and structures

, It might be beneficial to take the exam right after finishing your internship so most of the material is still fresh in your mind. The National Council For Therapeutic Recreation Certification will administer the test. When you pass, you will be considered a licensed MT-BC (Music Therapist-Board Certified).


You can find information about taking the exam on the board’s website, nctrc.org.
You must renew your certification every five years., You’ve spent the last six to nine months building a relationship with them and you should be fairly familiar with the way they do business. By hiring you, they’ll likely be able to save money on training someone else from scratch. They’ll also be able to minimize their risk of hiring an inadequate employee as they’ve already seen you do work in the field.


If you decide that you want to work where you complete your internship, you should let your supervisor know as soon as possible. You may even be able to secure a position before you graduate.

, The demand for music therapy is increasing as people begin to recognize its benefits. You’ll likely be able to find a job very soon after earning your certification. There are a variety of places you can search. Each opportunity has its own advantages and disadvantages.For example: Schools have a lot of funding, so they can usually pay well, but hospitals always need music therapists so they offer reliable job security. Some places that hire music therapists include:


medical hospitals
psychiatric hospitals
schools
rehab facilities
mental health facilities
senior centers

, Music therapy falls under the broader category of recreational therapy. While the governments of the most populated areas in the United States recognize the benefits of recreational therapy, there a few state governments that do not. If your state doesn’t offer funding to support music therapy, you may need to move to a larger market like New York or California to find employment.

, If you want to be your own boss, you can create an independent music therapy practice. You may even earn more money than most music therapists because you’ll be able to set your own rates. When deciding on a fair price, take into account all the expenses involved in running your business.Factor in costs for things like:


room rental
heating and lighting
indemnity insurance
instrument maintenance
travel

, A career in music therapy can be very fulfilling if you have a genuine desire to improve people’s lives. Most everyone has a certain type of music they like and you can learn a lot about a person from their musical tastes. You’ll be working with people that have a variety of psychological and physical ailments. Get to know your patients so you’ll be driven to find the right type of music that will help them with their problems.Music has been shown to lower blood pressure.
Music causes the brain to release less cortisol (the stress hormone).
Music causes the brain to release endorphins which give you a feeling of contentment and happiness.
Fast music has been shown to stimulate quicker brainwaves while slow music has been shown to relax brain waves.

, Learning to play music requires a great deal of concentration. Children in particular can have trouble focusing. You may have to wait for them to calm their minds before you can teach them. Learning to concentrate is like learning any other skill. The more your students practice focusing, the better they’ll be able to do it.


Having a guided meditation before starting lessons is a good way to help your patients concentrate.
Having students do a few stretches before a session can help them get out some of their extra energy.

, Don’t give up on your patients. You may have to try several different types of teaching methods before you find one that works for a particular person. You may have to go over music theory many times before a patient finally understands it. Continuously strive to find new ways to help people learn music.Instruments like the guitar and ukulele can take longer to learn because they require finger strength and dexterity. You may have to find ways to keep students motivated when they start learning them.
Some people learn music better by actually seeing it while some people prefer to hear it played. Adjust your lessons based on whether your student is a visual or auditory learner.

, Many of the people that you work with may not be able to control themselves and may have severe behavioral issues. The goal of their therapy sessions will often be to help them manage those issues. Be ready to deal with a few outbursts. If one of your patients loses control of their emotions, you may have to wait until they regain their composure before continuing the session.


Some patients may be returning from service and have post-traumatic stress disorder.
You may be working with inmates in a correctional facility.
Your patients may occasionally curse or yell or even break your instruments if they lose control of themselves.

Find out what you're into.,
Listen to the music!,
Pop: Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Lana Del Ray, Carly Rae Jepsen, Katy Perry, One Republic, Justin Timberlake are all very common pop artists.,
Punk: Sex Pistols, Dropkick Murphys, The Ramones, Cherri Bomb, Rise Against, Crass, Bad Brains.,
Indie: Animal Collective, Arcade Fire, Death Cab For Cutie, The Kooks, The Shins, The Strokes, The Killers, Two Door Cinema Club, The Wanted.,
Metal: Metallica, Slayer, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Deafheaven

,
Emo: There are actually many misconceptions about the emo genre of music.,
Study up!,
Go To Concerts!,
Have Fun!",How to Be Obsessed With Music," Listen to all types of music, and see what you like best. Try to fit the stereotype for that music. This isn't essential, because you should be your own person, but people will easier know what you're into if you look like the people who are into it. If you like indie, be unique and fresh! If you like Metal, dress hardcore, and wear band tees. If you like country, wear country-ish shoes and accessories. If you like emo or punk, than wear band tees, skinnies, and converse! If you like pop, dress cute and colorful!;
, You can't even like music if you don't listen to it! So study up on one or two artists to find other bands or artists like them. Getting a Pandora account and starting a station for your favorite artists. But a better method would be to use a Last Fm account and find more in depth artists there. Here's a list of artists and genres.

, More in depth and complex pop artists might be Kate Bush, Prince, Kishi Bashi, Joanna Newsom, or Michael Jackson. There are many sub genres of pop music like experimental pop music, chamber pop music, and art pop music.

, Punk as a genre was the beginning and creation of many other different genres of music, some of which you may hear on the radio- such as pop punk (Blink 182, Sum 41, Fall Out Boy, Panic at the Disco). Punk also created the Riot Grrrl genre- which is a 90s scene of feminist based punk rock. Bikini Kill is a good example of this scene.

, The term ""indie"" is actually a huge umbrella term for a very large genre. There are also subgenres like experimental indie (xiu xiu, man man), indie rock (St. Vincent, Wolf Parade, Minus the Bear), or indie folk (Sufjan Stephens, Fleet Foxes, or Andrew Bird)

,, The origin of emo music was in the 1990s with bands such as Jawbreaker, Rites of Spring, American Football, and Cap'n Jazz. Later on in the 2000s there were bands such as Mineral, Brave Little Abacus, Snowing, and You Blew It! Emo is a diverse and misunderstood genre, just like the music itself.

, People who are obsessed with music know everything about every artist, band, and song. So crack those books! Read Wikis about your favorite artists, songs, and albums!

, Going to concerts will give you the right to say you've seen an artist in person, which makes it harder for people to call you a poser. And you can connect with the music and maybe even the band members! You can buy merchandise at concerts too!

, Don't do this if you don't like the music. Do it because you want to express who you are!

That will allow you to understand the pitch, speed, and rhythm of a song, so you can see how other songwriters have put their songs together and eventually craft songs of your own.If you’re already a student, see if your school offers a music theory class that can help you pick up all of the basics, including how to read specific notes and decipher the beat.
If you’re not in school, your local community college or continuing education program may offer an introductory music course.
There are a variety of online programs that can help you learn to read music. Many are free, but you can also pay for courses that provide more personal instruction.
Some singer songwriters receive a more formal education by attending an arts college or performing arts conservatory with dedicated music programs, such as The Juilliard School or the Berklee College of Music. It isn’t necessary, but a formal degree may open other career paths to you if songwriting doesn’t work out, such as teaching music.;
, Most songwriters play an instrument, which they use to help them develop melodies and chords when they’re writing songs. In most cases, they use either an acoustic guitar or a piano, but you can technically use any instrument to help you write a song. Choose an instrument that you have an interest in, so you’ll be motivated to put the work in to master it.If you have the opportunity to learn an instrument as part of your school’s band or orchestra program, go for it. It’s a chance to get hands on instruction without having to pay for it.
You can take private lessons to learn how to play the guitar, piano, or another instrument. Visit your local music store to ask about learning -- the store may offer classes or have a bulletin board where teachers can provide their contact details.
It’s possible to learn an instrument without a teacher. There are online programs and videos that can provide effective instruction if you’re willing to make an effort.

, If you plan to sing your own songs, you want to ensure that your voice is as strong as possible. While practice can help you get better, working with a vocal teacher or coach can provide valuable feedback that improves your singing. A teacher can help correct pitch problems, vocal fatigue issues during performances or rehearsals, poor breath control, and even a lack of confidence.Private vocal lessons can be fairly expensive, so it’s important to set a budget and shop around until you find a teacher who you can afford.
If you want to be sure to find a qualified vocal teacher, visit the National Association of Teachers of Singing website. They provide a search engine that allows you to find vocal teachers in your area who meet the association’s standards.
If you’re on a budget, your local music store is an ideal place to look for a vocal teacher. You may find graduate students and instructors who only teach part-time, so they don’t charge as much as full-time teachers.

, When you’re trying to become a singer songwriter, your goal is eventually performing in front of large audiences. Before you start pursuing the career, it’s important to know that you’re comfortable singing and performing in front of a crowd. If you're a student, you might join your school chorus or glee club. You can also participate in your church’s choir or find another singing group in your area that you can join. Look for any opportunity to gain experience singing in front of others.If you don’t have any opportunities to join a singing group, find ways to perform on your own. Sign up for a local talent show or gather some friends and family that you can perform for. Even participating in karaoke night at your favorite restaurant or bar can help you become more comfortable in front of a crowd.

, Before you start to write your songs, it helps to listen other songwriters’ work so you can get a feel for what makes a successful song. Don’t just listen to songs in the genre that you enjoy, though. You can learn something from every type of song, so analyze pop, rock, country, rap, folk, dance, and other types of music and see what you like about each song.Pay close attention to the lyrics of the songs that you listen to. See which ones move you emotionally, so you can try to figure out how to create a similar effect with your own music.

, When you listen to music, pay attention to the composition of the songs. Composition refers to how the songs are put together. Most songs typically feature two to three verses and two to three choruses. The verses tell the story or set the scene for your song, while the chorus is a simple, repetitive section that usually draws the listener in. As you listen to a song, try to break it down into these components.Some songs contain a bridge in addition to the verses and chorus. A bridge is usually a section that helps take the song in a new direction. In many cases, it’s instrumental and may feature changes in key, tempo, chords, or instrumentation. The common layout for a song with a bridge is: verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus.In some cases, a song may contain a pre-chorus, which serves a transition between the verses and the chorus.
Some songs features intros and outros, which help establish and expand the song’s main theme. It can be comprised solely of instrumentals or feature a combination of vocals and instruments.
It may help to print out the lyrics or purchase the sheet music for some songs. That way, you can diagram the songs and label each section as what it is.

, The best songs are ones that are rooted in personal observations and emotions. You’ll find inspiration for your songs in the things that you see around you and the experiences in your life, so it helps to write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal. Your entries don’t have to be fully formed lyrics -- just get your feelings down and you can develop them into catchy lyrics later.Carry your journal with you all the time. You never know when an idea for a song or specific lyric will hit you.
Sometimes, it’s easier to sing an idea that comes to you. Use a recording app on your phone to hum a chorus or melody line that you come up with suddenly.

, There is no right way to compose a song. Some songwriters start with the lyrics and then put a melody or chords to the words. Others start with a melody or chord progression and then add the lyrics later. See which approach feels most natural for you, and go to work writing your song.If you have a specific story or idea that you want to convey in your song, it may be best to start with the lyrics.
If you want to capture a certain mood, starting with the melody or chords may be a better approach.
When you’re trying to figure out a chord progression for your song, just play chords that you think sound good together. In music theory, there are certain chords that are commonly played together, but you’ll never know if a progression will work until you play it.
When you’re having trouble coming up with lyrics, it’s okay to hum nonsense words or syllables until you establish a basic melody for the song.

, Once you’ve finished writing the song and you’ve practiced it, it’s time to make a recorded version of it. By recording it, you’ll be able to listen back to it to see if there’s any room for improvement, but you’ll also have a version that you can post online for exposure, or send to record companies as a demo.If you have the money to book a session at a professional recording studio, that is definitely the best option. Do an online search for studios in your area.
If you don’t have the budget for a professional recording session or don’t have any studio nearby, don’t worry. You can make a strong recording with a good quality microphone and the right computer software at home.

, Once you write some songs that you’re proud of, it’s important to protect them before you start performing or sharing them with the public. As soon as you’ve produced the final written version of your song, you can register your song with the U.S. Copyright Office to ensure that no one else can claim ownership of it.You’ll also need a recorded version of the song. It doesn’t have to be a professional recording from a studio, though. You can use a rough demo version.

, After you’ve written at least one song that you’re happy with, it’s time to start singing it in front of an audience. Look for open mike nights at clubs, bars, and coffee shops in your area where you can test out your new songs, and gain more experience performing your material in front of a crowd.In addition to open mike nights, keep an eye out for talent shows and music festivals in your area that might allow you to perform your songs.

, If you want to get more exposure and see how your songwriting compares to other artists’ work, you may want to enter a songwriting contest. Not only may you win money or other prizes that can help fund your singer songwriter career, you may also make contacts in the music industry that can help you advance.There are a variety of different contests for songwriting, such as the John Lennon Songwriting Contest and the International Songwriting Competition. Some may be geared toward specific genres, though, so be sure to find one that’s a good fit for your song(s).
Do an online search to find songwriting competitions that you may want to enter. In some cases, you may be better off entering local contests because you won’t be competing against as many other songwriters.

, Another way to get more visibility as a singer songwriter is to share your music via social media apps, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. YouTube is probably the best tool -- create an account and make videos of yourself singing your original songs. Through the other social media apps, you can share them with friends, family, and potential fans, who will hopefully share them with more people so you can create a larger following.You can also use social media to advertise performances. The more people that you help bring to an open mike night, festival, or other venue, the more of a commodity you’ll seem to booking agents and music industry executives.
It’s also a good idea to create a website for yourself and your music. There are a variety of website building sites that make it easy to create a site even if you’re not a computer expert. A fee may be required, though.

, When TV shows, commercial companies, and other business need music, they often consult online music catalogs. You can submit your songs to these catalogs so companies can listen to your music and see if it’s a fit for what they need. It’s a good way to break into the industry because it will be cheaper to use an aspiring songwriter’s music than to use a successful, popular musician.Some online catalogs charge a fee to list your songs, so be sure to read the fine print to know what you’re in for.

, Some record companies accept unsolicited demos from aspiring singer songwriters, so you can send them recordings of your songs to see if they’re interested. The best way to identify companies that you should contact is to consider the labels that represent sing songwriters with a similar style to yours. Do an online search for the company, and see what their submission policy is.If you’re going to be sending a demo to a record label, you should have a professional recording of your music. Wait until you have the money to buy studio time and produce a high quality demo before contacting a record company.

Find a place to play.,
Dress to character with music.,
Ask permission if you can find someone to ask.,
Play so people can hear you.,
Be gracious if someone asks you to leave.,
Collect tips.,
Don't play within earshot of other musicians.,
Smile.",How to Be a Street Musician," While the term ""street musician"" implies playing on or near the street, don't actually do that unless you have to, or unless you're a drummer. Cars tend to drown out acoustic music, but if there are a lot of pedestrians on the sidewalks, it might be worth a try. Look for a farmers market with an open booth, a crafts fair, arts festival, or any other place people might appreciate your music floating by. In general, the more foot traffic the better, but if it looks so crowded that you might have trouble finding a spot at all, it might be harder than if there's a few open spaces here and there.;
, This is more effective in retaining an audience. It also makes the statement that you are a serious musician. Also musician's that have movement in their act such as dancing, tap dance for percussion, a tambourine attached to a foot makes a much more interesting show.

, It's a lot more comfortable to play somewhere if you don't have to worry about being run off by store owners, or worse, cops. That said, in the U.S. and many other countries, you're free to set up and play on public property as long as you're not obstructing passers-by or otherwise creating a nuisance. Typically the worst that can happen is that someone will ask you to leave. If you have to plug in an amp or something, however, you should ask permission first.

, Stand up when you play, if at all possible. Standing up to play and/or sing projects the sound better. If you're kind of quiet and you sit down, you might not be heard. Sit down if you have to, though. Keep in mind that the sound of strumming chords on the guitar carries a lot better than finger picking does.

, Smile. Maybe they'll suggest a better place to play. Police and store owners are almost always very nice about asking you to leave, and you should be nice, too..

, Remember to bring your hat or tip cup, or simply open your guitar case in front of you. People can't tip you if they don't know where to put the money. When someone gives you a tip, thank them with a smile or gesture, but keep playing.

, Give them their sonic space. If you cluster too close together, it will hurt everybody's earnings. In some situations, there are too many musicians in an area, so they'll take turns playing.

, A sour attitude drives away listeners. Don't get discouraged if you're not making a lot of money. Maybe you need to try another spot, or maybe it's just one of those days. Playing on the street can be very frustrating, but it can also be very rewarding, especially in terms of getting your music out there.

Learn what it takes to write a good song lyric.,
Learn how to structure a song.,
Continue learning your craft.",How to Become a Lyricist1," Although a song lyric looks like a poem and uses many of the same poetic techniques and descriptive imagery, a song lyric needs to be written for the ear instead of the eye. While a poem can deliver complex ideas in a complex format, a song lyric must rapidly deliver simple, powerful ideas in a clear and focused manner. A good song lyric needs the following:


A memorable title. Many country songs are famous for their titles, such as Paul Craft's ""Drop Kick Me, Jesus (Through the Goalposts of Life).""
A ""hook,"" or memorable phrase in the body of the lyric that often connects back to the song's title. In Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell's ""Georgia on My Mind,"" the hook is ""Georgia, Georgia,"" which begins most lines of the song.
A clear theme or story that can easily be followed throughout the song. Johnny Cash's ""Folsom Prison Blues"" is about a convicted murderer lamenting the loss of his freedom while watching a train pass his prison cell.
Imaginative and engaging rhymes. The Toby Keith song ""A Little Less Talk,"" written by Keith Hinton and Jimmy Alan Stewart, features the lines ""The look she shot me through the glass refraction said, 'A little less talk and a lot more action.' ""
Imagery that lives in the mind. In Jimmy Buffett's ""Margaritaville,"" the line in the chorus ""Searching for my lost shaker of salt"" shows the singer's emotional state of feeling he can't do anything worthwhile.;
, In addition to having the components described in the previous step, a song lyric has a structure of 1 or more verses, a chorus that repeats after each verse and frequently also a bridge separating the last repetition of the chorus from its next to last repetition.


Each verse usually has different words, but all verses are sung to the same melody. Some verses include a ""pre-chorus,"" a line that prepares the listener for the chorus.
The chorus uses the same melody and the same, or nearly the same, words each time it is sung. It provides the song's emotional impact, often incorporating the song's title in its lyrics.
The bridge has a different melodic and lyrical structure than either the verse or the chorus. It provides a break in the song and often includes a moment of revelation.

, Read books, attend classes and seminars, and incorporate what you learn into how you write lyrics.


Attending songwriting workshops and seminars also provides an opportunity to network.

Once you feel a comfortable with your voice: you need to get use to singing in front of others, start singing around people you are already somewhat familiar with and comfortably around like at a school choir, or church.

,
Now you need to start getting comfortable around strangers: (1) Go to your local fair and ask them if they have open slots for you to perform.,
Optional: Make connections!,
Start recording demos.,
Start promoting yourself like there's no tomorrow.,
Send out your demo(s) to record labels.,
Keep on going!,
Do not let your label control who you are after you have signed a recording contract.",How to Be a Professional Singer," Not for the fame, but because you have a true, and strong passion for music! It's going to take a lot of hard work. Don't just do it for money or to show off.;
, It does not matter how naturally talented or terrible you might be; lessons will teach you a lot and help you improve your voice.

, If you choose the wrong band mates that can lead to serious issues down the road.

,, (2) If there are any business near by that have open mic nights, go for that. (3) If your lucky and live in a bigger city you can just perform on the street, or maybe a concert venue.

, This might not really work as well if you live in a smaller town. Become friends with people at concert venues, you might end up opening for another 'bigger' band, and could make even more connections.

, You can even use a program called Garage-band on a MAC.

, Tell friends and family members, make fliers for upcoming gigs, make a Myspace, a Facebook, a twitter, a live journal, and a YouTube account anything that can reach a lot of people upload your music and attempt to add as many people as possible!

, Don't get discouraged if/when you are rejected, keep trying! And remember record labels DO NOT want to hear something that's already been done, be original.

, Keep playing shows (tour if possible), promoting yourself, sending out demos, and making your fan base grow! Labels like to see that you are taking the initiative.

, Fight for your creative vision because if you don't, well that's just not good..

Choose a title for your song.,
Analyze the title for ways to support it in the lyrics.,
Write the chorus.,
Write the verses.",How to Become a Lyricist2," This is what everything else in the song should relate to.

, Find the questions the song title raises and decide how you want to answer them. Make lists of words and phrases that flow from these answers.

, Use the song title and the words and phrases you brainstormed where they fit. Focus more on honest lyrics initially, and let the rhyming scheme come later.

, Using the same techniques as in the chorus, create the story the song is telling. For example, if the song is talking about dealing with a broken heart, the first verse can relate how the person got a broken heart, the second an unsuccessful means for dealing with it and the third a successful resolution.

Collaborate.,
Solicit feedback.,
Master songwriting software.,
Put your lyrics out there.,
Enjoy your accomplishments and build on them.",How to Become a Lyricist3," Most lyricists work with a composer and increasingly collaborate with additional lyricists. (The B52's hit, ""Love Shack"" was co-written by 4 people, for example.) Co-writers each bring their own strengths to a project; some may excel in vocabulary, while others have an ear for the rhythm of words. Collaborators can be found at songwriting workshops or by asking around at music clubs or the music department of a local college.


Usually, when a lyricist works with a composer, the composer creates the melody for the lyricist. Some composers prefer to write the melody first, others will compose a melody for lyrics you've already written. When looking for a composer make sure you can agree how you will work together. Find someone with the same goals as you. Make sure you are looking to create songs for the same genre. e.g. Pop, Heavy Metal, Hip Hop.

, Show your lyrics to other songwriters for their opinions. Also, get feedback from prospective listeners and music industry professionals.

, While songwriting software makes the composing of the music easier, it can also benefit lyricists by providing ready-made melodies and beats to write lyrics to.

, Getting your work out there is important in getting it published, recorded and performed. Modern technology makes a number of options available now that weren't available before.


The Internet makes it possible for you to post your lyrics on your own Web site or share them with other lyricists on a message board.
Computers and the Internet have also opened many more opportunities for performing artists, thus allowing a larger market to sell your songs to. There is also a larger number of non-traditional opportunities, such as providing background music for electronic slideshows.

, It will take some time to sell your first song, and once you do, you'll want to sell more, and others will look for more from you. It helps to see each step you master along the way as a personal success worth celebrating.

Develop a stage persona.",How to Be a Rock Singer," Becoming a rock singer requires more vocal control than singing karaoke in a bar. You need to learn how to control the pitch and tone of your voice.Sing from the stomach instead of the throat. Singing from the throat is like a speaker without a box. You don´t get the fullness of the sound. It will sound squeaky when you try to hit some good notes, especially the high ones. So, mainly use the throat as a conduit. Work on hitting high notes.Diaphragm pressure is the key to creating the heavier vocals used by rock singers.Your diaphragm controls the air that goes through your vocal chords. Some pressure in your diaphragm can push just enough air through your vocal chords to get that heavy grit out.
Practice changing the pitch. Experiment with opening and closing your throat, lips, and teeth to see how much control you have over the sound. Closing your throat can add harshness or grit, while opening it can increase volume and improve timbre. Lips and teeth affect not only the character (what phonics you make) but also how the vibration of your vocal chords is translated into the air around you.;
, As you become more controlled and proficient in using your voice, try to expand your musical vocabulary by learning about the basics of music and singing.


Vocal warm-ups, scales, intervals, and timbre are all helpful things to familiarize yourself with but remember the first rule of rock: do it your way. Choose your style of rock.
Abandon musical lyricism, tone, and articulation. Rock singing should be rather ambiguous in rhythm, lyrics, and pitch. That is the essence of hard rock.

, Don't try to learn from a cd or machine. Get a great teacher. Many professional rock singers have done so. A voice coach will help you develop your voice and can give you tips in how to protect your voice.Rock has a vast array of voice styles and methods. An experienced coach can appropriately assess your improvement. A coach will help you improve your vocal range.
There are no shortcuts. It takes a long time to learn to sing well. You might have natural talent, but that will take you only so far. You have to have a solid technique to have a stable career. That is why there are so many ""flash in the pan"" performers. They have no technique, and their voices crash and burn quickly.

, You do have to be able to hold enough breath to push a note loud enough for a microphone or audience to hear it.Focusing on core exercises such as abdominal, chest, and back muscles will help you tighten your core in order to focus on your breath.
Cardio exercise such as biking, jogging, jump rope, and even brisk walking can improve the amount of breath you have for holding notes and can also help a lot if you're an active singer who does a lot of jumping around or headbanging while singing.
Take care of your voice. While some singers can smoke and drink and sound like rock stars, that approach might not work for you. It's important to know the limitations of your own voice because nothing is worse than running your voice ragged before your band finishes its first set.

, Everybody has a different vocal range, but most male singers fall into the categories of either bass, baritone or tenor, while most females have either a contralto, mezzo soprano or soprano vocal range.


Some people have ranges that extend further than these categories. Learning your vocal range is very important because you need to know your limits.
Learn how to scream. Develop a screaming-yelling style to your singing voice. Most rock singers do not utilize the same technique as pop stars do: instead of smooth transitions and mild sounds, they go for the more scream-like voice, making it sound more passionate. Try yelling parts of any rock lyrics without utilizing vocal notes and then replicating that feeling while singing.

, Singers have a bad reputation for being bad musicians. Don’t fall into that trap. Be a good to great musician. Anything less, and you're wasting your time and everyone else's.


Master the electric guitar. That’s a staple in rock bands. Or study piano. Also know how to read music; even better, know how to write music as well.
Be realistic about your talent. If your voice isn’t what you want it to be, learn an instrument instead. Parents are rarely realistic about their children's talent.
Have persistence and patience. Don't be in a hurry. It takes time. Perform in small venues until you are used to performing. Being a solid performer takes practice. Get a thick skin. Be prepared for what you might feel is vicious criticism. Don’t get discouraged if you don’t make it big right away. Expect to face a lot of rejection.

, If you want to become a rock celebrity with your band like blink-182, Angels & Airwaves, or NOFX, then you need to have songwriting chops.Each of those artists has written unique songs and did not get famous off of singing covers. Perform your own songs.
Learn the music fundamentally. Your complete understanding of the notes and rhythms must be solid before you can work on stylizing your performance and songs.

, You’re not going to be a rock singer if you don’t get out there and play. Rock bands have many parts to them: Lead singer, drummer, bassist, guitarist.


There is no substitute for practicing a lot and then performing. Start out small: perform for family and friends.
It would also help if you performed to a group consisting of an individual or individuals who know how to sing rock. After you perform, ask for suggestions and feedback. How can I become better? What do I need to tweak?

, If you're serious about becoming a rock star, you will have to create a demo recording so that producers can hear what you sound like when your voice is mixed on a professional quality CD. These are essential for those hoping to make commercial music.Use only your best songs on it - four to six at the most. The format used depends on who's getting it, and the type of equipment they have. Keep it simple. Start with your absolute best song.Make sure to label your demo. That way if it gets passed around, no one will forget that the great rock music on it belongs to you. Choose strong lyrics, and make sure the audio has strong clarity.
You might want to think about getting an agent as well. However, be realistic; of the many thousands vying for stardom, only a few make it, so have a back-up plan and perhaps a day job.

, Rock is more than screaming. It’s about feeling. It’s about putting your opinions, emotions and beliefs into music. Sing what you believe and feel.


If you want to become a rock singer, sing with a passion. Let the words and the tune flow out of your heart. Let the pain, happiness, anger, sadness, anxiety, stress and hopefulness out. Let all your living emotions reach the maximum and explode from you.
Let the music flow through your bloodstream. Listen to what you are making and enjoy it. Use your life in your music. Sing what you know so the emotions feel real.

, Rock aesthetics is built around the concept of individuality and rejection of conformity. Therefore, if you are setting out to emulate a singer or style you already like, you may set yourself back considerably in your learning process.


The beginnings and history of rock and roll (which over time ""split"" into what we now call rock and R&B) are replete with artists who made the most of a limited set of tools. Minimalism and sparse resources have always been a cornerstone of the genre. So first and foremost, trust yourself. You have the rock inside you, and no one needs to tell you how to let it out.
Find what you do well, and stick with it. You may not have to ""try"" to make your voice unique. Try to sing in the way that is most comfortable for you. This is going to allow you to sing the strongest and longest your voice will allow.
If you can only scream, then be the screamer in the band! If you can only hit falsetto notes, then play that into your style. If you feel like you can only sing really low notes, then stick to where your voice is comfortable. A lot of beginning rock singers waste their time trying to emulate their heroes.

, Try studying the vocal techniques of the singer in the song you are listening to. Is he/she singing putting more emphasis on the higher notes? The lower notes? Are the noises coming from the back of the singer's throat or from the front of the mouth?


Try mimicking specific notes and the way these are sung, as this will help you develop that rock technique.
A lot of people say they want to learn how to sing rock but in the end of the day they never actually listen to rock music. Listening to rock music constantly can familiarize you with the beats.

, If you want to be a rock singer, you shouldn’t dress like a country singer. You need to master the look, while still keeping true to your own individuality.


Male rock singers often wear ripped jeans, ripped T-shirts, scuffed hair, black makeup around the eyes, spiked collars and spray painted black leather jackets.
A typical female rock singer’s wardrobe might involve dark colors like black and purple, mini-skirts, T-shirts, leather jackets, boots, spiked bracelets, and long teased hair. Avoid pastels.

, The key is confidence. You need to be confident to project both voice and personality when on stage. This may be easier thought about than done––you may wish to join drama class or a club to help you to develop presence before testing yourself in the stage environment playing music.In some cases, depending on the band you're fronting, it may become more important to be a good entertainer than it is to be a good singer. It won't always be this way though, as it depends on the combination of singing and presentation of your band. You need to interpret the music on stage.
Practice your posture. It may not seem like it, but good posture is essential to both good singing and great stage presence. Bad posture can cramp the sound leaving your body and can cause people to think you'd rather shrink to the back of the stage than take it front and center.

Relax and start writing whatever rhymes, phrases, or ideas come to mind.,

Consider song structure as you develop lyrics and melodies.,
Grab an instrument and start playing underneath your words.,
Re-write once you feel confident in the developing ideas.,

Try a few simple tricks to adjust your songs if you get stuck in a rut.",How to Be a Good Songwriter1," Don't lose the faith that brought you to this article just because a brilliant song isn't bursting out of you. The only way to have creative thoughts is to do creative work. So grab a pen and paper and start scribbling. Spend your first 5-10 minutes writing just warming up your brain and relaxing into ""songwriting"" mode.


Freewrite for 5 minutes. Put the pen to paper and put on a timer, and don't ever stop writing until the timer is done. It doesn't matter what you say, just that you're saying something at all. When you're done, read over it and see if any lines or ideas stick out for a song.
Improvise on your instrument, humming melodies or even blurting out lines, rhymes, and ideas. If one catches your fancy, follow it and see if it leads to a song.
Review your old idea notebook and expand on one idea you like. If you have a collection of ideas, lines, and melodies somewhere, pull it up and review it for a few minutes. If you find an idea you like, spend a few minutes writing down every thought you can relate to that idea.;
, Some days you'll come up with a great verse, but have no chorus to back it up. Some days you'll write a killer instrumental line but have no idea what lyrics it needs. Most people think that you have to have a specified topic about something in order to write a really good song, but in reality all you need to do is write. Keep working on ideas and you'll notice that they start to develop and join together naturally.


Tack up different song titles or ideas on your wall. Each time you come up with a line or new part of the song, post it underneath the title, moving it around when necessary., Song structure is simply the order in which you place your parts, and is most commonly something like: Intro → Verse → Chorus → Verse → Chorus → Breakdown/Change Up → Chorus → Outro.However, there are a million ways to adjust this structure to fit your song and style, including:


Many songs feature a ""bridge,"" which is a short, new set of lyrics or melody between the Chorus and Melody.
Songs off Bob Dylan's seminal album Blood on the Tracks"" and Lupe Fiasco's song ""Murals"" both feature verses with no chorus or bridge, highlighting the wide-ranging ideas and songwriting talents of the artists. You don't need to follow any form if you don't want to.

If you're an instrumentalist, where would you fit a solo, instrumental break, or change of melody? How, as a listener, are you pulled from section to section?, Now that you have all of your words brainstormed you can mix and match different sentence fragments to get some lyrics. With an instrument in hand, start experimenting with different melodies that sound good to you. Hum or whistle along while playing to make up the melodies for your lyrics, experimenting until you find something you like.


It is rare that the entire, finished idea will come to you at once. So keep improvising until you find something that clicks.

, If something doesn't make sense, write it again and try to accompany it with other rhyming words and sentences. While rewriting, work on cutting away ideas that don't work and finding the theme of the song. Now that you have some parts, what is the song ""about?"" Even if the answer is ""nothing,"" you want to use your rewrite to hone in on this idea and make the song as impactful as possible.


After re-writing you want a nearly finished song structure. It will change as the song develops, but you want to get to a point where you could play the entire song at once and see how it sounds., Play the song for a friend, share it on the internet, and start getting feedback. Do people tap their feet? Do they hum along? Do they come up with the same theme for the song that you do? Music is meant to be shared with others, and you'll notice that your song will subtly evolve as you keep playing it. This is natural, and it is often after a few performances that you can finally perfect the song and move on to another one.


James Brown developed the genre of funk at live shows when he noticed what songs, parts, and instruments people were dancing the most to., All writers, no matter what they are writing, get stuck from time to time. The best advice if you get stuck is to keep writing. Inspiration is not something that is turned on and off randomly -- you need to sit down and write in order to write great songs. Try the following tips and tricks to keep you writing, even when if feels like nothing is working:


Reverse the chords. If you love the verse melody but have no chorus, reverse the chords. What happens if you reverse half of them, or swap two out?
Say it differently from your favorite song. Rappers like Jay-Z used to re-write their favorite songs, keeping the same structure but changing the words inside and rhymes, as a songwriting exercise.Create contradictions. If you've got a slow, long chord melody, try using short, staccato phrase when you sing. If you've got a peppy, high-tempo song, try bringing down the energy in the bridge or breakdown.Write with a partner. The most successful songwriting duo in history, Lennon/McCartney, had to be on to something.Drop your judgment and break some rules. The best artists know the rules so that they can break them. There is no ""wrong"" way to break a song, so listen to your own imagination and write what sounds good to you."

Learn to sing and play your favorite songs.,
Write down fragments of songs whenever they come to you.,
Let influences hit you from anywhere.,
Steal from your favorite artists, bands, and songs.,
Play an instrument regularly.,
Enjoy your life outside of songwriting.",How to Be a Good Songwriter2," The best singers in the world spent years learning the songs of other songwriters, studying the art form and playing music daily. The Beatles spent 2 years in Germany as a cover band, sometimes playing for 8-10 hours each night.Bob Dylan covered folk songs, even lifting old-time melodies, for years before he started recording only original music. Both Bob and the Beatles are considered some of the greatest songwriters to ever live -- and they both started as cover bands. This isn't a mistake, this is because they needed to learn from the greats before becoming greats themselves., Don't feel like you need to have a full song in your head in order to write it down. Even if all you think of is a single rhyme, or you just imagine a wordless melody to hum, record it for later. These kernels of music may fit perfectly into songs you haven't finished yet, or become the seeds of completely new songs over time. Great songwriters are writing constantly.


Dedicate a notebook to music. Whenever you're out of inspiration, turn back to it and read a few pages -- what ideas stick out again?
Famous singer-songwriter Tom Waits carries a tape recorder with him everywhere he goes, recording lines, melodies, and inspiration throughout the day and listening to it at the end of the week., There is no experience that can't be turned into a song as long as you keep your mind open to it. From surrealistic trips into pop-culture tragedy in ""American Pie,"" to the endless professions of love and loss in pop music, to an ode about a ""Yellow Submarine,"" great songwriters can spin a song out of their life, imagination, the news, or simply a feeling. This isn't to say that your should write about anything and everything, simply that there is no ""wrong"" topic for a song.


Don't purge your ideas because you ""don't think they'd make a good song."" Just let your ideas flow without judgment -- you can decide if an idea isn't worth it when you're recording your album or writing a set list.
No idea is too small to become a song. ""99 Red Balloons"" is about a Rolling Stones concert effect where they released balloons, for example.""I think songwriting is the ultimate form of being able to make anything that happens in your life productive."" --Taylor Swift, ""Good artists borrow, great artists steal."" Interestingly enough, this quote was originally attributed to Picasso but is also found in the writing of T.S. Elliot, Steve Jobs, and many others, all of whom may have stolen it. The point is simple -- you need to consciously pull your influences and inspirations into your writing.If you're struggling with a melody for your new song, play the chords from a similar song. Snap up your favorite lines from songs and re-use them in interesting ways, and realize that this isn't really ""stealing,"" it is just the artistic process. All art is a combination of your own feelings and the notes, chords, and melodies that are already written -- so own up to this and start stealing like a pro.


Note how Vampire Weekend's ""Step"" re-purposes several melody lines from Souls of Mischief's ""Step to My Girl.""
Bob Dylan's famous, game-changing lyrics to ""Blowin' in the Wind"" is set to the old melody of ""No More Auction Block.""Hip-hop is built on sampling, homages, and borrowed clips. Sometimes it's obvious (""50 told me go 'head mix the style up""], sometimes it's subtle (""there she goes again / the dopest Ethiopian"").

, There is a reason that many of the best songwriters can play 5-10 different instruments, even if only a little bit. Playing a song without thinking of words sharpens your ear for melody, rhythm, and song structure. It also helps you think about music without the pressure of coming up with original words. Even if the instrument isn't one that you normally play, spend some time getting to know music in all of its forms -- it will improve your songwriting considerably.


You don't have to play multiple instruments to be a songwriter, just something musical. Start playing an easy melody instrument like a piano or guitar to learn the guts of your music as you write

, It may seem like odd advice to stop songwriting in order to be a better songwriter, but you need to live your life to the fullest to give yourself fuel for a great song. The best way to do this is to set aside time for songwriting every single day, giving yourself a few dedicated hours to focus on your craft. As you get used to this schedule, you'll find it helps you turn on ""songwriting mode"" when you need to write, and you won't feel worried about not-writing when you're at a party, on a hike, or reading a book.

You can also get inspired by what's currently popular with artists like Fetty Wap, Drake, and Nicki Minaj.
Delivery is almost as important as the lyrics themselves. Take note on how some rappers delivery is faster, slower, smoother, or harsher than others.Study the wordplay and context of songs. Look for double meanings and puns so you can incorporate these things into your lyrics.
Remain original, but draw from the skills of artists that came before you. You don't have to sound the same, but you must understand why and how they made music.;
, Different rhyming schemes are available to rappers, from AABB to AXXA.These rhyming styles dictate which words rhyme in your lyrics. Study them and develop your rhyming versatility.


Most verses in rap songs are ""16 bars"" or 4 sets of 4 lines of lyrics in a song.Start with simple rhyming schemes like ABAB and build up to include more complex rhymes.
An example of an ABAB rhyme is ""That cat, over there, in the hat, on the bear."" The last word in the first and third lines rhyme as well as the last word in the second and fourth line.
Some rhymes are known as half-rhymes if they have similar sounding ending consonant sounds but do not fully rhyme. An example would be ""bald"" and ""held."", Some artists get so complex and into their art that they forget that it must also appeal to the general audience. As you build up your lyrical skills, make sure to keep the listener in mind and don't get too fancy or else you may lose fans.Taking risks are a part of being a popular artist, but sometimes you can lose fans if they don't like the direction you're going in.
Just because a song is catchy does not mean that it has to lack substance.

, The hook is the part of the song that is often repeated and is the portion of the track that's usually most remembered by fans. For other genres of music, this is typically referred to as the chorus. Having a good hook in a song is incredibly important if you want it to be popular. The hook should be catchy, memorable, and should embody the song.A popular hook from the past is Chamillionaire's ""Ridin Dirty."" ""They see me rollin', they hatin', Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty. Tryna catch me ridin' dirty.""If you aren't a singer or aren't good with hooks, consider collaborating with an R&B singer who would be better equipped.
Think of something that helps support the verses in your songs.

, Regardless of how popular or famous you get, it's important to stay on the top of your game. Rapping is a skill that requires discipline and practice so make sure to regularly practice to work out your rapping abilities.Take every opportunity to show other people your songs and get feedback.
Practice in front of the mirror, while you're in the car, or taking a walk.

, While copying popular or iconic music may get you a small amount of success, it will never make you as popular as the artist that you're trying to be. It's important to draw from personal circumstances, events, and emotions from your life and the lives of people around you.


If you've been through tough times it is likely people have shared similar experiences. Being open and genuine will affect people more than copying a lifestyle you've never lived.
Try to mix up your catalog of music. Don't always rap about the same thing and make sure your songs don't all share the same mood. Showing a range of emotion will allow you to connect to more fans.

, Unless you plan on mixing and creating your own beats, you'll most likely have to meet a producer that's already good at it. Try to get producers that have created successful songs in the past, and meet with them so that they can cater their beats to your unique style and voice.


Talk to other rappers to find local producers that would be willing to collaborate.
Send local recording studios a demo of your music if you're still unable to find a producer in your personal network.If you can't find a producer, consider learning how to create your own beats or use royalty free music.

, A music studio will be able to refine, mix, and remaster the music that you make. In addition, they will have the hardware and equipment, like mixers and mics, to make sure that the best quality music is produced.Call a local studio and ask for rates and schedule a time to record.


Make sure to have a game plan before going into the studio. Studios usually charge an hourly fee, so wasting time is not smart.Some musicians record in their bedroom, but it requires skill and knowledge on how to mix sound. You will also likely need expensive equipment like a powerful laptop and a good microphone in order to create high-quality music.

, You can only become famous if your music is popular, which means people need to be able to listen to it. Before you get signed to a label or release a record, exposure online can be an early springboard towards success. Partnering up with a video producer to create a music video can also help get your music out there.


Artists like Soulja Boy and Macklemore got their start on YouTube., Being a top rapper means that you can be innovative, genuine, and likable over the long run. Developing your own unique style and sound is critical to standing out from the crowd. Take the unique aspects from your personality and integrate that into your music, and never stray away from what makes you different and unique.


Artists like J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar are different than most of the rap mainstream due to their lyrical content and production, but were able to pick up multiple Grammy nominations., When you're first starting off, you're probably not going to be headlining your own show. It's important to get performing experience before you being to play in front of a large audience. Hang around local venues and get to know the staff there. Ask the talent manager or booking agent there if you can open for other hip hop acts.Talk to other local artists. If you become their friend, they may want you to open for their shows.

, If you're not able to book any shows, then a manager may help in directing your career. They can use their pre-existing relationships with venue owners and people in the industry in order to get your foot in the door.


Managers typically take 15% -20% of the income that you generate.Before you hire a manager, make sure that you've exhausted your own personal networking connections to land gigs.

, Getting into personal arguments with other people in the music industry will most likely come back to hurt you. Don't do anything that violates your own personal set of ethics, but try to maintain good relationships by remaining respectful and not spreading rumors or holding grudges against those that you work with.

, Social media has given the ability for artists and rappers to directly communicate with their fans and has completely revolutionized the rapper and fan relationship.Staying active and relevant on social media will allow you to hype new tracks and promote your music, as well as stay in touch with the people listening to your songs.


Try to stay away from arguments or starting ""beef"" with other musicians unless it advances your career.
Be careful about what you post because it could ruin your career.

, Branching out and merchandising your brand will give you another revenue stream and will increase your exposure to the general public. Many of the most famous rappers have merchandised in some way over the span of their careers.


Popular rap driven clothing brands include Drake's OVO apparel, Kanye West’s ""Yeezus"" and ""Life of Pablo"" merchandise, and Yung Lean's SBE Gear.Dr. Dre owns Beats Music and Beats which increased his net worth to $800 million.Merchandising will get people who don't like rap aware of your brand.

, Musical evolution is critical, especially in the case of hip-hop and rap. As you age, it becomes harder for you to stay relevant, so you must be up on the latest trends in the rap industry.Integrate what's popular into your music and make it your own.


Don't be judgmental of younger rappers if you don't get why they are popular. Instead, try to see the perspective of the fans and figure out the aspects that make it sell.
Do not get stuck in your ways when you're rapping. Rap has evolved and will continue to evolve with or without you.

Save up.",How to Become a Music Producer," You don't have to be a virtuoso to be a music producer, but training your ear and learning musical theory will hugely benefit your career. You should also try to compose your own songs, master tempos, or perhaps even learn to play from sheet music; understanding music from the other side of the soundboard will make you much better equipped to hear its full potential. Consider these basic instruments:


Piano/Keyboard. Probably the most versatile instrument for a producer, being able to noodle on the piano is huge. Whether you're just trying to work out a concept or want a particular phrase recorded, a piano is almost indispensable,not only for the melody itself, but also for its flexibility in live scenarios !
Guitar. Learning the guitar will help you easily flesh out chords and immediately become relevant to rock and popular music.
Bass. Underrated but essential, the bass will help you lead the rhythm section and create a solid foundation for your productions.;
, To create and manipulate music, you’ll need to learn how to use a soundboard and as many music-processing programs as you can. If you don’t already have some background in sound production, a good sequencer program to start off with is Cubase.


Sequencer software programs like Cakewalk Sonar, Reason, and Pro Tools help music producers arrange and tweak the music that they record. Hip-hop and dance producers may wish to use FL Studio, which could be used for pop as well.
If you're thinking about producing hip-hop music, think about investing in a sampler. The MPC60, SP1200, and S950 are all popular with ""golden age"" hip-hop producers like Pete Rock and DJ Premier.

, Know what it means to mix a track: how to blend all the disparate sounds together into one mellifluous mix.


Know the difference between ""in the box"" and ""out of the box."" In the box just means you're mixing solely on a computer program; out of the box means that you're mixing with a soundboard and other non-computer equipment to achieve your sound.
Know the difference between stereo mix and mono. Stereo mixes represent two different tracks in the same song, one for the left ear and one for the right; mono represents a single sound for the track.
Know what to put in the center of your mix. Bass guitar and vocals usually want to stay in the center of your mix — not off to any one side. Other instruments and production elements can usually be panned slightly to the left or right side to create a fuller sound.

, Take your scholarship seriously. Music producers are in the business of making music, often with the help of other songs. Hip-hop producers in particular, whose job it is to take samples from other songs and rework them into a different beat, need to be voracious music students. If you're not a student of music, you'll soon find that you're limiting yourself unnecessarily.

, Your job as a music producer is to make fascinating, intriguing, soul-shattering music. Often, this means taking exploring the way that different sounds and different genres interact.


George Martin, the illustrious producer of the Beatles, introduced what we now call ""World"" music into the popular canon. Martin helped mesh the sitar into lush pop songs. This was truly East meeting West.

, Try doing whatever feels best: Punk, Ska, Rock, Rap, R&B, Country, Funk, Jazz, and the like. In the beginning, focus on mastering one style of music. This will allow you to make a name for yourself in one particular genre before eventually moving onto different musical styles. Because they often involve less instrumentation, Hip-Hop, R&B, and Pop are the easiest to start off with.


Eventually, try experimenting with more genres. The more genres you become fluent in, the broader your horizons will be (and the more clients you’ll get). Don't overextend yourself too early, however. Have one genre down pat before you move onto the next one.

, Take a known song — preferably one that has been minimally engineered — and give it your own flavor. What kind of potential does it have? How can you make it better? What new vision do you have for the song to transform it into something utterly different?


Make several versions to get a feel for the possibilities. Make a Reggae version of ""The Wall"" perhaps, or work an obscure jazz tune into a Hip-Hop beat. Don't be afraid to think big here.

, Collaborations have produced some of the most memorable music in the canon. Don't be afraid to go up to a producer you admire and ask him or her if they'd like to work with you. Collaborations succeed because you can use the other producer's strengths to mask your weaknesses, and hopefully use your own strengths to mask theirs.

, Tell your family and friends you're producing music. Create business cards. Post bulletins around your neighborhood. If your prices are reasonable, you’ll get clients in no time. Charge cheaply per hour or per song.


It might be good to get your feet wet with a friend or family member. Do you have a buddy who is a great singer? An uncle who has a knack for playing the tuba? Produce them and keep examples of your work to show prospective clients. (Remember to keep family and business separate, though.)
If nothing exciting comes up, offer to volunteer your services to establish your reputation. There's nothing bad about working for free, unless you're being exploited. A really good first impression on a volunteer job could even earn you a paycheck if your work is too good to be free.

, Sure, it's tough work, but you might get some free time in a real recording studio. In the meantime, you’ll make friends in the business (and bring home that paycheck).


Start low on the totem pole if necessary; the point is to get your foot in the door. The harder you work (and more cheerfully you do it), the likelier you’ll be to get noticed.

, Take night classes to earn your degree if necessary. If music production doesn't work out, you have something to fall back on.

, It used to be that you had to forge personal connections in order to get your music heard. Now, if you use the internet adeptly, you can quickly make an impression both locally and globally, if that's what you want.


Upload you're music to different websites, such as Bandcamp, Soundcloud, or Youtube. Curate it furiously; only put your best work up, and keep your page(s) stocked with new and different material to keep fans excited.
Use social networks to get the word out about your music. Social networks deliver viral success to hundreds of artists, even if that success is short-lived. Use — don't abuse — your social network with updates, promotions, and free stuff. They'll thank you for it. Look into SEO (Search Engine Optimization when using online social networks. When using Youtube learn about tags, descriptions, and titles to give your videos more views.

, Now that you have a working knowledge of the business, a steady source of income, and a sizeable client base, you can start your own studio. If your sights are set higher, you might even move to a different city to try out for the big league.

The job can be demanding and the training can be expensive, but it will all be worth it if you love going to work every day. If you love working with people, expressing your creativity, and paying attention to details, a career as a hair stylist may be perfect for you.;
, Hair stylists need to be extremely personable in order to retain clients. Many people return to the same hair stylist time after time because they enjoy talking with him or her while they get their hair done. You are also likely to get better tips if you can make your clients' experience very enjoyable. If you don't enjoy talking to people or are not very upbeat, this profession may not be right for you., Not everyone will be happy with their haircut. In order to be successful as a hair stylist, you will need to be able to deal with unhappy customers, learn from your mistakes, and not take criticism too personally., Hair stylists spend the majority of their work days on their feet, which can take a toll on the body. If you have problems with your back or knees that make standing for long periods of time difficult, you may want to reconsider becoming a hair stylist.Keep in mind that you will probably need to work evenings and weekends as well, at least when you are just starting out.

, Before you decide to become a hair stylist, you should understand what your income potential will be and how much the training programs will cost. It is best to do some research on these figures in your area, as salaries and program costs vary dramatically from place to place.


According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for a hair stylist was $22,770. This does not include tips, so you may be able to earn much more.Cosmetology programs typically cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $10,000-$20,000. Keep in mind that you might be able to apply for scholarships and financial aid., In most states, a high school diploma or GED is required to become a hair stylist. Check with the licensing board in your state for more information.If you are currently a high school student, find out if there are any vocational high schools in your area that would allow you to complete some or all of the training hours required for a hair stylist license in your state. Some high schools also offer programs that allow students to take some classes at the high school and others at a local community college. These options will save you a lot of money, so take advantage of them if they are available., If you have already graduated from high school or if a high school vocational program is not an option for you, you will need to complete a state-approved cosmetology or hair stylist program in order to obtain your license. There are a variety of different programs available, and they all differ in cost, duration, and curriculum, so be sure to research your program thoroughly.Depending on your area, you may have the option of attending a community college to obtain an associate's degree in cosmetology or attending a cosmetology, beauty, or hair school to obtain a certificate.
If your state issues separate licenses for cosmetologists and hair stylists, you may be able to find a program that focuses only on hair. Most states, however, only offer licenses in cosmetology, so you will be required to take some classes in areas such as makeup, skin care, and nail care as well.
It is a good idea to tour all of the schools you are interested in and ask the admissions advisers lots of questions about the curriculum.
Look for programs that are accredited by an institution recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Accreditation means the program's curriculum meets a set of industry-specific guidelines. You will likely have an easier time finding a job if you graduate from an accredited institution, and you will be able to apply for federal financial aid.Apprenticeships are also a training option in a few states. This is a much more affordable option for completing the necessary training and it will allow you to start working in the field with a professional hair stylist right away. Check with your state licensing board to see if this is an option in your state. If it is, you should be aware that it will likely take longer to complete an apprenticeship than it would to complete a cosmetology program., Most cosmetology programs take between one and two years to complete, depending on whether you attend part-time or full-time.You should expect to complete a combination of classroom work and hand-on work during your program.
At most schools, you will begin your hand-on training by working on mannequins, before eventually progressing to working on real clients at the school's salon.
In addition to learning how to cut, color, and style hair, you will likely be required to learn about things like sanitation, anatomy, and business management.

, Once you complete your program, you will be required to apply for a cosmetology or hair stylist license in your state. Licensing procedures are unique in each state, but you will typically be required to pass a written test and a practical test to demonstrate that you understand the theories of hair styling and are capable of implementing them.If you move to another state, you will need to apply for a license in that state in order to start working as a hair stylist. Keep in mind that requirements for licenses vary from state to state, so you may also be required to take additional training courses.

, Most licenses need to be renewed every few years. Depending on your state, you may need to take continuing education courses in order to renew your license.Even if you are not required to take continuing education courses, it may be a good idea. Trends are always changing, so it will be important for you to keep up with the latest techniques and styles.

, In order to stand out in the job market and earn more money, you may want to consider taking some additional courses beyond those that are required for your licenses. You can choose specialty areas to focus on, such as hair color or hair extensions.You may be able to find courses at your local cosmetology school, through the manufacturer of a hair care product, or through a professional organization.

, When applying for jobs online, you will need to to submit a resume and cover letter that detail your experience, training, and interests. Be extremely thorough when writing these documents and make sure to highlight qualifications that make you a unique candidate.


Don't forget to include any experience that you have working with customers. Even if you weren't working in a salon, customer service experience is a plus.
If you're not confident about your grammar and spelling, make sure to have someone proofread your resume and cover letter for you before you submit them.
Make sure to tailor your resume and cover letter to each position you are applying for. You don't need to start from scratch, but you should make sure to focus on skills and qualities that will be most important for each specific position.

, You will need to show off your skills to potential employers, so having a portfolio of your work is extremely important. Take before and after pictures of as many clients as possible and include your best work in your portfolio.


Your portfolio should show off your strengths, but it should also showcase your versatility. Try to show examples of a wide variety of cuts and styles.
Make sure to get consent from your clients before taking their pictures and explain to them what you will be using the pictures for.
Having an online portfolio is advisable because you can simply include a link to it whenever you submit an application online. You may also want to have a nicely organized binder if you plan on applying for jobs in person.
Update your portfolio regularly.

, If possible, try to get a job at a salon while you are still in school. You will not be able to work as a hair stylist, but you may be able to work as a receptionist or office assistant. Experience working in a salon will be very valuable to you, and you might even get a promotion to hair stylist once you obtain your license., Your cosmetology school can be a great resource to you when you are looking for a job, so don't forget to ask for help! Most schools have relationships with local salons, so they may be able to help you find a job when you graduate. They can also give you advice on how to prepare for interviews.Start working with the career services department at your school before you graduate. Even if you don't have your license yet, you may be able to introduce yourself to salon owners, and maybe even get a conditional job offer.

, You can search for jobs at salons and spas online by using job boards such as Craigslist and Indeed. You can also try visiting local salons and inquiring about available positions, but always be sure to have your portfolio and copies of your resume on hand.


While you may have to be a bit flexible with your first job, you should still try to focus on applying to salons that offer the services you enjoy the most. If you love coloring hair and you get a job at a salon that only does haircuts, you may not be very happy.
If you get an interview, make sure to research the salon thoroughly so you know what kinds of services they offer.
Remember that you need to come across as passionate and friendly during your interview. While you should definitely talk about your technical skills, make sure the interviewer also gets a sense of who you are as a person.
Don't be surprised if you're asked to demonstrate your skills before you are offered a job.

, If you can't find a salaried position at a salon, or if you're looking for the freedom to make your own schedule, you can try leasing a booth or a suite at an established salon. In this scenario, you will essentially be working for yourself.When you lease a chair at a salon, you will pay the salon a fee to use the space. You will be responsible for providing your own tools, marketing your services, and scheduling appointments. Make sure you thoroughly understand the terms of the agreement before you sign.

, Another option is to open your own salon, although you should probably only consider this if you have some knowledge of how to run a business and some experience as a hair stylist.If you open your own salon, you will be responsible for a lot more than just styling hair. You will have to deal with managing employees, maintaining your salon, and marketing, among many other things. You may not have any time to style hair, so make sure you are prepared for your role as a business owner.
Opening a franchise is a good option if you want some support with marketing and brand development. You could also consider purchasing an established salon if you don't want to start from scratch.

, In addition to working as a hair stylist in a salon, you might also consider a variety of other related careers. Some options include styling hair for magazine shoots and fashion shows, teaching at a cosmetology school, or becoming a sales representative for beauty products."

Don’t listen to anyone.",How to Make It in Hollywood," If you have a fallback, you’re going to use it – point blank. So that boring data entry job you have? Don’t fall in love with it. Don’t type your life away, spending 60 hours a week inputting numbers and zapping you of any energy you have to go out and pursue what you actually want to pursue. This needs to be your only option, otherwise you might back out.


There’s a phrase when it comes to Hollywood: “If you can do anything else, do it.” The ones that make it in Hollywood never see themselves doing anything else. This has to be your future. Nothing else is possible.;
, Whether you want to act, write, sing, film, or dance, take classes. True talent is all well and good, but you need skill. You need to meet people and work with similar ways of thinking. You need to learn from others and have challenges set in front of you with deadlines. You need to find out if this is something you’re actually good at and enjoy.


Take a look at the courses offered at your local community college or university. You can also consider classes at adult schools, community centers, or online. And if money is a big issue,you may have to be your own teacher.

, Take advantage of today’s technology and get yourself out there and potentially seen. Whether it’s a film you wrote, directed, and filmed or a video of a dance you choreographed, get it in public for the world to see. You never know – you may be discovered.


Need proof that the Internet can be all you need? Talk to Kate Upton, Justin Bieber, Bo Burnham, Kim Kardashian, or Carly Rae Jepsen. They were all discovered on the Internet, and that's just the names of people you can count on one hand., Do you have a friend who’s in an acting class that needs to create an audition tape? Offer to film it for them. Does a local high school need a choreographer for their musical? Take it. It doesn’t matter how small the opportunity is – if it’s slightly related to what you want to do, grab it and don’t let go. It’s a step in the right direction.


There's only one thing to consider: don't let it keep you from going. There's a fine line between building up your resume somewhere else and settling down. Give yourself a deadline. You'll work for the next year or so, and then you'll hightail it out West. This is just a pit stop, not where you end up.

, If you’re just working away your life, spending the weekends drinking and in your pajamas, odds are luck isn’t going to come your way. Those who make it are constantly working and looking for the next chance to do what they love. Spend your free time monitoring want ads (like Craigslist), meeting people who may need your services, and getting your name out there. Opportunity is not a lengthy visitor.


Stay as busy as possible. This looks good on paper and gets you meeting as many people as possible. If and when those people make it, they'll already have your number. You can sleep when you're making the millions.

, If you want to make it in Hollywood, well, you’ve gotta be in Hollywood. At some point, you’re going to have to make the leap. It’s expensive and not nearly as glamorous as it’s pictured, so make sure you’re going in with a healthy dose of reality. But it has to be done; what better time to bite the bullet than now? It'll help you feel like your dream is coming true, too.


Alright, so ""Hollywood"" doesn't necessarily mean Hollywood. It means Culver City, Glendale, Los Angeles, Lennox, Inglewood, Hawthorne, and others. California is one of the most expensive places to live in the entire world and living in a smaller suburb will likely be cheaper than living in actual Hollywood.

, If you have the option to push mail at a talent agency, on a set, or for production company, take it. If you’re practically scraping the scum off the bathroom floor, take it. For starters, you need a job. What’s more, you’ll meet people and get a feel for the environment. Everybody starts somewhere, and those bills won’t pay themselves.


Harrison Ford was a carpenter on the set of Star Wars when George Lucas nabbed him for the role of Han Solo.It might not be as easy as that in your case, but it is a step in the right direction.

, In order to be taken seriously and to have less work on your plate, get an agent. They’ll get auditions for you and get your name out there – you just have to do the hard work of showing up and rocking it.


A good agent is free. Never pay an agent before you get a gig – they should only get a cut of the gigs they nab you.
There is sort of a catch-22 with getting an agent – they have to see you in something. So take whatever small gigs you can get and get them on tape. You can start creating a demo reel to submit to the agents you want. Apart from this, all you can really do is rely on word of mouth and networking., Is there a party on Friday that’s supposedly going to be hopping, but you only know one or two people going, and that’s only via Facebook? Go anyway. There will be drinking and laughter, and after a while, no one will remember that you’re a stranger. You’ll meet people, hear about their connections, and possible get a phone number or two to network with later. The more people you know, the better chances you have of getting recommended later.


For performers, this will help you get an agent, too. After a few beers, B-rated sitcom star Bobby Whatshisname throws you his agent's business card and says he'll give you a heads up. Every little bit counts, and if you have to do some schmoozing to get ahead, so be it.

, You’re going to hear no’s out your ears. You’ll practically be swimming in rejections. Even the most famous of celebrities have been told they’re crap at one point or another. In order to persevere and survive in this dog-eat-dog world, you’ve gotta grow a thick skin and still believe in yourself. You made it happen after all, right?


The life leading up to the life of a star is rarely glamorous. You'll likely be poor, hate your day job, and consider the littlest of victories huge. And they are! This is a tough gig, but you have to believe that eventually it'll pay off.

, How many people can you name who have made it and made it with their friends? Ben Affleck and Matt Damon? Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau? Often struggling actors, writers, and directors band together and inadvertently make each other famous. You’ll probably know dozens of people in your same boat. Instead of hoping they fail, jump on their gravy train – they could be your ticket to win it.


Keep in mind the people that helped you if and when you hit it big. They supported your dreams, so you support theirs, too, even if you've already made it. Hollywood is a surprisingly tight-knit circle, and getting in good with its residents is a wise plan for the future.

, You know all those no’s you’re drowning in? You can’t give ‘em the time of day. If you do, you’ll quit. Logic will take over, feelings of inadequacy will take over, and you’ll abandon this road you’ve put so much work into. You’ve gotta believe that you’re awesome that no one else has realized it yet. That's all there is to it.


Those that make it in Hollywood might be viewed as a little crazy by those that have never tried. Day in and day out is going to be rough until you start realizing that things are happening. You get an agent, you land an audition, you get a bit part in a commercial, and it keeps you going. It may not be much, but it's a sign. Let these little things keep you afloat.

, Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither will your career be. These things often take years. There are few souls who move to Hollywood and jump right into success. It's like any other career – you gotta work your way up the ladder. And if you dedicate yourself, you will.


Stick with it. You’re going to have times when you think about how great you were at accounting or how easy it would be to move home and live with mom. Those are just fugacious temptations that will go away. Be patient and stick with your resolve. Otherwise you'll just be left wondering ""what if"" for the rest of your life.

, When you do finally start getting gigs, work hard. Spend hours getting your lines down perfectly. Throw back six cups of coffee refining your script. Attach your computer to your side like its your Siamese twin and leave practically no time for eating and sleeping. Each gig that you do your best at may mean another gig down the road.


True, there will be glamorous red carpet moments, but it's work, too, after all – especially when you're just beginning out. You have to take the good with the bad. Putting in the work will make it easier to realize just how much you've earned this.

, You’re going to have people that tell you you’re crap, even when you're at the top. You’re going to have people tell you that you have to do it this way, that you have to suck up to these people, and that you have to jump through the hoops they tell you to jump through. But the truth? They’re all wrong. There is no one way to make it but to keep trying. Don’t listen to anyone, especially the naysayers. They’re just out to bring you down or to make a buck off of you. They don’t deserve a second of your time.


There will never be a time when everyone is a fan of your work. We all have different tastes, and that's a good thing. It makes the world diverse. So even when you're at the top, ignore the naysayers. They don't really matter anyway. You have your success and happiness – who needs them?

Learn and improve from every busking performance.",How to Make Money Busking (Street Performing)," Busking laws vary depending on location. Even different boroughs within a city can have different regulations. Contact your local authorities and ask what the busking laws are. You may have to get a permit, or you may be able to perform anywhere that isn't dangerous for pedestrians or on private property.Always follow the law. Buskers can get arrested for playing in unauthorized areas.;
, Walk-by acts are continuous, and you don't have a single audience the whole time. As people walk by, they may give you a tip in passing.Circle acts have a set beginning and end, and a steady crowd stands around your act in a circle or semi-circle.Most musicians perform walk-by acts.
Circle acts generally last 10-20 minutes. You can perform three or four in one hour.

, Busking is not synonymous with improvising. If you play the same three songs or perform the same tricks repeatedly, you will bore your audience. Before you busk, plan beforehand. Musicians should construct a tentative set list. Non-musical performers (like magicians, jugglers, or mimes) should plan four to five 10-20 minute acts to rotate between as their audience changes.An hour is the minimum suggested time. If you want to busk for long periods of time, you can plan an hour and a half or even two hours of material.

, You may love Baroque music, for example, but receive more tips from jazz or folk. Take listener requests, if asked. Scan the audience and choose music popular for their demographic. If you're not a musician, base your act on the audience you've accumulated. Magic shows for an older audience, for example, may involve more complicated illusions than one for children., The best busking spot is a relatively quiet place (so your act can be heard) with lots of foot traffic. You might choose, for example, a street corner, city square, outdoor mall, or farmer's market.

Avoid residential areas or suburban neighborhoods.
Choose a place based on your act. If you want to do a circle act, find a spot with lots of space. Musicians might look for an area with good acoustics.

, Once you've found your spot, prepare yourself a stage. Busking stages do not have to be elaborate. Put up a sign or banner, and write your name on it so people can look up your work later. Set up a microphone or speakers if needed.Don't sit down on the sidewalk to perform. People might mistake you for a panhandler.

, If you're shy or have social anxiety, step outside of your comfort zone. Don't close your eyes or look at the ground. Smile at your audience to appear friendly, and chat with them as they walk by. Acknowledge and thank tippers to show gratitude.Emotional engagement can work wonders. Put passion into your work: smile, laugh, and speak both loudly and clearly.Speaking to your audience directly will help them connect to you and invest in your performance., Don't sit down when you play or perform. Your audience will not connect with you as easily, and they may be less inclined to tip you. If you stand, people will spot you better as they walk by and they'll hear your act more clearly., Audience participation (especially in circle acts) can be a great way to engage passers-by. Ask for volunteers to help you perform a certain trick or sing a song with you. Kids especially like to volunteer, and their enthusiasm can be contagious.

It's okay to tease the audience a little, as long as no feelings are hurt.

, Treat your audience well, even if you draw the attention of a few hecklers. Get to know other buskers, and don't intrude on their busking spots. Stand up for yourself when needed, but always do so with kindness., Put up a sign that says ""Tips Appreciated,"" and set up an eye-catching tip jar. Hats, pots, baskets, or unusual containers all make great tip jars. Continuous acts keep their tip jars out constantly, but circular acts usually collect tips at the end of their act., Finding the ideal spot or location for your act may take trial and error. Some performers may find that their perfect venue is near a tourist attraction on the weekends, while others may have the best luck in the subway on a Tuesday evening. Try several different places and keep record of which spots give you the best results.

Holiday weekends are great for performing because people are in a festive mood.Stay safe! Choose a place that is well-lit and legal for buskers to perform at.

, Prepare business cards with your name and website or social media usernames to increase your platform. You can also bring merchandise like CDs to sell, so your audience has something to remember you by., A ""hat line"" is what buskers say while finishing a circular act to encourage tipping. Say it right before the finale so people stick around to see the most exciting part of the show. If you ask for tips after your finale, your audience may have already walked away.

An example of a hat line might be, ""Thank you, everybody! If you liked my tricks, you can leave a tip in the jar I'm passing around. Have a great evening!""

, Pay attention to your audience as you perform and monitor their reactions. Record your busking experience and what you learned. Write down what went well (like the location, a song you played, or your audience's favorite trick). Write down what you could improve.

One show won't give you an indication of your busking experience, good or bad. You might have just chosen a poor venue or missed your ideal timeframe.

Learn music theory.,
Improve your rhythm.,
Play with other people.,
Learn more than one instrument.,
Perform.,
Be expressive.",How to Be a Good Musician," Music theory can change the way you write/play music. It opens up your mind to all the different possibilities and options you have. Music theory is also universal, most musicians should know it. It will make things easier to explain. For example telling someone to play a C major chord is easier than telling them where to put each finger.;
, Keeping time is very important whether your playing with other people, or playing by yourself. Having bad rhythm will make the piece of music sound bad even if you are playing the right notes. You don't have to be metronomic, but as long as you can keep a tempo without speeding up or slowing down that's OK.

, Playing with other people will force you to stay on time. It will also give you experience and make you more confident in your abilities. And above all playing with other people is a lot more fun then playing by yourself. Joining a band will also be very beneficial.

, This will help broaden your horizons. If a guitar player was to start playing bass guitar, the guitarist would then start to realize the role of bass guitar. So the next time the guitarist has to write a bassline, the guitarist will have a better understanding of how to write a more effective one.

, Performing requires you to know the music that you are playing inside out in the event that something goes wrong. Most performances require you to memorize your pieces. Having a good memory will benefit you because you always know what to play. It will also allow you to have more confidence in your talents and music.

, It's one thing to learn the notes and rhythm, but it's another to express the music. This is probably the hardest thing to do, because expression is different for everyone. Try picking a slow song; they tend to have a lot of hidden meaning within the notes. After you get used to slow songs, try faster ones; they're a little harder because you need good speed, timing, and accurate articulation. But remember, too much expression will make you sound a little corny.

However, there are some general props that are used by many clowns, such as balls for juggling, balloons for making balloon animals, magic trick props if you're doing tricks, and any other silly props you can think of. You can start off with the traditional tools and become more original as you discover who your inner clown really is.


Get your music together if it's part of your act.






Part of your act may include putting face paint on children.






If ventriloquism is part of your act, then get yourself a dummy.





;
, You can buy authentic clown costumes from clown suppliers, but they can be a bit pricey, so you can start off with some colorful clothes, Halloween clown costumes, a colorful set of pajamas, or any funny-looking items you can find in a Goodwill or a thrift store. The expensive items can come later, once you are more established, so don't worry about those for now.You'll need a clown costume along with a pair of big, floppy shoes. These shoes can actually be the most expensive part of a clown costume, so try starting off with size 22 Converse or other overly big shoes that you stuff with paper towels at first.







, Contrary to popular belief, not all clowns wear face paint. Clowning is a style of comedy, not a style of makeup. Most clowns use greasepaint for their faces, since this kind doesn't wash off as easily as water-based paint or Halloween paint. If you do put on makeup, there are a variety of makeup styles you can try:Whiteface clown paint. This is the traditional face paint that you may think of when you want to look like a clown.






Auguste clown paint. This type of clown wears makeup that is a bit more flesh-toned.






Tramp or hobo clown paint. This face paint is a bit darker and sooty looking, because this type of clown is down on his luck.






Character clown paint. What kind of clown do you want to be? Mad scientist? Keystone cop clown? Your character will determine the color and style of makeup you use.







, Most clowns work for themselves, but some of them are part of a duo, a trio, or even an entertainment company. If you want a sidekick, or if you want to be a sidekick, then see if you can find a clown friend to buddy up with.


If you do, think about performance partner and what your relationships are to the audience. Thinking about status may be a good start.

, Get an idea for major comedy points you want to include, and work out the lead-up and other parts of the comedy. Thinking about problems that need addressing can be a good start e.g a hat that won't stay on your head , or a music stand that keeps falling over. A twist at the end may help, as can thinking about the rule of three (e.g mistake, mistake, success) in an unexpected way. It's almost like a play. If you're so minded, script your act before rehearsal! Here are some things clowns often include in their shows:


Making balloon animals






Miming






Juggling






Storytelling






Ventriloquism






Jokes







, If you want to be more of a magician-clown, then you'll need to work on learning some easy magic tricks and work your way up to being a magician all-star. Check out the variety of Magic articles on wikiHow, or take a course in magician training, if you're really serious about this aspect of the job.


Just remember that if you want to be a magician clown, you'll need more props, such as a top hat, wand, flashy handkerchief, and so on, and it could get costly.

, If you want to use slapstick - practice - there is almost nothing less funny than slapstick done badly. The best comedy will try to emulate some real life, such as talking about bosses, home life, and other things people can connect with. try to include jokes about things the likely audience will understand and appreciate!

, There is nothing a clown has to do. Unless you have a twist on the obvious, you should try to avoid the most obvious clowning tricks if you want to be successful. Here are some moves that you should generally stay away from:


Slipping on banana skins






Falling over






Chasing your sidekick around






Getting soaked in buckets of water







, Once you have your act together, you've scripted it and acquired the necessary tools, start practising. An ability to time the jokes just right, and the ability to make a smooth recovery if something goes wrong, is essential. First, try your act on your own and tape yourself to see how you can improve. Then, work your moves on a trusted friend. Open it up to your family or small group of children and see how you do.

, Before you can go off and try to find work, you need to figure out what type of clowning is best for your personality. This can determine how you alter your routine and what kind of clients you will work with. For example, you will do different tricks depending on whether you're working with hospital patients, children, or adults. You can do multiple kinds of clowning, of course, but you should always keep your audience in mind before you perform. Here are some places where you can work:Children's parties
Adult parties
Children's hospitals
Circuses

, Clown school used to be more popular, such as the Barnum and Bailey's clown school that was a big hit until the mid-90s, but you can still find some classes to take if you want to improve as a clown. Barnum and Baileys, for example, still offers a one-year clown school if you make the cut, though it does not have a permanent location., If you don't have time for clown school or if there aren't any clown schools in your area, you can still go to clown conventions to learn some tricks and moves from the great masters. The Clowns of America International web site, for example, advertises a clown camp in Orlando in 2014. Going to conventions is a great way to meet other clowns and to improve your skills.

, The CAI website also offers information about Clown Alleys, or places where you can find and learn from groups of other clowns. You can contact these clowns and ask if they wouldn't mind having a student. The best way to learn, really, is to find a clown mentor that is right for you. Remember that, just because a clown is great doesn't mean that he or she is interested in the same kind of clowning that tickles your fancy.

, If you want to make this a business, try to get some advertisements up around your local area. Contact your local newspaper and local venues to see if you can pay to put up posters and adverts. To really make it as a clown, you'll have to understand marketing and advertising techniques, especially on a local basis, to improve your chances of booking gigs and actually making a profit., Work a children's birthday party. See if a hospital needs a clown to fill a shift. Clown around at one of your friend's parties. Even working for a small audience will help you get your feet wet and to know what people do and do not like. This will also give you the experience to learn what to do for larger audiences, and to gain the confidence you need to truly succeed as a clown.


This is how you will begin to build a following. Even if you've only impressed the friend of a friend, that person may be able to get you your next gig.

, These groups or unions will give you more support, knowledge, and credibility and they are a great thing to add to your CV. If you know local clowns, ask them about alleys in your area, which can help you gain skills and network. On the national and international level, check out some of these prestigious organizations:Clowns of America International
World Clown Association
Clowns Canada
Clowns International

, Hopefully by now you have put together an act, started on the ladder to stardom, and (if you're really committed) have made some cash as well. With show business, the sky really is the limit! Keep working on juggling, acting, telling stories, doing magic tricks, or whatever it is that makes your show special.


Don't get complacent. There is always room for improvement.

, If you want to be the best clown ever, then you have to be able to know what your audience wants and how to give it to them. Here are some things you will have to work on to succeed in your career:Understanding of audience expectation of your performance's quality and authenticity
Ability to speak in public without fear
Ability to make children feel comfortable
Performing in a way that ensures the safety of your audience

, If you want to be a circus clown, then you have to build up years of experience first. But if this is the route you want to take, then you have to apply to be a clown in the circus just as you would in any other job application; you'll need to include your résumé, videos of your tricks, and to audition for the role if you are asked to do so.Auditioning for a circus, such as Cirque du Soleil or Barnum and Bailey's, is considered the big leagues of clowndom. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't work out right away.

But the more you know how to do, the more likely you'll be to wow stunt coordinators and to be perfect for roles that require multiple skills. If you want to be a stunt man, then chances are, you're already experienced in a field or two. Here are the most common skills that stunt men can possess:



Fighting: Expert level skills in boxing, combat, or a martial art.

Falling: The ability to fall from a variety of heights, some of which are over three stories high, and the ability to use trampolines.

Riding and driving: High-level skills as a precision driver of cars or motorcycles, or expert level horseback riding skills.

Agility and strength: Superior gymnastics or rock-climbing skills.

Water skills: High level skills in scuba diving, underwater stunts, or advanced swimming.

Miscellaneous sport: A superior skill level in tumbling, fencing, or wirework.;
, If you want to sound like you know what you're talking about when you start your career as a stunt man, then you have to know the terms associated with the career. If a stunt director starts talking about wirework and you have a blank look on your face, you won't get very far. Here's what you need to know:



Wirework: The ability to expertly use rigs, harnesses, and vests to perform aerial stunts, which include flying or falling action sequences.

Tumbling: Performing gymnastics feats safely without using specialized equipment. These include front and back handsprings, somersaults, shoulder rolls, break falls, dive rolls, round-off back and front handsprings, and cartwheels.

High falls: The ability to fall from three stories or higher, while landing on a box catcher or an airbag, without hurting yourself. You should be familiar with a variety of falls, such as twisting falls, headers, and step outs.

Swordplay: Skillfully using swords, foils, or blades while in combat. This includes fencing or choreographed fight scenes.

Horsework: The ability to ride horses skillfully and safely while performing stunts such as falling, jumping onto a horse, and engaging in swordplay while riding.

Air ram: A device that uses compressed air and hydraulics to catapult a stunt person into the air. It's usually used to create the effect of an explosion, propelling the stunt person through the air as he is flying forward, backward, or somersaulting.

, Though you don't need a bachelor's degree or formal training in any one arena to be a stunt person, it certainly couldn't hurt. You may already be a pro in certain areas from racing motorcycles to being a black belt in karate, but if you want to improve your skill set, then you should find a reputable school in your area, such as Rick Seaman's stunt driving school, which can help give you an edge.These programs will not guarantee you a job and some may cost a pretty penny, but if you need to hone your skills, this may be the safest way to do so.

, Though going to school to brush up on your skills or to gain new skills is a great way to improve your abilities and make yourself a more marketable and appealing stunt man, another great way to improve your chances of getting hired is to find a mentor. If there is a stunt man you admire, whether it's a stunt driver like Steve Kelso or Andy Gill or a Stunt Director like Spiro Razatos, then you would be very privileged to be able to get under his or her tutelage.This doesn't mean you should annoy famous stunt men, but that if you are around them or find a way to know them, you would benefit greatly if you could ask them for advice on improving your skills. Often, this part can come later, after you've gotten your foot in the door; you won't have much luck finding a mentor in the stunt business if you have no experience whatsoever, unless you have some powerful connections.

, If you want to be taken seriously as a professional, then you'll need to get an 8 x 10 inch black and white headshot. You may need to invest some money in a professional photographer, or be careful about finding a trusted and talented friend with a stellar camera, but it will be worth it. You won't be taken seriously if all you have is a selfie or a cheap Polaroid, so make sure to follow through on this part. A good headshot can help you look like a professional, and can also help stunt coordinators or producers see whether you have the look they want.A headshot is like your business card as a stunt man; if you don't have one readily available, then how do you expect people you meet in the business to remember you?

, You may think that you don't need a résumé to be a stunt man because so much of the work is physical, but that's not the case. You should treat your career just like any other, where a résumé is crucial to helping the people who are hiring you to figure out if you're good for the part. The most important thing is remember is that you have to be honest. Don't try to impress people by saying you have skills you don't really possess, or you will be in trouble -- and even possibly in danger -- if you're picked for the role. Here are some important elements that you should list on your résumé:Your height, weight, shoe size, and any other physical measurements
Your union affiliation (more on this later)
Film and TV credits (if you have any)
A list of skills or special abilities, such as rock climbing, scuba diving, boxing, or martial arts

, If you want to find work as a stunt man, then you have to join a union, so that you can be legally hired to perform in films, music videos, or television. In America, the two major unions are the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), which is the more prestigious of the two, or the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. In England, you will have to join the Join Industry Stunt Committee's Stunt Register (JISC); look into the guilds in your country if these do not apply to you.Getting into a guild is hard work. One way you can get in, if you're lucky, is to get waved in in case a stunt coordinator isn't able to find a person with the combination of skills and build that you have to do a certain job (for example, if you're four foot five and can climb a mountain).
Another way of getting in is to try to get work on a SAG or other union film as an extra for at least three separate days. Get an extras voucher after every day and turn in those three vouchers to make yourself eligible to join a union -- though this still doesn't guarantee that you'll get to join.

, If you get lucky, you can land a gig with a great headshot and impressive résumé on a non-union project. But if you want to hit the big leagues and find work on a union project, then you have to obtain a production list from the union you've joined; this will contain all of the local union productions that are shooting near you; you will have to sent the stunt coordinator your headshot, résumé, and a brief letter, and hope to get picked for the job.Even if you don't get picked, the coordinator will have your résumé on file for future gigs.
While you're waiting for a call, you should try to get some more experience on (union-only) sets, to get a feel for what the job is like.

, You may not land your first gig right away. Or you may get lucky and land your first gig, and then there's the months-long radio silence before you hear from a producer again. That's perfectly natural. This is an extremely hard business to break in to, especially if you don't have any connections, and waiting is part of the game. Though you should continue to put yourself out there, you should be prepared to find other work in the meantime, and to stay motivated to succeed, even if you haven't gotten a gig in a while.

, Being a stunt man is exciting work, but you may not be able to do it forever, whether you're becoming prone to injury, getting older, or just no longer wanting to be part of a risky profession. If you're tired of being a stunt man or a stunt driver but you've gained a lot of experience, then you don't have to quit your field completely; instead, you can find a way to take a more management-related role while still staying in the stunt world. Here are some other roles you can take on:



Stunt rigger: To be a stunt rigger, you should not only be an experienced stunt performer, but you should have an understanding of the mechanics of stunt equipment. You should have safety as your first priority, and will perform a variety of tasks, from testing and tearing down stunt equipment on the set to arranging landing pads for falls and positioning wires and harnesses correctly.

Stunt coordinator: This is the head of the stunt department, the person who works closely with the director to create the action sequences in the film, or even to suggest alternative stunt scenarios when it is necessary. The stunt coordinator designs the desired stunts, hires the stunt crew, manages the budget, and makes sure all of the stunts are performed safely.

Second unit director: The person in charge of filming the stunt scenes, as opposed to the stunt coordinator, who is responsible for staging the actual stunts. As the second unit director, you will film scenes of the stunt performers in action as well as exterior shots of the scenes which can be used in post-production. Although these directors may have experience in stunt work, then must also be experienced in filming and directing.

, You may think that your best chance of success comes from showing off, trying to impress the film crew, and boasting about all of your additional skills. Once you've become a veteran stunt man, then sure, you will have more leeway, and you may even be consulted as a stunt coordinator or producer, but when you're trying to get your foot in the door, it's important to be as agreeable as possible.


You want to be remembered as someone who is easy to work with. Why? So you can get hired again.
When you're following directions, it's important to be polite and reasonable when you interact with the crew. If you genuinely have a question about how a stunt should be performed, ask away, but don't nitpick everything that's happening or slow down the process.

, Being a stunt person doesn't mean falling out of a helicopter for three takes and then calling it a day. It can mean over 14 hours on a set, working nights, and staying mentally and physically alert throughout the process. This is a full-time job, and once you start landing enough gigs, you must be able to commit to the time that you'll need to succeed in your role. In the beginning, you may be juggling other work along with stunt work, but if you've hit the big leagues, you must be ready to give it your all.This means that you'll need endurance to succeed at the job. If you get winded after an our of fighting or feel ready for a nap after rock climbing for an afternoon, then you need to build up your mental and physical strength.

, If you're a true stunt man, then you won't be spending your life filming within a thirty mile radius of your comfy home, not even if you live in Hollywood, CA. You'll be traveling to the Caribbean to film a jet-skiing sequence. You might find yourself in Peru to shoot a rock climbing scene. You might even be in Germany for a high-speed car chase. This means long hours on airplanes, and needing to get over jet lag before you hit those jet-skiis. Sure, this will be exciting, thrilling work, but you'll need to be prepared for all of the travel it involves.As you get older, all of the traveling may become more difficult because you'll have to find a way to make time for your family, if you have one.

, Most stunt men are at the peak of their careers between their 20s and 40s, which means that you have to stay in the best possible shape during these years. This means not engaging in risky behavior, whether you're on the job or hanging out with friends, and avoiding overindulgence in food or drink, which can wear down your body and make you feel horrible when you show up to work. Eat healthy, get enough rest, and make sure to exercise as often as you can, doing a mixture of cardiovascular and strength training, so you're fit enough to do the job.Another way to stay strong is to continue to brush up on your skills, whether you're practicing karate or swimming.
If you want to stay physically strong, then you have to keep your mind strong, too. You can't let the dangers of the job get to you and you have to stay focused and positive if you want to succeed in the long run.

, Being a stunt man doesn't mean recklessly jumping out of three story windows, playing with fire, or crashing a motorcycle into a tree because you weren't careful. Stunt men have families, drive, and exciting careers, which means that they love what they do and want to stay alive to continue doing it. When you get training on how to fall without hurting yourself, drive without crashing, and swim without drowning, etc, you should heed those words carefully, and not go out of bounds to show off if it means risking your life.A study conducted by the University of Illinois at Chicago showed that there were 37 fatalities on film or TV sets between 1980-1989 by stunt men and women alone; a study by the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) showed that 4,998 of its members were injured between the years of 1982-1986, mostly because of stunts. This is a risky business, and you need to stay rational and focused if you don't want to become a statistic.
Something can always go wrong, on the set of a Harry Potter movie, Daniel Radcliffe's stunt double David Holmes was left paralyzed and suffered serious spine injures, after a test run for a flying scene went wrong. He is set to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair.
Even if you don't get hurt while demonstrating reckless behavior, you don't want to develop a reputation for being reckless, or no one will want to work with you. What producer would want the reputation of having a stunt man die or fall to serious injury on his set?
You need to work on your risk-management skills, not your risk-taking skills. Being a good stunt man is all about being safe, not risking your life.

Buy an acceptable jumping pole.,
Go to a pole vaulting pit.,
Hold the pole correctly.,
Place the end of the pole in the vaulting box.,
Stand on your left foot and drive your right knee into the air if you are right-handed.,
Run forward.,
Jump off of your left foot, using your right knee to drive yourself up into the air.,
Swing your left leg up to the top of the pole while keeping the right knee in the 90 degree drive position in an attempt to get yourself as upside-down as possible.,
Row through with your arms.,
Turn.,
Push off of the pole when you are at your maximum height.,
Fall Let the mats of the pit catch you.",How to Pole Vault," Length and the flex number (the weight it is made to be used for) of the jumping pole depends on the user's weight and height. Make sure that the pole is made out of a good material that won't break with the first jump. Remember, you're going to be resting all of your weight on this flimsy pole.






;
, Make sure the pit is built to safety standards.








, Right-handed people should hold the pole with their right hand on top, and their left hand should be between one and two feet below it. On a first attempt you should only hold the pole as high as you can reach when the pole is being held completely upright. Extend your right hand above your head. Left-handed people, do this vice versa.








, Make sure your hands are in the same position as before.








, If you're left-handed, stand on your right foot and drive with your left knee. Take three large steps backwards for room.








, To make it easier on the first few attempts simply keep your arms extended above your head. Take three running steps forward. On later attempts you can start the run up with your arms bent and the top part of the pole right above your hand resting on your shoulder ,later you can invert the pole, so that the end is up in the air and the top near the ground. During the three approach steps smoothly bring your right hand from it's initial position on your hip to it's final position above your head (as explained above). Be sure to keep your hand close to your body, bending your elbow instead of swing a stiff arm away from your body and then up. When you have mastered a three step approach and are confident with your vaulting ability the approach can be extended to a 12 to 16 step run-up.








, Jump off your right foot if you are left handed. You should move forward at a fast pace, with the pole providing more and more height. Run tall and jump off the ground,keep your left arm from collapsing into your body and let the pole flex.








, A good way to practice this is a one handed pop-up vault.








, Do this by bringing your top hand (your right hand, if you are right handed) down to your hip. This will give you additional height and keep you close to the pole.








, Up to this point your back has been facing the pit you are vaulting into. Now,pull and turn your hips around the pole. Initiate the turn by turning your right foot to the inside. As you pull your body should naturally turn around the pole so that your belly is now facing the pit.








, Your feet should still be vertical (almost like doing a one-handed handstand push-up off of the top of the pole). One of the most difficult techniques is keeping yourself balanced in a vertical position with your head and shoulders down and your legs extended directly over them. Beginning and most intermediate vaulters will make the mistake of letting their legs fall toward the bar and cheating themselves out of two or more feet of height. Stay vertical as you pull and turn! Be careful! Most devastating injuries in pole vaulting occur when the vaulter lets go of the pole too early and falls headfirst into the box.








, Don't attempt to land on your feet, as this can possibly lead to a sprained ankle. If possible land on your back.

Train.,
Choose an athletics track for best training results.,
Ensure you already have some sort of fitness base.,
Test and time yourself over the first week.,
Set Goals.Goal setting is imperative if you plan to stick to your workout regimen.,
Try interval training.,
Go on long runs.,
Set aside one day a month for preparation and sprinting.",How to Improve Results in Long Distance Events," It's as simple as that, in order to get better results, you'll need to train. 3-4 times a week is perfect, anything less and you won't be improving fast enough for results to be noticeable, too much and you could risk over training and 'burning out';
, If there are no tracks close by, a sports oval is good. Do not run in large areas that are over 1 kilometer (0.62 mi) long. Having a short (400m) track makes it easy to keep track of your progress.

, Do not start this plan unless you already have some sort of fitness.

, Run various distances ranging from 800m - 5 k. Write down your times and also your lap times. By keeping track of your lap times, you can see how well you run the distance and if you go out too hard or not hard enough etc.

, Without goals, your running will feel futile and pointless.

, That means shorter distance at or close to race pace. e.g. if your pr (personal record) for 1500m is 5:30 and you want to drop down to 5:00, you should run say 6x300m with each 300m in one minute (which happens to be the pace you need in order to run 5 minutes) with, say, a 45 second rest in between each 300m. As you get fitter and it becomes easier, reduce the rest until you can run the complete 1500m in the time desired. Do this for whatever distance is required and make up your own plan.

, Runs lasting 45 minutes to 1 hour should be done twice every three weeks. This will ensure your legs can stay the distance in any event.

, Results should appear within weeks and after a few months; your fitness should be through the roof.

Exercise your hamstrings and glutes.",How to Improve Your Stride," Time yourself running for 60 seconds. As you run, count how many times your feet strike the ground. Calculating how many steps you take per minute will give you an idea of what your cadence currently is and how much you need to improve. Most runners have a cadence of 150-170 steps per minute, while elite runners will often have a cadence of over 180.A stride is two steps—one by each foot. Divide your steps per minute by two to find your stride per minute. Most running analyses use steps per minute, but you may find strides per minute more convenient for your training.;
, You only need a few minutes of film. Find a track or a treadmill where you can run at your optimal speed. It is best to ask a friend or a coach to hold the camera for you. You can also try using a tripod, although it may not catch the full length of your run.

, You may need to watch the footage several times. Upload the video onto a computer or TV so that you can see your form in large detail. When reviewing the footage, pay special attention to your knee, head, and shoulder placement. You may compare your running form to professional and elite runners. You will need to correct any mistakes in form or style before you can start to improve your stride. Ask yourself:


How high do you drive your knees?
What is your posture like?
How fast are you running?

, Do you land on your forefoot, midfoot, or heel? While there is some debate on what is the best foot strike, it is generally agreed that you should avoid landing on your heel. You may need to reform your foot strike to a more consistent style.


A forefoot strike will cause the least amount of shock on your body. You land on the balls of your feet before rotating back on your midfoot or heel. Your foot will rotate forward again to propel your next stride.A midfoot strike spreads the impact throughout your foot. It will look like you are landing flat on your feet or that you are landing on both the ball and heel of your feet. A good midfoot strike will land on the outside of the foot.A heel strike can cause stress and injury. Your foot will land on the heel and rock forward to propel your body on the ball of your foot., If you do not have not a good form, you may not be reaching your full running potential. Each time you watch your video, look at a different part of your body, and see if you need to correct any mistakes.


Your head should be looking straight ahead, not down at your feet or at the track.
Your shoulders should be down and relaxed, not tight and scrunched up by your neck.
Your arms should be relaxed, and they should be moving backwards and forwards, not sideways. Keep your arms positioned between your chest and lower waist.
Your back should be straight. You should be leaning slightly forward, centered over your hips. You should not be leaning back., Different styles of running will require different techniques. Training is a highly individual process, and what works for some may not work for others. Understand what your needs are so that you can improve your stride using the techniques best for you.


Sprinters will want to increase their stride length. High knee lifts and hip exercises will be most beneficial.
Mid-distance runners may want to improve both stride length and rate. They will need to focus on glute, hamstring, hip, and core exercises.
Endurance runners may want a shorter stride length and a faster stride rate. They will want to work on core, glutes, and hamstrings.If you’ve had an injury, you may want to avoid widening your stride length, focusing instead on proper form and stride speed.

, Even when you are not running, you should try to keep good posture. This will naturally improve your form when running. When you stand, keep your back straight and your shoulders rolled back. Try to work standing up if you can to naturally strengthen your back muscles., Dynamic stretching exercises are a good warm-up for running. These increase your range of motion and help prepare your muscles for exercise.Dynamic stretches include:



Shoulder circles: slowly move your shoulders forward in a circular motion. Do ten times before rolling them backwards in a similar motion.

Side bends: Stand straight with your legs apart. With a straight arm, reach down the side of your legs before coming back to the center. Repeat with the other side of your body.

Hip circles: Put your hands on your hips. Make a circle with your hips, keeping your legs and torso still.

Leg swings: Balance your weight on your left side of your body. Swing your right leg back and forth rapidly. (You can balance your left hand on a wall if necessary). Do 6-10 times before switching to your other foot.

Leg bouncing: Brace your hands against the wall. Quickly bounce on the on the balls of your feet. Your heels should be lifting from the ground., Your arms are an underutilized force that will balance and push you forward. Strength training may be able to increase your overall energy, running economy, and endurance. Try to have two training sessions a week. Some exercises you can try are:



Bench press: Lie on a bench with two dumbbells extended above your shoulders. Lower one dumbbell to shoulder height, and slowly lift it back up until your arm is straight. Lower the other dumbbell in the same manner.Bicep curls: Hold a dumbbell in both hands. Stand straight with your elbows near your torso and your palms facing forward. Curl one arm up slowly. Wait a second before lowering it back down. Repeat with the other arm.Dumbbell squat to press: Hold a dumbbell in both hands at shoulder height. Slowly lower into a squat. Rise back up, stretching the dumbbells above your head. Your arms should be straight above your head. Lower the weights back to shoulder height before repeating., Core exercises will increase your energy and provide essential stability to your running. These exercises will often not just give your abs strength, but they can also strengthen your hips, glutes, and legs, which are essential components for a good stride. Some good core exercises are:



Plank: Lie down on your stomach. Lift your body until it is resting on your forearms and toes. Your body should form a straight line from your shoulders to your toes. Try to hold the pose for at least 20 seconds.

Bridging: Lie back on the ground. Your knees should be bent about hip’s width apart. Relax your arms on the floor. Squeeze your glutes. Lift your hips and pelvis off the ground. Your body should form a straight slope from your knees to your neck. Hold for 10 seconds before lowering.

Lunge with a medicine ball: Hold the medicine ball with both hands straight in front of your body. Lunge forward, bending the front leg and keeping the back leg straight. Move the medicine ball from right to left across your body before bringing it back to center., As you run, focus on driving your knees high up into your chest. Try to keep a steady pace at first so that you can focus on how high your knees can go. There are several exercises you can do to improve knee height.



Knee hugs: Stand straight with your legs slightly apart and your arms at your side. Beginning with your right leg, raise one knee as high as it will go. Grab the knee with your hands, and squeeze it towards your body. Release and slowly lower it towards the ground. Repeat with the other leg.Marching Drill: March at a walking pace around your usual running route. As you step up, drive your knees up as high as you can. The more exaggerated the movements, the better. Start slowly but build up speed over several sessions.Skip: Once you have mastered marching, try skipping around an exercise track. Skipping is more intensive than marching, and it will help you lengthen your stride at a faster pace. Focus on pushing yourself off, and use your arms to help drive you forward., The hips are an important area to strengthen if you want a longer stride. While core exercises can help you open and stretch your hips, there are certain exercises you can do that will specifically target your hips.



Deep lunges: Bend one leg in front of you while keeping the other leg stretched out straight behind you. Lower your body as far as it will go. As you rise, bring the back leg forward into a new lunge.

Hip flexor stretch: Kneel on your right knee with your left knee bent 90 degrees in front of you. Slide your left foot forward a few inches before stretching your hips forward so that your left knee is straight over your left foot. Hold for 30 seconds before switching to the other leg., Start with a slow jog. With each step, increase the length of your stride just a little bit. Soon, you should be leaping between each stride. Focus on propelling yourself off your feet and extending the back of your stride.High skips are another type of bounding drill. Push off or jump from one leg while driving the other leg up towards your knees. It will look like an exaggerated skipping or jumping motion. As you move forward, alternate between your legs., While it can be good to increase your stride length, you do not want to extend your stride too far. This can cause injury. Your foot should be landing beneath your body, not in front of your body. If your stride is too long, you may land on a straight leg extended in front of your body, or you may feel a harder impact on the foot.When you lengthen your stride, you should be focusing on lifting the knees and extending the back leg of the stride, not the front.

, Some runners find that visualization techniques can help them mentally focus for better stride rates. Try imagining that you are running on hot coals or on spikes. This will cause you to soften your steps and increase your turnover rate., Identify what your personal stride rate goal is. For example, if you are starting in the 160 steps per minute range, you might want to work your way up to 170. As you train continue to count your steps per minute. Try counting aloud to give yourself a beat to run to. Measure yourself several times to see what your average rate is. See if you can increase it by a few steps a day. It may take several training sessions to work your rate to a consistently higher level.

, Your hamstrings and glutes are important to develop if you want to increase your speed. Many exercises target both the hamstrings and the glutes. That said, hamstring injuries are common amongst runners. Make sure that you are practicing safe, proper techniques. Certain exercises can strengthen your hamstring while preventing injuryLeg curl: You can find a leg-curl machine at your local gym. Adjust the machine for your height and weight preferences. Lie flat on your bench against the bench and your legs beneath the weight pad. Curl your lower legs up, keeping your upper legs flat against the bench. Lower and repeat.

Superman exercise: Lie on your stomach. Extend your arms straight in front of you. Raise your arms, legs, and chest off the ground, and squeeze your glutes. Hold for two seconds before lowering. Repeat at least ten repetitions.Glute-ham raise: Have a partner hold your ankles. Kneel with your torso straight. Lower yourself towards the ground by extending your knees. Hold your hands out to catch the floor, and gently propel yourself back up. You may need to practice before you are able to reach the floor."

It is extremely important as a track athlete that you have very strong core muscles, as these play a huge role in running mechanics.One great way to strengthen your core muscles is to do a plank. To do a plank, begin by laying flat on your stomach on the floor. Then, lift yourself off the floor by planting your bent elbows on the ground directly under your shoulders, and lifting so that your toes are holding you up. Keep your back straight, and your abs engaged.
This will work both your abs and your back. Hold the plank for 30 to 60 seconds, and repeat one to two more times.

, Squats are excellent for developing the muscles in your butt and the backs of your legs. Squats can be done using your own bodyweight or you can add a barbell to make them more challenging. There are many different types of squats you can do to target different areas and keep your workout challenging. Remember that, regardless of the type of squat, your back should always be straight and your knees should never extend past your toes. Learn how to perform squats by reading this article: How to Do a Squat.


Practice single leg squats. When you are running, you are basically hopping from one foot to the other foot, but for a very long time, so it is important that you have a strong, balanced pelvis. , This exercise will target your glutes, which are the muscles in your butt. These muscles are very important in running. If they aren’t strong enough your body may try to rely solely on your hamstrings (the muscle in the back of your thigh), which will slow you down and reduce your endurance.Hold a dumbbell, a weighted plate, or a kettlebell in your right hand. Keep the opposite (in this case, left) leg planted firmly on the floor.Begin to hinge forward, bending at the waist. Keep your left leg planted on the floor, and allow your right leg to lift straight into the air behind you.You should feel the muscles in the back of your left leg, and your left glute begin to contract in order to support you. Be sure to keep your back straight and your abdominal muscles engaged in order to avoid injury.
Stop at the point you feel your muscles contract. When you feel the hamstring and glute muscle in your left leg engage, stop there and hold for a few seconds.Return slowly and carefully back to standing. Then repeat the exercise eight to 12 times, and then do it again using the other leg.

, Your hip flexors help drive your legs forward, and strengthening them can improve your speed and explosiveness.There are a number of ways you can improve the strength of your hip flexors — even a small improvement can make a major difference, especially if you are a sprinter.Exercises that strengthen your hip flexors include leg raises, decline sit-ups, and running and jumping with high-knees., Jumping rope and exercises like calf raises and box jumps can help strengthen your calf muscles, the gastrocnemius and the soleus.


Learn to strengthen your calves without equipment by reading How to Build Calf Muscle Without Equipment.
If you have access to a gym with machinery, you can try leg press calf raises, but remember the most effective sport performance enhancing calf exercises use your body weight. The calf press machine does nothing for balance and stabilizers which are critical for protecting the knee and ankle from twisting injuries.

, This is the most obvious, and most important way to get in shape for track season. Although you don’t want to overdo it, you do want to train enough so that your aerobic fitness will be tip top by the time the season starts.


Mix up your running, doing different things each day of your training in order to keep it interesting. For example, do sprinting one day and a longer distance run the next day.

, Whether you are a long distance runner or a sprinter, you should do some long distance running to improve your endurance. Long distance runs are important for improving cardiovascular fitness, and are also important for teaching your body to run efficiently.If you are a distance runner, this will be your main mode of training, but if you are a sprinter, you should still try to do at least one day of distance running each week.
For example, run five miles one day, and then run 3 miles the next. You will want to vary your distance so that you can focus on speed during the shorter distances, and then focus on endurance during the longer runs.

, Again, it is important to do sprint training regardless of whether you run for distance or for speed. Sprinting is important for teaching your muscles how to store and expend energy quickly and efficiently.If you are a long distance runner, then you can probably limit your sprinting days to one or two days each week, but don’t skip it! Sprinting will help you increase your speed, even over long distances.
One good example of a sprint workout is to sprint 400 meters as fast as you can, give yourself a one to two minute break, then sprint 300 meters, repeat your break, then sprint 200 meters, take another break (limit this one to a minute), and then sprint 100 meters. Repeat this circuit once more.

, This is a great way to improve your aerobic fitness, and it will also help to build the muscles in your legs. A really good place to do this running is at your local football stadium, as these usually have several rows of stairs.


Start with running (not sprinting) as quickly as you comfortably can up and down one row of stairs, then keep running to the next row of stairs. Continue this for 10 – 15 minutes, then repeat the set one or two more times. Do this with caution though! As you get tired you may not lift your legs as high, making it more likely that you will trip on the stair.
Alternatively, if you don’t have access to stadium stairs, you can also find a steep hill and run up that as fast as you can. Then walk carefully back down. Repeat this for 10 to 15 minutes.
Make sure to wear sunscreen if you are doing this on a sunny day.

, Not only will this help you build strength, it will offer a good method of stretching your muscles thoroughly. There are many types of yoga you can do. For a more gentle experience, you could try Hatha or restorative yoga. For a harder workout, consider trying Bikram or power yoga., Before you begin any workout, especially if it is an aerobic exercise, you should consider doing some dynamic stretching or dynamic warm-ups. Dynamic stretches should get your body moving and warmed up, putting the muscles you will be using through their full range of motion.Start with some simple moves, such as high knees, heel kick backs, then straight leg lifts forward, back, and out to the side. Try doing leg circles in both directions.
Big arm moves are very effective for increasing blood flow. Arm raises in front, out to the sides, triceps press backs, overhead reaches, shoulder circles, rowing motions, can all accompany leg moves and improve the warm up.

Stretch your spine. You can do this by rounding your back as you bend down to try and touch your toes. Stand up slowly and then extend your back in the opposite direction. Repeat this as many times as you like, ideally about five or six times.

Head and neck moves should be done after shoulders and should only be combined with spinal warmup moves such as rounding the spine and arching the spine.

, Regardless of what type of exercise you have done, spend 15 to 20 minutes stretching your muscles slowly and carefully. Stretching regularly can help improve flexibility, range of motion in your joints, and may decrease the risk of injury.Any stretching done before you run must be a dynamic stretch. Static stretches, in which you elongate your muscle and hold it for several seconds, should not be done as part of a warm-up. Doing so can reduce your performance.Remember to stretch your legs, back, chest, shoulders, and arms.
If you are outside, and it is cold, put on some warm, dry sweatpants and a sweatshirt while you are stretching to keep yourself and your muscles warm.

Have the right equipment.,
Know the basic telemark turn.,
Keep your hands in front of you and close together.,
Have your upper body always face downhill.,
""Gimme the ball!"",
Put as much weight as possible on your rear ski (the trailing ski as you're carving a turn).,
Focus on ""stepping back"" with your trailing ski into a turn, instead of consciously ""stepping forward"" with your leading ski.,
Try to feel as if you're pinching a pencil between your ribcage and your hip as you're making your turn.,
Another good exercise to promote better carving is ""big toe, little toe"": try to think about pushing down on the big toe of your leading ski and the little toe of the trailing ski as you carve a turn.

,
Try exaggerating your knee bends.,
Keep your rear (trailing) ski under control.,
Work on your pole placement.",How to Do Better Telemark Ski Turns," You'll need a good pair of modern telemark skis, cable bindings, and plastic boots. Even if you prefer more traditional gear, such as leather boots and skinny skis, you'll be doing yourself a favor by renting some sidecut skis and supportive plastic boots this time around. You won't regret it!;
, This wikiHow is for those who've already had some training in the basic turns and can link at least a few slow turns.

, Too many telemark skiers try to turn with their arms spread out. Having your arms far apart makes it harder to keep your upper body facing the fall line. By keeping your hands close together and in front, as if you're carrying a cafeteria tray, you're encouraged to keep your upper body facing downhill, even as your lower body turns to carve your skis.

, It allows your body to coil and uncoil--like a spring--as your skis carve the turns and release between the turns. It makes it easier for you to release your skis and bring them around into the next turn.

, Your posture and hand placement should feel as if you're crouching down slightly, asking your teammate on a basketball team to throw you the ball: hands out in front, knees bent, agile and loose.

, That's right: not your front ski that seems to be doing all the carving, but your rear ski. If you feel as if you're trying to put 80 to 90 percent of your body weight on your rear ski, you're probably in reality putting around 40 to 50 percent of your weight on that ski. It seems counterintuitive, but it works. You will get that rear ski--the one that's always shaky on you, or noodling around, or skidding off on its own--under control, and your turns will quickly improve.

, This not only helps you control your rear ski, but makes you feel less nervous on steep terrain--you're not lunging forward into a scary void, but tucking your leg safely back into the mountain. The end result is the same: your leading ski will be in front of your trailing ski as you carve your tele turn.

, This will help you carve with your lower skis. This will help you get your skis carving better: the top half of your body will be more upright, but your lower half--hip and legs--will be angled to better help you carve your skis.

,, Many skiers think they're bending their knees a lot, but in fact they're not: their front leg is stiff. Telemark skiing is kind of like acting--a lot of people think they're overacting when in fact they're stiff and timid. The same goes for skiing: try overacting a little and it'll help you loosen up.

, In addition to trying to push down on that rear ski, another exercise that can help is to take an extra glove or hat and pinch it between your legs as you're skiing. This forces you to keep your legs and knees closer together so you don't feel so ""strung out.""

, Keep your poles out in front of you, hands together, and pretend as if you're ""shifting gears"" with a gearshift lever, with a slight tap into the snow, as you allow your body to come up a bit to unweight your skis and shift into your next turn.

"

Relax.,
Get into a rhythm.,
Allow yourself to slide after each glide.,
Keep your poles near you.,
Improve your balance.,
Keep your knees slightly flexed.,
Crouch a little for descent.",How to Improve Your Cross Country Skiing Technique," This is the most important technique. If you feel tense and worried about falling over, this will influence your skiing technique and hamper your ability to ski smoothly.;
, Classic cross country skiing is not about racing; it is about enjoying the great outdoors at a pace that allows you to enjoy the scenery around you and to appreciate the feel of skiing. Follow the technique of kick, stride, glide:


Kick: ensure that the centre of the ski connects well with the snow; keep your hip and weight forward over the ski;






Stride: take the stride with the ski opposite the one making the kick and shift the opposite hip;






Glide: launch into the glide as you take the stride.







, Allow at least one second of sliding at the end of each glide forward before kicking into your next ski stroke.

, Do not try to reach right out in front of you every time you glide or you will tire quickly and waste energy needlessly.

, Getting a good sense for balancing and using different parts of your body strength to achieve this balance will improve your skiing. To practice this, try:


Skiing without your ski poles. This will improve your strength as well as your balance. Choose a flat and well-groomed part of the trail to practice this. And be careful not to lose your resting poles in the snow - ensure they are well secured.






Try going down a very small hill on only one ski. It might sound silly but it will give you a very good sense of trying to balance yourself well.







, This helps to diminish the risk of injuries. As a bonus, this also allows you to react more quickly to obstacles when they come across your path.

, Try not to lean forwards too much. The slightly crouched position helps you to balance better for descending and will help to minimize damage if you do fall.

Pack liquids.,
Eat frequently to replenish energy and to encourage you and your fellow skiers to take appropriate breaks.

",How to Pack Food for a Day of Cross Country Skiing," It should be one that sits well and does not cause you to overbalance. You may wish to share the supplies around with others skiing with you; that way you can carry lighter loads all round.;
,, Place the soup in thermos flasks for a hot lunch; it is also possible to put sausages (meat or veggie) in thermos flasks for a hot meal. Lunch should also include some fruit (apples, oranges etc.) and some of the supplies from the high energy snacks.

, These can be nibbled on even while skiing but especially should be consumed when you stop for breaks every hour or so. Suggested ideal high energy snacks include:


Salted Crackers
Breakfast cereals, place in small Ziploc/sealing bags; add nuts if liked
Chocolate, especially dark chocolate and fruit/nut combinations
Nuts
Dried fruit
Energy bars
Hiking mixes

, You will need to keep up your liquid intake during the day. Put beverages in different thermos flasks; if possible, colour code (bottle/tape/decal etc.) to make it easy to know which beverage is in each thermos. Ideal beverages include:

Stomp the landing and ride away.",How to Land a Switch 180 on Skis," The vital thing to remember here is to start small. The smaller and the easier, the better. Your first jump should be more of a mound that air can be taken off of.;
, When you are doing your normal jumps, take note of how steep the take off is, how steep the landing is, and how much speed you must take to clear the jump.

, Start at the required distance up the run up, and begin to run down to the jump backwards, all the while looking back, turning your head in the direction you intend to spin. This is absolutely crucial to the jump.

, At the transition to the jump, you will probably be feeling nervous, and your instinct will be to stop, or rotate. Do your best to ignore this instinct.

,, As soon as you've turned, spot your landing, and don't take your eyes off it. There is a basic, elementary rule in freestyle skiing. That is, look where you want to go and chances are, your body will follow.

,, Congratulations, keep practicing and soon you'll be landing corked 540's!

Choose your wax.,
Lay your skis out.,
Apply base cleaner.,
Let the skis air dry and brush.,
Melt the wax.,
Allow dripped wax to cover a majority of the surface.,
Apply more wax where needed.,
Let the ski cool.,
Scrap off excess wax.,
Brush your ski.",How to Wax Skis1," Before purchasing your wax, consider what kind of temperatures you will be skiing in. If you can't predict the temperature of the slopes you're headed for, or the area you will be skiing in has a wide variety of temperatures, use an all-temp wax. Otherwise, consider getting temperature-specific wax that corresponds to the temperatures you'll be skiing in.Most entry level waxes are hydrocarbon wax. Fluorocarbon wax is another option, which will give you better performance and speed, but comes with an increase in price.;
, Make sure it is a flat, well lit, and well ventilated workspace. If you don't want hot wax dripping on the surface it's on, lay down some newspaper or plastic sheeting first. Use either a vice or heavy wooden blocks to hold down the tail and tip of your ski, so it doesn't move while you work.









If your skis have breaks, you'll need to get them out of the way. Do this by retracting them with your hands and then wrapping a strong rubber band around them and the tail piece, to keep them in place at the base.

, Base cleaner removes dirt, dust, and old wax. Apply it to a towel or cloth and wipe the length of the ski until the whole surface is covered.









Don't go overboard with the base cleaner. You don't want to wax your skis until they're completely dry, so just a small splash of cleaner will do.

, Remember not to touch them, or wipe them down. Once they're dry, if your skis look particularly smooth, you can use a brass brush to create a slightly rougher surface. This will allow the skis to absorb the wax more efficiently. Just brush with a brass brush using moderate pressure.








, Hold the hot iron above the ski with the tip pointing down, and touch the wax until it melts, and drips onto the skis. Drip a line or two of wax along the length of the ski. You can use any iron for this, but be warned that some wax will stick to the iron, so don't use an iron that you intend to later use for clothes.









You can also buy wax-specific irons that have the advantage of being more consistent with their temperature.
It's important to be wary of making your iron too hot, as wax that is too hot can damage your board. For most conventional irons, the appropriate temperature is somewhere between the lower end of the ""wool"" setting and the higher end of the ""synthetics"" setting.

, Use the iron and gently move up and down along the length of the ski, making sure to spread the wax until it coats the entire surface. Always keep your iron moving as to prevent overheating an area of the ski.








, Keep going until the entire surface has been covered by a thin layer. If there's an area with no wax, you can apply the wax to the iron quickly and touch the iron to that area.








, Let your ski sit in room temperature until it is completely cool to the touch. This usually takes around 30 minutes. Err on the side of caution and don't rush to the next step too quickly., Wax works best as a thin sheen, not a thick layer. Use a wax scraper, or thin plastic edge to remove excess wax. Make sure it is not metal, and that it will not cut into the ski. Angle the scraper in the direction that you're scraping and push it from tip to tail.









Remember to file your scraper regularly to keep it sharp
Scrape all the wax off the edges of the ski as well.

, Brushing will remove even more wax, leaving you with a ski that has just a fine layer of wax in the pores of the base. Use a soft nylon brush or a fine horsehair brush, or both, to brush your ski. Brush from the tip to the tail for five to ten minutes.If you're expecting wet snow, use a nylon brush, as wet snow skiing is improved by a more varied base structure. If you're expecting dry snow, use a fine horsehair brush, as wet snow skiing is improved by finer, smoother base structure.

Use only a pool table brush.,
Brush with straight strokes.,
Start brushing in the center.,
Vacuum up the piles you made.,
Vacuum the entire table.",How to Clean a Felt Pool Table Top1," Brushes made for pool tables have soft bristles that are gentle on the felt. Never clean the felt with an abrasive brush because the felt is delicate. Brush the table regularly, at least once a week.Pool table brushes can be bought at pool table supply stores, recreation and hobby stores, some big box stores like Wal-Mart or Target. They can be ordered online from various vendors, too.
In most cases you will pay around $10-$20, but you will use the brush often enough to make it a worthwhile purchase.;
, Anytime you brush the felt of a pool table, use quick and short forward strokes rather than circular motions. Brushing the felt in a circle only moves the dirt around and damages the felt. Use light strokes rather than hard scrubbing strokes., Brush the dirt outward to the edges of the pool table. Brush the dirt into a lines or piles so you can vacuum it up. Once you have done that, brush the table again from one end to the other to get anything you might have missed on the first pass over the felt.


Don’t brush the lines of dirt all the way under the bumpers because this will make it harder to vacuum up. Make the lines a few inches from the edge of the table.

, Use either a handheld vacuum or a standard vacuum with a hose attachment. Don’t use the vacuum brush attachment because it may be too stiff. Be sure to vacuum carefully under the bumpers where dirt and dust are more likely to accumulate.Use a narrow nozzle attachment to get under the bumpers.

, Use a wide rectangular attachment and run it from one end of the table to the other in long strips. Don’t run it in circles. Use light pressure rather than pressing it down hard into the felt. Make sure to get the entire table to remove as much of the accumulated dust as possible.


Be sure that your vacuum does not have too much sucking power as it can actually pull at the fibers of the felt and cause more problems. If you have to use a strong vacuum, don’t put it directly onto the felt to reduce some of the force.

Set a budget.,
Select a one-piece cue for home use.,
Buy a two-piece cue for travel and competitive play.,
Pick a cue that is the right length for your height.,
Hold the cue in your hand to feel the weight.,
Choose a comfortable wrap.,
Look down the length of the cue to judge its straightness.,
Choose a tip.,
Take practice shots on a pool table.,
Opt for the stick with the least vibration within your price range.",How to Choose a Pool Cue," A good pool cue is not worth going into debt over, so be honest with yourself about how much you can afford to spend on a cue. Having a specific price limit in mind will help you be more selective about what cue you choose. For a quality cue on the low end of the price scale, plan for about $100.Factors that affect the cost are the material the cue is made of, wrap types, and size. If you are above average height and need a longer cue, you may pay more.
Professional cues can cost $500 or more, but a cue like this is not necessary for a casual player.;
, One-piece cues do not come apart, so they are not meant for travel. For a home pool table, you don’t need a cue that is made to travel. One piece cues tend to be a little cheaper, and they are the best option for home use.


It’s not that one-piece cues can’t be taken somewhere, but it will be inconvenient to take a nearly five foot stick in your car with you.
A potential disadvantage of a one-piece cue is that they are more prone to warp over time.

, If you are buying a pool cue so that you can play in tournaments outside of your own home, it’s wise to buy a cue that can be broken down into two pieces. These typically come with some kind of carrying case to make travel easier.You can still buy a two-piece cue for home use if you find one that fits you well, but it isn’t necessary.
A benefit of two-piece cues is that if the shaft begins to warp, you can buy a new shaft and retain the butt of the cue.

, Standard cues tend to be 57 inches for one-piece cues or 58 inches for two-piece cues, but children or people of below average height should opt for a 48 inch or 52 inch cue. Players over 6 foot, 5 inches tall may need to special order a cue that is up to 61 inches long., Pool cues weigh between 17 ounces and 21 ounces, with most players preferring either 19 ounce or 20 ounce cues. The weight affects your shot, so it’s important to choose a weight that you can easily use.Most of the cue’s weight is in the butt end because the butt is thicker than the shaft. If you test the cue and it feels too heavy in your back hand then opt for a lighter cue.
Short people tend to want a lighter cue because a heavier one will cause them to lower the butt and raise the cue’s tip during the shot. This results in not connecting solidly with the ball.
Some players prefer a heavier cue for breaking and a lighter cue for skill shots.

, The wrap is the part of the cue that you hold with your back hand. Since this is the part of the cue that you have the most skin contact with, you want to be comfortable. Wrap options include leather and linen, but some cues may not have a wrap at all.If you tend to have sweaty hands when you shoot pool, you definitely want a grip rather than bare wood or fiberglass. Your best options are Irish linen or leather which are both good for absorption.
Rubber grips are also available but you want to make sure that the rubber is of a high quality and feels smooth and dry without any stickiness. Rubber wraps might deteriorate faster than leather or linen wraps.
This is not something you can choose just by looking at it. You need to hold the cue in your hand and choose a wrap that feels best to you.

, Hold the butt of the cue at eye level and stare down its length. Slowly spin the cue to see around the whole surface. Look for any abnormalities in the cue. Only buy a cue that is perfectly straight.Most pool cues are manufactured to a high standard, so it’s unlikely that you’ll find a new cue that is crooked, but it is still good to check.
It is sometimes recommended to roll the cue along a flat surface to see if it rolls smoothly, but this is not always a valid test as you can’t tell for sure if the surface is perfectly flat.

, Tips come in soft, medium and hard. Each tip type offers a slight difference in play. Soft tips are great if you put a lot of spin on the cue ball. Hard tips tend to last longer but are less capable for ball spin. Medium tips are fairly standard on new cues.Soft tips tend to misshape and wear out faster, so if you do not want to keep an eye on them and perform more frequent maintenance, don’t get a soft tip.
Hard tips are more prone to glance off of the cue ball when you strike it off center. If you typically shoot more toward the outside of the ball, a hard tip is not your best option.

, If you are buying from a store that has tables set up, you should test the cue you choose before you buy it. Get into proper shooting position and take four or five shots with the cue.If the store does not have tables set up or they won’t let you practice, ask what the return policy is so that you can play a game or two with the cue before you make a final decision.
You won’t be able to tell if a cue is right for you unless you play with it.

, Listen to the sound the cue makes hitting the ball, and feel the vibration in your hand. If you hear a loud click when you strike the ball, you will probably also feel a strong vibration. A softer pop sound means less vibration.


Higher end cues will make more of a soft pop sound when they hit the ball and this corresponds to less vibration running through the stick into your hand.
Vibration affects the smoothness of your shot, so you want to find a stick with low vibration.

, If they are, teach them how to use the poles properly, and how to put the pole straps on before you go on any run.








, There are many different types of ski lifts. For a chair lift, remind them to wait behind the line and then go as fast as they can before the next chair comes around.








, Different ski areas have different criteria for beginners, so make sure that the run doesn't have anything you might call steep or icy. You might want to check it out before you take the beginner up there.








, They can either ""snowplow"" by pointing their toes together, or simply turn uphill, which will always work.








, Demonstrate, so they can follow your tracks in the snow. Have them turn, and stop, for the rest of the run, unless they feel that they can try to make 2 turns, then stop.

Apply the wax to the ski directly.,
Polish the paste wax in.,
Use a soft nylon cloth or brush to wipe the surface of the ski.",How to Wax Skis2," Make sure it is a flat, well lit, and well ventilated workspace. Use either a vice or heavy wooden blocks to hold down the tail and tip of your ski, so it doesn't move while you work.








If your skis have breaks, you'll need to get them out of the way. Do this by retracting them with your hands and then wrapping a strong rubber band around them and the tail piece, to keep them in place at the base.

, Base Cleaner removes dirt, dust, and old wax. Apply the cleaner to a towel or cloth and wipe the length of the ski until the whole surface is covered.







, Remember not to touch them, or wipe them down. Use a soft metal brush, or a fine horsehair brush, and brush off any oxidation (the white and gray areas on the surface of your ski base).








, Use the applicator included with the wax. Make sure to cover the entire surface until it looks slightly wet. Try to keep the wax layer as thin as possibly, while still covering the whole surface.








, Use whatever polishing tool that came with your paste wax to polish the ski. Vigorous polishing will generate some heat, allowing the wax to adhere to the ski better., It just takes a few steady swipes down the length to smooth the layer of wax. This will remove excess wax, ensuring the best performance on the snow.








Finish with a finer brush. Use a soft bristled brush as desired to finish the surface. Only a swipe or two down the length is enough.

Place a dry, white towel on the spill immediately.,
Blot the spill with a white towel dampened with water.,
Use vinegar to lift stains.,
Use a pool table felt cleaner.",How to Clean a Felt Pool Table Top2," Lay paper towel, or a white fabric towel, flat on the spill. Don’t press down or you might push the spill into the felt. Replace with dry towels multiple times until the majority of the spill is absorbed.The most important thing is to clean the spill up as soon as it happens to reduce the time it has to soak into the felt and the table board beneath it.

, If you spilled something besides water, gently dab at the spot with the damp towel. Rinse the towel multiple times to pull up as much of the spill as possible. Don’t apply too much pressure as you dab at the spot.Never scrub at the spot because this will mess up the felt.
After you have blotted the stain away with water, you can dab it with another dry towel to help it dry out faster, then allow it to air dry.

, If blotting the stain with water does not sufficiently remove it, mix a solution of vinegar and water at a ratio of 50/50. Dip a cloth in the solution and dab at the stain again. The vinegar will break the stains chemical bonds better than water. Rinse the cloth and dab repeatedly as needed.


Vinegar is a less harsh solution than chemical cleaning products so it is safer for felt tables.

, If blotting the stain with a damp cloth does not completely remove the effects of the spill, use a cleaning product. Only use a cleaner that says it is specifically for pool table felt. Carpet cleaners and other stain removers can damage the felt worse than the spill did.Only use cleaners as a last resort if the spill is bad and can’t be blotted away.
Seek help from the manufacturer or a professional pool table dealer to determine which product you should use.

Chalk your cue away from the table top.,
Cover your pool table when it’s not in use.,
Keep anything that isn’t pool equipment off of the table.",How to Clean a Felt Pool Table Top3," People often carelessly chalk their cue over the top of the table, but the fine grittiness of chalk can slowly wear away the felt. Keep the table top clean by always chalking your cue off to the side of the table rather than over the table’s surface.Don’t be afraid to tell guests that you don’t want them to chalk over the table. They won’t think about it if you don’t tell them, and it’s your table so it’s okay to have rules.

, Pool table felt attracts animal hair from shedding pets. Dirt and dust get into the felt, so keep it covered whenever you aren’t using it to prolong the life of the felt.Pool table covers are often included in the purchase, but if you don’t have one, it is a worthwhile investment to protect your table.
Even if you don’t have a cover and don’t want to buy one, lay a clean sheet, tarp, or blanket over the table which will still keep it cleaner than being uncovered.

, Never set food or drinks on the table. Never hold cigarettes or cigars over the table. Place some stools, tables, or shelves near your pool table to avoid setting things on the table. Set ashtrays near by if you have smokers playing on the table.This rule applies to anything that does not belong on the table, including but not limited to messy kids toys, pets and pet supplies, chemicals and cleaning products, and dirty clothes or shoes.
Preventative measures will keep the table clean so that you don’t have to do more work than necessary.

You can get started on the edging while waiting for your skis to warm up.;
, Clamp the skis securely to a vise at a comfortable work height, on their side with the top of the ski facing you. If you don't have a a vise, place two chairs facing each other and weigh them down with heavy objects on their seats to make them stable. Lay the skis across the top of the seat backs, and fasten them securely with bungee cords. Make sure the skis are completely stable before you continue.


You can put small pieces of cardboard between the skis and the vise clamps to prevent scratching.

, Use brake retainer bands or large, thick rubber bands to pull the ski brakes up and out of the way of the ski edges.

, This is the edge between the base of the ski and the side. For most purposes and ski models, this should be at a 1º angle. While you can sharpen this edge in the same way as the side edge, described below, there is a higher risk of damaging the skis by scratching the ski base. If the base edge has become dull or in need of reshaping, getting this done at a ski shop is recommended. If you do this yourself, sharpen the base edge before you sharpen the side edge, using the same tools and process described below.

, Run your finger along the side edge of your skis, between the upper surface and the side. If you feel irregular nicks or rough patches, of if you see rust along the edge, file those areas down with a wet diamond stone, gummy stone, or bastard file. Hold the tool flat against the edge and push in long strokes over the rough patch, in one direction only. Repeat until the edge is mostly smooth.


If your edges are already sharpened, don't run your finger along them, or you could cut yourself. Wear gloves or just use the stone a few times without testing.

, For the average skier, this should be done roughly once every seven ski days, or whenever it feels like turning has become more difficult. You can get this done at a ski shop, or do it yourself:


Purchase a special ski file from a ski shop, along with a side edger that holds the file at a 1º angle (or a 1.5º or 2º angle if recommended by the ski manufacturer).
If you haven't done this before, use a black felt tip marker to draw a line along the edge. This is a useful guide for beginners: file away this line, but no further, and you should get a sharp edge without overdoing it.
Place the file against the side edge of the ski. Hold the side edger vertically, so the file will press against the edge at the required angle. Push the file into the ski edge at constant pressure to keep it flat, then push along the length of the ski in long strokes. Repeat, pushing the file in one direction only, until the entire length of the skis has been filed about 20 times.
You can file tip to tail or tail to tip, as long as you stick to one direction.
Test how sharp your edges are by using them to scrape off a bit of your fingernail. The less pressure you use, the sharper your edge.

, Reposition the skis so the base is horizontal and facing upward, in preparation for waxing.

, Rub the base and edges of the skis down with a rag or soft-bristled brush to remove dust and debris. If there is a great deal of crumbling old wax, use a base cleaner or wax solvent from a ski shop.

, If the base of your skis has noticeable gouges, you'll need P-tex candles to repair them. Gouges that expose the metal beneath may need more serious repairs from a ski shop. These candles burn very hot, so wear heat-proof gloves and remove all flammable materials from the area before you begin.


Hold the P-tex candle over the gouge and light the end of the candle with a lighter.
Drip the P-tex wax into the gouge until it is filled, or touch it to the gouge for more accurate filling. Take care not to spill this anywhere else, as the wax can be tough to scrape off.
Let the wax cool for at least an hour, then scrape it flat using a wax scraper (see the end of this section for more information on scraping.)

, Different waxes are suitable for snow at different temperatures, so check the forecast for the location where you'll be skiing next. Typically, a cold weather wax is suitable for temperatures under 20ºF (-7º C), medium wax is best for conditions between 20 and 32ºF (-7º to 0ºC), and warm weather wax should be used in temperatures above 32ºF (0ºC).


It's better to err on the cold side. If you use a wax for too warm a temperature, your skis will become sticky and won't glide nearly as well on the snow.

, A waxing iron, which has no holes in the base, does a much better job than a regular clothes iron. If you do use a regular clothes iron, you will not be able to use it for clothes again, and there is a higher risk of damaging your skis. Set the iron to the minimum temperature setting and give it a few minutes to warm up. Once it's warm, run it along the ski base once or twice to warm up the ski.

, Hold the bar of wax against your iron to drip a generous amount of wax onto the ski base, moving in a zig zag pattern.


Stop if your wax smokes, and unplug the iron for a few minutes to cool it down.

, Push the iron over the wax in long, steady strokes, moving lengthwise along the skis. Always keep the iron moving, as even a couple seconds in the same spot can burn your ski base and ruin it. Repeat until the wax has melted into one smooth surface.

, Wait at least one hour for the wax to cool. For best results, leave the skis overnight.

, A hard plastic ski scraper works well, and is the safest option for beginners, since there is little risk of damaging the skis. A metal scraper or even a wide razor blade will work, but can easily scratch the ski base if you aren't careful.

, Once the wax has cooled, it's time to scrape the wax down to a thinner, flatter surface. This can take significant time and effort for beginners, but it will greatly improve the ski's performance on powdery snow.


Hold the scraper with both hands and start at the tip of the groove, holding the scraper at a 45º angle to the base. Starting at the groove ensures that a slip will only nick the wax on the base, not the base itself.
Pull the scraper firmly toward you, along the length of the groove. Flakes of wax should come off as you do this. Repeat until very little wax comes off.
Repeat for the rest of the base, scraping off excess wax with even pressure. While you can remove all the wax, leaving a thin layer on the skis will help the surface last longer before it needs retuning.

, This is a somewhat controversial step that comes down to personal preference. It may make your skis glide more smoothly, but try them out without this step before you make the change. If you do decide to detune the tips and tails, place a regular sharpening stone against the 2–3 inch (5–7.5 cm) section past the ""shovel"" or ""tail"" where the ski swoops up. Run it vertically along this section of the edge, dulling it enough that you can see a light's reflection on the edge. Repeat for all edge sections near the tips and tails.


This will also reduce the chance of cutting yourself on the ski edge if you hold it by the end.

, Restoring a little texture to the ski may improve performance. If you expect icy or hard-packed conditions, a horsehair brush or copper brush works well. If you expect soft snow or just want to brush off irregularities in the wax, use a nylon brush instead. Either way, brush along the base of the ski a few times to make shallow, visible streaks.

, Take some runs around the jump, at faster than normal speeds. Practice a quick check turn to learn how to scrub your speed after landing. This is probably the most important skill to have in jumping as you will most always land with a good bit more speed than you expect.

, Good skiing posture is relaxed, bent at the knees, elbows in tight, looking forward and ahead, and hands in front of you as if your carrying a tray. The goal is to lower your stance (center of gravity) without bending at the waist, but by bending your knees and lowering your rear. It's like your sitting on a bar stool that is 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) shorter than standing. Keep your back straight and don't hunch or slouch your shoulders forward.

,,,, Maintaining your speed (constant velocity, and not accelerating or decelerating) is crucial to a good takeoff and successful landing. You'll be more stable, relaxed and focused when you carry constant speed.

, This is called spotting your landing and is key when you start trying Tele Heli's. Look at it, stomp it and stick it. Don't be passive, but get proactive and make your skis stick.

,,, To carry your speed, drop into your Telemark stance or better yet, scrub your speed with a solid check turn.

Set up the table properly.,
Decide which player will break.,
Alternate between red and colored balls to earn points.,
Pocket the rest of the colored balls in the correct order.",How to Play Snooker1," In order to secure victory in a game of snooker, you have to end the game with a greater number of points than the other player. This means that you should try to secure as many points per turn as you can. Snooker can be tricky to get the hang of at first, but with time you’ll learn how to place your shots to run the table and make the best of each turn.There are 22 balls total used in a game of snooker: 15 red, 6 multicolored (yellow, brown, green, blue, pink and black) and a single white “cue” ball, which is used to pocket shots. The point value of each ball is as follows: all red balls =1, yellow = 2, green = 3, brown = 4, blue = 5, pink = 6 and black = 7
Players score points every time they successfully sink a ball. By the end of the game, every ball must be in a pocket for there to be a winner. Because of the player's ability to pocket colored balls repeatedly during the opening stage of the game, a winning score will rarely be below 50.;
, Before you can begin playing, the balls must be arranged in the right configuration. Each of the colored balls has a specific location on the table. The 15 red balls are arranged in a triangular formation at one end of the table, with the pink ball directly in front of the point of the triangle and black ball a few inches behind the red balls. The blue ball rests in the center. The yellow, brown and green balls are lined up horizontally on the breaking end of the table.Whichever player begins the game will break from the end of the table opposite the cluster of red balls.

, Flip a coin or come to an agreement on who will shoot first. This player will be responsible for breaking the formation of balls. For their opening shot, the player will position the white cue ball behind the line of yellow, brown and green balls. They will then aim to gently dislodge a red ball from the cluster, officially starting the game.Unlike in pool, where the object of the break is to scatter the balls across the table, a snooker break should be conservative. That way, your opponent won’t have the advantage of multiple shots should you miss.The cue ball can be placed anywhere within the D-shaped semicircular section of the table.

, Points are scored by sinking the right balls in the right order. The active player will attempt to pocket a red ball first. Once sunk, red balls remain where they are. The player will then aim for any of the colored balls, which are returned to their designated spot on the table after they’ve been pocketed. Continue the game in this manner, going back and forth between red and colored balls, until all of the red balls have found their way into a pocket.A player’s turn is over if they miss a shot.If a player scratches (pockets the cue ball by mistake, or fails to hit a single colored ball) or shoots a ball in the wrong order (for instance, two colored balls in a row), it’s considered a foul. Typically, they lose their turn, and in competition there may also be a point deduction.

, After all of the red balls have been pocketed, a player can close out the game by consecutively sinking the remaining colored balls in order of their point value. In this stage of the game, the balls no longer go back to their original position. If one player misses, it becomes the other player’s turn. The game is over when there are no more balls on the table.Following the red balls, the colored balls must be deposited in this order: yellow, green, brown, blue, pink, black.
Since missed colored balls stay on the table in the final stages of the game, it becomes a free-for-all to see which player can snag the most points.

Take a comfortable grip.,
“Bridge” the cue with your non-dominant hand.,
Move the cue in a smooth, straight line to shoot.,
Use a precise stroke to place the balls into pockets.,
Use extensions to assist with difficult shots.",How to Play Snooker2," Grab the cue near the bottom of the thick, weighted end. The closer to the end you grip, the more control and extension your shots will have. Make sure your hand placement is comfortable and secure to prevent the cue from drifting when you’re aiming.Snooker cues tend to be somewhat heavier and have narrower tips than the cues used in other forms of billiards. With a slender tip, the player can manipulate the cue ball more precisely.
How high or low you choose to place your hand on the cue is mostly a matter of personal preference.

, Lay your non-shooting on the table and use it to guide the cue as you shoot. Most people prefer to use either an “open bridge” (lining up the cue across the groove of the thumb joint) or a “closed bridge” (enclosing the end of the cue between their thumb and pointer finger). Bridging helps you steady the cue as you strike the cue ball, allowing you to place your shots with more precision.Use a solid bridge to keep your cue from wiggling around during your stroke.Elevating your bridge by lifting the bottom of your hand off the table can enable you to pocket balls that are too close to the rails or other balls.

, In one tight, controlled motion, draw your shooting arm back a few inches and thrust it forward, hitting the cue ball in the upper part of its center. Keep your elbow relaxed and close to your side. Try to make your movements as fluid as possible. A jerky or halted stroke will most likely be inaccurate.Practice shooting straighter by bouncing the cue ball off one of the rails and seeing how closely it returns to the tip of your cue., Sink balls by shooting them straight for the pockets, or striking one side of the ball so that it rolls in at an angle. You can also use the rails, or the edges of the tables, to bounce balls into pockets on the same side of the table you're shooting from. The balls will be in many different positions throughout the game. Take some time to line up your shots every time it's your turn at the table.Keep your eye on the ball as you line up your shot, and don’t let your shoulders come up until you’ve completed your stroke.
Calculate the angle you need to strike the ball in order to knock it into a given pocket by aiming for the point on the ball that's directly opposite the pocket's opening., Because of the size of a snooker table, and the number of balls cluttering the table, there may be times when it’s impossible to make a successful shot using the standard technique. In the situations, an extension tool such as a ""rest"" (also known as a “bridge”—not to be confused with the hand position used while aiming) or ""spider"" will come in handy. Rests resemble normal pool cues with the exception of an arched stand at the end. The player’s cue can be fitted into this stand, which takes the place of the bridging hand for steadying shots.A rest is a valuable aid for making shots that would otherwise require you to lean across the table.
The spider extension has a higher arch, and should be used in situations where the cue ball is too close to a ball or group of balls to give you a clear shot.

Take your time.",How to Play Snooker3," Red balls are worth 1 point each. The remaining colored balls are worth an increasing number of points in sequence. Remember, these balls can be pocketed multiple times before the end of the game, which will help you quickly drive up your score. The fixed position of the colored balls means you should always have a clear shot at one, no matter where the cue ball is on the table.Players should either keep score mentally or have a pen and paper nearby to record the number of points earned after each turn.If the losing player’s score is so much lower that it’s impossible for them to close the gap by the time all the red balls have been cleared from the table, it’s customary for them to forfeit to the winning player.

, As you assess the table, make it your goal to sink a red ball that will leave you with a follow up shot at one of the colored balls. Keep in mind the value of each ball and go for the ball that will earn you the highest number of points whenever you can. Use an appropriate amount of power for each shot so that the cue ball comes to a stop as near as possible to the center of the table. This way you’ll always have an unobstructed path.The ability to use one shot to set up the next is the hallmark of a skilled snooker player.

, In general, it’s best not to take unnecessary risks. By staying composed and opting for modest, well-executed shots, you can keep your turn going longer, putting you in control of the table. Look over the entire table and determine what your best option is before trying to pocket a ball at a distance or angle you’re not sure you can make.The closest shot will usually be the easiest.
Avoid sharp angles or bank shots that require you to use the rails. The small size of the pockets makes it more likely that you’ll miss.

, Snooker tables are quite a bit larger than standard billiard tables, and, to make it even more complicated, the pockets are slightly more narrow. For this reason, you should always pace yourself when picking, lining up and taking your shots. Being hasty or getting overly excited about scoring could cost you the shot, and if you’re playing against an experienced opponent, one missed shot could mean the end of the game.


Regulation snooker tables measure 12’ (3.6m) long by 6’ (1.8m) wide, whereas most pool tables are only 8’ (2.4m) long by 4’ (1.2m) wide.Additionally, the pockets on a snooker table are about 1.5 (roughly 3.7cm) inches smaller than those on other playing surfaces.

Get a warranty whenever possible.",How to Buy a Pool Table," Pool tables run the entire gamut from small, cheap toy tables meant for kids to learn on, to elaborately designed tournament size tables. The huge range of designs and quality levels means a wide range of prices. You don’t need a top of the line model for your kids, but you don’t want a cheap wobbly table for serious practice, either. If you intend the table for serious, consistent play, shop accordingly.Cheaper tables can be a good option for many people, but pay attention to the fact that they may only last a few years. If you want something that will last a long time, think of buying a better table as an investment in your family.
The purpose of your table will be the first guide in deciding what pool table to buy.;
, Deciding which room is important mainly due to size constraints, but which room the pool table goes in has other effects too. Putting it in a basement, garage, or game room that is away from your main living area can be a good idea due to the noise of playing the game. However, if you want to purchase an ornate table, it can be a centerpiece that brings the room together.Some people worry about putting a pool table in an upstairs room or finished attic, but most tables do not weigh enough to cause problems. For example, an average model may weigh about 1000 pounds, which is only as much as 4-5 grown men.
If you have a large living room with a TV and seating concentrated to one half of the room, the pool table could help balance the room by being placed on the other half.

, Find out how long and how wide the room is and be sure to write it down so you have a record for later. Pool table sizes are typically made to “regulation size,” which means that the length is 2x the width, i.e. 8 foot tables are 4 feet wide. Make sure the room you want to put the table in can accommodate it, including extra room around the table.Plan for 5 extra feet on each side of the table to give you room to maneuver the cue stick when shooting. Not accounting for this extra space will making actually playing on your table really hard.
For example, an 8x4 foot table needs a room that is 18 feet by 14 feet to give you enough room on all sides.

, Pool tables can range from a few hundred dollars to over $10,000, so it’s important to know your budget. For a pretty basic model made of low-quality materials, expect to pay about $500 on the low end or up to about $1000. For a mid-range model constructed of quality materials, you’ll probably pay around $2000-$3000.If you just want something fun for the kids that will last a few years, you will definitely have some cheap, lower quality options. If you want something that will last most of your life, you will be looking at the more expensive models.
The materials the table is made of will be the primary factor that affects price. Whether it is solid wood or a veneer, slate or particle board are a couple of the main material choices. Surfaces that aren't slate can warp as they age while a slate surface will stay level and won't wear down.
A reasonable baseline for a medium quality table is about $1500-$2000.

, Although sporting good stores and even department stores often sell pool tables, you will most likely get someone who doesn’t know much about what you need. If you want to buy something in the quick and easy way, this is probably fine, but if you want to get a quality table and know what you are getting, a specialty store will be best. Go to a hobby store or leisure store that specializes in rec room features like pool tables. You’ll be more likely to get some with specific knowledge to help you pick out the right table.


If going to a specialty store is not a viable option, have an idea of some specific brands and tables you want before you go. Once you get to the store, see if they have what you are looking for. If not, take note of what they do have and research those options specifically to make sure they are up to your quality standards.

, To make an informed purchase, you’ll want to ask some specific questions about the pool table you are thinking about buying. Find out what material it is made out of, what the bracing system is like, what the tabletop is made of, what cloth is used, what the cushions are made of. The best materials will cost more, so keep this in mind, but you also want something that will last a long time.In stores where the employees are not experts on pool tables, ask them if they have any information about the materials of the tables you are looking at. They should be able to get you something that will tell you about the manufacturing specifications.
The best materials are solid wood frames, slate playing surface, and rubber cushions.

, After you have visited a store or two and found a few tables that you are interested in, do extra research on those specific tables and find out the manufacturing specifications to see if it is what you want. It is also good to find user reviews to see if people tend to like that specific table or if people have had a lot of problems.Since purchasing a table will most likely be a significant investment, you want to give the research due diligence so you can feel fairly safe your money is going to a quality product.

, If it is within your budget, hiring someone who knows about handling and installation of pool tables is a good idea. You don’t want to risk breaking it in the move or putting it together improperly. Making the sure the table is sturdy and level is important and you may want to leave it up to a professional., Many tables come with a warranty that covers repairs for basic wear and tear on the cloth and cushions, at least. Since you are making a sizeable investment, it is a good idea to pay the extra amount for a warranty. You don’t want to spend all that money and have something go wrong within a few years and be stuck with a worn out table and no options to fix it.

Look for information on programs' late-season injuries, winning and losing streaks, and post-season playing history, which may indicate how a team approaches high-pressure elimination games.


Look for teams ranked really high who have been badly blown out in a loss during the regular season — these teams are statistically unlikely to win it all. Highly-ranked teams who have suffered a blowout loss of double-digits are statistically less likely to win it all.
Look for teams who score high on basketball analytics. Sites such as kenpom offer a purely objective look at teams based on different metrics. Of course, these sites can't measure intangibles, but looking at them can be a good way to figure out which teams may be better, or worse, than they actually appear.
Don’t limit yourself to one particular site. National news may not have access to local details, while regional information can carry a heavy hometown bias.;
, The running joke among office pool participants is that the person with the least knowledge of the sport always wins the March Madness pool. While it can happen- and is extremely frustrating- there’s really no advantage in being ignorant. A lot of luck goes into the games themselves, but having good background information will give you an edge. You’ll start to see which players step up in big games, which coaches have proven track records and who can’t win away from their own arena. This knowledge will come in handy.

, Take seeding, or a team's rank, into account, but don't be a slave to it; there are often upsets, most notably in the number five to number 12 match-ups in the first round. Use your bracket's point system to maximize your gains, as some award more points based on the winning team's initial seeding.


Know the trends. Entering the 2008 tournament, No. 1 seeds are 92-0 against 16s. Even if you think that a No. 16 will win this year, the odds say that you're probably wrong. It's not that you're not brave; it's that it's just not worth taking that sort of risk.
In fact, don’t risk taking any team above the 12 seed in the first round unless you're absolutely sure it's a mismatch. If you pick a 13, 14, 15, or 16 seed to win in the first round, you’re picking against a team that (based on seeds) should be going to the Sweet 16 as long as they take care of business.
However, also realize that 12 v. 5 and 11 v. 6 games are upset city. Usually at least one of each will win, so be on the lookout for which ones you think can make it past the first round.
Know that 10 v. 7 games are hardly upsets and 9s actually have a winning record over 8s since the beginning of the 65-team era.
Ignore rank completely starting in the Elite Eight. One study has shown that the tournament's last three rounds are statistical toss-ups., Pay attention to teams' rebounding statistics, which indicate a team's ability to judge shot quality and capitalize on opponents' mistakes with second-chance points and fast breaks.

, Study teams' offensive stats; free throws and three-point shooting can be important factors in closing games and in overcoming deficits quickly, while assists can indicate the ability to create opportunities and adjust to opponents' defensive weaknesses, as well as the capacity to work well as a team.

, Focus on teams that can play both a zone and a man-to-man defense, and therefore adapt easily to the variety of teams they might face during the tournament.


Look at teams who can execute a full-court press. Full-court press is a little more popular in college basketball than it is in the pros, but it can translates to a couple more steals and fast-break points per game.

, Try to find out the picks other people in your pool are making and deviate when reasonable; choosing an unpopular team might seem daunting, but if they win, so will you. Remember: no risk, no reward.


Be conservative about picking first-round upsets. While gloriously satisfying when they work, they often cause you to eliminate a team that in all probability will go several rounds. Save your upsets for the second or third rounds.
There's usually one dark horse team that goes completely unnoticed by the national media until they blow through the tournament and upset a No. 1 or No. 2 seed on their way to the Final Four. Study past dark horse teams, their coaches, their metrics, and make a judgment about their intangibles.
In 2010, the dark horse team was Butler, who entered the tourney as a 5 seed. In 2011, the dark horse team was VCU, who buzzed into the Final Four as an astonishing 11 seed.



, Unless your favorite team or alma mater is a powerhouse, don’t throw away logic to show your allegiance to it. If you can’t bring yourself to pick against your team, don’t fill out a bracket. You can root for them to win it all (that would be a much better memory than winning your office pool anyway), but don’t pick them to go all the way if you don’t really believe it’s going to happen.

, Fill out several different brackets with slight differences. That way, the bracket that you lost in a pool of friends will not be the same bracket that you use in a pool of colleagues. Many people fill out close to a dozen different brackets to increase their chances of winning.

, When in doubt, go with your gut. And most importantly, root from your heart – the tournament is more fun that way!


When you win, consider using the money to take everyone out for beers, or some other way to show you are smart enough to be an individual achiever but generous enough to be part of a team.

, The people after the leader should be straight behind him, and about 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m) back so that if the leader makes any sudden turns or stops, the people behind him will have time to react. Another, more efficient position (i.e. it maximizes the effect of drafting), is to offset your front wheel from the leader's rear wheel by a few inches, but trail within 1 foot (0.3 m). For example, if there is a headwind, position your front wheel so that it slightly to the side of the leader's rear wheel, not directly behind it. In fact, the wheels may even 'overlap' by several inches (when observed from the side). The photo above shows this very technique - the second person is less than a foot behind the puller, but offset by several inches.

, The puller (i.e. the person in front), will indicate that he/she will fall off, and then give one or two strong kicks to clear the pack (in case any followers overlap his/her rear wheel). Then s/he will veer sharply to the left or right, and then slow down or coast to the back of the pace line. The new puller should then resume at the same pace as before, or pick it up slightly.

The objective is to score more goals than the other team by putting the ball in their net. Each team has 11 players working together to move the ball and defend against attacks, but they cannot use their arms or hands to do so. The key rules to know include:


Each team has one goalie, who is allowed to use his/her hands to defend their goal, but only in the boxes around their goal.
A goal is scored when the entire ball crosses the entire goal line and is within the frame of the goal.
While light contact is accepted, a team of 3 referees is on the field to enforce the rules and make sure the players are attempting to attack the ball, not the other team.;
, One of the first things that confuses new soccer watchers is the clock. Unlike most other sports, the clock doesn't count down to zero, it counts up to 90:00. The game is broken into two even 45-minute halves with a 10-15 minute break in the middle. The clock also never stops, and the game only ends with the referee blows the final whistle (usually 2-3 times in a row).


This is so the game doesn't stop unexpectedly. Soccer is all about flow, and if the clock was being constantly stopped, started, and checked like in football/basketball then the game would take forever.
The game doesn't stop right at the 45' or 90' mark. Rather, the referee adds ""stoppage time"" to account for when the ball was out of bounds, a goal was scored, subs were made, etc. This means the actual game might stop at the 93-minute mark. Most TV broadcasts will show you how many extra minutes are being added in the corner of the screen as halftime or the end approaches.

, A soccer pitch is a simple rectangle. There are a few extra marks, but the essential ones are all intuitive and easy to read.



The Center Circle is where play begins. The ball is placed in the center middle of the field and the starting team gets to pass it. The other team cannot enter the circle until the ball has been touched.

The Goal Box Also known as the penalty box or the 18-yard box, this is the rectangle on either end of the field in front of the goals. The goalie can only use their hands in this area.

The Touch Lines are the long sides of the field. If the ball crosses over this line completely than the last team to touch the ball gives it to the other team for a throw-in.

The Goal Lines The two end lines of the field. If the ball crosses this line and is within the fame of the goal, it is a goal. If it crosses the line, but not in the goal, then it is a goal kick or corner kick, depending on who touched the ball last.

, A foul is when a player makes illegal contact with another player on the other team by hitting, tripping, or kicking them. However, there is a lot of physical contact that is never called. Figuring out what is a foul and what isn't is one of the most difficult exercises in soccer, because there are few clear cut ""infractions"" to call like in football or basketball. The best way to remember a foul is to ask yourself -- did the player ""play the ball,"" meaning did they make contact with the ball, or did they ""play the player,"" by pushing/hitting/tripping the other player to win possession? FIFA defines the type of fouls as:


Kicking, or attempting to kick, the other player.
Tripping, or attempting
Jumping/charging at someone
Striking, or attempting
Punching, or attempting
Tackling
Spitting
Holding.
Handling the ball., This rule gives a lot of people consternation, but it is actually pretty straightforward. It simply states that a player cannot receive the ball from a teammate if they are behind the last defender. It is easiest to see with an example--


USA Attacker Alex Morgan runs past the defender, leaving just her and the goalie between herself and the goal.
Alex's teammate Megan Rapinoe who is in front of the defender Alex just ran by, passes Alex the ball. Alex is offside, and the referee blows the whistle to stop the game.
This rule is only complicated because of the speed of play, and several important tweaks to the rule. Still, they are straightforward:

If Alex does not touch or play the ball,' but is still in an offside position, she is not offside.

If Megan passes the ball, and Alex runs into an offside position to get it, she is not offside.' What matters is where she is when the ball is passed, not where she gets it.
If Alex and Megan are on their defensive half of the field, then they cannot ever be offside.

You can be offside on a shot or missed pass, too, if you get the ball before anyone else touches it. You cannot be offside if the other team passes or shoots the ball., If there is a foul or someone is offside, then play is restarted by a free kick awarded to the opposite team. No person on the other team can be within 10 yards of the ball before it is kicked, at which point normal play resumes.


If the ball goes out over the sides of the field it is restarted by a throw-in, which must be done with both hands, over the head.
If an attacker misses the goal and it crosses the end line, the goalie gets a free kick from their goal. If a defender kicks the ball out over their own end line the offensive team gets a free kick from the corner of the field., A yellow card is basically a warning, telling the player that their foul was careless, reckless, or excessive. A red card is far more serious, as it means the player is immediately ejected from the game and their team is forced to play with one less player for the rest of the game.


Two yellow cards in the same game, for the same player, always leads to an automatic red card.
Some infractions, like violent play, intentionally fouling or using your hand to stop and obvious goal, and swearing or threatening the referee, are automatic red cards."

Soccer is about flow, the give and take between teams as they try to figure each other out and attack weak spots while simultaneously defending their own. Soccer is much more about tension and rapid, sudden changes of pace and momentum then constant scoring. Goals are incredibly difficult to score, making each one a huge, special moment many minutes in the making.


Consider goals the culmination of a long attack -- like a battle being fought and contested in the trenches before one side makes big, successful push.
The more you understand about soccer, the more enjoyable it becomes beyond just flashy goals. Soccer is too organic, creative, and fluid to be broken down into individual plays.

, A soccer game consists of hundreds of small challenges and individual battles. It could be a wing player attempting to slice and dice a defender or a striker jockeying to win a header in the box. These individual battles, more often than not, determine the entire game. An attacker, for example, could be barely getting by his defender before getting tackled. But if you notice him/her getting more and more shots off as the game continues, you can tell he's beginning to get the upper hand. All it takes is one goal for the battle, and the game, to be decided.

, How do the individual players move, attack, and defend to aid their team. What are they doing when they don't have the ball? This is where games are won and lost, because all 11 players need to be working together no matter where the ball is.



Defenders. Do they give the other team space, or follow them everywhere? Do they stay close to home, or do they roam up on attack? A fast and attacking defender like Philip Lahm or DeAndre Yedlin is often the most exciting player on the field, winning a tackle and then taking the ball right back up the field on an attack. Weaker teams or defenders give the offense lots of time and space, waiting for a 2nd defender to join them instead of attacking on their own.

Midfielders. What do the players in the middle of the field do? This is where the tempo of the game is dictated, and they are the most important tactical players on the field. Are they going out wide or backward a lot? If so, they're likely probing for holes in the defense, sitting back and waiting for chances. Midfielders that dribble, attack, and pass forward a lot are trying to push the team forward for a goal, exposing their defenses by pressuring the other team to respond quickly to their attacks.

Attacker/Striker. Are they checking backward often, getting the ball and passing it quickly? Are they holding far up the field, using size and speed to get the ball, turn and shoot? Are they running onto passes often then putting moves and tricks on defenders to win space? An attacker is there to create havoc for the defenders, even when they don't have the ball, and these match-ups are often the most crucial.

, Managing the field on the fly is the secret weapon of a good soccer team. Passing is not always used directly to attack the goal. Rather, it is used to force the other team to move, shift, and adapt, potentially making a mistake and leaving a hole open. The basic tenet of soccer tactics is manipulating the other team to give you space in front of the goal for a shot when you're attacking, or closing down space so that they other team can't move forward when playing defense.


Notice how many balls are played to players on the run. This is because they are running into open space. They need to get the ball before a defender joins them and closes down the opening.
Is a team ""bunkering in"" by placing all of their defenders near their goal? This is used to prevent goals, especially if they have a lead. It can, however, lead to lots of free shots from farther out which will crack the facade of a defending team.
Watch the defense of a great team, like Italy, to see how a team masterfully controls space. You'll notice that they move as one consistent line, eliminating pockets of space in front of and behind them as a unit.

, Much like defensive patterns in football, soccer teams have general patterns for their players that greatly impact their style of play. Formations are always written from the back upwards, excluding the goalkeeper. So a 4-4-2 would mean there are 4 defenders, 4 midfielders, and 2 attackers/strikers.


The ""classic"" formation, a 4-4-2 is a solid, well-rounded strategy that has been used for decades. That said, it lacks in creativity and is often used for defensive or counterattack-oriented teams.
A team's formation says a lot about their strategy going forward. Do they have 1 striker and a big midfield? If so, they're likely looking to control the center of the field and run players up into space on the wings. Are they sitting back with 5 defenders? Where players are placed tells you how the team wants to attack and defend.

, Your appreciation of soccer will shoot up incredibly once you notice not only what teams or players are doing, but why. How do the tactics, match-ups, and pace of play come together in a good team? How are they attacking (along the sides of the field a lot, through the middle, by hitting big huge crosses up the field?) and how successful are they? Do all of their passes go through one player, or is everyone on the field touching the ball?


It can help to watch how the best teams in the world play a cohesive, recognizable game. Brazil is known for flash, talent, and speed. Italy is known for slower play and stalwart defense. The USA is a quick, counterattacking team that tries to make the most of it's limited chances against better teams with lightening-fast attacks.
If you watch a lot of American sports, think about each attack like a play in football. Whereas a one football team might focus on the passing game to be effective and another the running, a soccer team might rely on the wings (sides) to attack defenders and put crosses into the box or a few big players to muscle out and attack up the middle. The only difference is that soccer plays are fluid and organic, not chosen ever 15 seconds, so strategies are constantly evolving.

, They are beautiful contests marked by near misses, technical brilliance, passionate players, and non-stop, commercial free push and pull. Tactics and substitutions are dissected with chess-like precision, good teams fail to find the goal when they should have 5 goals already, and underdogs can sneak a goal in even after 85 minutes of constant pressure. Soccer is about 2-3 large climaxes in the midst of an intense game, not constant scoring, and is best enjoyed as such., The best way to catch the soccer bug is to be in the stands. You can feel the collective rise and falls of emotion from your fellow fans, see both team's tactic happening across the entire team, and you'll learn a few colorful chants in the process. Like most sports, soccer is best enjoyed in person, when you can really get swept up into the game.

Watch soccer year round by switching between many different leagues and tournaments.,
Find out which national leagues are currently in season.,
Choose a team or league to follow to get invested in the scores.,
Watch out for the major club tournaments.,
Follow your country's national team in major world tournaments.,
Follow soccer blogs, teams, and accounts to be in the know about upcoming games.",How to Watch Football (Soccer)3," Soccer is on year-round, as there are so many different leagues, tournaments, and teams across the world that you can almost always be sure of finding a game. While the availability of certain games depends on where you live and your TV provider, following your favorite teams is getting easier and easier in the online era. Moreover, the widespread nature of soccer means that almost every country and area will have a team to watch.


If you want to watch a game, but can't find it on TV, search for the game and date, plus the word ""streaming"" in your internet browser. Many soccer blogs will post all of the different ways to see the game.
Check out your local teams, including semi-pro teams. Much like baseball, soccer players and teams can move up and down in the rankings from season to season and even become national stars after several years. The rankings and leagues are fluid, and the enormous global market means players move frequently.

, Just about every country on the planet has a soccer league, and while most of them play through the winter months, many of them are staggered in order to make room for international tournaments later in the year. These teams are colloquially known as ""clubs.""



The English Premier League, generally considered the best league in the world, plays from late August to early May. La Liga (Spain), Seria A (Italy), Bundesliga (Germany), and Ligue 1 (France), the other major European leagues, all run on similar timelines.

Major League Soccer, America's league, runs from March to October. Liga MX, the Mexican league, runs in both the summer and winter.

, All sports are more fun if you have someone to root for. Pick a team or league based on whatever feels right to you, whether it is your hometown, has your favorite player, or simply seems like a fun team to root for. Even individual leagues have their own intricacies, quirks, and unique facets:



The English Premier League is where all the best players go because it has the most money. The play is crisp, tactical, and fast, and there are a lot of teams that can compete in any given game.

La Liga, the Spanish League, is fast and flashy. The players are technical and the game is beautiful, and the top clubs, like Barcelona and Real Madrid, are among the best in the world every single year.

The Bundesliga, Germany's league, is technical and physical, and produces many of the best players in the world. It is less watched, perhaps, than other leagues in Europe, but contains some of the highest quality play.The MLS is a young, quickly growing league marked by physicality and young, developing players.

, Almost every league in the world doesn't actually have a playoff. Instead, points are tallied up from every game, and the highest point total wins the league. However, there are a variety of major tournaments each year for club teams, and this is almost always the highest quality soccer you can watch every year.


The Champions League is a tournament between all of the best clubs from every country in Europe. Qualifying takes place over the summer and winter, with the final in May.The FA Cup is a tournament between every pro or semi-pro team in England, no matter what their standing is.
Every continent has versions of this cup (such as South America's Copa Libertadores) but the European League is the best-known tournament.

, A country's national team is made up of only citizens of that country, and these teams compete in the world's biggest tournaments, like the World Cup. International soccer is played in the summer and consists of a series of games, qualifications, and tournaments that ultimately culminate in the World Cup every 4 years.



Friendlies are practice games that mean little, but are essential for team building and testing out players and strategies. Since most players leave to play for their club team during the year, these are crucial practice games for coaches.

Qualification for major tournaments, such as the Gold Cup, the World Cup, and the Confederations Cup, take place every single year. These crucial games determine, ultimately, what 32 countries make it to the World Cup.

Tournaments These round-robin and knock-out events are what every national team lives for. Winning some of them, like the Gold Cup, gets you an automatic free bid to the World Cup, the ultimate tournament in soccer., There is so much soccer on TV at any given time, it is hard not to find something worth watching. But the deluge of information can be overwhelming, especially for new fans. If you don't have a team or can't figure out who to watch, the best place to start is the English Premier League. It runs from August to May, and all of the games are played on Saturday and Sunday, always, making it easy to sit down and get a good game even if you aren't in the know about the schedules."

Show Children how they can save lives with Homework.",How to Teach Children Water Safety Without a Swimming Pool," When asked to “take the stage” at an event like a Safety Fair or Children’s event at a mall, park, or children’s fair--the first challenge is always getting the kids to the stage. You can answer that challenge quite easily with a handful of free prizes. Some ideas include economical goggles, pool toys, etc. Announce... “Girls and boys, children of all ages, come on up to the stage for a free water safety presentation. Bring your mom or dad with you too! I have stickers and lots of prizes too! Did you hear that boys and girls . . .free prizes! Come on up now""! You’ll gather a crowd of children in a hurry!;
, The moment the children come up to the stage, start putting stickers on the children and handing them helium balloons—all with your logo and contact information, along with a handout of the SAFER KIDS song (which you will use in a few minutes). Everyone loves free stuff and this certainly does the trick to stir up the excitement.

, You want to engage them by asking a question. Ask, “How many of you are SAFE in the water?” Most of them will raise their hand. Then you really pull them in when you shock them with an animated “NO!” Act a little silly so you don’t scare them, but stress and hammer home this point: “No one... not you, not your mom or dad, is safe in the water! And I can swim across the lake, I can swim a mile without stopping, and I’m even a swim teacher and a lifeguard—but that doesn’t make me safe. What we can be, you and me, is “safer.” Everyone say that... “Safer.” The “r” in safer stands for “risk.” Where there is water, there is risk. But today, I’m going to teach you how you can be safer by following the Safer 3, a layered approach to water safety"" (that technical comment is aimed toward the parents but we are going to teach it to the children).

, Continue the presentation by saying, “You have a song sheet with the words to the Safer Kids Song by Jim Reiser. I’m going to teach you that song so you can learn everything you need to know so that you can be safer when you’re in or around the water. Here’s how we’re going to do this: I will sing a verse of the song. Then you will sing that verse with me. Then we’ll talk about what we learned in that verse. Then after we learn each of the verses, we’ll put it all together. Ready, here we go with the first verse (same tune as Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star): “Learning to swim is really cool, so you can have fun playing in the pool, but always make sure there’s a grown up watching you, that’s a safety tip that’s oh so true.” After you sing it, you talk about it. I may say, for example, “So you all agree learning to swim is really cool, right?” They say “yes!” “But what was that really important thing we learned in the first verse? To always make sure there’s a?” They all yell “grown up watching you!” So that’s the idea, and from there you can move on to the next verse (see video sample of Jim Reiser teaching this to a group of second graders below).

, In addition to keeping the children engaged during the 20-minute presentation with questions and participating in the singing, you can also throw out prizes, i.e., goggles, toys, t-shirts, temporary tattoos, to the children that answer the questions correctly. This technique really keeps them sitting on the edge of their seat!

, Once you finish teaching the song, get their attention again: “Now it’s time to give you your homework!” There are two parts two your homework. Part one; this song is my gift to you. Your homework is to practice this song every day until you can sing it without looking at the words. That way I know that you really know the safety rules. Part two... I want everyone to close their eyes. Now think of a relative or friend that you really care about (pause). Okay, open your eyes. I want you to teach them the song, just like I taught it to you. Then give your friend your copy of the song as a gift, and give them homework just like I gave you""!

, Over the course of the year, I will teach 2000 children the Safer Kids Song and I will give 2000 children this homework. Here’s a math word problem for you. If 2000 children learn this song and do their homework, thus teaching 2000 more children how to be safer in the water, how many children are now safer in the water? “4000!” I continue this example until we get up to 64,000, sometimes even 128,000, and make my point (plus get them to think and work on their math).

,
Pull in your stomach muscles, and keep them taut while swimming.,
Lessen your breathing during the swimming session.,
Concentrate on your pull while swimming.",How to Use a Pull Buoy," Buoys come in small and large sizes, and you will need to try them out in a store to see what feels the most natural for your body type.;
, This will help you get your balance before trying to float and make it easier to place once you are prepared to swim.

, For optimal results, insert the buoy as high up your legs as possible. It can be harder to control the buoy the closer it gets to your knees.

, A good rule to remember is to face downward and forward a bit, and contract your sternum. This is the natural position you need to focus on when you're not swimming with a pull buoy.

,,, This streamlines your body and creates a straighter line as well as limits the mass needed to push through the water.

, With a pull buoy, you should not have to work as hard to swim, and you can use this opportunity to slow down your breathing. Less breathing equals less exertion, and you are less fatigued.

, A pull buoy allows you to float effortlessly in the correct position, so that you can really focus other aspects of your stroke, such as hand entry, release point, and wall push-offs. Each time you use this training method, focus on a different part of your technique to improve.

Apply your basecoat.,
Use any one of several techniques to apply the basecoat.,
Apply the basecoat until bumps start to form.,
Apply your temperature wax.,
Comb the wax.,
Spray cool water over the board.",How to Wax a Surfboard," If you are using a longboard, wax the entire topside of the board from nose to tail and edge to edge. If you are using a shortboard, wax the topside of the board from the front logo to the back edge (about two thirds of the length) and from edge to edge.You can get by just fine without a basecoat wax, but your wax won't last as long. If your board doesn't have the right basecoat, the topcoat won't stick to the board, leaving you with a naked spot on your board where slipping and sliding can happen.
Your basecoat should stay on the board until you re-wax your board. Your topcoat clings on to the basecoat.;
, When it comes to getting the basecoat to stick onto the board, surfers tend to use different techniques — sometimes in isolation, sometimes in combination:


Circle pattern: Rub the wax onto the board in small circles, moving up and down the board until bumps start forming.
Straight line pattern: Rub the wax onto the board in straight lines up and down the board, parallel to the rocker.
Crosshatch pattern: Rub the wax onto the board on a diagonal, and then perpendicular to that diagonal, completing a crosshatch pattern.
Kitchen sink: Rub the wax onto the board in any direction, using any of the patterns listed above or making your own.

, Use the edge of the wax stick, not the flat side. Apply until there is a bumpy coat. Your topcoat will adhere to these little bumps. Depending on the size of your board, you may need to use an entire stick of wax, or up to two sticks, in order to get the basecoat right.

, Wax over the entirety of the area you just covered with base coat. Rub the edge of the wax onto the board in small, 3 to 6 inch (7.6 to 15.2 cm) circles, or using any of the techniques listed above.


To be safe, try using a different-colored topcoat wax than your basecoat. If your topcoat wax is the same color as your basecoat it will be harder to tell where you have applied it, so be sure to wax in one direction if this is the case.

, Run your wax comb through the wax on your board. Run the comb in diagonal crosshatch lines to rough up the wax and allow you to grip to your board even better. Be sure to run it through all of the wax on the board.


Use the wax comb each time you surf if you haven't applied a new topcoat. Sometimes, your wax will get flat and lose some of its traction. If you don't want to apply a new layer of topcoat, take the comb-side of your comb and make a crosshatch pattern using diagonal scrapes.

, This will make the wax harden and stick to the board better. You're officially ready to surf.

While in the correct surfing stance you will find by pushing your hips forward you will place more weight on the front leg and the nose of the surfboard should slightly dip towards the sand.,
Don't lean, bounce or step all over the surfboard, simply keep pushing your hips back and forth and transfer your weight from the front leg to the back leg.,
After a few weight transfers you may need to step off, rebuild your sandcastle and then replace your surfboard and start again.

An ophthalmologist will use special equipment to examine your eye in detail.
The doctor may perform further diagnostics to confirm their diagnosis.;
, One of the most common ways of treating surfer’s eye is with topical lubrication drops. These drops will reduce dryness and alleviate other symptoms.


Eye drops may be prescription or over-the-counter. An example is GenTeal drops.
Your doctor may also prescribe artificial tears. This might include, for example, Refresh Tears., Steroid eye drops are sometimes prescribed as an adjunct to regular eye drops. These drops help reduce inflammation, which in turn, reduces other symptoms.


Steroid drops will most likely be used on a short-term basis.
Only use steroid drops under the consultation of your medical professional, as they could increase your chance of other eye diseases.
Steroid drops are often prescribed when symptoms are severe., One common solution to dry eye is to insert a plug into your tear duct trains. By doing this, you eye will maintain its ability to lubricate itself better.


Tear drains serve to remove excess tears and fluid from your eyes.
Your doctor may recommend this as a last resort before surgery, after use of steroid or regular eye drops have failed."

Keep your knees bent as you cross the wake. Make sure that you don't cut hard and then let up. If you do, you'll allow slack into the rope, which can cause you to lose control.To cut heelside: Roll your weight back onto your heels and turn your shoulders and your hips toward the wakes.

To cut toeside: Push your hips over your toes. Avoid pulling in on the handle as you veer in and out of the wakes.

Bend your knees when you land to absorb the impact.",How to Wakeboard3," Your toes should face away from the wake.

, Cut in at a gentle angle at first, and then cut in harder as you get closer to the peak of the wake.

, Extend your knees and stand tall as you ride up the peak of the wake, and keep the rope taut. You'll fly up over the edge of the wake and catch air at that point. Draw the board up toward yourself while you're in the air to stay up longer., Place your weight over your toes so that you have maximum control of your landing."

Have surgery.,
Ask your doctor techniques to inhibit pterygium growth in the future.,
Wear an eye patch after surgery.",How to Treat Surfer's Eye2," In severe cases of surfer’s eye, your ophthalmologist must surgically remove the growth – pterygium – from your eye. By removing the growth, your doctor will remove abnormal cells and enable you to see correctly.


Surgery is only needed in severe circumstances, when abnormal tissue blocks sight or threatens a person’s ability to see.
The procedure usually lasts less than an hour.
Surgery to remove pterygium may cause or worsen astigmatism., In many cases, doctors will use techniques that will inhibit future abnormal tissue growth into their surgery. By using these techniques, you’ll substantially lower the chance of developing surfer’s eye in the future.


Ask about anti-metabolites. These will slow or inhibit the growth of pterygium cells that may be left over after surgery. A common anti-metabolite used to treat surfer’s eye is Mitomycin C.
Your doctor may also place a barrier – a thin membrane – over the site of surgery to inhibit the growth of abnormal tissue., An important part of providing care after your surgery is to wear an eye patch. An eye patch will protect your eye and allow it to heal properly.


You’ll likely have to wear an eye patch for one or two days after surgery.
Avoid dry or dusty environments for up to a week after surgery.
You will most likely be able to return to work or your usual activities the day after surgery."
"
Protect your eyes from ultraviolet (UV) light.,
Avoid spending time in environments that are excessively dry and dusty.,
Consult your doctor about ways to lubricate your eyes in dry environments.",How to Treat Surfer's Eye3," Since exposure to UV light is one of the great contributing factors to the development of surfer’s eye, you should substantially limit your exposure to UV.


Limit time outside when the UV index is high. Most weather websites and applications will reference the UV level outside on any given day.
Wear polarized eyeglasses or sunglasses that are rated with UV protection.
Consider wraparound sunglasses if you spend a prolonged amount of time outside., Ultimately, by limiting your time in environments that are dry and dusty, you’ll reduce the chance of another occurrence of surfer’s eye. This is because dry and dusty environments aggravate the eye and trigger the growth of pterygium.


Limit time in dry and dusty environments. For instance, if you need to work outside and you live in the Desert Southwest, limit this time to an hour a day or less.
If you have to spend time in dry and dusty environments, make sure you wear protective glasses., One of the best ways to counter the dangers of dry and dusty environments and to help prevent surfer’s eye is by making sure your eyes are properly lubricated.


Talk to your doctor about solutions that may be good for you.
Consider using artificial tears to keep your eyes lubricated.
Think about using eye drops to address irritation caused by exposure to dry or dusty environments.
Your doctor might also prescribe mitomycin eye drops to be used after surgical removal of abnormal tissue."

Recognize the symptoms of surfer's eye.,
Learn the basics about surfer’s eye.,
Understand the causes of surfer’s eye.,
Know that severity of surfer’s eye varies from person to person.",How to Treat Surfer's Eye4," Surfer's eye can be typically seen on the eye as a yellow bump or white overgrowth of the eye. If you are uncertain whether or not you have surfer's eye, you should look out for:

Yellow spots on the white of the eye
Redness or swelling of the eye
Blurry vision
Dry, gritty itchy eyes
Feeling as though there is something in your eye, Surfer’s eye is a condition that is associated with growth of tissue over a portion of the eye. This tissue may partially block your vision and cause discomfort or irritation.


Abnormal tissue growth is also known as “pterygia.”
Surfer’s eye often develops in people who spend considerable amounts of time outside in dry or windy conditions., While the exact cause of surfer’s eye is not known or agreed upon by medical professionals, there are a variety of contributing factors that are associated with its development. Medical professionals, though, commonly point to several factors as causing surfer’s eye. Some include:


Long-term exposure to UV light. People who work outside in sunny environments are especially prone to the condition.
Exposure, long-term, to dry and dusty environments.
Long-term exposure to windy environments, which tend to dry eyes out., While some cases of surfer’s eye are severe enough to require immediate treatment, others may not require treatment at all. In the end, you and your doctor must determine the extent that surfer’s eye threatens your vision.


Some people who suffer from surfer’s eye may not exhibit symptoms other than abnormal tissue growth.
Many individuals who suffer from surfer’s eye may not need to undergo surgery or other invasive procedures.
Only a medical professional can determine the severity of your surfer’s eye."

Rent or borrow a surfboard with a leash.,
Get to the beach.

,
Enter the water with your board under your arm and attach the leg leash to your rear ankle.

,
Lie flat on your board and paddle to the area where the waves begin to crash, with your head in the front of the board.,
Walk out to an area that is about waist deep and where the waves are breaking gently.

,
Turn the board so it faces the shore.

,
Lie in the prone position and start paddling gently when the wave is a few meters away.,
Watch for other surfers with priority to you, those closest to the breaking part of the wave have this priority.,
Quickly standing up on your board is known as a pop up.,
Surf on the face of the wave.,
Ride the wave until it tapers of or closes.

",How to Surf a Wave," A foam board or a long board are the best choice for a beginner.;
,,, Lie belly down on your board.

,,, As you feel your board being picked up by the wave give an extra two or three powerful strokes to match your speed with the wave.

, If you take off in front of them, this is called snaking them. This is not cool and could end up in the surfer shooting his board at you or fighting you. This is the one rule most new surfers (0-5 years experience) lack. Like preschool on the swings, you have to take turns and there are no cuts.

, To do this you should place your hands under your shoulders on the surfboard. Then do a push up while springing off your legs and toes, this will give you enough height to get your feet underneath you, one foot in front of the other and almost perpendicular to the middle of the board.

, Lean to one side or the other to turn.

Study the butterfly stroke.,
Strengthening.,
Kick Drills.,
Kick Drills with Integrated Pull.,
Practice and Competition.",How to Teach the Dolphin Kick Effectively," The best way to study a swim stroke is through a combination of illustrations, overview, real-life experience, and visualization.



Illustrations. Pictures like those below offer specific details about body position and breathing placement.

Overview. Review the entire stroke in detail. Swim the Butterfly Stroke


Real-Life Experience. Demonstrate the full stroke for your students or visit a swim meet. At a meet, watch carefully those swimmers performing the butterfly.

Visualization. Have your students close their eyes. Talk them through a race situation. Be sure to highlight body position, other body movements, and breathing.;
, The butterfly is the most challenging stroke of the four competition strokes. In order to perform it, a certain level of fitness is beneficial. This includes upper and lower body strength, as well as stamina. It is best to introduce the stroke after a swimmer has some proficiency in the other three. This will not only assure a level of fitness but also safety if the swimmer tires from the new stroke.

, There are many drills out there for the dolphin kick and the dolphin motion during the kick. This is a list to get you and your students started. For additional drills please click on the link at the bottom of the page.



Body Dolphin 1. Kick with hands at side, breathe on upbeat of every fourth kick, drop head down on downbeat with out hesitating. Keep rhythm consistent, especially while breathing.

Body Dolphin 2. Same as number 1, with hands now in streamline position.

Underwater Kick. Kick in a streamline position underwater, on stomach, back, or side.

Kick on Back. Dolphin kick on your back with hands at your side or in front, keeping knees below the surface of the water.

Underwater Kick with Flippers. Same as above only with flippers. Meant to emphasize kick and exaggerate dolphin motion.

Dolphin Tread. Kick Butterfly while doing a small scull extending beyond the shoulders, and back in again. Keep sculling strokes to less than 12-inches of travel. Purpose: working the catch phase of Butterfly.

, There are many drills out there for the dolphin kick and its implementation into the butterfly. This is a list to get you and your students started. For additional drills please click on the link at the bottom of the page.



Two Up, Four Down. Do two strokes Butterfly, breathe, and dive forward underwater into a streamlined position and do four kicks. Purpose: entry, dolphin action, and breath control.

Four Kicks with Flippers. As the swimmer progresses at these drills, the arms may also be incorporated at a ratio of four kicks to one pull, gradually working the ratio down to a full stroke. The final step is to swim butterfly with fins, concentrating on pressing the ""T"" forward and down while breathing every other stroke.

, Now that your swimmers can successfully combine kick and pull, continue to develop their abilities further. Continue to use a variety of stroke drills as a reminder of body movement and positions. Congratulations, you and your students are ready for a meet.

Remember that safety comes first.,
Show that you care.,
Be prepared with a comprehensive lesson plan.,
Create a positive environment.",How to Teach Swim Lessons for Kids1," Before teaching a new skill, one must make sure that everyone involved stays safe. Never turn your back on a beginner. Be cognizant of the dangers involved in swimming, which include drowning, equipment malfunctions, or slipping. Be up-to-date in your understanding of CPR and first aid. Though lifeguard certifications can last multiple years, consider attending first-aid seminars on a regular basis.Prioritize general safety over the teaching of skills.


Consider having a lifeguard or water watcher present as you teach. That way, you will be able to more completely focus on teaching individual students while someone else keeps watch over the entire pool.
All the steps in this guide should be followed alongside proper teaching and safety protocols, which are learned through certified programs.;
, Children often need extra encouragement and welcoming when they enter strange environments or learn something new.Warmly welcome every student. Get to know them as individuals, including knowing their names, how they like to be approached and taught, and what their strengths and weaknesses are. Developing an intuition about the needs of every student takes time, but a warm and approachable attitude can jump-start the bonding process.


It is often a good idea to include parents in this process; not only can they let you know ahead of time what a child struggles with, but being on good terms with parents can lead to their children trusting you more.

, Children often learn quickly and easily in structured environments that provide consistent feedback based on performance.Develop lesson plans for each swimming session, keeping in mind what the class might focus on based on how they are doing. Consider consulting an experienced teacher or mentor when developing lesson plans, especially if you are having trouble tutoring individual children and their needs.


Your lesson plan should be flexible, easily alterable, and feature age-appropriate skills and challenges.

, The backbone of your approach and presence should be positive. Every class should include attainable but challenging goals, praise, and positive feedback. More than that, class should be fun. It is all right to loosen up class plans every now and then if students are engaged and playing. Learning can still happen (and often does happen) through play."

Use your voice effectively.,
Use proximity, touch, and facial expressions to communicate.,
Use ""buzzwords"" and cues instead of long-winded instructions.,
Maximize practice space and practice time.,
Use a flotation vest for beginners.,
Use choral responding techniques.",How to Teach Group Swimming Lessons," If you're teaching a group, you will have to talk much louder than if you were teaching just a couple children. Make sure not to strain your voice (look up tips for saving your voice), but most importantly keep your commands and instructions short and to the point. The video provides more information on voice techniques.


In this example, which would be more effective? A. ""Okay class, I want everyone to pay attention and listen closely to my directions."" B. ""Oy!"" The answer is ""example B."" ""Oy"" means ""attention"" and is precisely 13 less words than ""example A."";
, An example structure could be moving in closer to the student that is not paying attention, putting a hand on their shoulder, and giving them a ""look"" of disapproval.

, If you're teaching freestyle side breathing, for example, avoid saying: ""Okay, I want you to start turning your head as your pulling hand passes under your body. Then take your breath and start returning your face back into the water as your dominant hand recovers and you begin recovering your other arm."" Instead, say, ""Breathe, stroke one, stroke two."" Wasn't that easy, precise, and to the point? And in just 5 words you communicate your message to the entire group.

, Give each student a number or a color. For example, go to each child and say, ""red group,"" next child ""blue group,"" next child, ""red,"" next child, ""blue, etc."" Since every other child is in an opposite group, you have maximized your space. In large groups, you may even want to go with three groups. In order to maximize practice time, have one group go, and then when that group is 1/2 to 2/3 of the way to the rope or wall, have the other group go. This way you are maximizing practice time and eliminating as much down time as possible.

, Nothing is more important than safety and practice time. By using a flotation device (preferably a progressive one), you can increase practice time and keep your beginners safer.

, Most swim instructors make the mistake of doing all the talking which is a huge mistake when teaching group lessons from both a learning and behavior standpoint. Instead, give yourself and your students an ""edge"" be engaging them in the process. For example, let's say that you want to teach your students the cues/buzzwords for the back kick. Simply state, ""say what I say"" or ""repeat after me:"" ""Ears in the water,"" they repeat, ""Tummies up,"" they repeat, ""Small, fast kicks,"" they repeat. Not only are they learning but by involving them in your presentation, you eliminate many behavior issues.

Teach age-appropriate skills.,
Encourage the development of coordination.,
Teach independent floating.,
Teach stomach floating.,
Teach wall push-offs.,
Encourage the development of discipline.",How to Teach Swim Lessons for Kids2," The average age of your class will determine your lesson plans and goals; very young children will not respond to certain challenges that older children may thrive with. For instance, children under a year old should simply become acquainted with playing in water rather than being forced to swim.Often, teachers get bored teaching fundamental skills and jump to something that interests them rather than that properly challenges the students. Be patient and mindful of your students' needs.


You may consider shadowing a more experienced swim teacher in order to observe how they react to different demographics of children. Contact a community gym, pool, or fitness center to see if this is an option.

, Children will not be competent swimmers until the age of about six or seven, but skill-building in a classroom environment can begin before that age.Children between four and six years old can benefit from coordination and stabilization exercises in the water. These exercises will help them get used to the basics of moving in the water.


Water safety should also be a prioritized lesson at this age. Teach children not to run by water, to be careful on slippery surfaces, and follow a protocol when entering and exiting a pool.
Be patient. Children at this age are not learning disciplined form; they are learning how to interact with the water. Interest levels and prowess will change day-to-day at this age.

, An ability to independently float in the water is a fundamental skill for swimming in general. Independent floating can be taught as an assisted wall float: with the student's back in the water, have them place their heels on the edge of the pool, anchoring them. Then, have the student extend their legs, flattening their body on the surface of the water and spreading their weight out to the length of their body. Once their legs are extended and their body is floating on the water, have them breathe normally and sustain the float for as long as possible.


It is best for them to not use their hands to assist their float. Once they master the assisted wall float, they should move on to try floating without any assistance.

, This form of floating can help students get used to having their head and stomach underwater. Much like the assisted wall float, this exercise requires students to put their feet on the pool edge and extend their legs; this time, though, they will be floating on their stomach rather than on their back. Keeping hips and shoulders on the surface of the water, students must take a deep breath and put their face under the water. Students may use hands for the stomach float, but only to help bring the head up for another breath.


Assisted wall floats and stomach floating can be alternated as part of a drill or a game. Challenge students to be the one who can sustain a float the longest.

, Students who know how to push off a wall to float will understand how to use momentum to move in water. While their feet are on the wall of the pool, have the student take a breath and push off the wall. This will propel them through the water. Have the student relax and feel their head, legs, and arms sink in the water as they lose momentum and finally stop. This will help them become accustomed to sinking in the water and correcting this with a float. You don't necessarily have to couple this with a lesson in strokes, but a wall push-off is a good exercise to pair with continued movement through the water.


You may want to conduct this exercise in the short end of the pool, so that inexperienced swimmers can stand up after they lose momentum.
Water noodles and floating boards are good tools to pair with this exercise, so inexperienced swimmers can experiment with using their legs and arms to continue movement through the water.

, Often, the point of instructing young children is to instill discipline, self-awareness, self-esteem, and curiosity rather than build great technique. Empathize with your students and understand the challenges they are facing in trying something strange and new. Making their first experience with swimming a friendly, safe, and responsible one can lead to a lifelong interest in learning.


A safe environment can be established through instructional generosity. Sandwich ""corrections"" with compliments, reward those who try new things, and keep in mind each child's fears or weaknesses.
At the same time, hold students responsible for their conduct, discipline, and effort. Make sure lesson plans are followed, even if altered.

Introduce more complex expectations.,
Teach basic strokes.,
Begin with the backstroke.,
Introduce measured challenges.,
Use practical skill progressions.,
Reduce structure.,
Educate parents on their child's progress.,
Act like a professional.",How to Teach Swim Lessons for Kids3," Older children, from ages 6 to ten, are more agile and coordinated than younger children. They can enter and exit the water by themselves and can learn fundamental strokes, such as the backstroke or breaststroke.Though children in this age group aren't ready to be professional swimmers, it is healthy to increase expectations for behavior, reception of technical instruction, and stamina. Lessons can be more focused, longer, have more detail, and introduce higher expectations.

, These are the basic building blocks for moving through the water. Basic strokes include the backstroke, the butterfly stroke, and the breaststroke.Each of these strokes require coordinated movement across the body, meaning that teaching these strokes can take up large amounts of time. Often, instructors will break each stroke down into several parts, teach the parts individually, then combine them into a whole. One can follow this method to introduce basic movements to young children.


Instructors can break strokes down into ""cues"" that can illustrate a complex stroke. Children can easily memorize cues--which may indicate certain body postures or movements--and use them to build a stroke.

, The backstroke is an easy stroke that can be taught through specific skills. Begin with students floating on their back and stroking the water using only one arm--25 strokes with the left arm, then 25 with the right. Once the movement is perfected, the arms can be alternated. After the student can keep a steady rhythm with alternating arms, they can be taught a flutter kick. Once the student can alternate arms, flutter kick, and stay afloat on their back, they can use these together in rhythm in order to perform a backstroke., Once the student is able to move in the water with the backstroke, introduce challenges or drills that require them to apply the technique. Swimming a certain number of laps in a lap pool, or around the edge of a pool without laps, can be a good challenge, as can be races against other students. Randomized challenges, such as swimming to pick up randomly dropped pool weights, can develop reaction and decision-making skills.


Try to have your students reduce their time spent completing each drill or challenge. Consider recording their times in order to encourage development.

, This is similar to teaching strokes by breaking them down into cues. Skill progressions introduce students to small tasks or movements that, once mastered, are then combined or extended into larger ones. A skill progression will establish foundational skills that are predictable, then lead students to more complex skills that are less predictable and indicative of mastery.Using a skill progression in teaching swimming might mean playing a game that develops a simple skill, then moving on to more technical-based lessons that build upon that skill.


Skill progressions can be used in the open (that is, you can provide a chart or graph that tracks the skills attained) or can be used in an unacknowledged way.

, As students get older and more experienced, their need for structure may be reduced, as they are able to make their own decisions and rely on their own intuition about their skills. Students might need to be weaned off structure in order to develop this independence. Consider challenging your students more, or introducing the risk of failure; putting students outside their comfort zone can often lead to the largest jumps in competence and skill acquisition.


At the same time, remain generous, gentle, and responsible with your students' self-esteem. Never make them internalize failure, feel lasting shame, or have deep doubts about themselves.

, As children gain mastery, they may need more support than you can give in order for their skills to develop. Talk to your students' parents about their progress, weaknesses, improvements, and opportunities for activity outside your lessons. Parents do not have your expertise or time with their children and may miss information about their child's development.


Continue to remind parents about swimming safety. Many parents assume that once a child has taken swimming lessons, they can swim alone. This is not the case; all children should be supervised while swimming.

, Arrive early, stay on schedule, keep your equipment and props neatly organized and maintained, and avoid talking about personal issues. The higher expectation you fulfill for yourself, the higher expectations you can expect from your students.

Keep practicing.",How to Teach Diving," Have your swimmers get into water holding onto the edge of the pool. Have them practice holding their breath underwater and getting their entire heads wet. This helps kids overcome any fear of water.;
, With kids sitting on the side of the pool, have them place their arms over their heads pointing upwards, with arms against ears.


If they want to hold their noses, let them; they can put only one arm up and against the ear. They'll outgrow the nose-holding.






From this sitting position, have them lean forward with hands and head pointing toward the water until they slip off the side of the pool. They likely won't get their hands and heads into the water first, but they will become comfortable with being mostly head first. Be patient with this step.

, When they have mastered diving from a sitting position, have them kneel and lean forward until they slip into the pool head-first. At this stage they will truly be going head-first. Be patient and repeat as often as necessary (it won't be long).

, From a kneeling position, hold your arm straight out in front of them so they have to dive over it. Start low to the water and work up a little bit at a time until they are diving over your arm.

, Progress to a standing position and have them just lean over until they slip into the pool head-first. Have patience, and have them repeat, repeat, and repeat.

, For example, you can use starting blocks and then higher diving boards. Go slowly and make sure kids are comfortable with each step.

, If there's a set-back, like a belly flop or a nose full of water, get them right back up to do it again, so they know it was a fluke and they really do know how to do it. This is important.

Look out for tubing waves.,
Keep an eye out for obstacles.",How to Surf Big Waves," As a semi experienced surfer, we are going to assume that you are aware of channels and how to properly get into the lineup.;
, From your observations on shore, you've noted which peaks are breaking and how they are breaking.


If the wave forms a tube/barrel/green room, whatever you want to call it, be careful not to attempt to go through the wave where the tube is being formed. Most likely you will be sucked ""over the falls"" and end up back on the inside in a used condition.

, Exercise extreme caution not to mess up a surfer's ride on your way out. Avoid being an obstacle in the water.


Obstacles in the water get hurt, badly sometimes. Paddle out of the way of a riding surfer or a surfer attempting to catch a wave remembering that you should always cross the wave behind the rider, not in front of them. Proper use of channels will help you avoid these situations.

, If the wave is not ""throwing a lip"" and appears ""mushy"", there's not nearly as much danger of going over the falls, but the white water can push you back quite a ways. When passing through white water, hug your board making yourself and your board as hydrodynamic as possible. Once the wave passes, from the hugging position begin paddling right away. This allows the buoyancy of the board to work to your advantage.

, That's the place the wave first starts to break. If you're completely unfamiliar with overhead (OH+) surf, then you definitely want to start with a mushy wave.

, When surfing OH+ mush, as with all waves, the take off is paramount. Muscle memory will help you with your take off and the drop in. Don't be overly surprised at the speed of your drop in. You'll be traveling anywhere from 20 to 50 mph depending on the size and power of the wave. Keep your eyes on what is happening with the wave in front of you. If the lip is starting to break further in front of you then you can get before it does, it may be time to bail or pull out. Often on a mushy wave you can drop in front of the white water and pull back into the green on the other side of an inside peak.

, A longboarder will naturally sit outside further than a shortboarder. The longboarder can use distance more easily to gain the speed/momentum required to drop in on the wave. The shortboarder will want to catch the wave by the steepness, doing only 4-6 paddles to drop in.


An experienced surfer can actually catch a wave after it's started to break. The take off is infinitely more difficult as the white water is raging all about the surfer, balance is much more difficult and sometimes even maintaining contact with your board can be a challenge.

, From take off to dismount that's where the fun is. Sure, white water surfing has it's own set of thrills, but ask any experienced surfer, the green is where to be.

, Riding hollow waves is much more difficult than riding mushy waves. The danger level is increased dramatically by how hollow the wave is.


When a wave is ""throwing a lip"" and creating an empty space inside itself, the forward motion of the water is tremendous. Boards are snapped and bodies broken.
Hollow wave riding usually requires a much later take off than a mushy wave. Decisions must be made instantaneously in order to avoid wipe out.

, It is usually very difficult if not impossible to catch one of these. They generally arise when the wave hits a reef or a sandbar. The sudden obstacle underwater forces the power and the water toward the surface. Sometimes (as at Suckouts, San Elijo State Beach, Encinitas, CA.) when the wave hits the reef it ""jacks up"" as much as 25% of the wave height while traveling less than 10 feet. The experienced surfer uses this boost to help them drop in on the wave.

, A curious phenomenon that occurs when water rushing in and water rushing out meet in the same place. There is usually a peak, and the ""sections"" of the wave from the peak turn toward the shore, like a crescent moon. Sometimes the ends of the crescent close out and can doom the surfer's ride.

, Inexperienced surfers will often attempt to catch a wave long after they should have let it go. It's not uncommon to see surfers pulled by the wave, not riding it at all, over the top of the wave and into the soup (an experience called ""over the falls""). Truly a nasty experience that should be avoided. Don't continue to chase a wave that you will not be able to take off on. Of course it's great for cleaning sinuses...

, OK, so you're in the lineup, you've chosen a nice wave coming in, looks like it might be OH+1/2, a good 6' - 8' wave. You're in the pocket and you're about to drop in and ... holy carp! That's a long way straight down! Seems like you're gazing into the chasm of your doom. No worries! You are! You can bet your bottom dollar that the first 3 or 4 waves are not going to be good. You'll feel like Cody Maverick's first wave on Penghu Island against Tank.


You get over the shock of how far down it appears to be, and look off to the sides. Look at the peak next door. Check out how ""vertical"" the face of that wave is. Not nearly as bad as it looked from the peak during your near death experience earlier. You notice that by watching the tubing waves next door that there's space to actually drop in on that peak, and make your take off.

, It will happen to you eventually. You're dropping in on an OH+ wave and ... son of a gun! Where'd my board go? You'll lose contact with your board, you will be airborne hurtling down the face of the wave. If you've got the skills, there's a good chance you can connect with your board again and successfully complete the take off. This difficult maneuver is called an ""air drop"" and happens more by accident than by design.

, Tube riding is extremely difficult and frankly, it's uncommon in California to get tubing waves most of the time. Generally you will find mushburgers, but when things are working together in perfect harmony, tubing waves can be found. Not at all beaches, but the special breaks that are blessed with the tide, current and bottom that allow waves to tube.


Once you've got your tubing wave, you want to get into the tube correct? Believe it or not, you may be traveling faster than the wave, and want to slow down. To do this most efficiently is simple. ""Pet the cat"". This means that you put a portion or your hand into the face of the wave. How much you want to slow down is how deep you put your fingers in. Be cautious not to dig to deep lest you end up being swallowed by the tube you're riding...
When in the tube, the forces pushing up on the rail of your board that is in the wave are trying to get you to ""circle the tube."" This unpleasant experience occurs when the wave catches your rail and flips you upside down inside the tube, and subsequently over the falls.

, As always, local knowledge is good to have, but if you're surfing an unfamiliar break, pay special attention to any ""boils"" you see in the water. This usually indicates an obstruction that should be avoided, like a reef or protruding rock. If you surf near Santa Barbara or Ventura, you may even come across abandoned pipes leading to the water that were once part of the oil industry.

Use both your arms and legs.,
Keep your head up and your breathing normal.,
Move your arms horizontally.,
Move your legs circularly or kick your legs back and forth.,
If you need to, lay down on your back and gently paddle your arms and your feet.,
Hold onto any flotation device if you're having trouble staying above water.",How to Tread Water1," Make use of all four of your limbs with your body upright (vertical). If you turn your body horizontal and start kicking with your legs and paddling with your feet, you'll start swimming, not treading water.;
, Keep your head above water and try to slowly regulate your breathing. Slowing down your breath will help you calm down, conserve energy, and tread water longer.








, If you move them up and down, you'll move up, and then move down again because you have to pull them back up. Move your arms forward and back with your hands closed facing the way they are moving. This will keep your upper body up








, If you are moving your legs in a circular fashion, don't point your feet and keep them stiff. If you are kicking back and forth, point your feet downward and kick them constantly.








, Give your body a temporary break from paddling by laying down on your back. You'll still have to paddle with both arms and legs, but not nearly as much as you would have to with your body vertical.








, A log. A paddle. A rubber boat. Whatever it is, use any type of floating material that you can to hold onto and help keep you above water. The less time you spend using energy to stay above water, the longer you'll last.

The Golden Rules: Always tell someone where you are going and when you will be back and never, ever swim alone.,
Don't swim in unfamiliar water.,
Do not try to go swimming if you are too hot, too cold, feel ill or have eaten a large meal in the last hour.,
Swim in supervised areas that have lifeguards on duty.

,
Obey the warning signs and notices around your swimming area- they are there for everyone’s safety.

,
Always listen to the lifeguard’s advice and heed any warnings.",How to Stay Safe While Swimming at the Pool and Beach1,";
, Ask locals if it is safe, what the temperature is, if there are any dangerous marine life or currents, what the depth is and if a lifeguard is on duty.

, Take a walk and admire the scenery, play beach games or buy a cool drink instead.

,,, If in doubt ask the lifeguard to explain something that you do not understand.

Check the forecast.,
Pay attention to posted warnings.,
Talk to the lifeguard.,
Know how to identify a rip current.,
Look up example images online.,
Stay away from structures that extend away from the beach.,
Learn how to swim.,
Swim only with a lifeguard present.,
Swim with others.,
Respond safely if you see a rip current catch someone.,
Learn how to survive a rip current.",How to Stay Safe Around Rip Currents," In the U.S., The National Weather Service website posts rip current predictions for select beaches. In most other countries, the weather forecast near popular beach destinations will include a surf forecast. Rip currents can appear even on a calm day, but they are more dangerous when waves are high.


Distant hurricanes can contribute to ""flash rip currents,"" short-lived and unpredictable events.Hurricane warning centers may post rip current warnings for some areas, even if they do not experience any other effects of the storm.
Consider checking the tide forecast as well. Rip currents tend to be strongest within a couple hours before and after a low tide.;
, When you arrive at the beach, look for posted warning signs. If you are a weak swimmer or if there are no lifeguards on duty, you may want to avoid the water entirely on high risk days. Rip currents can occur in any conditions, but the warning signs give you a good estimate of risk. Some warnings are posted using this international flag system:Yellow: moderate surf or currents. Weak swimmers discouraged from entering water.
Red: strong surf or currents. All swimmers discouraged.
Two red flags: beach closed to swimmers.
Red and white checkers: emergency evacuation.
Two flags, each one half red and half yellow: the area between these flags is supervised by lifeguards. Swimmers should not leave these bounds.

, Lifeguards may know where rip currents are likely to form, and whether there have been any today. Don't hesitate to ask for advice.


Lifeguards may also issue warnings when a rip current is sighted, or ask swimmers to steer clear of a dangerous area. Pay attention to them.

, There are a number of ways you can identify a possible rip current without actually getting in it. A rip current is a relatively narrow channel of water, seldom more than 50–100 feet (15.2–30.5 m) in width, usually running from the beach straight out to the sea. Since you cannot see the whole shape of the current from the shore, look for a streak of water with one or more of these suspicious characteristics:A dirty or muddy appearance from churning up the seabed. You might sea seaweed or debris moving rapidly away from shore.
An unusually calm area of water, including a gap in the line of breaking waves.
Water with a different color than its surroundings, or a foamy surface.
Lower waterline on shore at that spot.

, One easy way to familiarize yourself with a rip tide is to look up videos and images of rip tides. Look for perspectives from the shore for a more accurate idea of what to look for.

, Permanent rip currents often develop near piers and jetties, so try to stay at least 100 feet (30.5 m) away from these structures. Long-lasting seasonal rip currents can also form around natural sandbars and rocky outcroppings that extend perpendicular from the beach., It should go without saying, but learning to swim is the single most important thing you can do to stay safe in water. Remember, swimming in surf is very different than swimming in a pool or lake, so don't test your limits if you're not accustomed to surf conditions.

, Rip currents can occur in the water near any beach where breaking waves are present, including on large lakes. While it's a good idea to avoid swimming without a lifeguard nearby, it's especially important in these bodies of water.

, Swimming alone is risky, since no one will be able to help you in an emergency. Swim with a buddy or at least near other people.

, Many people have drowned attempting to rescue another rip current victim. A lifeguard may be trained to swim into a rip current, but only the strongest and most experienced swimmers should attempt it. Instead, throw any floating object to the person so they can hold on and wait for rescue. Notify a lifeguard immediately or call emergency services if a lifeguard is not present.

, While rip currents are usually avoidable, you should still learn what to do if you get caught in one. Read this article for full instructions, or start with this quick summary:


Never swim directly against the current. This will only exhaust you.
Traditional advice tells swimmers to swim parallel to shore, to escape the narrow channel of the rip current. Everyone agrees this is a good tactic for strong swimmers to try.
Recent, controversial research suggests that weak swimmers may have better odds if they relax and focus on staying afloat. The rip current will either take you to calmer waters, or circle back to shore."

Do the dog paddle.,
Try the flutter kick.,
Do the frog kick.,
Try sculling.,
Try the rotary kick.,
Try the little helicopter.",How to Tread Water2," The dog paddle is where you move your arms out in front of you while kicking your legs up and down.









The advantage: it doesn't take a lot of ""proper technique"" in order to do.
The disadvantage: it saps you of energy, meaning you won't be able to do this technique for very long.

, The flutter kick is where you tread water with your legs while keeping your arms outstretched for balance. To flutter kick, point your toes downward and kick one leg forward as you kick another leg back. Maintain a consistent back and forth.









The advantage: you can keep your arms free by doing the flutter kick, giving you an opportunity to do something else with them.
The disadvantage: because you're using just your legs to keep you up, this technique can be taxing.

, The frog kick is where you bring your feet out to the side, and then back in. The frog kick is also called the whip kick. Starting off with your legs together, move your feet out to the side and then quickly back in.









The advantage: this kick is less tiring than the flutter kick or the dog paddle.
The disadvantage: using this kick causes you to bob up and down in the water instead of staying relatively motionless.

, Sculling allows you to tread water with your hands. To scull, keep your hands outstretched to the side and completely submerged. With your palms facing toward one another, move your hands towards one another until they are almost touching. When you've reached this point, turn your palms facing outward and move your hands back out to their original position. Try to keep your hands doing one fluid movement back and forth.


The advantage: you can keep your legs free by sculling, allowing you to combine this with another foot treading technique such as the flutter kick.
The disadvantage: you have to keep pretty much your whole body (minus your head) underwater.

, Also called the eggbeater, this is where you move one foot clockwise while moving the other foot counterclockwise. This technique is hard to master, but it saves a lot of energy.


The advantage: you save a lot of energy doing this technique if you can perfect it.
The disadvantage: this is a hard technique to perfect, and many people need to practice extensively in order to learn it.

, Lay back in the water in the same manner as floating. Immediately move your hands in a circular motion. Move your feet up and down together.


The advantage: it's very simple to explain to children.
The disadvantage: circling hands can become tired.

Learn what a drowning victim looks like.,
If you see someone in difficulty there are a number of things you can do.,
Report any missing people to the lifeguard immediately.

,
Stop swimming at the first sign of bad weather; always pay attention to local weather conditions and forecasts.,
Don’t try to swim against the current if caught in one.,
Spinal injuries are very serious.",How to Stay Safe While Swimming at the Pool and Beach3," Splashing and shouting occurs when someone is in difficulty, not drowning (this does not mean they do not need help urgently however). If someone has only their mouth or nose above water with the head tipped back, is vertical, is lying face down in the water, making very little movement or is frantically flapping arms and legs underwater but not making any sound, splash or moving anywhere you should act immediately. A small number of non-swimmers will drown without making any attempt to save themselves. It takes a lot of training to recognise drowning and people in difficulty which is why you must always swim under the supervision of a qualified lifeguard.

, Most importantly, shout for help. If you cannot access the person, call the emergency services.


Make eye contact and use a firm, kind tone to calm them down and encourage them to swim to shore.






Reach to them using a pole or a stick. Alternatively, throw an item of clothing they can grab onto or a rope and pull them in. Lie on the bank as you do so so you are not pulled into the water.






You could throw a ring buoy or other item that can float, such as a big empty bottle with the lid firmly screwed on, and encourage them to kick their legs into you.






A strong swimmer could wade out to the subject and hold a swim ring at arms length, encouraging them to follow you in. A strong swimmer may also swim a short distance out to throw them an object and encourage them to come in but always stay at least 7 meters (23.0 ft) from the subject to avoid them grabbing you and drowning you in their attempt to save themselves.







Do not attempt a contact rescue unless you are qualified to do so.







,, The water attracts lightning and it is very dangerous during a storm. Strong winds cause rough, choppy water and big waves.

, Swim gradually out of the current by swimming diagonally across it. Swim one stroke with the current and one against it.

, Do not attempt to care for a spinal injury victim if you are not trained to do so. Alert the lifeguard or call an ambulance immediately. Tell everyone around you to clear the pool or area immediately, moving slowly and causing minimum movement. Hold the head of the victim between your two hands in a tight clamp and do not allow for any movement.

Still on the boat, put the lubber line (the fixed red line) in the direction of your destination or parallel to the coastline where you enter the water (in case it's needed only as a general orientation).,
While holding the lubber line (actually the whole compass) in it's original position, turn the bezel (the mobile ring with the degrees on them) with the 0° (normally marked) on the North.,
You can now find the original position underwater by turning the whole compass (attached to your arm or in a console) until the North is on 0° again.",How to Use an Underwater Compass,";
, Now you've set the compass. Take care to not turn the bezel again or you will lose your setting, unless you are swimming a pattern with calculated angles at predefined turning points (after having covered a measured distance).

, The lubber line now points to your destination or will be parallel to the original coastline where you entered the water.

Wear a flotation device.,
Get away from anyone else in the water.,
Be a strong swimmer.,

If a rescue helicopter appears in the air, raise both arms in the air, not just one.,
Keep positive.,
If injured, don't move the injured part of your body at all, and try to keep it covered with your clothes, or with any other covering.

",How to Save Yourself from Drowning in a Shipwreck," Hypothermia, shock, injury and exhaustion mean you cannot be guaranteed that you will swim to safety if an accident did happen. Wear a properly fitted life jacket that supports the neck and will keep your face out of the water if you fall unconscious.;
, Immediately after the accident is when you, as a strong swimmer, are in most danger. You can come back and group together with strong swimmers later but, right away, you are in danger from weak and panicking swimmers who will do anything to try to save themselves. No swimmer, no matter how strong, will manage to get to safety if they are being grabbed by several drowning victims. Remember, you must protect yourself first and foremost.

, Everyday, in preparation, swim for an hour while wearing jeans and a t-shirt. This will help build stamina and speed. If you drown, these are the items you will most likely be wearing.

, To do so, form a huddle position, in which you double over, and try to conserve all your heat.

, Tie the legs of your jeans together, and then fill air in to them. Lift them over your head and pull them towards the water. When they blow up, use it as a buoy.

, This will help conserve body heat, and will enable you to use more resources.

, There you will be able to build a fire, dry yourself, and rest. If this is not possible, limit your movements, and try not to waste energy.

, One hand signifies no, while two mean yes. This way the copter will assume you need help and will rescue you.

, Corny as it sounds, a positive mindset is what several survivors attribute to their success. Repeat mantras such as ""My name is John Smith and I am not going to die out here"", and sing songs out loud to distract yourself and keep your mind occupied.

Look for pool inspection results.,
Check water clarity.,
Test the pool water.,
Check for heavy chemical smells.,
Find a lifeguard.,
Look for rules involving cleanliness.",How to Determine if Your Public Pool Is Safe1," Public pools must go through a public inspection to ensure its cleanliness and to ensure that there are no rampant health hazards. When you are choosing a public pool, look for the results posted around the pool. If they are not listed, ask the people that work at the pool when the last pool inspection was and where the information is posted.The Centers for Disease Control have a database of state regulations in regards to public pools if you want more information about your local pool inspection specifications.;
, Before you swim or allow your family to swim in a public pool, you need to look at the clarity of the water. The water should be clear and blue. Look for any cloudiness in the water. Make sure you can see all the way to the bottom of the pool, even the deep end.


If the water is tinted green or it is cloudy, it may be contaminated with algae.
Also check the drains to ensure that there is no debris around the drain and that the cover is securely fastened and not cracked.Glance around the pool. Make sure that there are no chemicals left by the poolside or out in the open where children can reach them.

, When you go to a public pool, you can test the chemical levels to make sure they are within the recommended range. You can buy pool test strips in general stores, but you can also get free test strips from the Water Quality and Health Council's website.When you check the pool levels, you need to make sure that:


Chlorine is at least 1 ppm
Bromine is at least 3 ppm
The pH levels are between 7.2 and 7.8, If you notice a strong smell of chlorine or other chemicals, the pool may not be as clean as you think it is. The smell often comes from something called chloramines, which develop from a mixture of chlorine, sweat, dead skin cells, and other waste. This water might cause irritation to your eyes and skin., When you are looking for a safe pool, check to see if a lifeguard is on duty. Having a lifeguard will make sure that you and your family is safe. If there isn't a lifeguard on duty, make sure there is a posted sign that says ""No Lifeguard on Duty.""


You can also look for rescue equipment, such as a pole or ring, readily available for use in case someone is drowning or hurt in the pool.
Also watch the behavior of the lifeguard. Make sure he or she is watching the swimmers and is not distracted by his or her friends, phone, or anything else., Most public pools should have showers. In order to make sure people are clean before they go in, see if there are rules posted that require a short shower before entering the pool. This will help wash off any germs that may be on someone's body.

Recognize your kind of kick, and pay attention to your technique.,
Warm up thoroughly before every swim practice or gym session.,
Warm up your knees in the water.,
Kicking drills during warm-up.,
Communication with your coach is a key part of your progress.,
Respect your limits.,
Warm-down enough.,
Stretch after swimming.,
Commit inside and outside the pool.,
Strengthen the muscles that surround your knee.,
Keep your body properly hydrated at all times.,
Be constantly active.",How to Prevent Breaststroke Swimmer's Knee," Based on the kind of competitive distance you are specialized, the width between the knees when doing the kick varies. Usually, sprinters tend to do their kick with their knees closer than mid-distance or IMers. This makes the angle of the knees with the ankles be more sharp, which at the end makes sprinters more likely for knee injuries. The most important thing is to make sure every kick is not out of the boundaries of the knee rotation, especially during the out sweep of the kick. Because most of the injuries happen, when swimmers do not pay close attention to their kick technique and end up making wrong movements while doing the kick.;
, This is the key factor in avoiding knee injuries. Before getting in the water, do some joint movements. It’s always a good idea to start from your ankles up to your neck so you do not miss any part of your body. Dedicate some time to move your knees around. There are two basic movements:


Stand up with your feet shoulder width apart and put your hands on your knees. bent them forward and return to initial position.
Stand up with your feet shoulder width apart and put your hands on your knees. Bent them forward and then bring them a little to the outside almost in a circular way and then return to the initial position. Repeat the exercise bringing your knees to the opposite sense of the circular movement.
It is also good for your body to get ready to go, to do around 10 minutes of aerobic, such as light rowing, jogging or jumping rope.

, Once you start your practice, make sure you do some laps in slow breaststroke, so your knees can get used to that movement. Inside your warm up, make sure you do some kicking; start slow, but as warm-up goes on you can accelerate your kick. A short kicking set during warm up is also a good idea.

, In order for you to improve the technique of your kick, preventing injuries, its necessary to perform drills that can make easier for you to execute the proper breaststroke kick for your type of stroke. Some of the most known drills are:


2-kicks-1-stroke: Make one complete breaststroke cycle and during the gliding part introduce a second kick and start again.1-kick-2-strokes: Make one complete breaststroke cycle and taking advantage of the momentum generated from the stroke, make another stroke without the kick and repeat.
Kicking on your back: Lying on your back on a streamline position, go breaststroke kicking, trying to avoid that you knees come out too much out of the water and at the same time, trying to make sure the width between your knees does not exceed the usual one. This drill is especially good for swimmers that make the mistake of bringing their legs towards their chest when they kick.
Kicking with hands your back: Lying on your belly, starting with your body completely flat in the water with your hands by the side of your legs, execute a breaststroke kick allowing your body to follow the undulation movement it produces, after the glide keep the kicks coming.

,
As an athlete you must know that it’s different the way you perceive you are swimming and the way you look swimming; outside the water, the coach might be able to correct different aspects of your stroke. You should rely on your coach’s perspective and follow his advises during practice.

, During long aerobic sets, while your knees are warm you might not feel pain as intense, but whenever you start feeling any kind of pain, you got to know when to stop. Sometimes pushing through the pain is not the best answer. Breaststroke is quite an anaerobic and high-impact stroke, and its common even for professional swimmers to do their long high aerobic sets in a different stroke, commonly freestyle.

, Almost as important as warming up, cooling down your muscles and joints plays a huge role in preventing injuries. It is very important for you as well to bring your heart rate down and allow your body’s temperature to go back to normal. Not cooling down after doing a tiring set can bring serious problems to your body, as it needs to remove all the lactic acid that your muscles developed while doing the practice set.

, Stretching your legs after swim practice is one of the best ways to ensure an optimal and full recovery from the exercise done. Make sure you stretch the largest body muscles, such as your quads, gluteus, hamstrings and calves. There are several ways to stretch but here are some examples.


To stretch your quads, stand up with your feet shoulder width apart, next to a wall or something you can rely on for support and bring one foot back to your gluteus and hold it with your hand. Leave your knees close to each other
A more general stretch can be made by simply standing up with your feet together and incline your back towards the floor and try to touch your feet with your hands and your knees with your head.

, It is really important for you to pay attention to the activities you do outside of practice.


Use proper shoes. They can be for running, training or even just for walking; you should always use some shoes that balance your feet and help your knees to stay in the right posture.
Pay attention to the way you run and walk and make sure it is not affecting your knees. Try to always keep your knees with a slight bent.
Follow a routine that suits your needs. Once you start getting used to protecting your knees daily it should start feeling like an unconscious act.

, There are plenty of exercises you can do to strengthen your leg muscles. Building strong muscles around your knee decrease the chance of injury. Even though, swimmers do most of their workout in the water, they also need to develop certain strength doing gym workouts or dry lands.

, While doing intense workouts the muscles need to be at optimal conditions in order to work properly and prevent injuries. Your body requires the right kind of hydration, so it does not start cramping up in the middle of your practice. It’s important that you fuel your body after all the nutrients you lose in a high intensity workout. Many people underestimate the amount of effort involved with swimming, so remember, just because you do not see sweat doesn’t mean it’s not there.

, Being healthy it’s not a one day thing, it’s a lifestyle. The risk of a knee injury decreases with people that are constantly active that has as well a healthy eating habit. If you have a healthy weight it’s less the weight your knees have to handle to your everyday activities. Find the balance in your routine in order to achieve a stable weight and a healthy nutrition.

When you are at the public pool, avoid opening your eyes while you are underwater. Tell your children to also keep their eyes closed when they are under water.


If you want to be able to see underwater, use goggles at the pool to protect your eyes from the contaminated water., Water born illnesses can be spread by swallowing pool water. When you are at the pool, make sure you avoid swallowing any of the pool water. This is true for putting your fingers in your mouth after you have gotten out of the pool when you are still wet or before you have had a chance to shower off the pool water.


Make sure you keep your children's hands out of their mouths as well so they do not get sick.

, Every hour or so, you and your family should take a break from being in the pool. This will give all of you time to go to the restroom, stay hydrated, and rest a little before getting back in.


You should also reapply sunscreen when you are out, since most sunscreens will get washed away after continued exposure to water.

These illnesses are caused by various germs, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, or other microbes found in pools. They can also be caused by the chemicals used in the pool water.


Common germs that cause RWI are E. coli, Cryptosporidium, and norovirus
You come into contact with them through exposure to the water, including swallowing, breathing in the water mist in the air, and other general contact with the infected water., There are a number of types RWIs that you can develop from swimming in public pools. These include eye, ear, skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and wound infections caused by the germs. Common illnesses that are caused by the various waterborne germs are:


Diarrhea, which is the most common
Stomach aches
Bloating
Cramping
Skin rashes
Ear infections

If you are against a more powerful gun, improve your dodging skills.,
Step or run back.,
Run to your side.,
Don't move forward or towards the attacker.,
Also work on aiming.,
Don't hold your shot too long.,
If your opponents are moving backwards or towards you, have your gun pumped and squirt.,
If you have a gun with a trigger, making a very powerful blast is easy.,
Super soaker triggers usually break easily in the Secret Strike and the Flash Flood.,
Once you've learned these tips, practice.",How to Use a Super Soaker," To dodge, NEVER duck. Ducking slows you down, for you have to be upright to dodge and run better. Instead, listen to these dodging skills that will hopefully make you a better dodger. They are just a simple change in direction. Don't, however, move in one direction too long.;
, This will help if you have noticed the shot a bit too late and you are in a rush to prevent yourself from getting wet. This is also a great time to pump your gun with the pressurizer. But be careful, don't move back too long.

, This is a good move in an open area, and will let you strike/shoot when your opponent's shot of water runs short. However, do not run left and then turn right. The slight stop when you change direction is enough to let your opponent get a better idea of where you are and shoot you. In that slight stop. Instead, run left, back, then right.

, This means you get closer to your opponents shot and you will have less time to dodge. It is the way I mostly get soaked.

, Hold your shot for 2 seconds at a time, making sure that you catch your opponent when he/she dodges. Here are the tips for aiming your gun.

, If yo do, the water you squirt will be hard to control, especially if your opponent is dodging side to side. Instead ignore your opponent when they dodge side to side, and dodge yourself.

, If they move a little to the side get them so they turn to the other side. When they do, squirt them.

, Pump the gun with your air pressurizer 3 times before you pull the trigger. The more you pump the better!

, If your trigger broke, when you pump your gun squirts. It will only work on the mode High Powered Steam, or the thin stream. It takes a while to increase distance, but will squirt as long as needed or until the water's out.

, The best way to build dodging skill is to have your friend try to squirt you when your disarmed. Practice this 3-4 times a week. Then play armed to increase aim, which you should practice 2-3 times a week. Then play gun to gun combat with your friend, which you try to do as much as you can.

Plan your dive and ensure that all safety precautions have been taken.,
Know how you will secure the boat, or who will be manning the vessel whilst you are diving.

,
Prepare your BCD, Regulator and other equipment before.

,
Wetsuit divers should put on the bottom layer, however leaving it up only to their waist.,
Put mask/fins/boots/gloves in a dive bag, or other small bag, marked with your name.

Once arrived and secured at the dive site, raise dive flag.

,
Clean your mask out and make sure it is not to tight on your face.,
Wetsuit divers should get ready quickly and first, and get in the water.,
After room in the boat is attained, dry suit divers should get into their suits, helping each other.,
Once everyone is in the water go for your dive, enjoy!

,
When you return, assign one diver to remove their weights and place them into the boat.

,
This diver will remove their BCD and secure it to the boat, before getting up and into the boat.

,
They will then take the other divers weights, organizing them and then instructing the divers, ONE AT A TIME, to take of their BCDs.

,
The diver in the boat will accept each BCD, one at a time, and organize them into a safe location.

,
Then the diver in the boat will de-robe to desired level, and organize their gear.

Knowing your kit is helpful as when others give you advice you need to know what they are talking about.,
Remember that when starting the daggerboard, it should be down at all times.,
Know that there will also be foot straps and a deck plate to hold the rig on.,
Push the board out into deep water until the fin is clear of the bottom.








,
Get a sense of the wind direction, and maneuver the board so that the sail is downwind of the board.








,
Swim or walk to the upwind side and clamber onto the board - elegance is not required!,
Raise to your feet at a slow pace.,
Bend your knees slightly and pull the sail up from the water with the uphaul, hand over hand like hauling in a rope.,
Take hold of the mast with both hands and let it swing.,
Practice steering(called Center of Effort Steering) in the ""safety"" position.,
Start moving.,
Pull with the stern wards hand (the back hand) to accelerate - let it out to slow down.,
Relax!,
Tilt the mast, from the safety position, towards the stern to turn the nose of the board upwind (behind you) or towards the bow to turn downwind (in front of you).








,
Step around the mast, as the nose comes around, to get to the other side.,
Enjoy yourself!








",How to Learn Basic Windsurfing," The kit is divided into two parts; the board and rig. The board is the surfboard-like part you stand on, and has one or more fins and daggerboards (on some models) underwater.






;
, You can do this by pulling the big nob towards the rear, or stern, of the board to lower and towards the front, or bow, to raise when packing away.








, The rig consists of a sail, mast and boom. The boom is the bit you hold on to, but the mast can be used for support. A cord should run from the boom to the bottom of the mast, this is the uphaul and is used to pull the sail up. The boom often has harness lines hanging from it.








,,, Stay on your knees and grab a hold of the uphaul, without pulling up the sail yet.








, Using a beginners board should mean you are pretty stable - rock back and forth on your feet to get a feel for it.








, Try to keep your back and body somewhat upright. If you feel your lower back starting to ache, you are bending over too much.








, This is called the ""safety"" or ""control"" position: total control with next to no power.








, With the mast straight up tilt the mast to your left. Your body should transfer this imbalance(the center of effort of the sail is not balanced with the center of lateral resistance of the board) to the board and make the board turn(or spin) clockwise. Tilt the mast to the right and the board will turn(or spin) counterclockwise(anticlockwise). The stronger the wind and the further you tilt the faster the board will turn(or spin). In a stiff breeze you may be sailing very slowly at this point. Another steering description is as you tilt the mast to the stern the board will head up in to the wind. This is also described in the turning section of this doc. Tilting the mast to the front makes the board bear off from the wind.








, Look and see which side the bow of the board is in relation to you, and place your lower hand on the boom so the mast is leading the sail towards the bow(front). When you feel ready, transfer the other hand to the boom. Don't let the sail pull you down - the mast should be perpendicular to the board, so lean back and keep the arms straight. This is called the Number 7, and that should indicate the posture to you!








, Keep your feet behind the mast foot, with the toes of the front foot facing forwards.








, If you need to stop, return to the safety position, or drop the boom if it is safe to do so. Make sure it goes in front of you, and bear in mind you will get very tired if you have to keep on picking it up!








,, Now you can sail away! This principle works whilst sailing too - tilt the mast forwards and back using the boom to adjust your course!

Consider the alternatives.,
Remove your pad.,
Put the pad onto your bathing suit bottom.,
Pull up your bathing suit and put it on.

,
Consider adding swimming shorts.,
Enjoy your day at the pool!",How to Swim on Your Period with a Pad," Swimming with a pad on isn't necessarily your best option. Pads are designed to absorb liquid, so they will absorb the pool water as well. If you can, use a tampon or a menstrual cup instead.If you don't use a tampon or menstrual cup, you may want to avoid getting your bottom suit wet. If you're at the beach, do some paddling and wading instead of going in all the way. If you're at the pool, consider sitting by the side with your legs in. If you want to go all the way in the water, your best bet is to use a tampon or a menstrual cup.;
, When you are ready to go swimming, take off your pad or liner that you are currently wearing.

, Take it out of the wrapper and stick the back of it onto your bathing suit bottom. Make sure it's a thin one so that it doesn't bulge, and make sure you're wearing a suit that fits snugly to your body. If your pad gets wet, it won't be as sticky anymore, so wearing a tighter suit can help keep it in place.

,, This will help disguise any bulge from your wet pad, and if the material is dark, it will help hide any leakage as well.

, For maximum comfort and hygiene, just stick to paddling and water depths below your waist. If your pad does get wet, it will get soaked with water, so step out of the pool carefully and have a towel handy to cover up the signs of a wet pad.

Loosen and warm your muscles before you swim.,
Decide what stroke you want to focus on.,
Test your ability and set goals for improvement.,
Plan how much you want to improve each day, week and month.,

Follow your instructor's advice.

,
Maintain good head position and overall technique.,
Take your mind off the distance.,
Focus on your breathing.,
Know when you need to rest.,
Recover after each swim.",How to Swim Long Distance,";
, For most long distance competition, freestyle (front crawl) and breaststroke are preferred.

, Go to the pool and swim as much as you can at one time. This will help you set a goal.

, Keep it reasonable. Gradual improvement is the best for the long haul. With a plan for gradual improvement, you will not feel overwhelmed and quit or tax your body beyond what it can reasonably take on.

, You should practice a minimum of three times each week and should have an established routine for each session.

, Consider hiring a coach, or asking a friend who knows about swimming to critique your stroke. Attempting to swim with a rough stroke can be difficult and frustrating. Smoothing your technique will pay dividends: You will swim longer distances with less effort and will be able to stay in the water longer and have more enjoyment while doing so.

, Your stroke will get better and more personalized as you practice.

,, This can help with motivation, goal setting, and technique.

, Many public pools will have a swim clock within easy view of the pool, but if yours does not, ask a friend or family member to time your laps.

,, If you are swimming outside, be aware of impending storms, water temperature, currents, and lake or sea creatures. If it seems unsafe, do not enter the water.

,, These should be considered essential.


A rest stroke will allow you to add distance to your swim while the muscles used for your primary stroke recover.
Develop a comfortable stroke that you can switch to in emergencies, one that you can do for a very long time with little effort. Be ready to switch immediately to this stroke should you become exhausted or panicky. Relax and continue the stroke until you regain composure and energy. During this period, go across the currents until you have reached calmer water.

,, Many swimmers get themselves into trouble by relaxing too much and letting their stroke become lazy. This makes any distance difficult.

, Distracting yourself from the distance you are actually swimming can help if you do not have to keep track of how far you have gone or how fast you are swimming.


One method of doing this is to ""count"" your laps by moving small pebbles or marbles from one container to the other... one per lap. If you count out the marbles/pebbles/objects beforehand, you will not need to keep count while swimming. You'll just be done when all the marbles or pebbles are transferred from one container to the other at the end of the pool.
Waterproof MP3 players are available for reasonable prices (less than $30 USD). These can help distract you from the distance and/or help you set a pace and rhythm.

, Breathe to a rhythm that works for you personally, whether it is every three strokes (arguably the best rhythm) or every stroke. Do not hold your breath for longer than you have prepared for.

, Do not overtire yourself, especially in open water, as this can quickly become dangerous.

, When you come out of the water, rest and be sure to drink water. You need to hydrate or you can get very sick.

Warm up your body and get used to the water.,
Float on your stomach and hold your body in a straight line.,
Press your chest into the water, then release.,
Press your hips into the water at the same time you release your chest.,
Release your hips and again press your chest down.,
Extend your knees as the hips release, letting the undulating motion flow through your legs.,
Snap your feet.,
Repeat the sequence.",How to Swim Like a Mermaid1," Before attempting to swim like a mermaid, you need to make sure you are comfortable and confident in the water. Swim a few laps without holding onto the pool sides or another person, tread water for a minute, and practice floating on your front, back, and flipping from back to front.If you cannot easily complete this warm up, then you may need to practice your basic swimming skills before attempting to swim like a mermaid. The dolphin kick requires a lot of power, and you need to be able to hold your breath underwater.If you feel nervous or panicked, concentrate on building up your confidence in the water before you do anything else. Work with a coach or parent to get your swimming skills to a level where you feel comfortable swimming on your own.;
, Your body and head should be parallel to the bottom of the swimming pool.Your arms can be at your sides or stretched out in front of you, hands clasped, like a spear.
Your legs and feet should be kept together, with your feet pointed.
Do not lock your knees., Keep your core tight, holding your shoulders and arms still.

, Your legs should follow the hips in that downward motion, knees slightly bent.,,, The full motion should resemble a whip cracking, with your feet the tip of the whip. It should be fluid, never jerky.Imagine a wave or undulating motion passing through your body, from you hips to your toes.

, So, when you press your chest down, your hips are moving up, and when you press your hips down, your chest is moving up. Your legs should follow the movement of your hips."

Remember that the monofin is not meant as an aid for new swimmers.,
Find the right monofin.,
Practice using the monofin in a pool.,
Dolphin kick with your monofin.,
Practice until you feel confident using the monofin.",How to Swim Like a Mermaid2," Swimming with a monofin will add power to your kick and may take you further and deeper into the water than you realize. If you are not a strong swimmer, don't know how to hold your breath, or become nervous or panicked in the water, then it is dangerous for you to swim with a monofin., Your safety and comfort depend on finding a monofin that fits correctly and isn't too heavy. A heavy monofin can weigh you down in the water and cause you to tire quickly.Women should start with a fin one size lower than their shoe size; men should start with the same size fin as their shoe size.If the monofin pinches, rubs your feet, or it is difficult to get your foot in the pocket, try a larger size.Sit down and shake your feet in all directions. If the fin moves around on your feet, try a smaller size. It should be snug (but not uncomfortable)., Eliminating the variables of wind, waves, a current, and the possibility of reefs or seaweed will allow you to concentrate solely on getting used to your monofin., Allow yourself to get used to the feeling of the fin keeping your legs and feet together and the added weight of the fin. Notice how far you can propel yourself with one kick.


Keep your arms still at your sides or stretched in front of you in a spear shape. Using your arms is unnecessary and will just make you tired faster.,


Don't bounce or stand on the tip of the monofin, especially if it is bent backwards. You may break the fin."

Make or buy a mermaid tail.,
Practice swimming with your mermaid tail in a pool before you hit the open water.,
Don't rub or flick your tail against rough surfaces, like the bottom of the pool.",How to Swim Like a Mermaid3," There are many online stores that sell mermaid tails in different colors and fabrics. Make sure you use the sizing guide before ordering your tail.

If you are swimming in a public pool, be sure you talk to the lifeguard or pool manager before swimming in your tail. If they don't want you to swim where kids are playing, ask if you can use one of the lanes for swimming laps.Swim in your tail only with adult supervision.

, You want to keep your tail in tip-top shape, and this can damage and tear the fabric.

Get a snorkel and mask you feel comfortable with.,
Put on the mask and tug the straps until it feels comfortably sealed around your eyes and nose.,
Lay flat in the water on your stomach.,
Bite gently down on the mouthpiece of the snorkel.,
Take slow, regular breaths in and out through the tube.,
Wear a buoyancy vest.",How to Snorkel1," Try them on and adjust the straps until it fits. If you can, try them on in the water to make sure there are no leaks.


If you have bad eyesight, consider getting a prescription-adjusted mask to help you see underwater without your glasses or using contact lenses. Disposable ones are great for snorkelling in.;
, Make sure the snorkel tube is close to your mouth, but don't put it in yet.

, Place your face in the water at about a 45 degree angle.

, Allow your lips to seal around it and hold the snorkel in place.

, Breath slowly, deeply and cautiously with your mouth through your snorkel. No need to panic: you can always lift your head above water if you want. Just relax and become aware of your breaths. The sound of your breathing through the snorkel barrel should become quite noticeable. Once you get into a rhythm, relax and enjoy the underwater scenery.

, This makes floating on the surface of the water with minimal effort much easier. Many commercial snorkeling locations require a colorful life vest to be worn for safety reasons.

Choose your dive operator carefully.,
Ensure your boat skipper drops you in the correct place on the reef if you are doing a boat entry.,
Check your buoyancy.,
Ensure that you know exactly where your feet are.,
Be gentle when you stop and stabilize yourself.,
Observe and take photos or videos, but do not take any specimens home with you.",How to Protect the Environment when Scuba Diving," Find out if they have good references, research their safety record and check their website to see if they are involved in any conservation or research projects. A good dive operator should have all this information available to the public.;
, You do not want to be dropping straight down onto coral, so pick a spot just up current from the reef so you land in sand and can drift onto the reef. This will ensure a more comfortable dive all round. Do not drop anchor on the reef. If you're doing a shore entry, be careful of the many marine organisms that live in the shallow intertidal areas, walk gently.

, If you are a beginner and battle with buoyancy, then stay a few meters above the reef. Poor buoyancy control will have you sinking down onto the delicate coral and doing damage.

, Your fins are the biggest problem when diving; you may be inadvertently kicking and breaking coral without even knowing it. Buoyancy control is king here.

, If you want to look at something close up, gently get an open spot on a rock where you can touch gently with your finger and hold yourself steady. It works amazingly well. Never come to rest on the reef itself, especially when trying to get close up macro photographs.

, Remember, you are a visitor in this underwater world. Do not take anything from the reef except photographs. Do your part to ensure your dive buddies and fellow divers follow these rules too. Look out for marine aquarium collectors removing live fish from the reef and let them know how you feel about their actions. Raise awareness for the conservation of reefs and you'll be doing your bit for conserving reefs when you dive.

Think of a stroke that you would like to improve your technique on.,
Watch some videos or read some books about that stroke.,
Practise!,
Repeat this on all three of the other swim strokes.,
Find a local swimming club in your area to keep committed.",How to Swim Like the Pros1," If you can't decide, then just pick a stroke name out of a hat. The main stroke is the front crawl, but many people struggle with butterfly the most. Whichever stroke you choose, however good you are at it at the start, learning the perfect technique for that stroke will help you with all of the others.;
, The best book for freestyle is ""Swim Smooth,"" but there are other good books out there for other strokes. There are also many internet pages that will help you with your technique!

, Just go down to your local pool and practise all that you have learnt. Try using a lane and just swim up and down until you get it right. You can go along with a friend to keep you company or just enjoy the time by yourself. The more often you go, the better you'll get and the quicker it'll be before everyone is awed by your wonderful swimming strokes.

, It will be easier the next time as you will have picked up things from your last stroke. By the time you reach the last stroke, it should hardly take any time at all.

, This will give you professional coaching so that you'll be able to keep on improving as time goes on. In turn, if your club is competitive, this will give you a chance to swim and race against others and help you reach graded meet times for harder galas.

Breath cautiously.,
Hold your breath and place your head below the water, submerging the end of the snorkel.,
Surface your head without lifting it out of the water.,
Exhale through your mouth quickly and forcefully into the snorkel.,
Expel any remaining amount of water with a second forceful blast.,
Master airway control.,
Learn to dive.",How to Snorkel2," On any snorkeling adventure you are bound to get some water in your tube at some point, sometimes either due to surf conditions or excessive splashing, or by letting your head dip too low in the water. Learning to clear your snorkel will keep this from being a cumbersome disruption to your experience.

, You should feel that water is entering the snorkel barrel.

, Make sure the end of the tube is in the air this time.

, This blast method of snorkel clearing will remove nearly all the water from your snorkel.

, By repeating the blast method you should clear any water that enters into the snorkel.

, Sometimes you will get water in your tube when you have no air in your lungs. If there is only a little water, inhale slowly and carefully without letting water into your mouth until you have enough air for a full blast. If there is too much, you will need to lift your head out of the water and take a breath around the mouthpiece.

, Once you get adept at clearing your airway, you can consider diving below the surface of the water to get a better look at something nifty. Take a deep breath and swim down. When you need a breath, surface, keeping your face underwater, and clear your flooded snorkel tube like you practiced.

Use fins on your feet.,
Hold your arms at your sides to reduce drag and extend your legs so that the fins are pointed behind you.,
With your knees slightly bent, kick slowly and powerfully with the fins.,
Kick farther down and less upwards whilst arching your back upward.,
Keep your fins below the water when kicking.,
Float with the waves.,
Swim at a steady comfortable pace to conserve your energy.",How to Snorkel3," Wearing fins will amplify your movements and let you move forward quickly without a lot of disruptive splashing.

, Keep your legs fairly close together.

, Keep your fin stroke movements smooth and relaxed. Try to move from the hip to make use of your thigh muscles and avoid kicking with your knees, as this will only waste your energy.

, The right snorkeling technique to power yourself forward with the downward strokes.

, Try to avoid splashing, as this will scare off the fish and can be annoying to other swimmers around you.

, Snorkeling is best done on gentle waters, but even there you should learn to adjust your movements to the up and down surging of the waves.

, Snorkeling is not a race, and a good session can last for hours.

"
"
Pick the right spot.,
Go out on a sunny day.,
Learn to recognize different fish and coral.",How to Snorkel4," You want to snorkel in an area that has relatively calm waters and a vibrant mix of benign marine life. Shallow waters above coral reefs are great, as are some deeper spots best accessed by boat. Ask locals or check guidebooks to find the best spots that aren't too full of other swimmers.

, Even with a mask it's hard to see much underwater if the sky is dark and gloomy. Snorkel in the middle of a bright day when the water is clear of silt. Storms tend to churn up silt that clouds the water, so if it rained last night you may want to put your adventure off by a day.

, Seen one fish, seen them all? Not if you know what you are looking at. Memorize the shapes and colors of different kinds of fish that inhabit your local beaches and you can turn your simple swim into an aquatic zoological survey. If you see a fish you don't recognize, try to remember its patterns and look it up later.

Always ask your coach what to enter before entering a gala.,
Never enter too many events.,
Focus whilst in the marshalling area.,
Eat well.,
Prepare the night before.",How to Swim Like the Pros2," This will make sure that you are racing the correct races for someone of your swimming standard. If you believe this is wrong, enter what you think is right for you to enter but make sure you are not going too far outside the guidelines you have been set!

, If you do, you will get too tired and won't be able to swim your best race. To ensure this doesn't happen, enter a variety of events during each gala and don't enter more than 2 events per session unless this is your last session before you go home.

, If people around you are messing about, don't join in. Breathe deeply, relax and focus on what you are going to work on during the race itself. Drink plenty of water and go to the toilet if you need to but refrain from eating once you have been sent to race. It is good to move around a bit to keep your muscles warm but don't go crazy otherwise all of your energy will be lost.

, Eating a meal such as chicken salad or red meat with potatoes the night before a gala is very good. Even though pasta gives you a lot of energy, it needs to be eaten at least 12 hours (preferably 24!) before your first race otherwise it won't digest properly and will sit like lead in your stomach. Sweetcorn is also to be avoided as that is very heavy on your intestines. If you want a dessert with your food, have jelly as that is known to give you some good energy - especially if you buy the sugar free version. A good breakfast would be a weetabix drink, an actimel yogurt and a banana.

, To avoid stress on the gala morning, pack your bag the night before It should be a good size and contain your swimwear, 2 towels (one to sit on and another to dry yourself with), a swim cap along with a spare, at least 2 pairs of goggles that are adjusted to fit you, a t-shirt/hoodie to wear when you're not racing, flip-flops to wear on poolside, plenty of snacks and a packed lunch if you are there all day. You should have lots of water which you can put in your bag just before you leave the house.

Never go skinny dipping while drunk.,
Do not let your friends take pictures.,
Don’t go if you feel uncomfortable.,
Don’t go alone.",How to Skinny Dip," Public nudity is illegal in most parts of the United States, and some areas of other countries. If you're planning on skinny dipping, choose an area that's been specifically designated as a nude or clothing-optional beach, or strip down in a private lake or pool. It's a good idea to check up on local regulations before you take the plunge.


Your friend’s pool is the best bet, but it’s hardly the most exciting. If you are planning on doing it somewhere public, make sure you have a plan to avoid getting caught, too. Skinny-dipping is not as much fun when there are fines involved.;
, Though all your friends will have to know eventually, you’ll have a stronger argument if you have a friend backing you up. Talk to one of your best buds about getting everyone on board for skinny dipping. Together the two of you can divide and conquer.


Let’s say there’s a party or a get-together some night. After a meaningful head nod or brief text conversation, you can broach the topic and get everyone jazzed. When you two are super excited, people will feel compelled to be excited, too, and not feel like boring dissenters.

, There is probably a perfect opportunity coming up, like a pool party, that made you think of this idea. But if there isn’t, you’ll have to plan when to have it all go down. And better yet – morning or night?


It’s best to do it as part of a vacation or an after-party. This way everyone is bustling and ready to go and feeding off the energy of the occasion. If a party isn’t coming up, schedule one!
Night-time skinny dipping adds a sense of adventure and can help the more self-conscious come out of their shells. But daytime skinny dipping is an option, too, especially if you're somewhere private. And hello to no tan lines.

, Yes, spontaneous skinny dipping is a thing, but pre-meditated skinny dipping generally works a lot better. With the right crowd, shedding your clothes and hoping everyone follows suit could work, but you’re better off giving everyone notice. Imagine if you went for it and everyone just looked at you like a loon.


Why is this so beneficial? Most people are self-conscious and worried about what they’ll look like. Giving them some notice gives them time to shave or, to be frank, wear a tampon. Let them primp beforehand to up your chances of making it a group endeavor.

, Don't try to break out the skinny dipping at the beginning of a party or gathering. Instead, let things wind down a little bit. Wait until after everyone's arrived, eaten and had time to mingle. When the mood seems mellow, get ready to bring up the topic.


You’ll probably also want to wait for the sun, too. Sunrise, sunset, and when the moon is high in the sky are all great times to skinny dip.
If you’re doing it illegally, the timing is right when the authorities are gone. You’ll need to familiarize yourself with their check-up schedule and act accordingly.

, You can either announce to the people around you that it’s skinny dipping time, or simply walk to the water and start undressing. In either case, encourage the person you talked to in Step 2 to join in. Everyone else will start to get jazzed about the idea when they see another person join.


If you're feeling particularly bold, pull an attention-grabbing stunt. If everybody's practicing their cannonballs and you're up on the diving board, take your suit off at that moment. You'll make a bigger ""skinny-dipping entrance.""

, You won't feel comfortable getting naked if you're extremely critical or self-conscious about the way that you look. Take your clothes off without hesitation, and without grimacing at your perceived flaws. Think positive things about yourself, and focus on the body parts you like. No one is perfect, so learn to appreciate the body that you have.


Encourage the people around you to be confident, as well. If any friends are hesitant about joining you, try to help them see that flaws are no big deal and that they look fine. Self-consciousness is one of the biggest mental barriers to skinny dipping.

, When you’re down to your skivvies, take a moment to put your clothes in the right place. If you’re in public, you want them somewhere accessible to you but not accessible to others. In other words, somewhere nearby but hidden.


Sometimes there’s that person in the group who thinks it’d be funny to steal everyone’s clothes. This is the person you’re accounting for. However, there’s also strength in numbers and visibility: you could also leave everyone’s clothes in a big pile right in front of everyone. That way they’re right there and no one will be tempted to try to be sneaky.

, A more modest approach to skinny dipping is to shed your clothes and jump in with your underwear on. Consider yourself so excited to skinny dip that you couldn’t even wait to shed them all. Then, once half-concealed by that sparkly shield of H20, the underwear comes off.


It’s likely others will find this comforting, since plenty of people are nervous about being naked (and jumping around) in front of their peers. If you do it this way, you might find that your friends are less hesitant to join in your fun.

, Swim, splash around and dive. Be careful about brushing up against other dippers, unless you're sure they're receptive to the contact. Try to keep the mood light and make the event fun, not weird.


While you're playing, keep an eye out on your surroundings, especially if you're somewhere you shouldn't be. If someone else is uncomfortable skinny dipping, tell them you need a lookout anyway – this way they can feel less embarrassed about being embarrassed.

, Though being drunk often makes it easy to think skinny dipping is a good idea, it’s not. It is straight up unsafe to swim while drunk. Imagine if one of your friends started choking and you were too drunk to help – not quite the fun you had planned.


If any of your friends is drunk, consider all bets as off. Make sure the party beforehand is relatively tame or that people get some time to come down from their buzz before you all dip into the water.

, A good adventure can easily get ruined by a nude picture scandal (just ask almost every celebrity ever). What’s more, if you’re somewhere it’s illegal to be skinny dipping, you do not want proof floating around. All phones and cameras need to stay away from the water.


Again, be courteous of your friends. Most people do not want pictures of themselves to be public domain. The night will just turn into something you regret.

, If you’ve changed your mind or there’s something off about the particular moment, don’t go. No one is pressuring you. You’re still cool. If you were the instigator, know that you don’t owe anyone an explanation. You’re just not feeling it.


This goes double if someone is making you feel uncomfortable. Let’s say you were at this party ready to go, and there’s been a creeper on the prowl all night long that’s been hitting on you and getting all lusty. Do not swim around naked in front of the person – that’s practically inviting trouble to your door. You need to trust the people you’re around.

, Consider two situations:


If you’re in a public area, do not go skinny dipping alone. You could be found, your clothes and valuables could be stolen, and a number of ensuing unfortunate instances could arise. It’s safer to do in numbers.
If your friends aren’t up for it, don’t go by yourself. All of a sudden you’ll become the naked person that makes others feel slightly uncomfortable. That’s a title that’ll be hard to get rid of. Save it for when other people are feeling it, too.

Identification;
",How to Prepare for a White Water Rafting Trip," White water rivers have rapid classifications ranging from I to VI which indicate the level of difficulty. Class I is the easiest type of rapid to navigate and Class VI is the most difficult and dangerous type of rapid. Class VI rapids are not run on commercial rafting trips, and usually not navigable at all.


Find out the difficulty level of the river, and when is the best time to raft.
Check water temperatures so you can take the right rafting clothes.
Find a reputable rafting outfitter. Check online for reviews from travel review web sites, call the local chamber of commerce or business bureau, or contact the parks and recreation service in the area and ask about the company you are considering.
Buy a guidebook for the river you plan to raft. Many guidebooks include classification of each rapid, seasonal water levels, temperatures, maps and other helpful information. You can also search online or contact a local ranger service in the area.
Detail the needs of your rafting party to the rafting company. If you plan to raft with children, people with disabilities, or other special needs, discuss this in advance with the rafting company.
Ask the white water rafting company about the rapids. Be sure that you and the members of your party are physically, emotionally and mentally capable of running the river. Everyone in your party must be prepared to swim in swift rapids, do self-rescue, rescue other swimmers, and follow the instruction of the raft guide without question.

, The weight of the raft is important when navigating class III and higher rapids, so your rafting guide may combine your group with another group to be sure the raft is balanced. If you have a large group, you may be split up into separate rafts.

, You must paddle exactly when and how your guide tells you to. If one person does not paddle in time with the other rafters, the raft may go off course and into dangerous waters. White water rafting requires every paddler in the raft to use their strength as a sort of engine for the boat, while your guide steers you through rapids.

, A bathing suit is not the best choice in white water because if you fall out the raft, the suit gets pulled by the swift water, rescue attempts and boat re-admission. Wear board shorts and a t-shirt in warm conditions. Don't wear heavy cotton in cold weather, it does not dry easily and provides not warmth. Take dry clothes for after rafting.

, Closed toe shoes with good gripping soles are best. Don't wear flip-flops or anything that comes off easily. Take an extra pair of shoes to change into after rafting.

Pick a Shark.,
Have many Minnows.,
Start the game.",How to Play Sharks and Minnows1," Choose a player to be the Shark. This player is now “it” and stands in the center of the pool (the “ocean”).


When playing with a lot of people in a large area, you can play with more than one Shark. 10 Minnows to 1 Shark is a good ratio.
If many people want to be the Shark you can decide by flipping a coin, or playing rock, paper, scissors.;
, Everyone who isn't a Shark is a Minnow. Minnows form a line at one end of the pool deck, facing the Shark. There should be at least twice as many Minnows as Sharks.

, To start, the Shark yells, ""fishy, fishy, cross my ocean"", or some variation of that.When the Minnows hear this call, they jump into the pool and start to make their way to the opposite end. The Shark must remain in place above water until the next call.Experienced swimmers can challenge themselves by requiring players to dive, cannonball, or can-opener into the pool.

Choose one person to be ""Marco."",
Have Marco count to ten before searching for anybody.,
Have Marco shout ""Marco"" while everyone else answers by shouting ""Polo."",
Marco should follow the sounds of the other people and try to tag them.,
The Polos should move away from Marco to avoid being caught.,
When Marco tags somebody, he or she will become the new Marco and the game will start over.",How to Play Marco Polo1," This person will try to catch everyone else. ""Marco"" can also be known as ""It"". Think of is as playing a variation of tag -- in the water! The person who is ""Marco"" has to have his eyes closed the entire time.






;
, All players should start out in the pool. Marco should stand in place, counting loudly to ten, giving the players enough time to disperse. They'll want to be as far away from Marco as possible to avoid getting caught -- unless they're risky players who like living on the edge! Once he counts to ten, he can begin searching for people, but he has to keep his eyes closed.








, Marco can yell ""Marco"" as often as he likes. Hearing the other players respond ""Polo"" can help him figure out where they are, allowing him to swim or walk closer to the others.









The players who are trying to escape Marco must shout ""Polo"" every time he or she shouts ""Marco."" The only exception is that they don't have to shout it, obviously, if they're under the water.
If a player above water does not shout ""Polo!"" and Marco suspects he knows who it is, then he can say, ""I know that (player's name here) didn't shout Polo!"" If the other players agree with him, then that person has been caught, and he has to be the new Marco! The game starts over!

, You can swim or just walk in the water. To stay safe, keep your hands out in front of you. You don't want to suddenly run or dart into a wall. You can even keep one hand on the edge of the pool as you move around, so you know where you are. Also, if you're walking, watch out for walking into the deep end and make sure you're prepared to swim.








, If you're running from Marco, then you should be quick on your feet, prepared to dart away at any moment. You can also go underwater and swim in a different direction after shouting ""Polo"" to confuse Marco. If he's close to you, change the path you were moving in to throw him off.









Before you start the game, you should decide whether you can also move outside the pool. Some versions of the game allow for this, while others allow you to be out of the pool as long as one body part always remains in the water. This can make the game even more fun, but you have to make sure not to run outside the pool, which is very dangerous!
You can also play the game using the ""Fish out of water"" rule. Under this rule, if you allow players to be out of the water, then Marco has the right to yell ""Fish out of water"" at any time. Once he does this, he can open his eyes -- if he sees that one player is out of the water, then he is right, and that person is the new ""Marco"" and the game starts over. If multiple players are out of the water, then Marco has the power to choose whomever he wants to be it!

, Once Marco tags a person, he or she will become the new Marco, and the player will close his or her eyes, count to ten, and prepare to tag all of the Polos once more. Keep playing the game for as long as you like -- it usually only takes a few minutes for Marco to tag somebody and for the fun to start right from the beginning!









You can set a rule for what it means for Marco to ""tag"" someone during the game. Does he have to use his hands to tag someone, or does just touching that person, even if it just means his leg brushes up against the other player, mean that the person has been tagged?

Avoid the Shark.,
Play until there is a winner.,
Start with a new Shark.",How to Play Sharks and Minnows2," Once everyone is in the water the Shark yells, ""Sharks and Minnows!"" or ""Shark attack!"" at any time to start “tagging” players. When the Shark yells this, the Minnows' goal is to reach the other end of the pool without being tagged by the Shark.If the Shark tags a Minnow, that Minnow becomes a Sharkand joins the Shark's team. They now begin tagging Minnows to turn them into Sharks.
When the Minnows have made it to the other side of the pool without being tagged, they wait. The Shark calls “fishy, fishy...” again and they try to return to the other side of the pool. The original Shark calls, ""Shark Attack"" and the process repeats.

, The last remaining Minnow is the winner. This player becomes the Shark in the next round.It becomes harder as more and more Minnows become Sharks. The game lasts until there is only one Minnow left.


If you started out with more than one Shark, the last two Minnows become the next Sharks.

, Begin the next game with the winner from the last round, the new Shark. They now stand in the center of the pool and the Minnows line up on the pool deck facing the Shark. Let the game begin.

Make new tagging rules.,
Have more than one Shark.,
Choose different animals.,
Play on dry land.,
Make your Shark blind.,
Add obstacles.,
Transform extra Sharks into seaweed.",How to Play Sharks and Minnows3," Once you've become an expert at the game you can add your own rules to enhance it.


Make it a rule that the Shark can only tag Minnows who have their head above water.It’s fun to challenge yourself but never put your life in danger. Be cautious and make sure swimmers can make it from one side of the pool to the other in one breath.

, Add more Sharks so the Minnows have to swim faster and be more creative to get to the other side without being tagged.

, Instead of Sharks and Minnows, you can use Cat and Mouse, Cheetah and Gazelle, or Fox and Rabbit. , If you don't have access to a pool, or if the pool is too crowded to play, move to a field or gym. This version is played year-round and can usually accommodate more players. Make sure to swap your swim trunks for sneakers.


Cones, tape, or basketball court lines are used to mark the boundaries. These will be the spots where players will start and end.If you want to minimize contact, you can have players tuck a towel into their shorts, to act as a “tail.” Instead of tagging players, the Shark will pull their tail., Have the Shark close their eyes or turn their back until they hear a Minnow swimming. They must tag players by following their sounds.


In this version, Minnows can exit the pool and try to walk to the other end of the pool without being seen or heard. If the Shark does hear them then the Shark will yell, ""fish out of water"" and the Minnow must start over., Place pool floats around the pool. If a player bumps into one, send them back to the beginning or make them sit through a time out.

, In this version, instead of becoming Sharks when tagged, players become seaweed. They must stay still and can only reach as far as arm's length to tag other Minnows who then become seaweed as well.If a seaweed touches a Shark, it turns back into a Minnow and can continue swimming to the end of the pool."
"
Set the boundaries.,
Decide on the rules.,
Decide who will be ""it"".,
Have the person who is ""it"" count underwater.,
Play until the next person gets tagged.",How to Play Marco Polo2," Blind tag, for lack of a better term, played in the pool, is like Marco Polo, except the people not it are encouraged not to make noise. The game should stay in the shallow end. If you can, tie a line to separate the deep end of the pool from the shallow end of the pool.








, How long will the ""it"" person have to count for before the game can start? Does it count as ""tagging"" if the person who is ""it"" tags the person with his or her foot? Can the players who are not ""it"" go out of water at all, or do they have to stay in the pool?








, You can randomly choose, you can all shout, ""1, 2, 3, not it!"" or you can let someone who wants to be it go first. It doesn't matter who starts, and chances are, everyone will get a turn.








, Typically, the person should count to 10. He or she can also count above water if that's best. When the counting is over, the fun can begin! The other people should use this time to assume a tactical position, not cornered, but not too open, and as far away from ""it"" as possible. Unlike in Marco Polo, there is no shouting or talking, and the people who are escaping ""it"" should try to be as quiet as possible.








, Since the game will be quiet, the person who is ""it"" should try to pick up on where people are by the sounds they make in the water. He may also hear people randomly giggling or breathing close by. It's hard to stay completely quiet in the water! The person should just be careful not to move around too fast, and should keep his arms out in front of him, to avoid running into walls.









Once someone is tagged, the new person who is ""it"" can count to ten and start the game all over again. The fun can continue for as long as you want. It's best played when there's no one else around -- if you're darting around with your eyes closed and there are strangers around, you are bound to annoy one of them pretty quickly! Have fun playing ""blind tag"" for as long as you want!

Buy a roll of plastic sheeting.,
Choose your sliding location.,
Secure a water supply.,
Roll out the plastic sheeting.,
Anchor the sheet to the ground.,
Spray the slide with water.,
Slip.,
Be safe and respect other sliders.",How to Make a Slip and Slide," Visit the nearest all-purpose hardware store, and buy a 10 x 100 foot (3 x 30 meter) roll of plastic sheeting.









Look for sheeting in the paint supply section. You should be able to find a sufficient roll for $5-30 USD.You may find rolls of various lengths available; have a slipping-and-sliding space in mind while you're making your purchase, and try to buy a roll that will fit that space. If you're just using a backyard, 20-30 feet should suffice; if you'll be using a large, grassy hill, or a public park, you may plan for a 50-foot, 100-foot, or 200-foot slide. Remember that you can always fold the sheet over if it's too long or too wide, and you can always tape the ends of two sheets together to make an extra-long slide.
Find the thickest plastic that you can.The sheet should be at least 4-6 feet wide--broad enough that you won't slide off halfway down the slide. As a rough rule of thumb: the longer the slide, the wider it should be.
You may also consider using a standard tarp, although most tarps may not be long enough for a quality slide. If you're setting up a slide in your yard, then a large tarp should suffice. Tarps tend to be thicker and sturdier than plastic sheeting, but they're also much more expensive. Find the longest, thinnest tarp that you can.;
, You'll need a large, soft, grassy area, preferably on a slope. Consider building a slide on the beach. Make sure that you'll be able to access a water supply.








Make sure to choose a spot where you won't run into a driveway, a road, or any trees. Check for obstacles in the path of the slide: potholes in the grass, small bushes or stumps, or rocks that could be painful to a slider. Avoid all potential hazards.
A grassy, gently-sloped hill is ideal, if you can find one. The steeper the hill, the faster you'll go--and the more likely that you'll take a tumble off the slide on the way down! #*Carefully consider who will be riding this slide. If you're making a slide for young children, choose a shorter, flatter run--a gentle, grassy backyard is perfect. If you're a teenager or an adult making a slide for other teenagers or adults, feel free to chase the adrenaline and pick the biggest hill you can find. Slide at your own risk.
Make sure that the end of slide is safe, soft, and flat. Ideally, your slip-and-slide should run out onto a long, grassy lawn. You'll be coming down the slide pretty quickly, so be sure that you have plenty of room to land. Keep the end of the run far away from potentially painful surfaces: rocks, sidewalks, roads, walls. Consider running the slide out into a body of water: a pool, a pond, or a river.Always have an adult confirm that the space is safe to use. Better safe than sorry!

, You'll need to keep the slide constantly lubricated to ensure a smooth and slippery sliding experience.









If you're setting up the slide in the yard of your house, you can just use a standard garden hose. If you have any sort of spigot attachments--a spray hose, for instance--feel free to use it for more control.
If you're slipping and sliding away from home--say, on a grassy hill, or in a public park--look around for a spigot. If you can find a spigot, then consider bringing a hose from home to hook up, but be aware that your community may frown upon you tapping into the municipal water supply.
If you're away from home and you can't find a spigot, then you'll need to supply your own water. Bring a few buckets, and fill them up with water at the nearest tap. Pour out the water at the top of the slide and let it run down. Return to the tap to refill as needed. Your supply is low, so you shouldn't pour the water out until right before someone rides the slide.
Check the forecast for rain. If it's going to rain soon, or if it's raining already, you can embrace the downpour as a natural lubricant for your slip-and-slide. On a drizzly day, set the slide out in the rain and allow it to grow slick with running water. Be warned: things might get muddy.

, When you're ready to set up the slide, spread your sheeting out over the sliding run.









Make sure that the sheeting is as straight as possible. Smooth out any wrinkles. Align the course along the natural slope of the hill. You will start at the top (or on the hillside) and end up at the bottom.
Fold the sheeting as needed to get the size and shape that you want. If you want a narrower slide, stick to 4-6 feet wide. If you prefer a wider slide, leave the sheeting as wide as you bought it. Use your best judgement, and above all make the slide safe.
Remember: the longer the slide, the more time you'll have to tumble off the sides, especially if you start sliding at an angle. Consider leaving the slide wide for extra-long sheets.
Consider holding the sheet taut, with one person holding each corner in the air, in order to ensure that it's been completely unfurled.

, You want to slip and slide on the slip-and-slide, but you don't want the slip-and-slide to slip and slide around while you're slipping and sliding. This is especially important for longer slides and slides on hills.









Use metal stakes or tent pegs to hold the corners in place. You may want to stake down the edges of longer slides, at intervals, to ensure that everything stays where it should.
You can use heavy objects to weigh down the corners of the slide, but don't use anything that will injure you if you run into at a high speed. Buckets and plastic containers (filled with water for weight) are good; chairs are good; anything that you can knock over without hurting yourself is good; anything soft but dense (like a hay bale) is good. Cinderblocks, heavy rocks, and bricks are not good; sharp objects are not good; anything that you wouldn't want to smash against your face is not good.
Make sure that the slide is secured in place. Once people start sliding down the sheet, it will shift around and bunch up into itself unless you've stretched it taut. If you plan ahead, you'll save yourself the trouble of pausing the fun to adjust it later.
A smoother slide is a safer slide. If the sheet bunches up, wrinkles, and shifts around, the water won't flow smoothly, and riders will be more likely to tumble off-course. This is especially true of long slides.

, If you have access to a hose, use a hose. If you don't, use a bucket to carry water to the slide. The larger the slide, the more water you'll need.









Make sure to soak the entire length of the slide. If your slide lies on a slope, you can leave a hose running at the top so that a continuous stream of water courses down the sheet. You can do the same thing with a bucket, but be sparing if you're working with a limited supply.
If you aren't running a hose continuously--whether it's a conscious effort to preserve water, or just because you're using a bucket--try to splash the slide directly before someone takes a ride. Make sure that the slide is consistently wet, from top to bottom. It's most important that the slide is wet at its beginning end.
Consider adding a few cups of soap or detergent to the water, or pouring soap at the head of the slide. You can also use, say, bubble bath. The detergent will mix with the water and make for a delightfully slippery experience. Be careful not to get any soap in your eyes; consider wearing goggles in particularly soapy situations.
If you're sliding in the rain, wait for the downpour to thoroughly drench the plastic sheeting. If it's wet and slick, you should be good to go. Be aware the rain might make for a muddy situation.
Test out the slide Have a responsible person give the tarp a few test runs, just to be sure that it's safe. Make sure that there's plenty of room to stop at the end of the slide. Once you're given the go-ahead: limber up. It's time to slip and slide!

, Slide. Start at the top of the slide, feel the water rushing around you, and push yourself into the stream. Keep your eyes on the prize: the end of the slide. Try to keep your body still. Go with the flow.









Flat-ground technique (diving): If you don't have a hill to get you going down the slide, you'll need to create the initial force yourself. Stand 10-15 feet behind the slide to give yourself a running start, and make sure that your runway is clear. Sprint straight toward the slide. When you're a step or two away, tuck your body low and dive onto your belly. Don't dive deep, as if you were going into a swimming pool; dive forward onto the slide, parallel with the ground. Think of it like bowling, or skipping a rock: release yourself low so that you aren't falling, but rather sliding. Ride the slide as far as it will take you, and get off quickly.
Flat-ground technique (standing): Instead of diving onto the slide, you're going to try to ride it like a surfboard. Run on to the sheet and plant your feet--you may need to jump onto the sheet to really get going. Ride the slide as far as you can go, and try to keep your balance. This may be much more difficult than it sounds. Consider sliding on your knees, your back, or your bum, to taste.
Slope technique (beginners): Sit at the top of the slide and feel the water rushing around you. Look down the slope and make sure that this is something you want to do. Use your arms and legs to scoot yourself along until the natural slope of the hill carries you down. If the slope doesn't carry you fast enough for your liking, consider laying on your back (like a luge) or on your stomach, face down (which may be harder to escape). Once you really get going, stay with the stream of water and try not to tumble off the sides of the slide. The longer you ride--and the steeper the section of the hill you're on--the faster you'll go. Ride the slide out to the bottom of the run and try to spill out gracefully onto the lawn at the end. Remember: there's no shame in taking a spill off of the slide if you aren't comfortable with the speed.
Slope technique (advanced): Get a running start. Make sure there's no one in your way. Spring or jog toward the slide. You can choose to dive headfirst onto the slide or to stay standing. If you're on a slope, you'll need to be especially sure to stay on course. Let the stream of water guide you. To build speed, try to stay in the center of the slide. Point your eyes toward the end of the slide and try to keep your balance. Ride the slide as far as it will take you, and get off quickly to make room for the next rider.

,









Before you slide, make sure that there's no one standing, sitting, or laying in the way. Look out for rocks, pavement, and other potentially painful surfaces.It's better to take a spill into the grass than to run into someone else at full speed.
After you ride as far as you can go, get off the slide quickly to make way for the next slider. If it's a long slide, and the next slider can't tell whether you've gotten off, yell ""All clear!"" to give the go-ahead.

There should only be one Willy. But if there is an uneven number of players, a second Willy could be added to change the game a bit (both Willys must make it to shore for the guardians to lose).
The Willy starts deep enough for people to swim around him/her. Neck-deep on a shallow shore seems to work well. The Willy also starts frozen (at the pre-determined starting locations).;
, This team is the only team that can get points. The guardians guard the Willy and prevent the ""freers"" from getting to Willy, to prevent Willy from getting to shore, and ultimately freeze all the freers.


There should be one guardian for every two freers.
The guardian(s) are near the Willy, but should be required to maintain a set distance away from the Willy (depending on the talent and difficulty of the players).

, Their goal is to allow the Willy to make it to shore. The freers can remain anywhere else in the play-area, as long as they remain partially in the water (in a pool, they may be required to stay completely in the water).

, The circle in the middle represents the area that the guardians can't go, and the zigzags above the Willy represents the area that the guardians shouldn't be allowed to ""camp"".
, to free Willy by unfreezing him/her. If Willy is tagged by a freer, the Willy needs to try to get to the shore as quickly as possible.
If a guardian tags Willy before he/she reaches the shore, Willy is frozen in place again.
If a guardian tags a freer at any point, the freer is frozen in place. Another freer can come and unfreeze the frozen freer.
If a freer accidentally touches a guardian, the freer is not frozen. A guardian must touch the freer with his hand.
If the Willy makes it to shore, the current guardians receive -1 point.
If the guardians freeze all of the freers before Willy can make it to shore, the guardians receive +1 point.
After each round, one of the guardians will become a Willy. The Willy becomes a freer, and a freer becomes a guardian. It should be arranged so that every player has the same number of times playing as each role, but primarily as guardian, as that is the only role that can gain or lose points.

Choose a gun that covers the most distance.,
Consider the gun’s water-capacity.,
Pick a gun that lets you change the nozzle’s setting.,
Have water bombs handy.",How to Have a Watergun Fight1," Treat the gun’s range as its #1 selling point. Don’t get stuck with one that only shoots five feet when everyone else’s can shoot 50!Check the box or instructions to find out how many feet or meters the water will travel.


If the gun is already out of the box, test-fire each one and pick whichever one shoots the farthest.;
, To lower the number of times that you will have to reload, pick a gun that holds the most water. However, remember that the more water it carries, the more weight you have to carry! Choose a gun that holds as much water as possible, but still lets you move quickly so you can outrun your opponents.Guns that come hooked up to backpacks usually offer the most water-capacity.
Backpacks can be bulky and heavy, though, so avoid these if you need to be light on your feet.

, Check the nozzle to see if there is more than one option to control how much water is fired from your gun, and how far. If possible, choose a gun that lets you switch from “high-range” to “riot-blast.” These will help you control the amount of water that you use with each shot.


A high-range setting lets you fire a thin, powerful stream over long distances and save water.
The riot-blast setting doesn’t shoot as far, but it blasts a lot of water over a wide area right in front of you so you can soak close targets.

, If you are going to stick to one place during the fight, back your firepower up by having some grenades ready to throw at your opponents when they advance.Use these when your opponents are out of your gun’s range. Save a few for when your gun runs out of water and needs reloading.


Use regular balloons if that is all you have. But since these often blow up right in your face before you can even throw them, buy some “water bombs” instead. These are basically the same thing, but the rubber is tougher and less likely to burst when you handle them.
Place your filled balloons or bombs in a long can with a lid (like a tennis ball container). This will lessen the risk of them breaking. It will also keep you dry if they do end up bursting before you mean them to.To fill them up quickly, buy a special attachment for your outside faucet.

, If you are barely gripping the handles, you may fly off when going around a corner or if you hit a big wave.

, If you have all your weight on the left side of the tube, you will likely tip to the left and fall over. If you balance in the center of the tube, you won't have that problem.

, If you're curving left, you don't want to put any weight on the left side. Try to shift your weight to the right, or do the opposite if you're turning right.

, Constant movement makes the tube swerve which can be a perfect situation for a wipeout.

If it is only going to be a handful of friends or family, stick to a small space, like your yard.Force everyone to take part by keeping them close, rather than let everyone spread out to safety for the whole game. For bigger groups, choose a bigger location, like a park, beach, or multiple yards throughout the neighborhood.


Obviously, keep it outside! Soaking the inside of your home can cause mold and mildew and, more dangerously, electrical shock and fires.
Also, be considerate of other people if you use a public space. Avoid having your game shut down by the police or park staff because too many bystanders complain about getting caught in the crossfire!, Remember that everyone is going to need to reload at some point. Make sure that one or more sources of water are handy. If no outside faucet is available, fill one or more kiddie pools (or any other large containers) with water.Keep it fair. If you are going to play a game that involves defending territories, make sure both sides have equal access to water.
If your battlefield is stretched across the neighborhood, check with friendly neighbors in between your house and your friends’ to see if you can use their outside faucets, too.
Heed any posted warnings. Do not use natural bodies of water like streams and lakes if there are signs telling you not to swim or drink the water.

, Expect very young players to get caught up in the heat of battle. If young children are included, make clear boundaries that no one should cross. Explain these boundaries very clearly before beginning the game.


Stick to areas on your block to avoid having kids run out into the street.
Keep everyone in the open so no one gets lost or injured without anyone else knowing.
Have an adult supervise reloading from natural bodies of water like rivers, creeks, and oceans in case the shore is slippery or the currents are very strong.

Make everyone wear a target.",How to Have a Watergun Fight3," Rules? Who needs rules? Simply arm each player, load up with water, and have at it! Soak whomever you choose.Make sure everyone’s having a good time, though. If you see players ganging up on another player who is really young and likely to get upset (or even someone who is older but just as likely to get upset), come to their defense. Target the other players and break the gang up.

, Once everyone is armed and loaded, have everyone shout, “Not it!” Make whoever shouts last be It. Give everyone else a headstart to get out of It’s range. Then have It chase people down and shoot at them. Whomever It hits is now It, so run away from them!If you have more players than gun, this can also be played with just one gun that only It carries and then hands over to the next It.

, Determine who It is with a round of “Not it!” Whoever says It last starts off as It. Allow everyone a headstart to get away from It. Then, when It begins the chase, have each person they hit freeze in place with their legs spread. Unfreeze them by crawling between their legs. Try to unfreeze as many players as possible before It freezes them all!Since only It is firing a weapon, only one water gun is needed.

, Arm each player. Divide everyone into two or more teams of equal numbers. Set a time limit (five, ten, fifteen minutes). Then have each team try to soak the others as much as possible at the start of “Go!” At the end of the time limit, have everyone line up and give them points based on how wet they are. Add up the totals for each team, and then compare the totals. Whichever team has the lowest score wins.Give one point for little splashes here and there. Give five points if one or more pieces of clothing are wet all over. Give ten points if they are soaked from head to foot.
Be careful with the time limit. If the weather is hot and dry, keep it short so everyone is just as wet at the end as they are in the first minute of play.

, If you have an even number of players, split them into two equal teams. Line them up facing each other within range of the weakest gun. Yell, “Go,” and have the two teams fire at each other. When someone is hit, have them leave. Continue until only one person is left dry and standing.If you don’t have enough water guns, use balloons or bombs instead.

, For older or more experienced players, put everyone’s aim to the test to make things more challenging. For each player, poke a hole through an Alka-Seltzer tablet. Feed a string through the hole and then tie the ends together to make a necklace. Alter the rules of whichever game you choose so that a hit only counts if the tablet is struck and begins to dissolve."

The use of a scuba tank or any other underwater breathing apparatus is not used; all the fun lies when you must get them by diving while holding your breath. Not to say that you can’t go out at very a low tides and “rock pick” them without entering the water,;
, An abalone is a huge snail that lives on the rocks in the shallows of the ocean. Most abalone have hard shells and are approximately 7 to 9 inches (17.8 to 22.9 cm) wide. Most rarely grow to over 11 inches (27.9 cm) in its life. The abalone are firmly attached to the rocks by their “foot” and are pried off with a flat bar, which also must meet certain criteria legally to avoid damage to undersized abalone and those that are unable to be pried off such as, It must not be sharp or not wide enough so the abalone are not cut with it.

, By law, every diver must carry their own measuring device while diving which are wide “U shaped” tools with an inside width of 7 inches (17.8 cm).

, You will need a full wet suit which includes a hood, gloves, and booties. The other gear that you will need would be a mask, snorkel, fins, weight belt, abalone bar, abalone gauge, and something to keep your abalone in as they must be kept separate from other divers’.

, Seasickness, cramps, exhaustion, and injuries do occur and such a floatation device can save your life.

, The wet suit is neoprene which is a foam type material and the wet suits come in various thicknesses. This material is very buoyant and the weight belt’s purpose is to offset this buoyancy so that you can submerge. Without this weight, diving is virtually impossible. Each weight belt has a quick release buckle on it so that the diver can, if needed and as a last resort, shed this belt and float with ease. Once you lose or shed your belt, either someone else dives down to get it or your dive is over! Shedding your weight belt also causes you to lose some of your maneuverability as your lower body and legs want to float instead of stay underwater to give you “traction” in the water.

, The diver should dawn all gear to be dove with and enter calm, placid water close to shore where he(or she) can freely float. Start with about 20 pounds of weight on your belt and use a couple pounds more if you are taller or more robust than the next guy or girl.

, The water level should be such that your dive mask is half under the water and half above so you can look either under or over the water. Adjust the weight to your belt until you reach this equilibrium a diver will call “neutral buoyancy”.

, This breathing apparatus allows you to keep your head in the water and float easily and let you view under the water with your mask while still breathing normally. Your head is very heavy – 15 to 20 pounds- and if you insist on not using your snorkel and holding it up out of the water so you can breathe through your mouth and nose normally, you will be kicking your rear end off in order to do so.


Much of the time this one hard blow gets 90% of the water out of it and a huge mistake that new divers make is to assume that all of it is out and they take a huge gasp for that needed air and intake that last 10 percent and choke on it.

, This seems like quite a task, but it begins to become habit with experience as does much of proper free diving technique, which then allows the diver a degree of comfort that transcends him or her from the novice to the experienced diver. #Dive only in portions of the United States, where there are clear and gentle ocean waters. Diving on the north coast of California isn’t like the clear ocean waters of Florida, Texas, Mexico, or Hawaii. The water here is not only cold, but usually quite rough and almost always murky where the visibility underwater is only 5 to 15 feet (1.5 to 4.6 m). Although the abalone is found from the mean low tide level of the ocean to depths of 50 feet (15.2 m) or more, diving in waters that are shallow can be both dangerous and exhausting. The ocean’s waves come in and out with great force and sweep the diver where ever it decides to, which can include putting his or her head up against a rock! Even if you do find an abalone, trying to stay in one place long enough to get it off the rock can be nearly impossible and requires that you kick like a maniac and hold on for dear life. Diving in over 15 feet (4.6 m) of water eliminates most of these issues as the waves are just swells that gently take you up and down on the surface and have nearly no effect once you are submerged. When you go down and find an abalone, you are in still water where you can relax and concentrate. The novice diver tends to see the shallow water as easier and safer, but once they relax enough to give the deeper seas a try, they soon learn that their oxygen and strength lasts much longer and that the deeper ocean is a much easier diving experience.

, Part of diving deeper process involves the essential function of the process known as “clearing your ears”. Learning how to clear your ears when diving is an absolute must in order for you to prevent breaking or damaging your eardrum. There are stories of scuba divers that have drown due to the disorientation caused by the trauma to the organ of balance and shock of the cold water caused by the eardrum breaking.


Allergies, colds, and some medical issues can all cause an inability to clear your ears and you should not dive at all if this is the case.
When you do dive, clear your ears several times on the dive, perhaps every 5 or 6 feet (1.5 or 1.8 m), and stop descending if you feel pressure that you cannot relieve by clearing.

, The ocean water here is murky. Many times you are diving to the bottom that you cannot see until you are well on your way from the surface. Bad experiences due to the beginning diver being taken along to learn how to snorkel or abalone dive when the ocean conditions are poor is probably the main reason that the beginners give up diving before they can become proficient and relaxed enough to enjoy themselves and take up the sport as a hobby they love. And usually this is the fault of the friend that takes them along who should know better.

, When you make a dive for abalone, or any dive whether you are spearing fish or just snorkeling for fun, rest a minute on the surface while floating still so your body can build up oxygen in its cells and you are relaxed. After all, what’s the hurry! Then, turn your body downward smoothly and lift your entire leg straight into the air so that it’s substantial weight will propel you downward until your fin enters the water and you can further propel yourself with it as you kick. With this motion you will be surprised to see that you have already descended about 10 feet (3.0 m) with one kick. Many people that are just learning how to dive will try to swim down by kicking sideways to the surface or thrashing their fins in the air, which don’t accomplish much besides using your oxygen. This smooth entry will truly help with your diving abilities and success. Once under water, relax. You are only a few bathtub’s depths deep when you think about it! Kick smooth and think about the abalone on the bottom and how you plan to look on the undersides of the rocks where the big ones hang out or maybe about that huge ling cod or other bottom fish that you plan to show off at the dive shop or campground or on a website. Look at the colors of the corals and the other sea life that you pass and make it a point to enjoy the experience instead of rushing. Pay attention to your surrounding as you are going down and coming up for safety, but also for the opportunity to view the ocean creatures in their habitat. Keep your eye out for lost dive gear that some unfortunate diver lost that you can salvage. Catch a nice rock crab, sea urchins, or scallops to enhance that seafood meal for you and the gang later. Mostly, what I am saying is relax, as this is the key to learning to dive for abalone.

, You will “sneak” up on the abalone by not swirling the water around it or touching it as they will clamp their shell tightly to the rocks and you may not even be able to slip your bar under the shell at that point.

, Grab it and you are done.

, Then throw that lunker in your tube! Make sure that you always try to only pry legal abalone off as this process can damage their bodies and they are almost then certain to die. Try not to get too excited and to remember that everything looks bigger than it is when seen through the mask. If you do take one that is too small to be legal, take care and replace it firmly on the rock that you got it from if you can as this is the law, but at least put it somewhere safe as the fish and other creatures will swarm the poor thing immediately and you won’t be able to get it later when it grows up. These are a fragile creature and we all should have the respect for them to make every effort to protect and preserve them for our children.

, Bring out the abalone guts or squid and put them within sight of the surface in several places in a couple hundred yard area and swim back and forth between them waiting for a fish to appear as they are mostly hidden in the kelp beds, seaweed, or rocks.

Learn to breathe.,
Use dive computers.,
Swim using only your *Swim Fins.,
Stay in shape.,
Keep well hydrated and not fatigued.,
Be the first ones in the water.,
Remain as shallow as possible without missing anything.,
Use a snorkel on the surface instead of the regulator.",How to Maximize Your Scuba Dive," This is a bit of a tricky tip, as one of the major rules of scuba diving is to never hold your breath.


Breathe naturally. It may sound counterintuitive, but the more you focus on how you're breathing, the faster you'll run through your air. The best way to avoid focusing on breathing is focus on what you're doing and seeing instead. You're SCUBA diving, enjoy the experience!
Since you're keeping neutrally buoyant (if you're not, remember what you learned about adding and dumping air from your BCD), your breathing will also control whether you rise or fall in the water. It's okay to pay attention to your breathing occasionally for this purpose.

Under no circumstances should you hold your breath for more than a second or two. This risks both lung overexpansion injuries (i.e. popping like a balloon), and messing with your blood CO2 levels.


Staying calm helps your body require less oxygen. A new diver will have a hard time keeping enough air in the tank to stay down with an experienced diver. This is mainly because the experienced diver is more comfortable under the water, although fitness plays a large role there as well. If you find yourself breathing shallowly or rapidly, take a moment to make your breaths slower and deeper.;
, Most certified scuba divers are trained using dive tables to monitor blood-nitrogen levels. This allows you get a value to determine how deep you can take your dives and for how long.


The problem with the dive tables is that they are based on your maximum depth (or a few depths depending on the table). This is not very accurate because while you may take 90% of your dive at 40 feet (12.2 m). if you go for a couple minutes at 70ft., you will use the tables as if you were at 70 feet (21.3 m). for the whole dive.
Dive computers keep track of your depth many times every minute (if not every second) and calculate your blood-nitrogen levels much more accurately. Dive computers also incorporate your safety stop and your surface time to allow the maximum amount of ""bottom time"".

, Scuba divers wear fins not only to compensate for the added drag of all the equipment worn, but also to allow swimming to be done more efficiently.


Efficiency is the key to get the most bottom time; exerting less energy means you breathe less air. Seasoned divers will usually tuck or fold their arms in a streamline fashion and only use their arms for stabilization or when reaching to touch or grab something.
Swim with relatively straight and stiff legs to maximize thrust. Steer with your legs and fins, and use your lung volume to help ease ascending or descending.
Avoid rapid kicks with your knees bent, or ""doggie paddling."" This technique is inefficient, using up more of your air for less movement, and you have much less control of your fins. I've been on many dives in which a doggie paddler kicked and killed a beautiful piece of coral or stirred up the sand so visibility became terrible for everyone.
Try to avoid using your hands while swimming. This is tricky, especially for beginner divers. But as you improve your buoyancy control and learn to do most of your moving around with your fins, you will come to rely less on your hands for stability and fine angle control. Observe your dive master next time; he's likely swimming with his arms crossed, laid out horizontally on his belly, stretched out to full length. Aim to emulate that.

, Scuba diving is a very forgiving sport; it is low impact and does not require extreme exertion, but body fat hinders you in more way than one.


Body fat increases buoyancy, thus more weight on the dive belt is needed. Larger bodies require larger wetsuits which are harder to get a good fit, and also adds buoyancy.
Being in shape also allows you to swim with less drag and less effort (for all the reasons mentioned in the swim with your fins section. Additionally, body fat, while mostly inert, uses oxygen to survive, and wastes the oxygen your muscles could be using.
A strong diver will also exert less energy than a weak diver, thus requiring less oxygen.

, Dehydration is a dangerous state to be in while scuba diving. The filtered air your breathe from the tank is very dry (it must be, to prevent the tank from rusting), and your are exerting a good deal of energy while swimming, in turn, you are sweating.


Dehydration will increase the amount of air required to swim because your red blood cells are not working to their fullest. Scuba diving while dehydrated has also been shown to increase blood-nitrogen levels.
Diving while fatigued is also not a good idea. This can lead to even greater fatigue or exhaustion and can cause cramps or other serious problems underwater. Don't push yourself too hard, you want your mind and body to be top notch before you get into the water.
Diving with a cold can be risky if your ears and sinuses are involved. If you decide to do this, go very slowly and return to the surface if you're unable to equalize. No dive is worth burst eardrums!

, When diving off a public boat with other divers, make sure you and your diving buddy are suited up and ready to get wet as soon as you are allowed to get in the water, try to be in the water first.


Getting in the water first will keep you from sweltering in your wetsuit topside any longer than you have to. You'll also get to be one of the first down, which means you won't miss a thing.

, The shallower you are, the less amount of compressed nitrogen is entering your blood stream and each breath uses a lower percentage of the air from your tank. This allows you to stay down longer on this tank, and the reduced nitrogen allows you to stay down longer on subsequent dives.


Don't miss anything important or amazing though. Being able to stay underwater for a long time without seeing anything isn't much fun, so be sure you stay deep enough to enjoy the beauty and wonder of the sea!

, With a snorkel you can already take a look to the bottom from the surface, while waiting for your buddies. Sometimes it's necessary to make a surface swim before you descend. Most people without a snorkel swim backwards in that case, as long as you don't use your regulator while you're still at the surface.

, Scuba diving is an active sport that requires a reasonable level of good health and physical fitness. Potential divers can help determine if they are fit for training and participation in the sport by reviewing a simple questionnaire that can be downloaded from the World Recreational Scuba Training Council or International Diving Safety Standards Commission web site (see below). The WRSTC or IDSSC guidelines will serve to familiarize you and, possibly your doctor, with the medical issues involved in scuba diving and help you to make an intelligent decision.

, Locate a scuba instructor either through a referral from a friend or associate, an advertisement or through a local dive store. You should try to find one that is both well qualified (number of years diving and training divers, number of dives made and divers trained, breadth of experience, etc.) and whose instructional methods seem compatible with your way of learning; some people learn well from authority figures while others want hugs or high fives along with their lectures. When you find someone you think you like ask to audit one or two of his or her classes before committing.

, Convenience is a big factor when selecting a dive store or instructor to conduct your training. You will be spending days or perhaps even weeks learning to scuba dive depending on how the course is structured so you may want to select a facility convenient to your home or place of work. Ideally, find a dive store with an on-site pool (heated if you’re taking your training in cold weather) with hot showers and changing facilities. Since classroom studies are often combined with pool sessions in a single afternoon or evening not having to travel to go to the pool is a real plus.

, Some instructors and dive stores charge a flat rate for complete certification while others charge incrementally as training progresses. Some include books and classroom materials in a single price while others charge extra for these usually-required items. Know what the total classroom and pool training will cost and also the charge for the final Open Water training. This may take place at a local lake or quarry or at a resort location and is often priced separately. If you are taking your scuba training with your family or a group of friends ask about a group discount and/or a more flexible schedule. Learn if there is an extra charge for the C-Card processing and the photo needed for it. Some divers will choose to complete their certification (Open Water) dives on a tropical vacation following their classroom and pool training. This is permitted by many training agencies provided it is done within a year of the completion of the pool and classroom training. Instructors and dive stores may charge a fee for completing the paperwork needed to transfer your record of training progress to another instructor - ask if yours does.

, Scuba diving is an equipment intensive sport and divers need a full complement of scuba gear in order to participate. Some or all of this gear may be included in your course fee or you may be able to rent or borrow it*.

, The most basic prerequisite to becoming a qualified scuba diver is comfort in the water. In order for you to begin a scuba training course you must first demonstrate to an instructor your ability to swim continuously for 200 yards (182.9 m) and float for 10 minutes, both without aids. Alternatively, if you would like to swim using a mask, fins and a snorkel, you must swim continuously for 300 yards (274.3 m) and then float for 10 minutes without any aids.

, One of the great luxuries in scuba diver training is finding an instructor and a training facility that will cater to you if you have a challenging schedule or in case you need extra classroom time or, particularly, extra pool time. It takes pool time to learn to dive, the more the better so find out if practice pool sessions are available and if there is any charge.

, During class registration you will be asked to fill out and sign a version of the WRSTC or the ISSDC medical and fitness guidelines form certifying yourself fit to dive (in the US, a doctor's written approval is required only if you answer YES to any of the questions on the form). You will also be informed of the inherent risks of scuba diving and must sign appropriate forms acknowledging and assuming those risks prior to being allowed to participate in any water activities. These forms may include one of the following which are used by various training agencies, or one similar in purpose and effect: Liability Release; Waiver and Release of Liability; Affirmation and Liability Release; Assumption of Risk; Limitation of Liability; Safe Diving Practices Statement; Standards for Safety; Statement of Understanding; etc. These liability releases, as their names imply, serve to release your instructor, the dive store and the training agency from all liability, including negligence, should you be injured during your training. In court decisions these liability releases have been found to be legally binding contracts and you should understand exactly what rights you are giving up by signing. However, these forms are universally required in the United States and you should also be prepared to be refused lessons if you will not sign or if you demand revisions.

, Read the book, watch the tape or DVD or do the on-line course and the class work. Scuba diving is one of those activities where safety comes with and depends on a certain amount of specific knowledge. The academic portion of a scuba course teaches you the theory of diving and the procedures necessary to do it safely. Academics are divided into short segments with quizzes generally following each topic and a final exam at the end to assess your understanding of the material. Students must pass with a certain grade to move on to Open Water training - retests are allowed.

, The Confined Water, or pool, portion of a scuba course is where the heart of the training occurs. This is where you will learn the function of all that equipment and how to use it safely. You will be taught to clear water from a flooded mask, breathe from a regulator, use fins properly and control your buoyancy by adding or venting air from your buoyancy control device, along with a myriad of other skills that may seem foreign and intimidating at first but, with practice, will become second nature.

, The final step toward becoming a certified scuba diver is to complete four open water training dives under the supervision of an instructor. These dives are conducted in a large body of water like the ocean or a lake to depths between 15 and 60 feet over two or more days. On these Open Water dives your instructor will have you demonstrate to him or her that you are capable of doing in open water what you learned to do in the pool, things like flooding and clearing your mask, descending to the bottom, recovering a misplaced regulator, ascending to the surface, etc.

, Your C-card vouches for your training and qualifies you to obtain air fills or rental tanks, buy or rent scuba equipment, and engage in recreational open water diving in conditions similar to those under which you trained without further supervision.

Prep your slate tablet.,
Make sure your slate covers the basics.,
Leave an area of the slate blank for writing less common questions or remarks while underwater.",How to Communicate Underwater when Scuba Diving1," Using a soft-leaded pencil and slate write down commonly occurring questions or observations before you enter the water. This way you can simply point to them underwater and receive nonverbal responses.;
, The slate should refer to things like elapsed time, air supply, directions, etc. You can also list common fish you are likely to encounter while on the journey.

, This will be important and potentially useful in case of emergency.

Learn the ""Low-on-Air"" hand signal.,
Learn the ""Out-Of-Air"" hand signal.,
Learn the ""I'm Cold"" hand signal.",How to Communicate Underwater when Scuba Diving2," Scuba divers learns basic universal signs during training, which should be practiced and reinforced often.


Individuals should practice and review signs on land before entering the water.
If you are partnered with someone you don't know, take a moment and go over some signs with them and the dive master to make sure that you are on the same page. 

, The ""Okay"" signal is made by joining the thumb and index fingers to form a loop, and extending the third, fourth, and fifth fingers.


This signal can be used as both a question and a response.
The ""Okay"" signal is a ""demand-response"" signal, meaning that if one diver asks another diver if he is okay, the latter is expected to respond with either an ""Okay"" signal or a ""Not Okay"" signal.

, This signal is made by extending a flattened hand and pivoting it slowly at the wrist, similar to how people signal ""so-so"" in a normal conversation.


A diver communicating a problem underwater should then point to the source or location of the problem using their index finger. The most common use of the ""Problem"" hand signal is to communicate an ear pressure problem.

, The ""Ear Problem"" signal is similar to the ""Problem"" sign. The diver, after giving the problem sign, points to their ears.

, The ""Okay"" and ""Problem"" surface signals involve the whole arm, so that boat captains and surface support staff can easily understand a diver's communication from far away.


The surface ""Okay"" sign is made by forming a circle with both arms raised over the head or, if only one arm is free, by touching the top of the head with the fingertips.
The ""Help"" or ""Problem"" signal is made by waving the arm over the head to call for attention. Note: don't wave ""hello"" to a dive boat on the surface, because the captain is likely to think you need assistance.

, The ""Up"" or ""End the Dive"" hand signal is created by doing a thumbs-up sign.


The ""Up"" signal is one of the most important signals in scuba diving. Any diver can end a dive at any point for any reason by using the ""Up"" signal.
This important dive safety rule ensures that divers are not forced beyond their comfort level underwater. The ""Up"" signal is a demand-response signal. A diver who signals ""Up"" to his buddy should receive the ""Up"" signal in return so that he can be sure that his signal was understood.

, *The ""Down"" hand signal: The thumbs-down hand signal communicates ""Go Down"" or ""Descend"" while underwater.

, The ""Slow Down"" Hand Signal is made by moving down a flat hand with palm facing downward.


""Slow Down"" is another basic signal that is taught to all student divers before their first scuba dive. Instructors use this signal to tell enthusiastic students to swim slowly and enjoy the incredible underwater world.

, ""Go in This Direction"" hand signal is used to indicate or suggest a direction of travel. Scuba divers use the fingertips of a flattened hand to point out the desired direction.


Using all five fingers to point out a direction of travel helps to avoid confusion with the ""Look at"" signal, which is made by pointing with a single index finger.

, The ""Level Off"" hand signal is made by extending a flattened hand, palm down, and slowly moving it side-to-side horizontally. This signal means ""remain at this depth.""


The ""Level Off"" signal is most commonly used to communicate that divers have reached the planned maximum depth for a dive, or to communicate that divers should hold a previously designated depth for safety or a decompression stop.

, For the ""Buddy Up"" or ""Stay Together"" hand signal a diver raises both index fingers side-by-side to indicate ""Buddy-Up"" or ""Stay Together"".


Scuba diving instructors use this hand signal to remind student divers to stay close to their buddies. Divers also occasionally use this signal to reassign buddy teams while underwater. For example, when two divers in a group are low-on-air and ready to ascend, they may communicate ""we'll stay together and ascend"" using the ""Buddy Up"" hand signal.

, The ""Low-On-Air"" signal is made by placing a closed fist against the chest.

, The ""Out-Of-Air"" is indicated by moving a flat hand across the throat in a slicing motion to indicate that a diver is ""cut-off"" from his air supply.


This signal requires an immediate response from the diver's buddy, who should allow the out-of-air diver to breathe from his alternate air source regulator while the two divers ascend together.

, The ""I'm Cold"" hand signal is made by crossing his arms and rubbing his upper arms with his hands, as if he were trying to warm himself.

Learn the basics of electronic communicators.,
Choose your device.,
Understand communication protocol.",How to Communicate Underwater when Scuba Diving3," The communications from a helmet or full facemask have been around for quite some time.  Several first-responder units use these, as well as certain other public agencies to help with underwater communication.

, Casio has a device that uses a ""bone microphone"" to communicate. Known as Logosease, the compact 3.8-ounce (108-gram) transceiver attaches to the mask’s retaining straps, resting against the side of the diver’s head.


Using bone conduction (the vibrations carry through the wearer’s skull), the microphone on the Casio is able to pick up what the diver is saying. Words will be a bit garbled because the divers have regulators in their mouths and plugs in their noses.
The system reportedly allows divers to communicate within visual range, a distance that varies wildly, depending on water conditions. The unit itself is watertight to a depth of 180 feet (55 meters); plenty for most recreational divers.

, Using these devices is like using 2-way radio communication protocol. Parties take turns speaking, and use clear, short sentences, indicating when they have finished and whether a response is expected.


Like radio, this is done to ensure that the message has a fair chance of being understood and that the speaker is not interrupted. When more than one recipient is intended, the caller will also identify the desired recipient by a call-up message, and will also usually identify him/herself.
The surface caller should also give the diver a chance to temporarily suspend or slow down breathing, as breathing noise is often so loud for the message to be heard over it. 

"
"
Create a plan for communicating during times of limited visibility.,
Consider rope tugs as a way to communicate.,
Purchase and use a dive light.,
Learn alternatives for attracting your buddy’s attention at night.",How to Communicate Underwater when Scuba Diving4," Diving in low light is common. Usually the best way to communicate with other divers is by using a combination of hand signals, electronics and slates.

, Rope tugs or line tugs are often used by cave divers to communicate with their buddy.  Before the dive be sure to talk about your signals and practice them to ensure you will both understand what is being said underwater.

, A dive light is good for illumination and signaling. Hand signs may not be visible without a light. The light itself can also be used as a signal.


The first rule of using a dive light underwater is never to shine it at another diver’s face. That may attract his or her attention, but all they will see is a point of bright light coming from your direction. Point the light towards yourself, and make sure you are not blocking your hand signals.
To attract your buddy’s attention, move your light rapidly back and forth across your buddy’s light beam. Back and forth horizontal movement signals “I want your attention.” Up and down vertical movement signals danger or emergency.
Dive lights are also used for signaling from the surface at night. Here again, keep your light beam pointed at yourself unless you are trying to attract attention from a distance.
Signal “OK” using one or two arms over the head, pointing the beam of your light down toward your body.  If you are in distress, point your light toward the boat or shore and wave it back and forth over your head.

, You can bang on your tank or use a noisemaker, but it is difficult to tell where the sound is coming from when you can’t see the person making it. In addition to an audible signal, you can use your light.

Consult your physician to make sure you're healthy enough to take a SCUBA course.,
Find a facility near you that offers PADI-approved diving courses.,
Contact the facility to find out which personal equipment you will need to own.,
Purchase the required personal equipment.,
Register for an open water diving course.,
Usually a PADI open water diving course will include classroom sessions, swimming pool sessions (during which you'll learn to use your equipment in a swimming pool), and open water sessions.,
When you've completed the course to your instructor's satisfaction, you will receive your PADI certification card.",How to Become a PADI Certified Scuba Diver,";
, (Refer to the PADI website in the external links section of this article to find the closest dive course.)

, Most dive courses provide most of the basic equipment but require you to own your own mask, snorkel, *Swim Fins, boots, gloves, and hood. You will also need to purchase your course materials (usually a book and video) and your first dive log book. (The course materials and log book together will usually cost under $35.)

, Most facilities that offer SCUBA courses are also dive shops. Be sure to save your receipts when purchasing your equipment, since many facilities will give you a discount on either the course or on future equipment rentals and air refilling services if you bought your equipment at their shop. The basic personal equipment needed for the course can cost anywhere from $200 to $500, or even more if you buy the fanciest gear.

, The cost of the course varies from region to region, and may even vary greatly within one area. For example, in Massachusetts you can pay anywhere from $125 to $500 for a PADI open water diving course.

, Some courses may do all of the water sessions in open water.

, Keep this card safe, since most dive shops will ask to see your certification card before refilling your air tanks or allowing you to rent equipment.

Decide which slide you want to go down first.,
Go up to the slide that you want to go down and, if no one is there, grab the bar above the slide, watch the previous slider and look for the lifeguard.,
Follow the rules that tell you to go down a certain ways to keep everyone safe, including yourself.

,
Wait for the life-guard to give you the okay or you can be expelled and banned.

,
Pull yourself down the slide to get going, when it's safe for you and the people in the 'target area' below.

Remember that if you want to take your time, that's fine too because lifeguards and other sliders are usually pretty nice to beginners (especially the lifeguards), but there are always exceptions.

,
Keep your eyes open when you go down the slide.,
Don't fight the slide or the way the slide goes; that will just scare you more and might get you hurt.,

Wash your mask in warm soapy water to remove the manufacturer's preservative lubricant.,
Scour the inside of the lens with a mild abrasive cleaner.,
Clean the inside surface and rinse before entering the water on the day of diving.",How to Defog a Diving Mask," Masks today are made with silicon skirts. Silicon can change color and lose flexibility over time from exposure to the elements. Manufacturers coat the masks with a lubricant to protect this from happening while on the display racks at retail stores. It is this lubricant that is the culprit behind fog in new masks.;
, Soapy water will cut the grease for the most part, but the lens must be thoroughly cleaned in order to prevent fogging. Toothpaste is the best thing to use for cleaning the inside of the lens. Toothpaste needs to be NON GEL type the gel pastes do not contain enough abrasives. Household cleaners can work, but care must be taken to be sure that the mask is completely rinsed before use because household cleaners can irritate or injure unwary divers if allowed to remain in the mask. With circular motion and a little bit of pressure, thoroughly scour the inner surface of the lens with about a dime-sized drop of toothpaste for several minutes. Rinse and repeat 2-4 times.

, If the mask is removed for any reason, either spit (some say beware of this as there are a lot of nasties in saliva that you don't want in your eyes) on the lenses or add commercial defogging drops to keep them clean.

Stand in shallow water.,
Take a deep breath.,
Dive straight down while tucking your legs to your chest.,
Plant your hands.,
Straighten your body and legs.,
Hold your legs and feet together tightly.,
Point your toes high up.,
Hold the stand for as long as you can.",How to Do a Handstand in the Pool1," It is easier to do a handstand in shallow water, but you want the water to be shallow enough that your legs & feet will be up in the air. If you try to do a handstand in water that is too deep, you may have a problem keeping your hands planted on the bottom of the pool or body of water.


Be sure that nobody is close to you. In case you tip over, you don't want to accidentally kick anyone in the face.
Try moving into deeper water if you find it difficult to do a handstand. This will make your body feel lighter.;
, The longer you can hold your breath, the more time you will have to practice your handstands while underwater. You may want to practice holding your breath a few times before diving into the pool or lake.

, Sometimes it is easier to kick one of your feet off the pool.

, When you plant your hands, be sure to keep them at least shoulder length apart. The farther apart you can plant your hands, the more stable you will be.


Aim to plant your hands where your feet started, this will help get all of your weight directly above you.
Try spreading your arms out a bit more if you are having problems performing a handstand.
The same with your fingers. The wider your can spread them when you plant your hands, the more stable of a base you will create.

, Keeping your hands firmly planted, untuck your legs from your torso and begin extending them up toward the sky.


For some people, it is easier to gain their balance if they straighten their bodies quickly.

, If you have difficulty holding your legs and feet together, try crossing your legs at the ankles.


Try to keep your spine straight, directly inline with your legs.
Remember to keep your legs straight. The straighter and closer together you can keep them, the easier it will be to maintain a handstand.

, Pointing your toes up to the sky will help you keep your legs straight, and will also help you maintain your balance.

, Remember to keep your legs together and your toes pointed. Once you're upside-down, keep your neck & head straight, looking forward, rather than looking at the bottom of the pool. This will keep your body straighter, and make it easier to maintain your balance.


Try to imagine that you are not only standing on your hands, but that you are trying to push yourself upward with every muscle of your body. Extending your muscles will help you gain your balance.

"
"
Select a suitable location.,
Do your homework.,
Prepare suitable gear.,
Perform a final check.,
Determine how you will enter the water.",How to Prepare for Your First SCUBA Dive," Many variables factor into where you may want to hold a dive, such as:

Attraction - There are many sights under the water including coral reefs, shipwrecks, caves, and any assortment of plants and animals. Coral reefs are found mainly in tropical climates. Shipwrecks and caves can be found almost anywhere.
Visibility - Under the water, visibility can vary from as little as 2 feet (0.6 m). to over 100 feet (30.5 m). This depends mainly on sea conditions, but can be affected by weather as well. In the Northern Pacific and Northern Atlantic, you will find visibility to be very limited, while in tropical climates, you can see the sun from over 100 feet (30.5 m) down!
Depth - Recreational divers should not dive below 130 feet (39.6 m) without advanced training and equipment. The deeper you dive, the higher the risks for injury. As you go deeper, less light can penetrate the water and the ocean becomes darker. Also, the deeper you go, your risk increases of getting Decompression Illness. These conditions may be very stressful for a beginning diver. It's recommended that you dive no deeper than 60 feet (18.3 m) until you become more comfortable with scuba diving situations. Additionally, due to the compression of air at depth, you use a greater percentage of air with each breath, thus reducing your total dive time.
Temperature - Scuba divers often wear wet suits to protect themselves from the cold. In most parts of the ocean, there is a temperature gap where in a change of depth of 1 foot (0.3 m), there may exist a 10 degree decrease in temperature, this is called a Thermocline. In some circumstances, in tropical climates you will need only a bathing suit.
Water Conditions - Surf and current are the basic sea conditions you need to know. Currents can be very strong in some areas and can carry a diver away. Even many popular dive sites have very strong current areas suitable only for experienced divers. Be sure you know how strong and in which direction the current is flowing. The current can also be part of the experience; a ""drift dive"" is a dive that is designed to have you be carried by the current. A boat must be present and the skipper will follow you on the surface by watching for surfacing bubbles. Surf can affect the boat and how safe it is getting in and out of the water.
Wildlife - Observing the local wildlife can be the most rewarding experience of an underwater dive, but it can also be quite dangerous. Every geographical location on Earth has its own unique species. You should know the basic fish and plant life you are likely to encounter and if there are any precautions for dealing with any. Just about all of them are harmless and are more scared of you than you are of them.;
, Thorough research is needed to select the best location for you. While objective research such as charts and diagrams can be helpful, there is no substitute for professional advice and experience. Any location with good diving has one or more dive shops. These local professionals know the sites and dangers better than anyone. Always seek local advice including information about currents, tides, visibility, depths and hazards. Before you go, you should know the local weather. Some important questions to know are ""Does it storm regularly?"" or ""How fast do storms arise in this location?"" On your first dives it is better to go with a dive operator. They have dove the area hundreds of times and will know which sites are best for beginners. Make sure the dive master knows it is your first dive. That way he can keep an eye on you and offer any help if you need it. Before the dive, the dive master will (or should) tell you where you are entering in relation to the site, where you will be going, how long you will be under, what the max depth will be, what signals you will use, what to do if you need to leave the dive early, what sites you will see and how long a safety stop you will do (it should be at least 3 minutes). So listen up and ask any questions now.

, Selecting and ensuring the proper operation of scuba gear for the water conditions is critical to the success and safety of a dive:


The wetsuit - The thickness of wetsuit you use should depend on the temperature of the water. Selections may include 3mm, 5mm, or 7mm thicknesses. The colder the water, the thicker the material on your wetsuit should be. The same is true for the hoodie, gloves and booties. The wetsuit not only provides cold-water protection, but also protection from stings and abrasions from underwater animals or other inanimate objects. Be sure to select a neoprene suit that fits you well and provides ample flexibility, as an improper fit can cause comfort and mobility issues.


Fins, or swim fins - Purchase fins with wide channels, as scuba divers require these to overcome water resistance with more equipment, and to generally travel more efficiently. The most commonly used fins contain a strap that fits snugly above the heel, although in some warm water conditions, a shoe enclosure type fin will be ample. The difference between a full-foot and open heel fin can be drastic-- so be prepared with whatever you choose.


Buoyancy compensator device(BCD) - This equipment allows the diver to achieve neutral buoyancy underwater as well as provides assistance in ascending or descending. Ensure proper operation of the BC before any dive, as this is a primary piece of safety equipment.
Weight belt - These will counteract the overall buoyancy of the diving equipment. Select a weight belt based on the buoyancy of both the equipment and yourself, which should be determined before attempting a dive. Ensure that the weights on the belt are secure and that the releases on the nylon belt are not jammed. Some newer BCDs have integrated weight systems. Always remember when you are wearing weight, whether a belt or integrated into a BC, that you need a one hand release-- almost always a right hand release. Before every dive, make sure you can release the belt easily with your right hand.
Scuba tanks, or diving cylinders - Select a tank tailored to your dive plan. For shorter dives in warm water with good visibility, generally only one aluminum tank filled to 80 cubic feet of air will be suitable. Some divers prefer steel tanks as the buoyancy between a full and empty tank varies less than an aluminum tank, but the weight is greater. Specialized dives may require two tanks, high-PSI tanks, or Nitrox; but these are more geared toward advanced divers.
Regulator - These are designed to let the air out of the tanks in a controlled manner. Make sure yours has been serviced properly. Remember-- regulators are designed, if they fail, to fail open, causing a lot of air to come out. You can breath that-- you will not just be cut off. If this does occur surface as soon as safely possible.
Mask and snorkel - Be sure to use a mask that has been tempered for pressure and contains a nose enclosure. Ensure that the mask fits properly and is watertight to your face. A purge valve on the snorkel is a welcome feature.
Knife or shears - Although optional, you should carry a knife or pair of shears in case of snags in fishing nets while underwater. Knives can be handy for other uses, such as prying rocks, while shears are more efficient for cutting fishing line.


, Once you have prepared all of your equipment, you must now prepare yourself. Ensuring proper hydration is a key step to diving safety, as dehydration can be detrimental to your underwater health. Also, maintain a positive attitude and a clear mind in case problems occur while diving. Most of all, do not panic if something goes wrong!

, There are generally two ways of entering the water for a dive: from a boat (giant stride or roll into the water) or simply by walking in from the beach. If you are walking in from the beach, ensure that you know the local sandbars and/or any coral or rock formations near your location. If you are entering from a boat, you can roll in backwards from the side, or jump in off of the rear of the boat. Remember to be careful when lowering the anchor because you do not want to damage coral or have it get tangled in a shipwreck.

Bring sunblock, lip balm, cash, towels, and a change of clothes for the end of the day. If you have long hair, you could also bring a hairbrush. Also, feel free to bring on some sandals or flip flops!;
, You will have a couple of hours when the park isn't too crowded if you arrive early, so the lines will be shorter.

, Most Water Parks have a locker/change room to store your things in and get changed. It's best to use them instead of bathrooms as in a bathroom you'll probably have to wait for a stall. In the locker room you can get changed on a bench if you don't mind other people (of your gender) seeing you naked.

, Nothing can ruin your day like getting a bad sunburn.

, That way, you don't waste time looking for a restroom once you're in the park and walking around.

, It may be helpful to get a map so that you can hit all the rides in one area and then move on to the next. Walking takes a lot of time, so you want to minimize it as much as possible.

, During mid-morning and afternoon, the lines might be very long, so you want to avoid that.

, Around noon, the water park might start to get very crowded. This is a good time to eat so that you don't spend hours in line.

, Most water parks will either have a wave pool or an area where you can lounge next to the water. This is a nice way to rest a bit and avoid really long lines.

, By this time, the lines may be starting to die down (or else you're just bored with sitting around). Your sunblock has also probably worn off, so you need more to last you through the afternoon.

, During the busy afternoon period, avoid the very popular rides. This is a good time to hit rides that move quickly so that you don't stand in line too long.

, Many water parks will start to empty out when 4:00 or 5:00 pm rolls around. Now is a good time to ride some of the more popular attractions (although they might still have long lines).

, Get out of your wet bathing suit and into dry clothes. Some water parks may have showers that you can rinse off in.NEVER change in toilet stalls,that is very unsanitary especially at water parks.

Lift your palm.,
Fold each finger in toward your palm, one at a time.,
Bend the elbow and lift the arm.,
Hold your arm and shoulder in place and straighten the elbow.",How to Do a Handstand in the Pool2," After you have learned how to hold a two-handed handstand in water, you are now ready to start learning how to do one-handed handstands.


Learning to do a one-handed handstand can be a lot more difficult and take a lot more time to learn than a two-handed handstand.
Be patient.

, While holding a two-handed handstand, begin to slowly spread your legs apart as far as you can. Remember to keep your back straight and extend your muscles.


Don't stretch the legs too far, instead, only spread them to a point that is comfortable.
The wider you can stretch your legs, however, the more easier it will be to find your balance due to a lower center of gravity.
You may have to move to shallower water if you can spread your legs far enough that your feet begin to dip.

, If you are planning on doing a one-handed handstand on your right hand then you should shift your weight to your right side.,


Try to imagine a straight line between the shoulder you will be standing on, and the opposite hip.

, Bending the elbow on the arm you will not be hand standing on, lift your palm off the ground so that you come to rest on your fingertips.


Try to maintain the straight line between your support shoulder and opposite hip., Begin with your pinky, then the ring and middle fingers, and then the thumb.You should now be supporting your weak hand with only your pointer finger.


Depending on how strong your fingers are, this may take quite a bit of practice.
If using one finger is uncomfortable, you can try skipping the last finger and going directly into the one-handed handstand.

, Be careful not to swing your arm out, but instead, be sure to bend your elbow so that it draws your hand up closer to the shoulder. This will help you keep your balance.


Try lifting the hand straight up to your shoulder. This will help you keep your center of balance.

, Your arm should now be extended outward to your side.


Try to keep your elbow locked. This will help stabilize the arm and make it easier to maintain your balance.
Remember to extend all of the muscles in your body. This will help you stabilize yourself.

Position your hips and legs so they are just slightly underwater. Keep your stomach flat and level to support your back and as near to the surface of the water as possible. Position your head so that it is inline with the body and the water level meets your hairline and eyebrows, with eyes looking forward and down.In this position you want to keep your head and spine as still and relaxed as possible. For momentum, rotate your hips and shoulders. Your head should only join the movement when you come up for breath. Your hips should not rotate as much as your shoulders.;
, Your kicks should alternate and start at the hip with a slight knee bend. Your legs should be close together with ankles relaxed. Do a steady small motion with most of the pressure on your feet. You still should be moving your whole leg, but your feet should be moving up and down with the movement of your legs.Make the kicks long and fast, but with very little splash.Try to do six kicks in every arm cycle, so three kicks per arm movement., One hand should follow the other hand into the water above your head. The elbows first exit the water half a foot to a foot or so. Make spear motions with your arm, with your palms turned facing out, causing your thumb to enter the water first. Make one spear with your arm through the water and as you pull the other elbow up out of the water, move the first arm back through the water to your body. Don't start pulling your arm back as soon as your hand is in the water. Allow your arm to reach forward, forming the spear, before you begin to pull it back to your body. When your hand enters the water, sweep your elbow forward, then pull it back towards the center of the body and then out towards the thighs., Breathing in front crawl can be difficult, but it is important for the stroke. Try to breathe after every three strokes. Smoothly turn your head to the side and lift your mouth out of the water as you enter the opposite arm into the water. Try not to lift your head too much out of the water, because the more your head raises the more your feet and legs will sink.As you breathe, one side of your face should still be in the water. You may want to stretch your mouth some to one side to keep water from getting in it.
The regularity of breathing is not the same for everyone. If you need to breathe more often then do so. Just aim to keep your same position and try to make your breaths regular.

, This swimming technique is perfect for swimming in the ocean for many reasons. It helped Adam Walker, record breaking swimmer who swam across the English Channel, prolong his swimming career. This stroke is good for anyone: children and adults, open water swimmers and channel swimmers.To change up your stroke for more endurance in the water, alter your movements in these ways:

Instead of using your chest and shoulders to drive your hand and arm into the water, focus on using your core. Imagine turning your hips and using your hips to propel you through the water.
Enter the water early. Use the same motion with your hand, but as you lift your elbow from the water, enter you hand into the water closer to your head. On a regular front crawl your hand would enter the water a foot or so in front of you, but with this stroke you want to enter the hand into the water a few inches in front of your head.
Hold your recovery arm in place. In a normal stroke, as you begin to enter one hand into the water, you will already be pulling your other arm back. In this stroke, keep your arm extended out in front of you until your other hand is just about to enter the water. Then, pull it back.
Only pull your arm back to your hip. On a regular stroke you would pull your arm back to your thigh, but on this one, only pull it back to you power section: your hips.


Some of the benefits of this technique are:Uses correct muscles
Maximizes speed and efficiency
Saves energy and prevents injuries
Relaxes your body, which helps relax your mind
Improves stability in rough water
Helps you keep your form in your stroke even when tired



, If you are going to the beach and just plan to wade in the water, you probably need to know the basics of swimming. However, if you want to really swim out far into the ocean, you need to make sure you are a strong swimmer. Waves can be difficult to swim in, and the tide can often carry you far away from your original location, so be prepared to work hard while swimming.


If you don't feel confident in your swimming skills to swim out in the ocean, take some time to practice in a local pool. Make sure you have the basic motions down, and you can learn a few strokes as well. The stronger swimmer you are the easier and more enjoyable it will be to swim in the ocean.

, When you swim out into the ocean and are only surrounded by blue water, it can be easy to lose sight of where you started. Before you go out to swim, try to choose a large landmark so that you'll know what to swim back to. You'll likely drift with the current, so it's important to remember how to get back.

, Before you go to a beach to swim, it's wise to check what the weather forecast is for the day. If it is mostly sunny you are safe to swim at the beach. However, if the forecast shows thunderstorms or lots of rain, today might not be the best day to take a swim.You can usually visit a beach if it's light rainfall all day, but keep in mind that it may be harder to see while you swim, so it could be dangerous.

, Beaches often place signs out to instruct swimmers and guests of the current conditions at the beach. For example, a beach may have a sign explaining that there is a lot of seaweed recently, that the tides are higher, or that there have been shark sightings. It's good to take a look at these signs so you are aware of the conditions of the water at the beach and so that you can follow the rules set.


Another good reason to read the signs is they may share information about where it is safe to swim in the water. Before visiting a beach, it may be good to look up the location on the internet. Many beaches, especially if they are public, will post warnings or give information on their website about the current condition of their beach and the water.

, In addition to reading the beach signs, it's good to be familiar with what certain flags mean. Not all beaches have these flags, but some will use them to alert visitors of current conditions. Some of the flags you might see are:Red and yellow flags: This means that the lifeguards are patrolling the areas that the flags have marked. These are usually the safest areas to swim in at a beach.
Red flags: This means danger. Don't enter water when this flag is flying, or ask a lifeguard or worker if it is safe to swim.
Black and white checkered flags: The area is safe for watercraft like kayaking or surfing. It's usually not safe to swim or use body boards in the areas this flag has marked.
Orange windsocks: There are dangerous wind conditions. You can usually swim in these conditions if you are a strong swimmer, but avoid using a floaty as you can get swept out with the current.

, If you are an adult and feel confident in your swimming skills, you probably don't need a lifeguard at your beach. However, if you are taking a child to the beach or feel safer with someone watching you, it could be good to swim near a lifeguard or at a beach where lifeguards regularly work. That way if something happens, you know someone is there to take care of it., A rip current is a strong, narrow current that often occurs in the ocean in large open spots of water or near structures like piers and jetties. Rip currents cause deaths every year on beaches, so it's important to know what to do if you get caught in a current. Some safety tips to follow if you are swept up in a rip current are:Don't fight the current. Try to stay calm.
Swim parallel with the shore, not towards it, until you are out of the current. Once you are out of the current you can begin swimming towards shore.
If you are unable to swim towards shore, try to tread water or float until you are out of the current.
Stay 100 feet away from jetties and piers.
If you don't think you will make it to the shore, draw attention to yourself by waving and calling so that a lifeguard can come rescue you.

, The safest thing you can do when you visit the beach is bring a friend along with you. If you plan to go out deep into the water, it's best to have a friend go alongside you. That way, if something happens to either one of you, the other person can help out or go get help. Swimming alone can be dangerous, especially if you plan to swim far out into the ocean.

, While it is unlikely you will be attacked by a shark at the beach, it can still happen. Sharks tend to attack when they are trapped by a sandbar or low tide near shore, or where there is a great drop off, because that's where they find a lot of their prey. Follow these safety precautions to minimize your risk of a shark attack:Don't swim too far from shore.
Swim in groups -- sharks are more likely to attack a solitary individual.
Sharks are most active during twilight and when it is dark, so avoid being in the water during these times.
Don't enter the water if you have a bleeding wound. Sharks have a strong sense of smell.
Avoid wearing shiny jewelry in the water. The reflected light resembles fish scales.
Avoid brightly colored swimsuits -- sharks can see contrast.
Don't live in fear at the beach of a shark attack. You are 30 times more likely to be killed by lightning and three times more likely to drown at the beach than die from a shark attack. Also, very few sharks ever kill their victims. It's more of a hit and run circumstance. If this doesn't exactly comfort you, just remember that it's very unlikely to happen to you or anyone you know, but it's good to be cautious either way., Out of 2,000 species of jellyfish, only 70 species can seriously harm you. However, if you are stung by other jellyfish, it can still hurt. Check the beach signs before entering the water for any information on jellyfish -- some beaches may have a large population at certain times.If you get stung by a jellyfish, treat the wound with a wash of vinegar or rubbing alcohol. It may sting but it's better than water because water alone can cause the wound to release more poison. You can also sprinkle meat tenderizer or a baking soda water paste. If you are near a lifeguard, ask them to give you first aid.
Don't touch jellyfish that have been washed up on shore. The tentacles can still sting you if they are wet. Even tentacles that have been torn off can still sting you, so stay away from all jellyfish on the sand.

, Even though you are surrounded by water at the beach, you can become easily dehydrated, especially if it is sunny. Make sure you pack enough water to last you for your trip, and try to drink it somewhat frequently. The last thing you want to happen is that you become dehydrated while you are swimming in the ocean.Bring along a cooler to store your drinks in so that you can keep them cool. Also, try to avoid drinking too much alcohol without drinking any water. If you are going to drink alcohol at the beach, make sure you drink enough water and eat enough food to counteract the effects of the alcohol. Swimming in the ocean while being buzzed or drunk can be very dangerous.
Before you bring drinks, look at the local beach's rules. Some beaches may not have any regulations when it comes to what you can bring but many prohibit their guests from bringing glass bottles.

, If you are spending hours at the beach without sunscreen, you will most likely get burned. Make sure you apply sunscreen before you go to the beach, but pack some too so you can apply it regularly throughout the day. Water and sand are major reflectors, so they reflect the sun's rays, increasing your chance of burning. Apply more sunscreen than you would think, just to be safe.Try to use a waterproof sunscreen so that it doesn't wash off in the water. Aim for a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher with broad-spectrum protection that protects skin from UVA and UVB rays.
Apply your sunscreen at least thirty minutes before going out in the sun, and then every two to three hours that you are outside.
Don't forget to apply sunscreen to all areas exposed to the sun. Wear lip balm with an SPF, and try to apply sunscreen to your ears and scalp if possible. Even if you are wearing a t-shirt in the water, apply sunscreen to your body.

, If you are going to be at the beach a while, it may be a good idea to pack a lunch or bring snacks to munch on throughout the day. Some beaches, the more crowded ones, will have concession stands or vendors selling foods, but many beaches do not. It's important to make sure you eat enough food and drink enough water throughout your visit to the beach.


Although there is no evidence that suggests exercising after you eat can give you cramps, you should still probably wait twenty or thirty minutes before you enter back in the water after you've eaten. This is mainly because eating a full meal and then doing intense exercise can make you nauseous, and that's not a great feeling to experience when you are swimming. If you plan to just splash around in the water don't worry about when you have eaten. However, if you are going to swim out far in the ocean vigorously, it may be wise to wait until your food has digested., After you've spent a day at a beach and have gotten sand all in your swimsuit, you may not want to sit in your car. That's why packing a change of clothes is always handy. There are usually showers and restrooms at a beach, so when you are about to leave, visit a shower to clean off the sand and change your clothes before getting into your car.

, If you are spending extended time at the beach, you may want some time to relax in the sun. Pack a beach chair and a big umbrella so that you can stay out of the sun and in the shade when you aren't swimming. Use this time to apply another layer of sunscreen and hydrate.Remember that your eyes can suffer from sun damage too, so when you are relaxing in your chair or on your towel, wear sunglasses.

, Maybe you want to spend the whole time swimming, but it's likely that you may want to relax on the sand and in the sun for a bit. Pack some things to do when you are out of the water like reading a book, playing on your iPad, or throwing a football. You can also bring toys to build a sandcastle if you are taking kids along with you to the beach.


You can also pack things for fun in the water like a snorkel and fins, goggles, boogie boards, and anything else to make your time more fun.

, This is especially helpful if you are bringing along children or babies to the beach. Children can scrape themselves with the seashells or rocks on the beach, or they could get stung by a jelly fish. Either way, it's handy to have a first aid kit ready in case something happens."
"Check the depth and area as per Method 1 above.,

Start running.,
Jump.,
Stay underwater for a few seconds.,
Act exuberantly tired.",How to Do a Cannon Ball Into the Water2,", (Don't do this if you're on a diving board). If you're too close to the water when you jump, you won't get enough power, and you'll make a smaller splash. On the other hand, if you are like 10 steps away from the water's edge, all your power is going to be wasted in running to the pool, not in jumping in.

, If you have to stop in the middle of your dive for air, you will decrease the splash.

, You'll only have to run for about half a second.

, However, if you want a huge splash, you've got to do more than just jump randomly. You've got to put pressure into your legs. Think to yourself while you're jumping, ""force those legs into the water!"" Use all the power your body can muster up. Use that power to force your body down into the water.


Pretend your legs are weights, and your body hurts and aches every second those weights are attached to your body. Those weights are heavy, and they practically force you to put pressure on your body. Sum this up as ""pressure, force and power"".

, Staying underwater impresses whoever is judging the contest because they'll think that you dove so hard that you got so deep into the water that it takes you a minute to swim back up to the surface. Unless, of course, there are judges underwater, in which case, go up as fast as possible.

, When you do get up to the surface, act like you're tired and worn out from the big jump, but also very proud of your work. This always impresses others observing.

, Always check with the lifeguard if it is safe to swim otherwise.

, Do not go in any deeper than your lower chest as you will be affected by any minor variations in water depth beyond this point. This depth of water is sufficient for swimming and playing.

, Be aware that the water depth may not be uniform and there may be sandbars, sudden drops or inshore holes.

, Always swim with at least one competent swimmer. Ideally swim together but, if you are strong swimmers, always stay within fifteen metres of each other, provided you can see each other clearly and hear one another. If you go by yourself, you could get stuck and you would have no one to help you get out.

, Conserve energy and think clearly.

, If you have a board, hang onto it and use it to keep you afloat. If not, use your swimming abilities. Weaker swimmers will have more trouble than stronger swimmers, so don't try anything that you cannot manage.

, Instead, swim out of the current in a direction that follows the shoreline and cuts across the current diagonally. The aim is to swim over the rip current, as it usually peters out and does not extend across the entire shore. See the diagram next to the article summary for a pictorial explanation.

, It will carry you out of the current. You will be deeper but you won't be dragged under, so just keep treading water until rescue arrives and attract attention by waving your arms frequently. If you are a strong swimmer, you can attempt swimming back to shore at an angle.

This method is for cold water in temperate weather. If you're swimming in very cold conditions, skip to the section below.;
, Long swim shorts or a rash guard will warm you up on the way to the pool, and help a small amount in the water. A swim cap can prevent heat from escaping through the top of your head.

, There are two groups of people when it comes to entering pools. If you're brave enough to jump right in, one group says, you can start enjoying the water right away. It will also increase your heart rate, which can be exhilarating. Here are a few suggestions:


Step down up to your neck in one movement.
Jump straight into the deep end of the pool, if you are a good swimmer.
If you are swimming in an ocean or lake, run down a slope into the water until your legs are submerged, then slide in.
Dunk your head into the pool. Once you've done that, you know you can take the temperature!

, If you can't convince yourself to get in the water quickly, use a more gradual entry. This makes it easier to adjust to the temperature, but don't let yourself get ""stuck"" halfway through.


Hold your feet in for a minute or two, then step onto the first step for a minute, and keep moving down slowly until you're in.
Wade in to the water until the cold ""forces"" you to stop. Wait a minute and repeat, trying to go as far as you can each time. Once the water is at your armpits, dunk your head under.

, Once you're in, swim or at least tread water to keep your blood flowing fast. This will make you feel much warmer than you would if you stayed still. After about five minutes of constant movement, the water might even feel warm.

, Wrap a dry towel around you as soon as you get out of the water. If you start shivering uncontrollably, go to a warm indoor area.


, Cold water is much more dangerous than air at the same temperature. Water as warm as 21ºC (70ºF) can make breathing more difficult, and most people will hyperventilate in water at 15ºC (60ºF).This method should only be attempted by fit, healthy people who have lived in cold climates.


If you do not fit this description, you should wear a drysuit and swim under expert supervision.

, You'll be safer and enjoy yourself more if you swim with a group of friends.


It's best to choose drivers who have tried this before or who don't plan to swim. You'll probably be very tired after your first swim in cold water.

, A chocolate bar is fine, but don't load up on a full meal.

, Avoid rivers, as the cold water can stiffen your joints and make it difficult to swim against the current. You should also find a spot with a flat shoreline so it's easy to get in and out of the water.


Many northern countries have businesses that will break a large hole in the ice and place a ladder in the hole. These are a great option if you can find one, since you can pay for a heated dressing room and a hot refreshment afterward.
In Finland and many other northern countries, it's traditional to go from a hot sauna straight to the cold water. This will make the experience much more pleasant.

, The air will probably be very cold as well, so come prepared with warm clothes and a big towel. You do not need a thermal swimsuit if you only plan to swim for a few minutes. However, it is a good idea to pull a warm hat or thermal swim cap over your ears. This way you can swim with your head above the water and prevent painful earaches.


You can easily injure yourself walking over rough ground with numb feet. Wear thick wool socks to protect them on the shore.

, Step carefully to avoid slipping, and do not try to jump or dive in. The first shock of cold can cause hyperventilation, so stay at the edge until you regain control of your breathing.


Once you're in the pool, keep your limbs moving to stay (relatively) warm.

, Stay alert about your own reaction to the temperature as you swim. If you start to feel very numb, you should get out of the water. Many people just enjoy a quick jump in and out, but you can swim around for a couple minutes if you are comfortable. Never stay in the water longer than five minutes.

, You may be numb and shivering as you leave the water. Move slowly and watch where you place your feet to avoid falling.

, Dry off and change into warm clothes immediately, in a heated dressing room if possible. Move to a café or other heated area, and pour yourself a hot drink or glass of liquor.


If you take a shower, start with a lukewarm temperature and increase it gradually. Hot water can burn you if your skin is too cold.
Don't be alarmed at bright red skin. This is a normal reaction to cold.

Pick a kick board that is the correct size.,
Get into the float position.,
Practice your kicks.,
Begin using the board.,
Hold on to the sides of the board or put your hands in the holes (if there are holes in your board).,

Put it all together!,
Use a variety of kick drills to get the most out of your workout.",How to Use a Kick Board," It should be long enough that when you hold the top edge of the board, it comes to the middle of your upper arm. The board should also be wide enough that your arms are extended straight out from the shoulder.


Some kick boards come with holes in the sides for holding. These are useful for beginners but are not a long term option, as holding the board on the sides should only occur when first learning, as the correct position is to hold the board from the top.;
, Hold on to the bar at the sides of the pool, and then push your body upwards, it should float easily.

, Before you learn to swim with a board, or even simply swim, you have to learn how to kick properly. Practice kicking techniques by holding on to the edge of the pool for support, stretching yourself out to float on the water (see first step) and kicking in the water. Try to kick so as to keep your feet under the water––breaking through to the surface makes for a less efficient kicking motion.


Keep your legs straight and don't bend your knees.
if you have no swimming experience at all, then use the shallow end of the pool.

, Once you're confident with floating and kicking, it's time to let go of the wall and start using the kick board to propel yourself around the water., As you gain experience, you will be able to put your palms on top of the board and simply press down lightly to bring your hips up into the proper horizontal position. This latter position is the correct way to hold a kick board but it's not always easy for beginners, so holding the sides will reassure you to start with.


In time, when you are used to the kick board and swimming with it, shift to holding onto it from the top edge.

, Your elbows should rest on the board for support. Rest your face in the water between your arms.

, All you have to do is lay on your belly, and float.

, Do a little push off to get you started. It is good practice to get used to keeping your face in the water and moving your face to your left or right to take a breath.


When you need to breathe, turn your head to one side so that your mouth is out of the water. Lifting straight up is harder on your neck.







, Obviously you have to kick to get moving. Try these different ways to kick:


Traditional butterfly kick






Breast stroke kick (frog style)






Caterpillar kick






Back kick






Side kick






You can try these out after getting the hang of the basics!



, Changing the kicks and styles will also help to prevent boredom. Keep making use of the kick board when swimming and training––even the elite swimmers make use of kick board swimming as part of their training routine.

Tie back your hair.,
Wet your hair with water from the bathroom or change-rooms.,
Open the swim cap.,
Pull the swim cap onto your head.,
Adjust the swim cap.",How to Put on a Swim Cap1," If you have long hair, use a hair tie to put your hair in a ponytail or bun (depending on the length of your hair).Be sure that your hair is tied firmly so that it is secure.


The swim cap may force your hair to shift and pull your hair down, so you may wish to tie your hair a little higher than you would expect it to be positioned in the cap.;
, Dunk your head into the water in a basin, or run your hair under a shower for a couple of seconds.Wetting your hair makes it easier for the cap material to slide over your hair. Caps tend to stick to and pull dry hair strands.


Consider coating your hair with a thin layer of conditioner. This will make putting the cap on a lot easier., Open the swim cap with your hands, and consider wetting the inside of the cap. Wetting the inside of the cap isn’t necessary, but some people have found that wetting the inside makes the cap easier to put on. Hold the sides of the swim cap with your two hands.


Wetting the cap may also make it harder to put on––it depends on the type of cap used.

, Tilt your head down and place the front of the swim cap at your forehead in between your hairline and eyebrows.Allow the swim cap to catch at your forehead, and use your hands to pull the swim cap down and back to cover the rest of your head.

, Once the swim cap is on your head, make any necessary adjustments. Tuck stray hairs into the cap, reposition the front of the cap so that it covers your hairline but isn’t over your eyebrows. Then position the cap around your ears.Pull the back of the cap to make sure it is as secure as possible, and put on your goggles.


Positioning the cap near your ears is mostly based on personal preference. Some people like to cover their ears completely with the cap, especially if they are racing. Others like to cover half of their ears, while some don't cover their ears at all.

Next, cut four 1.5"" wide strips from the bottom of the front section only., Working with the front section of the tee, cut the bottom line of the bikini top by cutting straight across the panel, about 1.5-2"" below the armpit. Then, cut the neck and shoulder straps how you want them to look,being sure to leave that ~2"" of material below the armpit.

, Working with the back panel. Use an old string bikini or cut up an old pair of underwear to make a pattern and cut it out from the panel.

, Cut side strips for the bottom by cutting panels from the sleeves that are as wide as the sides you cut for your bottom piece.

, Sew together the side strips that you cut for the back piece. Then, attach the long strips that you cut from the front panel to the sides and at the neck of the teekini top you made.

, You're done! Tie on your new string teekini and enjoy the sun!

Tie back your hair.,
Wet your hair.,
Put on the swim cap.,
Make adjustments, as needed.",How to Put on a Swim Cap2," If you have longer hair, use a hair tie to pull back your hair and secure it in a ponytail or bun.The swim cap may move your hair around so be sure your hair is tied up tight and high.

, Dip your head in the pool or run it underneath a shower before putting on your cap.Since the cap material tends to stick to and pull on dry hair, wetting your hair may make the cap easier to put on (although this will depend on the material of the cap).

, Ask a friend to help you put on your swim cap. Open up the swim cap with your hands, and tilt your head downward. Hold the front of the cap securely at your forehead while your friend takes the back of the swim cap and stretches it over to the back of your head., Once the cap is on your head, make any necessary adjustments. Pull the cap down further, adjust its positioning on your forehead, and tuck in any loose hairs.Remember that you can position the cap around your ears in whatever way is most comfortable for you. You can tuck your ears in, leave your ears out, or cover only a portion of your ears.

Adjust the swim cap.",How to Put on a Swim Cap3," If you have longer hair, use a hair tie to tie back your hair in either a ponytail or a bun.Make sure that your hair is secured tightly, because it may shift when putting on the swim cap.

, Have a friend turn the swim cap inside out and fill it up with water. You can scoop up water from the pool, or fill it up from any other kind of water source.Your friend should be holding the cap on the sides, with the water inside the cap.

, Sit down on the ground and have your friend stand over you, holding the swim cap directly above your head.Your friend can hold the swim cap near her face or even higher, to give the drop added height. Have your friend let go of the swim cap evenly, so it falls squarely on your head.


The velocity from the drop will cause the cap to fall on your head (because of the weight of the water) and the cap consequently will fold over onto your head.
Be aware that this method doesn’t always work on the first try, and the results can be rather inconsistent. More often than not, adjustments are necessary.

, Make any needed adjustments to the swim cap. Reposition the cap on your head, tuck in any stray hairs, and position the cap around your ears."

Check the weather, planning accordingly.,
Avoid large meals within an hour of swimming.,
Apply 30 SPF sunscreen 15-20 minutes before heading out, even if it is cloudy.,
Pack up a towel, swimsuit, and waterproof shoes.,
Bring water to stay hydrated.,
Stuff phones, electronics, and valuables in resealable plastic bags.,
Protect your hair from salt or chlorine with watered-down conditioner.",How to Prepare to Go Swimming1," If you know it is going to be hot and sunny, make sure you have sunscreen and water. If there is a chance of thunderstorms later on you can still go swimming. However, make sure you have a plan for inclement weather, such as shelter to get under, and that everyone you're with knows where to meet if you hear thunder.;
, The dreaded swimmer's cramp is caused when your body is both trying to digest food and exert itself to stay afloat. Avoid this by avoiding large meals, particularly greasy, fatty foods like hamburgers, cheese, etc. that take a long time to digest.This doesn't mean you need to swim hungry. Rather, try to graze and eat lightly over time instead of loading up on one big meal.

, UV radiation still penetrates cloud cover, so don't assume you're fine just because the sun isn't shining. Make sure you are using a waterproof ""sport"" sunscreen that won't wash off as soon as you get in the water.


While swimming, reapply sunscreen every 30 minutes to prevent burning., If you're going to change at the pool or beach, you should consider an extra shirt or pair of underwear as well, in case your dry clothes accidentally get wet. If you want goggles, be sure to pack them as well.

, It doesn't matter where you're swimming, it is always a good idea to have drinkable water on hand. Dehydration causes exhaustion, grumpiness, and, when left untreated, serious health issues. It seems obvious, but make sure you have drinkable water before you go into the water.


At the very least, aim to drink 16oz or more of water in the hour leading up to your swim.
1 water bottle per person should be good for 1-2 hours of activity.

, To be safest as you pack, just assume that everything you bring is going to get wet. If you are taking things like your mobile phone that can't get wet, take them in a separate small bag, pockets of your clothes or a waterproof bag which you can put in your swimming bag.

, Your hair is sponge, absorbing moisture when you're in the water. To prevent absorbing salt water or chlorine, however, you can ""pre-load"" your hair follicles with conditioner. To do so, simply mix up your conditioner with some water in a spray bottle, then coat your hair right before getting into the pool or ocean. You hair should come out noticeably cleaner."
"
Rinse.,
Soak.,
Hang to dry.,
Inspect for damage.,
Store properly.",How to Care for a Wetsuit," When you've finished diving for the day, rinse your suit in fresh water as soon as possible. Most dive operators have a rinse tank. Salt water can cause neoprene to lose its flexibility, and an non-rinsed wetsuit smells bad.;
, As soon as you are able, soak your wetsuit in clean, warm water for about 15 minutes. You also should wash your suit occasionally using wetsuit shampoo or baby shampoo.

, Use a special wetsuit hanger if you have one; if not, use a plastic hanger. Never use a thin wire hanger. The metal will cause the neoprene to degrade. Do not hang it to dry in the sun, the neoprene can crack, find a nice windy spot in the shadow,like under a tree. Let the wetsuit dry thoroughly before storing it to keep it looking and smelling good.

, Before you store your wetsuit, check for any rips or tears. It's easy to get them fixed when they are small.

, Store your wetsuit flat or hung as described above. Do not fold it or shove it in a drawer. The wetsuit will crease and lose some of its insulating effectiveness.

Focus on perfecting your stroke in your last practices, not pushing yourself.,
Relax the day before the meet, resting and getting your sleep.,
Pack your essentials the night before, double checking everything in the morning.,
Eat a simple but complete meal 2-3 hours before racing.,
Double-check the time you need to arrive as well as your plans to get there.,
Set personal goals for the meet.,
Warm up as if you're already in the race.,
Remained focused on your own performance and routine, not other swimmers.",How to Prepare to Go Swimming2," More likely than not, you've already been tapering down your workouts, having easier practices to save energy for the meet. But these workouts are useless if you don't take them seriously. The week before a meet is about getting your stroke absolutely perfect, not just relaxing.


Even though you're doing shorter workouts, you should still give each one of them your best effort.
Now is not the time to radically reform your stroke, but it is the time to ""sharpen your blades,"" working on a consistent, efficient swimming motion., The day before the meet is not the day to go on a 5-mile hike in the sun with your buddies. It is a day to sit back, eat healthy food, and let your body relax. Make sure you get to bed at a decent hour and don't push yourself more than necessary.


Some light stretching is a good way to stay loose and limber for the race the next day.
Some swimmers like a very light run or swim to stay loose. If you want a short workout, take it slow, stretching both before and afterward., There is no worse feeling than showing up at the meet without your suit, so give yourself 24 hours to catch anything you missed while packing. Another strategy is to always keep a spare set of goggles, trunks, and a water bottle in your bag at all times, ensuring you're prepared in a moment's notice.


If you love music to get pumped up, charge your phone/music player the night before and make sure you have headphones.

, Now is not the time to mix up your routine -- if you have a favorite pre-race meal or something you always have before practices, then stick to the routine that works for you. Avoid greasy, fatty, or overly salty/sweet foods and stick to simple, natural ingredients. If you're looking for new meal options, you can mix and match the following categories of foods, aiming to eat well but not completely fill up:



Lean Proteins: Tuna, hard-boiled eggs, grilled chicken, hummus, peanut butter, turkey slices

Simple Carbohydrates: Bread, pasta, pretzels, oatmeal, rice, quinoa (also high in protein), couscous. Avoid high-fiber carbohydrates -- they take a long time to digest.

Fruits/Vegetables: Bananas, avocados, tomatoes, apples, oranges, berries, greens

, Some swim meets have ""positive check in,"" which means you physically must sign your initials to get a lane assignment. Call your coach and check in what time you need to arrive for warm-ups and check-in, then make sure your plans to get there are intact.


The sooner you know what time you need to arrive, the easier it will be to plan your meals and warm-up., Don't just show up and assume that whatever happens will happen. Champions and top swimmers know that it is much easier to reach a goal if you actually know what it is, so take some time to set a good benchmark for your races.


Your goal doesn't have to be coming in first. It may be lowering your splits, perfecting your stroke, or qualifying for the next set of races., This doesn't mean swimming as fast as you can in the warm-up pool, it means having a racer's mentality the minute your toe is in the water. Don't try to just ""turn on"" once the gun goes off. No matter what your warm-up routine, use this time to get mentally ready as well as physically.


Focus on your form, getting into a habit of a nice, smooth stroke from the very beginning.
Tailor your warm-up to your events. If you're doing the backstroke, be sure to practice with some backstroke.
Think of your warm-up routine before you arrive and consider writing it down. You want to be on auto-pilot as you get ready for the race., One of the toughest mental battles before a race is staying focused. But the more prepared you are mentally the better you'll be prepared physically. In your mind, imagine your entire routine, from warming up to getting in the pool and swimming. Envision yourself winning, but also envision potential problems and your solutions.


A good way to stay focused is to commit all your mental energy to the race, and all it's potential outcomes, so you're prepared to handle anything."

Try this simple test to see the difference between how fins work compared to other brands.,
While seated, cross your ankle over your knee, grab your toes and pull them in the direction of the sole of your foot.,
Now, grab the foot in both hands; one holding the heel, the other holding the top of the foot, pull again toward the sole of the foot and resist with the leg.,
To measure your ankle flexibility, sit on the floor with legs extended and place a stiff piece of paper against the side of the foot.,
Measure the distance from the base of your big toe to the ground or floor; your goal should be from one to four inches.,
Avoid ""very long"" or vented, scuba style fins.,
Use your fins.",How to Choose Good Swim Fins,";
,


Do you feel the stretch and tension running from the top of your foot up and along the shin? Those are the primary muscles that other fins work because the fin blade extends from your toes.







, The tension has moved up to the upper leg, hasn't it?

, With heels touching the floor, point your toes as far forward as you can while having someone trace this side view.

,


Fins or flippers come in hundreds of shapes, colors, fastenings, and sizes; different fins will do different things for (and to) you - but don't come down with CFD (Chronic Fins Dependency).






Short or small bladed fins, such as Zoomers, allow you to maintain a foot speed closer to your regular kicking speed with no fins. They also add just enough extra surface area to give you more power from the kick. Zoomer-type fins come in two colors, blue and red. The blue fins are made of a softer material for folks new to short fin kicking or those that have a less efficient kick.






They are less stressful on the ankle due to a more flexible fin blade, much more comfortable when starting out. The red are stiffer fins, resulting in more force per kick, but that also results in more stress on your joints and muscles.








You can make your own short blade fins by cutting off all but two or three inches of the fin's blade.






The home-made variety are usually soft, somewhat comparable to the blue Zoomers-type fins.






The advantage of Zoomers is their finished edges and consistent quality. Other short blade fin designs comes from a variety of sources.






Medium to long bladed fins offer more power for each kick, but potentially at the expense of foot speed.






They are great for working on dolphin kick and butterfly. You can feel your body and leg movements as you swim - bigger fins add emphasis, amplifying each kick.






One good brand of medium bladed fins is the Churchill, featuring a blade that is not too long for competitive swimming.







, While excellent for scuba uses, they are not the best choice for a swimming workout with fins. The fin's length and design result in very slow movements, too slow to give you as much specific benefit as short fins.


The long fins still offers some benefits, for flexibility, increased workout load, and speed, but not as many as the shorter or medium bladed fins.






And then there is the monofin, single-bladed swim fins. These fins are also a great tool for workouts, particularly for developing strong legs, abdominal and back muscles, and working on butterfly technique.







, There is an official sport called Fin swimming. Fin swimming has competitive events where athletes wear single bladed fins (called a monofin) and race either under or at the surface for various distances.


These races are fast! The records for 100 meters (328.1 ft) with a monofin 50m is 13.85 recorded by Pavel KABANOV (RUS) at the 25th European Finswimming Championship in Lignano Sabbiadoro, Italy, in 2015.






Among the things that you can gain by using fins is improved ankle flexibility from the extra force the fins place on your ankle as you kick. Increased ankle flexibility will result in a more efficient flutter kick through better angles of attack on the water.

Identify a rip tide.,
Exit shallow water if you feel a rip current.,
Remain calm.,
Call for help if you are a poor swimmer.,
Swim parallel to shore to escape the current.,
Conserve energy when necessary.,
Swim diagonally toward the shore.",How to Survive a Rip Tide," What most people call a rip tide is technically a ""rip current"": a narrow channel of water rushing from the beach to the sea (or sometimes along the beach). Stay aware of your surroundings and learn the warning signs:


Avoid channels of water that look different from the surroundings. A rip current can be choppier and foamier, or it can be a quiet gap in the line of breaking waves. It may be a slightly different color than the surrounding water.
Use special caution close to low tide and in high surf conditions, but be aware rip currents can happen at any time.;
, If you feel a strong pull in shallow water, get out. A rip current is difficult to fight once you are chest-deep.If the water is waist-deep or shallower, you can likely walk to shore (or sideways out of the current) if you keep your footing.

, If you get caught in a rip current, don't panic: it takes a clear head to escape. Understand that a rip current does not drag you underwater, even if it feels that way when a wave hits you. Rip currents only pull you straight out to sea. Good swimmers are not in immediate danger of drowning unless they exhaust themselves by trying to fight the current., Rip currents are especially dangerous to people who cannot swim well. If you do not think you will be able to reach the shore, get the attention of a lifeguard or of other beachgoers by waving your arms and yelling for help.


Trying to rescue someone by swimming into a rip current is very dangerous. People on shore should throw you a floating object to hang onto instead., Most rip currents are less than 30 feet (9.1 m) wide, though they can reach 100–200 feet (30.5–61.0 m).Instead of trying to swim against the current — which is much stronger than you are — swim parallel to the shore to get out of its path. The rip current will carry you further away from shore as you swim, but don't panic. This is not a foolproof method, but it is a good option for a strong swimmer. If possible, look for these signs before choosing a direction:


The longshore current, a normal current moving parallel to the beach, is often strong enough to push you back into the rip current if you try to swim against it. Check the direction of the longshore current in advance by asking the lifeguard or observing the angle of waves on the beach.Rip currents often form around jetties and other structures perpendicular to the beach. If you are near one of these structures, swim away from it.
Swim in the direction of the nearest breaking waves. These mark the edge of the rip current.

, If you are not making any progress by swimming, or if you are getting tired, conserve your energy. Float on your back or tread water instead of fighting the current. Once you are past the breaking waves, the rip current will slow down and fan out into multiple branches, becoming much weaker.If you do not have the energy to make it back to shore, stay afloat and relax until you are ready to begin. Continue to signal for help if there are people present.


Most rip currents subside or become weak enough to escape soon after the breaking waves. In extreme cases, a rip current can extend up to 1,000 feet (304.8 m) offshore.Recent research suggests that many rip currents eventually circulate back to shore if you can stay afloat for a few minutes. This is still controversial, but it may be your best chance of survival if you are a weak swimmer., Once you are out of the current, either because you have swum out the side or the current has carried you to its end, make your way back to shore. Swimming diagonally away from the rip current minimizes the chance that you will enter it again. You may be some distance from shore at this point, so stop and float periodically if you need to rest.

Teach the Scissors Kick.,
Teach the Sidestroke Arms.,
Teach the timing of the Arms & Legs.",How to Teach the Sidestroke," You can start by teaching the kick on the deck, then move to the pool wall.


Teach the learning cues: ""Heels up, Split, Squeeze, and Glide"" (up, split, squeeze, and glide).






Make sure to demonstrate the kick as well, and have your students recite the cues as you demonstrate.






When your student is ready to progress to practicing the kick across the pool, use a kick board or water barbell (see attached video).






Be sure to manipulate the legs through the proper movement pattern.





;
, Try using the old “Apple Tree” analogy: ""Pick an apple off the tree, put it in your other hand, drop it in the basket."" (repeat). Further explain that the Sidestroke Arm Action with these cues: ""Pull, Push, and Glide."" Because it would be very difficult to practice the arms without the legs while swimming, teach the timing next.

, In this step, put it all together. Demonstrate the stroke first while having your students use a choral responding technique. In other words, recite the timing cues as they are demonstrated. The timing cues are: ""Arms and Legs Bend, Arms and Legs Straighten."" Once the students have seen it and have a general understanding of the new stroke-- get them back into the water to start practicing it!

Know how tall you are.,
Decide what your favorite style of a beach towel is.,
Choose what color or design you want on your towel.,
Know your price range.,
Visit local stores and the Internet.",How to Choose the Right Beach Towel for You," Measure yourself or have somebody else do it for you. This is important to know because towels come in different sizes. You don't want to purchase a towel that is overly small or big for your body. For example, if you are five feet tall, you wouldn't want a towel that was only four feet long.;
, Do you like towels that are shaped like creatures of the sea?? Or, how about towels that are shaped like stars or hearts? Maybe you just like the plain old rectangle towel. Look on the Internet for some pictures of towels to decide which one you like the best. Ask for a friend or family member's opinion if you are debating between two different styles.

, Do you like bright neon-colored beach towels? Maybe you would like a towel with pigs and ducks on it. Look at multiple ones to decide which design is your favorite. You may want to match the color of your towel with the style of the towel. For example, if you are getting a towel shaped like a heart, you would probably not want a design with trees on it.

, Do you only have ten dollars to spare on the beach towel? Whatever the case may be, don't try to spend all of the money you have just on a cool beach towel. Most towels become dirty, out-of-date, and too short to be worth too much money. You will probably have to get a new one in the next few years, so it isn't worth wasting all of your money on one beach towel.

, Look in multiple places for the cheapest towel that is similar to the one you want. Make sure that the height, style, and color/design on the beach towel is exactly the way you want. Don't purchase the towel if it is torn, ripped, has something stuck to it, dirty, or ruined in some other way.

Make sure your child’s bathing suit fits well and conforms to her specific shape and size.,
Choose a good quality material for your child’s bathing suit.,
Make sure the material you choose helps protect your child from the sun.,
Consider the convenience of purchasing a bathing suit that makes it easier for you to change your child’s diaper.",How to Buy a Child’s Bathing Suit1," When a bathing suit is too small, it can cause the child a lot of discomfort and can also give her a rash if the elastic is too tight. On the other hand, when a bathing suit is too large, it can cause your child to experience a lot of difficulty when she is swimming or doing other water activities.


Some girls may be more comfortable in bathing suits that have regular straps as opposed to bathing suits that are halter style and tie around the neck. When the suits tie around the neck, the straps can dig into the skin, which can be uncomfortable for some children.
Boys may be more comfortable wearing longer board shorts that hang just above the knee rather than shorter ones.;
, There are many different types of swimsuit materials and the type that you should choose depends on what kind of activities your child will be doing while wearing the bathing suit. Some bathing suits have a soft material that keeps your child comfortable and are designed to prevent her from breaking out in a rash. There are also bathing suits made of material that dries quickly and keeps your child comfortable as well; a lycra and spandex mix is the best material for drying quickly.

, There are certain materials that can help minimize the amount of UV rays that penetrate your child’s skin while she is wearing the suit. It is also important to check all of the materials used to make the bathing suit, so that you know if your child is allergic to any of those materials.

, When babies and toddlers are playing in the pool it can be hard to get them out of the pool to go to the bathroom, even if they are in the process of potty training. If you purchase a suit that makes it easier to change their diaper often, you can avoid embarrassing accidents in the pool.

You want to make sure that the bathing suit your child wears will not hinder her safety while she is swimming or doing other water activities.,
Keep your child’s style in mind when picking out her bathing suit.",How to Buy a Child’s Bathing Suit2,"


A long bathing suit or skirt can become attached to the side of the pool or the railings on the ladders of the pool.
Make sure that the waist of the suit is not too tight because this can harm the skin. One way to make sure the bathing suit you buy for your child fits appropriately is to choose a bathing suit with elastic that can be adjusted to the child’s specific shape.

, Just like when you feel uncomfortable when you wear a bathing suit that is not your personal style and that does not fit you well, your child will likely feel the same way about her bathing suit.


Both girls and boys can be self-conscious about their bodies and it is important to make sure that they feel good in what they are wearing and that it is not fashionably out of date.
Keep in mind that if you buy a bathing suit made of lighter colors, these colors will fade very quickly from the sun, chlorine and salt water. This can make the bathing suit look old and worn. It may be a good idea to buy brighter colors to prolong the life of the suit.

Learn about the different types of swim diapers that are available.,
In order to keep your infant safe, you should consider purchasing a good flotation device for the pool.",How to Buy a Child’s Bathing Suit3," Swim diapers have a stronger elastic band than regular diapers do, in order to contain any urine while the baby is in the pool.


You can purchase disposable swim diapers that are used only once and then thrown out.
If you would rather not buy disposable swim diapers, there are reusable swim diapers available for purchase at most baby super-centers. Reusable swim diapers can be used as many times as you like after they have been properly washed. Although they are not as convenient as a disposable swim diaper that can be removed and discarded, reusable swim diapers tend to save money because you don’t have to keep purchasing new packs of swim diapers every time you take your baby swimming.
It is important to remember that swim diapers do not keep leaks from occurring, they only help to contain urine for a short time. You should make sure that you continue to take your child out of the pool and check the diapers regularly.

, Bathing suits that have flotation devices built into the liner are a convenient, affordable option. Flotation bathing suits offer additional protection during swimming.


There are a variety of styles available, including bathing suits with inflatable rings around the middle and those with inner tubing that helps to keep the baby afloat.
Many parents choose to purchase flotation bathing suits in addition to placing their baby in a flotation device while in the water.
One of the best flotation devices for an infant is the ring that provides a place for your baby to sit. Most of these rings also have a device that keeps your child shaded, which will help keep your baby from getting sunburned.

From 6 to 12 months is usually considered a good time to introduce your child to the water because at this age children will absorb the skill faster. As long as you're gentle with your child and introduce him to the water gradually, you can begin as early as 6 months., Make sure your child, whatever his age, is healthy enough to begin swimming. If your child has any health conditions you should consult your doctor before beginning swimming lessons., If you have a young child just learning how to swim, you should be familiar with basic first aid. Knowing CPR can save your child's life., If your child is still in diapers, use a waterproof swim diaper to prevent any leaks and protect the health of other swimmers., Blow-up devices like water wings are popular, but not recommended by pediatricians. If these spring a leak while your child is swimming, he can sink. These devices can also slip off.Instead, use a U.S. Coast Guard-approved life vest. These should be available at most sporting goods and pool equipment stores.


When buying a life vest, look for the U.S. Coast Guard-approved label. For small children, the vest should have straps that hook under the legs to keep it from slipping over the child's head., If you have a pool, make sure your child can't get to it. Learning how to swim may make your child overconfident of his abilities and he might try to swim when you're not looking. Avoid accidents by completely blocking access to the pool when it's not in use.

, Infants require warm water, ideally between 85 and 92 degrees.If your pool isn't heated, you can try using a solar cover, which absorbs heat from the sun, to warm the pool.

, You should introduce your child to the water gradually. Many people, adults and children, drown because they panic in the water. By slowly exposing your child to the water, you're helping him overcome that fear. This will help him stay calm when learning more advanced swimming skills., An enjoyable first time in the water will teach your child the joy of swimming. Play together with toys, teach him to splash, sing songs, and be attentive to make sure he is enjoying himself., Lock his arms around your neck while he's facing you and start walking slowly backwards.

, With some practice, your child will learn to start kicking in the water by himself., He can best learn his own sense of buoyancy by remaining still in the water on his back, but at this stage he is sure to need your support.The most important part of learning this skill is getting him to relax., Carefully holding your child around the belly and being certain to keep his head above the water, you can both pretend he is a superhero flying.

, Seeing that you can float will reassure your child it is possible. You should take a moment to describe that different parts of the body float better than others. Deeper breaths will make the lungs more buoyant, and the lower body usually sinks., Now that your child understands a little bit more about floating, have him get a sense for the buoyancy of other objects. Have your child push toys and other floating objects under the water and laugh with him as he makes bubbles and splashes.

, Children are often uncomfortable with the sensation of the unsupported feeling of the back-float in water. A common reflex is to lift the head and bend at the waist, which will cause your child to sink., By resting your child’s head on your shoulder and holding him carefully, you can practice floating together. Sing a relaxing song together can have a calming effect in addition to other positive benefits of being skin to skin with your child., He should be in front of you in case he panics. Count down from three, exhaling lightly to blow on his face on the count of one. This will serve as a signal to your child that you are about to turn him on his back and will help prevent panic.

, Use your non-dominant hand to support his head, keeping it above water. Use the other to touch him in a reassuring way and offer support as necessary. He may squirm when placed in this position. Keep supporting him until he settles down.


When he calms, little by little stop supporting his body while still holding his head. Allow him to float.

, If you are emotional, it might appear you are validating your child’s panic response. Use positive affirmations to restore clarity, saying things like, “It’s OK. I’m here. You have nothing to worry about.” Smile and laugh to show him everything is alright.

, This will familiarize him with being underwater and diminish his fear of it., Count to three and gently submerge his head. Bring it back up immediately.


Use smooth motions. Jerky motions can hurt your child's neck.
Allow your child to rest before doing this again.

, If you are clearly nervous or scared, your child will believe the water is something to fear. At this stage, you want to stay positive and show him that he doesn't have to be afraid of the water., At this early age, your child can't swim independently. You should always be in the pool with him at this stage.

, You can do this in the same fashion described for children under two. Help him overcome his initial fear and get him comfortable in the water. Once he is at ease, you can move on to some more advanced lessons.

, At this age, your child should be able to understand what is and isn't allowed in the pool. Generally accepted pool rules include:No running
No horse-play
No diving
Swim with a buddy
Stay away from drain covers and filters

, Most drowning cases under five result from inadequate supervision., At this age, your child can understand descriptions of swimming activities. If he is ready for something new, he is more likely to absorb the lesson if he is given brief instruction ahead of time.Show the motions for swimming activities outside the water before getting in. You might want to address new sensations, like the sense of buoyancy that can be felt in the chest when floating, pressure in the ears, or the muffled quality of sound beneath the water.

, Have your child submerge just his lips in the water and blow bubbles. This will help him with breath control and help prevent swallowing water as he starts learning to go underwater.If your child is hesitant, demonstrate this first. When you take your mouth out of the water, make sure you have a smile on your face. This will help show your child that there is nothing to be afraid of.

, Tell your child to talk to the fish, make a noise like a tractor, or blow as many bubbles as he can in the water. This makes the lesson fun while you teach your child a valuable swimming skill., Stand facing your child. Hold his arms out in front of him. Then start walking backwards, having your child kick his feet as you move. Verbal cues like ""kick, kick, kick, kick"" can help your child remember this motion., This is a simplified, arms-only version of the freestyle, which is where you paddle with your arms while kicking with your legs. Have your child start by sitting on a pool step or ladder so the water is roughly up to his chest.

, He should extend one arm straight out of the water and bring it above his head.

, He should bring it back to the water in a downward slapping motion, making sure he keeps his fingers together as he drives his hand into and through the water.

, Repeat this motion with the other arm. Direct him to use his arms like he would if he were really swimming.

, Make sure he keeps his fingers together, so the fish don't escape., Standing a few feet into open water, hold your child with one hand on his chest and one around his waist. Count to three and glide him through the water towards the steps or ladder.


While doing this, have him combine blowing bubbles, kicking his legs, and swimming with his arms. This will help him start using all the motions necessary for independent swimming., Holding onto the wall is a good way for him to make his way back to the shallows and also helps teach him to maneuver on his own. It shows him a safe place he can use to stay afloat if he falls in the water, gets tired, or is scared., Instead of just dipping his head under, you can now try to keep him under for a few seconds. This will teach him to hold his breath underwater. Make sure you tell him to close his eyes and mouth and hold his breath.


Remember to explain what you're about to do to avoid scaring your child.
Never put your child underwater unexpectedly. This will scare him and could make him afraid of the water.

, After two or three seconds, bring him back up. You can increase this gradually as your child gets accustomed to it.If he seems hesitant, try counting to two or three to show him that he'll only be under the water for a very short time.
It may make your child more comfortable if you go under first. Remember to smile and laugh when you come back up so he knows there's nothing to be afraid of.

, At this point, he has all the basic skills needed to start swimming, he just needs practice putting it all together. A life vest will allow him the freedom he needs to start combining all these techniques and swimming on his own.

, Remember that even if your child is capable of swimming without you holding him, he should still never be left alone.

, If he is comfortable in the water and is able to swim at or beyond the level described for 2 – 4 year olds, then you can move on to more advanced swimming techniques.

, This is a fun and simple swimming style that is often used by young children learning to swim.The ideal water level for the Dog Paddle is about chest high.

, Making downward scooping motions with his fingers together, he should “dig” through the water while kicking his feet, much like a dog or a horse might swim.


Have fun while learning the Dog Paddle by searching for videos of dogs swimming online.

, Chances are he will try to fully extend his legs, but short, fast kicks offer more power. To improve form, have him point his toes while kicking., He might need support while learning to coordinate his arms and legs, but as he gains confidence you should supervise independent swimming.

, To properly swim with both hands, your child will not be able to plug his nose while swimming. Start with a game to see who can make the most bubbles using only air blown out the nose!

, In the beginning, your child might blow out all his air in one burst out of fear the water will rush up his nose. Stay close in case he accidentally takes on some water and needs your support.


In the event he has the unpleasant experience of getting water up his nose, respond appropriately. Give him warm encouragement by saying things like, “That happens sometimes. It’s OK!”

, At this point, your child might not be the most coordinated underwater, but allow him to get a feel for moving around underwater without plugging his nose. This will make it easier for him to transition to swimming a proper stroke.

, You should approach this exercise with patience, as this is a complicated technique that may take some time., He should be about waist or chest deep in the water. Be aware that your child might have eyes that are sensitive to chlorine.

, Practice in the shallow end and allow him to feel how his arms and legs sync up without submerging his head. Regularly, have him turn his head to practice the motion of turning out of the water to breathe. He should alternate the side he turns every third stroke.

, Do this by counting his strokes and having him turn his head and take a deep breath with the third stroke. Alternating sides will keep his form symmetrical., Have him dip his face in the water and practice swimming two strokes, turning his head for a breath on every third stroke. With each breath, he should alternate sides.

, Once he is comfortable, he can graduate to swimming with a life vest and, after mastering that, he can begin supervised swimming on his own.

, When he is experienced enough, you can try this without a life vest. If not, it is fine to start with a life vest on., When he stops moving from the push, he should start kicking and stroking with his arms until he reaches the other side.


Make sure you follow closely, especially if he isn't wearing a life vest.

, This will help if your child falls in onto his back., Tell him to drop one of his shoulders towards the bottom of the pool. He should roll the rest of his body to follow the motion of that shoulder.


When he rotates onto his stomach, have him swim to the side of the pool.

, Treading water is an important skill in case your child needs to stay afloat in the water for a long period of time. It will keep him upright in the water and able to interact with toys and friends while floating., Do this by having him jump off the ladder towards the center of the pool. Once in the water, he should immediately turn around and swim back to the ladder. This basic technique could save your child's life., This will teach him that it is only acceptable to jump to the middle, where it's safest, and not to the sides, where he could get hurt.

, Now that your child is more experienced, he can start learning some real swim strokes. The following are some of the most common swimming strokes your child can learn.


Freestyle: Do Three Basic Strokes while Swimming

Breaststroke: Swim Breaststroke Efficiently

Backstroke: Do Three Basic Strokes while Swimming

Sidestroke: Swim the Sidestroke

"
Throw anything in your hands aside.,
Tuck your chin into your armpit.,
Relax your joints.,
Turn your body as you fall.,
Break your fall with as much body surface area as possible.,
Land in a pushup position.,
Breathe out as you land.,
Roll with the fall.,
Examine yourself for injuries before rising.",How to Break a Headfirst Fall or Dive1," Having free hands will help you break your fall more easily. Try to throw the items to the side so you will not fall on them. Don't throw them with too much force, as you may injure someone. Don't worry about breaking fragile items, like your cell phone. If you are falling headfirst, items in your hand are likely to strike the ground anyway. Your own safety is a more important consideration.;
, You should also turn your head towards the armpit you tuck your chin into. This will help keep you from striking the ground with your nose or mouth. Injuries to the nose and mouth are among the most common serious injuries resulting from a face-first fall. Tucking your chin will also naturally bring the stronger parts of your shoulder and back in line for a roll, should you choose to do one.

, It is a natural response to extend and ""lock"" your arms or legs during a fall. This should be avoided. Locked elbows and knees are much more likely to be damaged during a fall, since they will not ""give"" under the sudden impact of landing. Instead, allow your arms and legs to remain loose and bent as you fall. , It is far better to land on your buttocks or side than directly onto your arms and head. Turn your body in the same direction you have tucked your chin to further ensure your face doesn't hit the ground. Try to make this motion as fluid as possible, without twisting your back abruptly. If you can't turn on your side in time, you can still break your fall with your arms and hands.

, If you strike the ground with as broad a surface area as you can, you will be less likely to be injured. If you had time to turn your body, this means falling onto your buttocks or the fleshy part of your side, upper back and upper arm. , If you must fall on your arms and hands, remember to strike with as much surface area as possible. This means striking with both palms, as if you were falling into a pushup. Make sure your elbows are relaxed. Think of your arms like springs, which will allow your body to come to rest on the ground without striking it full force. Don't try to fully stop your fall with your arms. Just allow the force of your fall to bend your elbows as slowly as possible, lowering your body to the ground.
If you can't land on your palms, try to land on your entire forearm. Don't land on your elbow, though, as it is more fragile and presents less surface area to the impact.

, It is common to hold your breath while falling, and this should be avoided. Your body will naturally try to expel the air from your lungs as you land, and you should allow this to happen. Breathing out will allow your body to ""give"" to the force of the impact, potentially reducing the strain on your bones. , Instead of trying to halt your forward movement, allow yourself to roll with it. This is easiest to accomplish if you land on your side, since you will naturally tend to roll like a barrel. If landing on your arms or shoulder, you can attempt an intentional forward roll by keeping your chin and forward shoulder tucked, and tucking your knees in. Here are some guidelines for attempting a forward roll.Try to roll over the shoulder opposite to the side where your chin is tucked.
As you fall forward, roll over your shoulder on a diagonal line from your shoulder to your opposite hip.
Come to rest on your buttocks and feet at the end of the roll.
You should practice performing such a roll from a squatting position on a soft, stable surface before attempting it during an actual fall.

, If you feel a sharp, intense pain in a bone or joint, don't put any weight on it, and call for assistance right away. If you suspect you may be injured, call for emergency services, and ask the operator what you should do to avoid worsening your injury.

Practice the freestyle kick.,
Teach the freestyle kick fundamentals first.,
Practice back kicking.,
Practice a variety of breath control drills.,
Teach side breathing drills.,
Practice the freestyle as a whole and in parts.,
Use kinesthetic feedback.",How to Teach Freestyle to Children," Start your young students off with a kickboard. Check that the child knows how to hold the kickboard properly, as described here:


Thumbs on top
Fingers on the bottom
Arms straight and on top of the board
The chin should be at or near the surface of the water
The bottom of the board should be held just in front of the student's chest.;
, By starting with kicking technique, you can get children enthused because this part is easy. In developing their kick, it is helpful to use cues such as: ""fast feet,"" ""small and fast,"" ""straighter legs"" , etc., so that they are immediately aware of what they are doing and how to fix it. By the way, this doesn't mean that their legs should be perfectly straight, however, ""straighter legs"" is still a good correction cue for beginners who have excessive knee bend. In addition, children will tend to make a lot of splashing (because they can) and while this can be tolerated initially, it should be discouraged over time or they will develop a bad kicking technique.

, The best method for teaching children back kicking is to use ""back kick progressions"". This means not just kicking on the front (stomach face down); it is important to practice on the back (stomach face up) too. The flutter kick skill practiced on the back transfers nicely to the freestyle flutter kick and for some children it is helpful because their face is not in the water to begin with.

, The breathing aspect of freestyle is important to ensure a smooth, gliding stroke that takes the swimmer further. For children, such drills can be turned into a ""game"" to begin with. Examples include:


Hopping Frog Bobs
Stationary side breaths (this is demonstrated in the video sample below).
Cues such as ""Breathe in the mouth, blow out the mouth and the nose"" work well too.

, Use both stationary and moving drills while using cues like ""ear in the water breathe, face in the water blow it out.""

, It is always helpful to break everything down when teaching children, while still giving the children a taste of the whole stroke placed together. So, practice the stroke in parts as an excellent way to isolate different aspects of the stroke, but always end your lesson by having your child ""at least"" attempt to put the stroke all together. As described above, make good use of cues like ""Breathe, stroke one, stroke two.""

, No form of feedback is more effective than ""kinesthetic feedback"". This simply means allowing your student to ""feel"" the movement while you manipulate their arms, head position, or legs through a given movement pattern.

Prepare your mind as well as your body.",How to Swim Faster," Swimmers often focus on swimming as fast as possible, not swimming with the least amount of drag. Drag is the resistance your body has against the water. Remember that it takes true skill, not just force, to bring down that drag. There are many ways to decrease your drag, such as improving your balance or swimming taller., This is a great way to decrease your drag. To stay balanced, maintain a position that is as horizontal as it can possibly be as you move through the water. This will make it so that the least amount of water gets in your path, slowing you down. This is especially important for the freestyle stroke, where you have to keep yourself from lifting your head too much, which disrupts your balance, so you have to kick harder to counterbalance.This is a bit different when it comes to the breaststroke and butterfly stroke, because your body undulates instead of being perfectly balanced during the strokes.

, Try to make yourself as tall as possible when you're in the water. The taller or longer you are, the better and faster you can swim. For example, to swim taller during the free stroke, you have to enter your recovering arm into the water early, once it passes over your head; you should extend your recovering arm forward as far is it will go before you begin the down sweep and catch.


Think about it: if your body is all scrunched up instead of stretched nice and tall, it'll be more difficult to move through the water.

, When you kick, you shouldn't break the surface of the water or move your legs too low below the body line—it all goes back to maintaining balance. If you do this, you'll be off balance, creating more drag., This does not mean you should focus more on strength than skill. Remember that about 10% of your speed comes from your legs, while the rest comes from your arms, so you should focus on getting those strokes as clean as possible., Don't be afraid to roll from side to side a bit more as you use each arm stroke. This will let you make better use of those big back muscles and will also make better use of your shoulder strength. It does take some getting used to in practice, but once you get the hang of it, you'll have a better command of your strength, as well as your speed., The core is made up of your back, hip, and torso muscles, and it's especially important to use it when you're rolling from side to side. Making use of those muscles will help you swim more cleanly and more quickly, though it may feel a bit awkward to place more emphasis on your core instead of your arms and legs, at first., In order to maximize your speed, you have to align your hand and your forearm and have them face backwards. This makes it easier to move your arm backward for strokes. You might have heard of this technique as the high elbow catch during the freestyle stroke, because you have to keep your elbow above your head to really master this move., To swim as fast as possible, aim to have a neutral head position throughout your stroke. Keeping your head positioned this way reduces drag and makes strokes more efficient. If your head isn't centered, you'll be swimming to one side. Incorrect head position may be the reason you feel you are ""sinking"" because of lowered hips or muscular legs. You should be looking down, not up, to keep your body as horizontal as possible in the freestyle position. To keep your head and eyes down, keep your neck relaxed; this will keep your lower body higher in the water.If you're more of a visual thinker, take this advice from the swimmer, Garret McCaffery: “Imagine you are a whale, there is a blowhole on your neck, and you need that hole accessible at all times so you can breathe or you will die. If your neck is angled you closed the hole and you can’t breathe. You need to position your head so your neck is at the right angle.”, By spreading your fingers slightly, instead of clamping them together, you create an ""invisible web"" that can help exert 53% more force! The ideal spacing is 20-40% of the diameter of the finger., Even when you're not in a race, avoid making illegal turns when you swim, so you don't get into the habit. Just like maintaining a neutral head position, doing what you're going to do on race day in practice will allow you to swim faster., A lot of swimmers think of the walls as a comfy little resting place, even if they're only ""resting"" there for a fraction of a second. However, if you want to swim faster, then this absolutely cannot be you. Approach the wall quickly, with your head down for at least two strokes in all of the strokes you're swimming except the breaststroke. This will help you get the lead you may need to beat your best race time—and the swimmers in the other lanes., When you're pushing off the wall, make sure to use a strong kick off it to keep up the speed you've gained. For a breaststroke, doing a full pull out can give you that extra edge. Continue to maintain a tight streamline while you're doing this, and you'll see that you'll soon be swimming faster than ever., If you're already using a powerful kick, you can go even faster by dolphin kicking off the wall. Dolphin kicking off the wall can make you go even faster, and having a strong underwater kick can increase your lung capacity.., If you're part of a team, then the coach will provide a structured routine for you. But it's always good to have your own routine as well, for personal practice. Having a routine that has elements of aerobic exercise, (which means swimming for longer) as well as a moderate endurance workout (which focuses on mid-distance and moderately hard swimming) can help you get faster. Your workout should have several elements but the main part should focus on endurance, speed, and muscular endurance. Here's an example of a structured workout you can try:10-15% spent on an easy warm up (4 x 100 easy swimming with 20 seconds of rest between each distance)
10-20% spent on drills and kicking (8 x 50s as an alternating drill, with 1 kick with 15 seconds of rest)
40-70% spent on the main set (6 x 200 with 30 seconds of rest or 12 x 100 with 15 seconds of rest)
5-10% spent on cooling down (easy 100s)

, Search for swim teams in your area, and find information such as how much it costs to register, what time practice is at, and what equipment you need. If you're not already on a team, being on one can definitely help you swim faster not only because you'll have more motivation to practice every day, but because you'll also get more practice during races and will be working with a coach who can help you master the correct technique.

If you do join a team, you have to commit to coming to practice every day.
Push yourself at practice. Try to make the send-offs with 5-7 seconds rest. Once you've mastered that, try 10 seconds, 15, and so on.

, If you are on a swim team, then you'll be participating in swim meets regularly. Don't be nervous; it's not about getting first place, but about beating your best time. Most swimmers swim faster during swim meets than practice, because adrenaline is high and there's more at stake. You can ""trick"" your body into swimming faster just by attending swim meets.

, Swim clinics can teach you better form for your strokes, tips for achieving more, can help you with your dives and turns, and may generally give you an unforgettable experience. You'll be motivated by meeting other people who are as excited about swimming as you are. Some swim clinics even have Olympic athletes as coaches. They may be costly, but many will say that they are worth it.


You may even be able to find a clinic or a coach who can film you while you're swimming, providing valuable feedback about how you can improve your technique. It's hard to know where you can improve without having someone else watch you swim.

, Watch videos and read books about swimming to get a better sense of what it means to swim faster. There are lots of videos on YouTube on how to improve your strokes. Also, there are lots of books about better stroke technique. Try to get books like that, or books about the success of swimmers like Michael Phelps, Ryan Lochte, and Missy Franklin to get motivated. Though using your body to swim faster is important, it doesn't hurt to engage your mind, too.

, Though practicing swimming itself is very important, you can also improve your speed by building a stronger body. Do some cardio work by running, train with weights, and do sit-ups to improve your core. Having stronger abs and arms can help you move through the water more quickly. Plus, this kind of workout can be a refreshing break from spending so much time in the water.

, If your friend is faster than you, and your goal is to be faster than him, think about that all during every practice to encourage you to work harder. Swimming alongside faster swimmers pushes you and helps you get faster, too. Just make sure the person next to you isn't so much faster than you that you get discouraged by the process.

, All of that physical work won't mean a thing if you're feeling too nervous or simply unmotivated. Stay focused and motivated throughout practice and get excited to be there on race day. Don't dread the meets, and instead, look at them as an opportunity to try to do your best. Remember that it's not about being the best swimmer on your team or at the meet, but about doing your personal best. This alone should motivate you to swim faster.

Judge the depth of the water.,
Relax your joints.,
Land on your feet and legs if you can.,
Tuck your chin to your chest.,
Try to avoid diving.,
Breathe out through the nose as you go under.,
Swim calmly to the surface.",How to Break a Headfirst Fall or Dive2," If the water you are falling into is too shallow for you to stand in up to your shoulders, breaking your fall with a dive is a bad idea, and you should do everything you can to land feet-first., Locked elbows and knees are more prone to injury in a fall, even into water. While it is natural to tense up after tripping or falling, try to relax your muscles and fall smoothly and naturally. , Depending on how far you are falling, you may have time to tuck your knees, and bring your feet and legs beneath you so that they strike the water first. Assume the ""pencil"" position if possible , entering the water toes-first, arms at your sides. Entering the water with your feet is always preferable to falling onto your hands or arms, as your legs absorb shock much more efficiently.Try to avoid ""belly flopping"" as much as possible, even if you can't bring your legs under your body. Tucking your chin, and bringing your knees up into a ""cannonball"" position is preferable to landing flat on your stomach, but remember to keep your joints relaxed.

, This will make it less likely for you to strike the surface of the water face-first, and will help straighten your spine for a dive. If you aren't able to complete a proper dive in time, tucking your chin will begin naturally curling your body so that your back and shoulders strike the water first, rather than your face. Closing your eyes as you attempt to dive is a good idea, as it will help you focus on positioning your body correctly.

, If you are an experienced diver, you might be able to assume the correct diving position and enter the water fingers-first. If you do not execute the dive correctly, however, you risk serious injury to your spine. If you are not falling from a great height (as described in the next section), a belly flop is an unpleasant but usually harmless way to enter the water.Try to cover your face with your hands and keep your chin tucked.

Again, whenever possible, turn your body mid-air to enter the water feet-first.
If you aren't falling very far and you are a competent diver, it may be appropriate to attempt an impromptu dive by extending your arms and hands, finger first, towards the surface of the water. Remember not to lock your joints. If your fingers hit the water first, they will break the surface tension of the water, allowing the rest of your body to enter the water more easily.

, Controlling your breath in this way will help ensure that you don't accidentally breathe in water. Holding your breath is a natural response to the shock of falling, but you should avoid this. If you impact the water with held breath, the pressure in your lungs combined with the impact of the fall can cause injury.

, It is natural to panic in deep water. Use even, steady strokes to rise to the surface where you can take a breath of air, then swim to land or ask for help from others nearby.

"
"
Remain calm.,
Spread your arms.,
Arch your neck.,
Use your legs to control your landing position.,
Protect your head before hitting the ground.",How to Break a Headfirst Fall or Dive3," A fall from a great height is an overwhelming, frightening experience. You must focus on the task at hand to maximize your chances of landing safely. Avoid the temptation to hold your breath, and try to breathe evenly. Relaxing your limbs will also reduce your risk of serious injuries, as locked joints are much more likely to be harmed by impact.

, If you are falling from a very significant height, such as from a tall building or an airplane, you will have time to alter your body position by creating air resistance with your upper body. Spreading your arms will help your upper body ""drag"" more in the air, slowing it down and allowing your legs to catch up., Tilting your head back will further increase the air resistance of your upper body, allowing you to shift from a head-first falling position more quickly. Be aware that you only want to do this position as you're trying to slow your fall — you will eventually want to protect yourself during impact by tucking your chin against your chest.

, If you are falling into water, then you should point your legs directly towards the surface of the water. This will allow your legs to absorb most of the force from the fall. Experts disagree as to what position is best for landing on a solid surface, but a feet-first or full-body landing are both certainly preferable to a head first landing.To achieve a full-body landing, you should spread your legs out behind you as you transition from a head-first falling position. This will even out the air resistance of your body, allowing you to point your chest and belly towards the ground.

, Head trauma is a frequent cause of fatal injury while falling. As you are about to land, wrap your arms around your head, being sure to protect the side facing the ground. Your arms may be injured, but you will increase your odds of surviving the fall. "

Remember to stay safe at all times.",How to Prepare for Your First Adult Swim Lessons," Find a suit that is comfortable, fits well, and that you can move in. It shouldn’t fall off if you jump in the pool. Leave the embellished bikinis and baggy swim trunks for the beach or pool; you need something that is streamlined and easy to move in.


Be extra cautious about the color white. Depending on the lining, it can be see through when wet.;
, Not only will it protect your hair against the chlorine, but it will also make your body more streamlined and reduce water tension. If you have long hair, be sure to tie it up first, and then tuck it under the cap.


Some swim caps contain latex. If you are allergic to latex, read the label, and make sure that you purchase a latex-free swim cap.

, Nothing ruins a swim faster than water in the eyes. Get goggles that fit over your eyes, and make sure that they are comfortable. Never get ones that cover the nose and mouth.


Some contain latex. If you are allergic to latex, be sure to check the packaging before you buy anything first; it will tell you whether or not it contains latex.

, Many people find that items, like pool noodles, kickboards, and flippers help them with various aspects of swimming. If your swim teacher recommends these items, then you might want to consider buying them as well.


You can also purchase nose plugs and ear plugs to prevent water from getting into your nose and ear.
If you are swimming in an outdoor pool, be sure to get sunscreen.

, Make sure your goggles are on. At this point, you may need to adjust the goggles by tugging on the straps so that they don't leak.


If you don't feel comfortable getting into the pool yet, you can practice this part in a bowl of warm water. The bowl should be twice the size of your face., Take a deep breath through your mouth first, then place your face into the water. Exhale slowly through your mouth, just enough to keep water from entering your mouth.


Some swimmers like to exhale through both their nose and mouth. If you find this to be more comfortable for you, then you should do it.Some swimmers find that wearing a nose plug helps them exhale better underwater., You should take twice as much time to exhale as to inhale.If you find this difficult to keep track of, try timing your exhalation to the count of ten.

, You will likely get water in your mouth at some point while you are underwater. While this may feel uncomfortable, it is not a near-death experience. It happens to a lot of people, especially when they are first learning how to swim.


One way to reduce swallowing water is to position your tongue as though saying ""Keh."", Even though you are not swimming yet, this is a good practice to get into. It will help keep your body straight and aligned. If you keep your head out of the water, your body will be tilted upwards, and create more drag and resistance. It will make it harder to swim.If your pool has those black lanes, use those as a focal point.

, You'll feel the pressure of the water resisting you, and you may even find it shifting your body around. Moving your arms sideways will cause your body to turn. Pushing downward will cause your body to move upward. moves your body up. Moving your arms backward will tilt your body forward.


You can do this standing or sitting, but you should be in the water up to your shoulders.
This is sometimes referred to as ""sculling.""

, Make sure that your head is out of the water.

, Use your feet to push off of the pool's floor, and remember to breathe out through your mouth.

, Push off the bottom with your feet to come up and grab the wall. Scull and kick while coming up.

, If you want, you can even step away further from the pool's edge. Remember to go no deeper than where you can still stand. This way, if your confidence fails, all you have to do is stand up.

, Become accustomed to having your face in the water and your body stretched out. Try to reduce your dependence on using a flotation device and being afraid of going underwater. You can even swim a little underwater before coming up. Your primary reaction in the water must be to stretch out on the surface, scull, kick, breathe and relax.


Don't get discouraged if you accidentally swallow some water. It happens to everyone, even experienced swimmers.

, If your hips are lower than your shoulders, your body will tip upwards, and you won't be able to stay afloat. You can practice this by trying to balance on a bed, bench, or chair.

, Try to keep your body as straight as possible, with the back of your head between your shoulder blades. Move arms to your side and wave your hands, palms down, away from the hips. This will help you stay afloat and move around.


Back floating is one of the easiest ways to learn how to float.
If you are having trouble with this, get someone who is experienced in swimming to help you get into position.

, Face down to exhale, then turn over onto your chest and stomach. This is the body position for most swimming styles, including freestyle and breaststroke.

, You can do this in the water, or on a bench/chair. Move your arm behind your head, over your head, and out in front of you in a circular motion.

, Hold onto the side of the pool, a pool noodle, or a kickboard, and gently kick your legs in a soft, flutter-like motion. Try to keep your toes pointed, and your legs as straight as possible. Don't kick from your knees or kick too hard, as this will create too much drag and slow you down.This is the basic kick for swimming, be it on the back or face down.
Your kicks should be low effort. Harder kicks won't necessarily make you go faster.
You can also practice your kicks while balancing upon a bench.

, Go for 5 to 10 yards (4.6 to 9.1 m) while dipping face in the water to exhale. Do a few laps like this until you get comfortable. You can go the first length keeping your face out of the water, but try to work your way up to where you can swim with your face under the water. This way, you will be able to practice breathing. You may also find it easier to swim!Start practicing in shallower waters until you feel comfortable, then you can move on to deeper waters.
Once you feel confident, try it without the kickboard, and add the arm movements.

, It is a great form of exercise to use after you learn to swim. This can be done while treading with the belt on.


You can also wear swimming fins while practicing your kicks. Don't wear them all the time, however, especially for warm-up and warm-down exercises., Learning how to swim is not a competition; save that for when you are more experienced. Don't force yourself to move into deeper waters if you don't feel comfortable at your current depth. If you feel tired, take a break, and get out of the deep end.


Everyone started with the basics, so don't feel discouraged by the experienced swimmers around you. They will not think less of you or make fun of you. After all, they were in your position at one point too.

Shower before you go swimming.,
Put on moisturizer.,
Use a pre-swim lotion to protect your skin.,
Put on waterproof sunscreen for sun protection.",How to Protect Your Skin While Swimming1," Start by rinsing your body with water in the shower. This will ensure you skin is free of bacteria, oil, and dead skin before you get in the pool or the ocean. Wetting your skin and hair can also prevent your skin from absorbing more of the chemicals or salt in the water.If you are swimming at a pool, there are often showers on site that you can use before you get into the pool.;
, Use a thick moisturizer that contains squalene and zinc. These ingredients will help to protect your skin from chemicals and substances in the water.You can find moisturizer with squalene and zinc online or at your local drugstore.

, There are specially formulated lotions made to protect your skin from chemicals like chlorine. Apply the pre-swim lotion after you have put on moisturizer. You can find pre-swim lotions online or at your local drugstore.Keep in mind that while pre-swim lotions can minimize chlorine damage, they can create carcinogenic by-products and weaken the effects of sunscreen.

, Protect your skin from the sun by applying sunscreen that is waterproof after you have applied moisturizer. Use sunscreen in a strong SPF if you are swimming outside in direct sunlight and your skin is sensitive to the sun. It is also a good idea if you are swimming in the ocean to protect your skin from the sun.Always reapply sunscreen every time you get out of the water to ensure your skin is protected from the sun.

Don't false start.,
Don't go past the 15 metre mark underwater.,
Do the right stroke.,
Touch the wall on your turn.,
Don't touch the floor.,
Use one hand to finish.,
Stay in your allocated lane.,
Do the correct amount of lengths.,
Only wear one swimming costume.",How to Not Get Disqualified when Swimming Freestyle," It is better to be the last to leave the blocks, and not get disqualified than to be first off the blocks and have the embarrassment of getting out of the water either halfway through your event, or at the finish. If you do a false start, you are automatically disqualified in most competitions, unless the official says otherwise.;
, In any event you cannot pass this marker underwater, you have to have surfaced before this. In a 50 metre pool, this seems closer to you, so always watch where you are.

, In freestyle, you can do any stroke you like, but most people do front crawl strokes as it can be faster. Work on your freestyle technique before the race to get the most out of your pull, and to maximise your lead with your kick.

, If you fail to touch the wall during a flipturn then you will be disqualified. Sometimes, if you are lucky, the official won't notice and you will get away with it, but this isn't usually the case. You might want to work on your turns before your race, just make sure you are close enough to the wall to push off, but far away enough to give you space to flip over and so you don't hit your head.

, If you need to stop for any reason during the race, tread water. Don't touch the lane rope either, for this will also get you disqualified.

, On freestyle and backstroke, you touch with one hand. On fly and breast stroke, you finish with two hands. If you finish with two hands on freestyle then you will be DQ'ed.

, If you accidentally swim under the lane rope during your race, you will be disqualified, and you may disturb the other swimmer.

, 50 metres is equivalent to 2 lengths in a short course pool, and one length in a long course pool. Remember to count your laps as you swim.

, Whether this be a regular training suit or a knee skin, it is up to you, although it is said that a knee skin makes you faster and more streamlined and they also make you look the part!

Shower right after you’re done swimming.,
Use mild shower gel.,
Keep your skin soft by applying moisturizer.",How to Protect Your Skin While Swimming2," Head to the shower as soon as you get out of the water. Showering right away will help to remove any chlorine or salt on your skin before it has a chance to dry it out.If you tend to get in and out of the water while you swim, try to shower between swims. This will help to reduce the amount of time the pool or ocean water stays on your skin.

, Apply a mild shower gel to your skin when you shower. Be sure to wash your entire body, including your feet and toes. Use a clean washcloth to gently rub your body with the shower gel to remove the pool or ocean water.You should also wash your hair during the shower, as the chemicals in pool water can damage your hair if they stay on your scalp for too long.
Salt water can also be harsh on your hair so you should shower using mild shower gel after you swim in the ocean.

, Put a moisturizing cream or lotion on your skin right after the shower. This will help to lock in the moisture and ensure your skin does not become too dry. Put the lotion on your entire body, including between your toes and behind your ears."

Swim in an outdoor pool or in freshwater.,
Do not stay in the water too long.,
Follow a regular pre and post swim routine.",How to Protect Your Skin While Swimming3," Outdoor pools allow for the chemicals in the water to escape into the air, leaving less of them that can damage your skin. Freshwater pools are also a good option as they do not contain salt or other substances that can damage your skin.If you are going to swim indoors, go for a pool that has good ventilation and low chlorine content.

, The longer you spend in the water, the more damage you are doing to your skin. Over time, your skin will start to prune and feel dry due to the chemicals in the pool. Take breaks out of the water and try not to stay in the water for longer than two to three hours at a time., Make sure you shower, moisturize, and put on sunscreen before you hop into the pool or the ocean. Then, always shower right away and moisturize again when you get out of the water. Having a regular pre and post swim routine will ensure your skin stays protected while you swim."

Avoid chlorinated water.,
Avoid salt water.,
Remove contact lenses before swimming.,
Have a soothing saline solution handy.,
Squint, rather than opening your eyes completely.,
Enter the water with your eyes closed.,
Try squinting at first.,
Slowly open your eyes wider.,
Close your eyes as soon as they start to sting.,
If you're having trouble, test your skills in a controlled environment.",How to Open Your Eyes Underwater Without Goggles on and Not Hurt," While you may not always be able to choose where you're going to swim, it is helpful to know which kinds of water cause the most eye pain. For example, chlorinated water (like you will usually find in pools, hot tubs, and so on) tends to hurt more than ordinary water when it gets in your eyes. While it's great for killing waterborne germs, the redness and stinging you can get after a dip in the pool can be seriously annoying.


Chlorine hurts more because it disrupts the eye's natural tear membrane. In some cases, chlorine can also dehydrate the cornea, leading to cloudy, distorted vision for a short time.;
, Another common source of eye irritation while swimming is salt water. Salt naturally draws moisture out of the eyes, dehydrating them and causing a stinging sensation. In addition, the sorts of places where you're likely to swim in salt water (like beaches) can have additional contaminants in the water like biological matter, silt, and pollution.


The eyes are naturally covered with a salty fluid (you are probably aware of this if you've ever tasted your own tears). However, the average salt content of the ocean is usually about three to four times more salty, leading to the imbalance that dehydrates your eyes., Most optometrists (eye doctors) recommend against swimming with your contacts in. Depending on which type of contacts you are wearing, the water can cause the contact to deform and press against the eye, causing pain. Contacts can also trap bacteria and microorganisms from the water against the eye, which (in rare cases) can lead to infections that cause serious vision problems.If you must wear contacts underwater, use single-use disposable contacts and discard them after you swim. This way, you won't need to carefully disinfect them., Saline solutions contain a mix of salt and water that is specially formulated to match your eyes' natural salt levels. Applying a few drops after swimming without goggles is a great way to flush contaminants out of your eyes, soothe stinging, and reduce the risk of infection. You can usually find bottles of saline solution at pharmacies and grocery stores for fairly cheap.In a pinch, you can also splash your eyes with cool, clean fresh water like you'd get from a bottle or the tap.

, The less you expose your eyes to water, the less you'll irritate them. If opening your eyes all the way is too painful, you may be able to get some underwater vision by simply squinting. You won't be able to see as much, but you will still probably be able to make out vague shapes and outlines, which is better than nothing.

, Like any difficult skill, the best way to learn how to open your eyes underwater without pain is through practice. Start by jumping into your preferred body of water. As noted above, clean fresh water is best — chlorine and salt water hurt more. Keep your eyes closed as you enter the water to prevent water from splashing into them.


If you're wearing contacts, don't forget to take them off before you get in the water.

, Once you're underwater, open your eyes ever-so-slightly. Crack your eyelids open just a little bit until you can see the vague outlines of your surroundings. Maintain this for a second or two. If it's not too uncomfortable, proceed to the next step.


If squinting is too painful, you may be swimming in eye-irritating water (or may just naturally have sensitive eyes). Try the ""controlled environment"" step at the end of this section.

, Now, gradually open your eyelids to their natural ""open"" position. It may be hard to get yourself to do this — it often feels ""wrong,"" like swallowing a pill without water or looking over a high ledge if you're afraid of heights. If you're nervous, go extra-slow to keep your anxiety manageable.


Some people find it easier to open their eyes underwater if they look upward. Try experimenting with pointing your eyes in different directions to find a position that feels best for you.

, If you've ever held your eyes open out of water (like for a staring contest), you probably know that they start to sting after a while even without anything irritating them besides the air. When you're underwater, your eyes will start to sting much more quickly and you'll need to hold them closed for longer than normal to get the stinging to go away. As soon as you feel the first twinges of pain, shut your eyes and hold them closed for a second or two. Your eyelids will re-coat your eyes with a protective layer of tears, reducing the pain.


When the stinging goes away, gradually open your eyes again. Repeat this pattern as you swim underwater to keep the pain under control.

, Everyone's eyes are different. Some people will find it easy to open their eyes underwater, while others may struggle. If you can't seem to get your eyes open, try this gentle practice method until you're more comfortable:


Fill a bowl or sink with clean, clear, warm (not hot) water from the tap.
Lower your face into the water with your eyes closed. It should feel nice. If it's too hot or cold, adjust the temperature.
With your face in the water, gradually open your eyes, squinting at first and then opening them fully. Close your eyes again as soon as they start to sting.
Repeat a few times until you can open your eyes confidently before testing your skills in the pool, at the beach, etc.

Rinse your eyes with cool water.,
Use a saline solution to restore moisture to your eyes.,
Try a few drops of milk.,
Try a baking soda eye wash.,
Use a cool compress.,
Apply wet teabags.,
Try cucumber slices.,
Use grated potato.,
Make an aloe compress.,
Wear goggles when you swim.,
Avoid swimming in pools that aren't ""healthy"".,
Be careful swimming in lakes and rivers, too.",How to Make Your Eyes Stop Hurting after Swimming," After swimming, residue from the water may remain in your eyes, and rinsing them with cool water will wash away traces of chloramines or other substances that may be causing irritation. Hold your face over a sink and slowly pour water from a cup into one eye, then the other. Dry your eyes with a soft towel when you're finished.


While flushing your eyes probably won't provide immediate relief, it's an important first step, since your eyes will stay irritated as long as they have residue in them.
Cool water may help the inflammation go down, but warm water is also fine to use if you prefer it.;
, If your eyes are feeling dry and scratchy after swimming a saline solution can help to soothe them. Saline is essentially synthetic tears, and it helps add moisture to make your eyes feel better right away. Look for standard saline eye drops at the drugstore. After you get out of the pool, use a few drops according to instructions., This method for relieving sore eyes is not scientifically proven to work, but swimmers in the know rely on it to soothe their eyes after a long day in the pool. Use a dropper or a spoon to drip a few drops of milk into your eyes. Blink a few times and wipe the excess milk away. Milk is basic and supposedly has the effect of neutralizing the pool chemicals, helping the pain go away.


Use this method at your own risk. No scientific studies have been conducted to show whether this works or what potential side effects it may have.

If you experience further irritation after using milk, rinse your eyes with water to remove it.

, This is a home remedy thought to help soothe irritated eyes. Like the milk remedy, it is not scientifically verified. If you want to try this method, mix 1/4 teaspoon baking soda with 1/2 cup water. Dip a cotton ball in the mixture and squeeze it over your eyes to bathe them. Blink a few times so your eyes get coated. If the irritation increases or doesn't go away within a few minutes, rinse your eyes with fresh water., A cool compress will help to bring down any swelling and reduce irritation. Just wet a washcloth with cool water and drape it over your closed eyelids for a few minutes. The sting will naturally start to lessen. If the washcloth gets warm before your eyes feel better, wet it again with cool water and repeat.

, Tea has anti-inflammatory properties that help to reduce swelling and irritation. Soak two teabags with cool water, lie back and close your eyes, and place the teabags over your eyelids. Keep the bags there until they come to room temperature. If your eyes still feel sore, wet them in cold water again and repeat.

, Refrigerate a cucumber, then cut off two thick slices. Lie down and close your eyes, then place the slices over your eyelids. The cool cucumber will soothe your eye irritation and help restore moisture to your irritated skin.

, Potato is astringent, which means it can help sooth irritation and bring down inflammation. Grate a white potato and apply it to your closed eyes. Let the potato sit on your eyes for about five minutes, then rinse it away with cool water.

, Aloe is used to treat all kinds of inflammation, and it makes a soothing compress for the eyes. Mix a teaspoon of aloe vera gel and a teaspoon of cold water. Saturate two cotton balls with the mixture. Lie down and close your eyes, then place the cotton balls over your eyes. After five or ten minutes, remove the cotton balls and rinse your eyes.

, This is the best preventative method you can take when it comes to irritation caused by chloramines or ocean water. If you never let the water hit your eyes, you won't experience redness and sore eyes every time you swim. Using goggles allows you to swim to your heart's content and open your eyes underwater without dealing with pain later.


Make sure you use goggles that fit well. They should fit snugly around your eyes so that water doesn't seep in while you're swimming.
If you can't stand goggles, try to keep your eyes closed as much as possible while you're underwater.

, Have you every been to a pool with a strong chemical smell? Many people mistakenly think that's the smell of chlorine, but chlorine doesn't have a smell. That strong ammonia smell is actually the smell of chloramines, which form when chlorine binds with sweat, sunscreen, urine, saliva, and other substances swimmers bring into the water. A pool with a strong smell is one that hasn't been properly treated with chlorine and other chemicals to remove all of the chloramines. Look for these signs that a pool isn't very clean:


The pool has a strong chemical smell (or any other type of smell)
The water looks cloudy instead of clear
You don't hear any cleaning equipment, such as pumps and filters, operating in the pool
The pool feels slippery or sticky instead of clean

, Lakes and rivers don't require chemical treatment to make them safe for swimming. They should have natural ways of keeping harmful bacteria at bay. However some lakes and rivers are part of ecosystems that have been disrupted, and they may contain bacteria that irritates your eyes.


Only swim in natural bodies of water that have been deemed safe for swimming; avoid areas that have a ""no swimming"" policy.
Avoid swimming in lakes or rivers that are contaminated with pollution.
Avoid swimming in lakes or ponds that seem stagnant. Don't swim in water that's full of algae or green in color.

Get used to the water.,
Grab onto a wall and kick your feet.,
Once you can feel your kicking pushing you toward the wall, you can try floating on your own.,
The kick follows the same monkey-airplane-soldier pattern, and both the pull and kick are done concurrently.,
Practice.",How to Swim Monkey Airplane Soldier," Go into very shallow water, and just get a feel for it. Splash a little, put your head under the water, blow bubbles, whatever. ""Scull"", or move your hands around in a way that they can feel resistance.;
, This can be tricky at first; it is very important to kick rather quickly (about 2 kicks/second) and your kicks don't need to be big. Point your toes, but don't lock your ankle joints. Concentrate on making your kicks as small and splashy as possible. This kick is only to get you comfortable in the water, although you may use if with the pull if it is more comfortable for you than the kick explained later.

, Lay on your back on the water, and kick. Now curl your arms up (monkey), straighten them out to either side (like airplane), and pull them down to your sides (soldier). The movement from airplane to soldier should propel you backward.

, Starting from the same back float position, drop your heels below you and flex your feet (monkey), keeping your knees in roughly the same position. Next, whip your feet around to either side and out straight, like a big V (airplane). Finish with your straight legs squeezing together, and pointed toes (soldier). You should feel the water pushing on the bottom of your foot as you kick.

, It is a lot easier to learn to swim if you get lessons too, so if possible learn to swim that way. Talk to a swim instructor (Water Safety Instructor) or swim coach at your local pool.

,, This will make turning easier.

, However, do not take a breath just before the turn as it will interrupt your stroke and slow you down.

, This can be hard to judge as it all depends on the length of your legs. Normally, there will be what looks like a T on the bottom of the pool. Depending on how long your legs are, normally you should do 2 strokes after the T then do your turn.

, As your arm enters the water, tuck your head in and keep kicking your legs to propel you over. As you tumble, breath out hard through your nose to prevent any water getting up it.

, The fastest way to get off the wall is to push off on your back underwater, rather then turning onto your front and then pushing off. Place both feet firmly on the wall and push off hard UNDERWATER and turn onto your front before you surface or do any kicking.

Swim towards the wall.,
Extend your arms to reach for the wall.,
Touch the wall with your palms.,
Tuck your legs up and put both feet on the wall, keeping your body curled.,
Bring the hand that is touching the wall back and over your head.,
Straighten both arms and legs.,
Push off from the wall.,
Twist your body so your face and stomach face the floor.,
Glide for 2-3 seconds.,
Begin kicking your legs and moving your arms.,
Swim forward in your chosen style.",How to Do an Open Turn in Swimming," When you’re on your last stroke of the butterfly or breaststroke, move your head to look straight down at the bottom of the pool.


Your last stroke should bring you about half a body length away from the pool wall.
If you are more than half a body length from the wall, give an extra kick in the water to push yourself forward.;
, Keep your arms straight and your elbows locked while reaching.


Your arms should remain about shoulder’s width apart., Keep your palms flat against the wall without grabbing the edge of the pool.


Make sure to keep your hands against the wall. Do not hang onto the lip of the pool; this might cause you cling to the wall and slow you down.
Keep your legs close together and begin to bend them at the knee.

, As you’re doing this, keep one hand on the wall, and bend the other arm into the side of your body.


The leg tuck will force your body back, so your face and torso should now be turned towards the ceiling, and your legs should be bent at the knee.
Bending one arm in at the elbow will cause your body to pivot slightly right or left (depending on which arm you bend). Try to bend the arm in quickly to help your body begin turning faster.
Keeping one arm bent in will help the body get ready to flip over. You can bend either the right arm or the left arm - whatever feels the most natural to you.
Tuck your body as if you’re curling up into a ball. While tucking, keep your knees pointing straight up towards the ceiling. This will help keep you moving in a straight line when you push off., Use a slicing motion when you do this movement.


Neither hand should be touching the wall now.
Bend your elbow as you are slicing through the water, and bring the arm over the crown of your head.
Watch your hand move over your head. Keeping it straight will help you push off straight., As you straighten your arms, bring them tightly around your head and touch your hands together into a streamline position.


Straightening your arms and legs will force you to being pushing away from the wall.
Streamlining your body will help reduce water resistance while you propel yourself forward.

, Use your feet and legs to push your body away from the side of the pool.


Try to push with a little force in order to create some forward momentum in the water.
As you push, your body should naturally start to turn either right or left. This will depend on the arm you bent while tucking your legs initially.

, At this point, your body will be moving in a straight line away from the side of the pool.


Twist onto your stomach quickly. This should be fairly simple with the forward momentum and turning motion you achieved while pushing off from the wall.

, Use the momentum from your push-off to shoot straight forward in the water.


Keep your arms straight and don’t kick or do any strokes yet. Just let yourself glide forward.

, The way you move will depend on the type of stroke you are doing.


If you are doing a butterfly stroke, do about 4 dolphin kicks.
If you are doing a breaststroke, start your pullout.

, Do the butterfly or breaststroke back across the pool. Repeat the open turn when you reach the other end."

Get your newborn used to bath time.,
Do not get a swimming teacher for the newborn.,

",How to Teach Your AJ Newborn to Swim," Put some fairly warm water in a tub and add some reassuring things inside the bath, such as bubbles and rubber duckies. Slowly lure your pup into the bath and with a soft sponge or cloth, rub gently on its ears, head, nose, stomach, back and bottom. Make sure the pup is making signals it is enjoying the bath, such as cute happy squeaks or playing with the bubbles and rubber duckies. Once you rinse off the pup, wrap it in its favourite blankie or towel and let it sleep in its crib.;
, The baby will feel uncomfortable with a stranger putting them in the water and will scream, cry and develop a lifetime fear of water. Instead, put some sunblock on the baby's nose, ears, back and tummy. Then put it in a comfy warm basket with some beach toys and take it to Crystal Sands.

, Take the newborn out of the basket and apply more sunblock. Then, put it in the soft sand let it play with beach toys. Then move beach toys and baby into damp sand until it gets used to water temp.

, Make sure it feels the water. If it cries, comfort it by rocking it or gently stroking its stomach/ears. Once it stops, continue the method until it feels comfortable in the water. Then take it out and re-apply sunblock. (This is essential because the baby may become sunburnt and it will be very painful)

, Then spread out your arms and call it enthusiastic until it jumps for you. Catch the newborn, then let it go. It will paddle with its tiny paws, and the floaties will stop it from sinking. If it starts to cry, cuddle it until it feels better.

, Make it paddle with its tiny paws to you, until it reaches you.

First is opening your eyes underwater.,
So the first step is a small science lesson!,
Anyhow, time for Practice!,
When you've become comfortable opening your eyes in the tub, try moving your head.,
Keep moving on to new levels.,
If you live by the ocean, this will be harder to get used to.,
Next is holding your breath!,
For the first lesson, try breathing deeply.,
Next, take five seconds to inhale, pause for five seconds, then exhale for five seconds, pause for five seconds, and repeat.,
This is the practice that I do daily.",How to Learn Basic Underwater Skills," Remember that every skill takes time. You can't learn a new instrument or sport in one afternoon, so don't expect to learn how to keep your eyes open in one afternoon! It takes time to accustom to the feeling of water on your eyes.;
, The outside of your eye is protected by a thin film called the cornea. It is very tough and keep dirt, bacteria, etc. from getting to the more sensitive parts, like the pupil and the lens. Trust me, I've dissected a sheep eye in science class, just take my word on it..., (: Who doesn't love practice? It may not make you perfect, but it will make you a whole lot better! The first steps are to take on fresh water. Try filling out your bathroom sink first. (You may want to rinse it out to make sure no toothpaste or cleaning products are in it. That could really be hard to adjust to...) Next, take a deep breath and relax. Jitters won't help. Close your eyes and stick your head under. When you feel ready, open them and stare at a point in the sink. Focus and relax, blink a couple times then stare at a new point to get used to the feeling. You can also try this with a tub or bucket of water from a hose.

, The fact is when you're swimming, hair is going to be getting in your face. Get used to it getting in your eyes. Move your head and feel the water on your eyes and your hair (if it is long enough.) The feeling is much different than if you're still.

, Try it in a lake. Focus on a rock, seashell, etc. then continue the steps mentioned above. Pretty soon you'll be so used to the feeling you'll be able to swim like that and amaze your friends! :^)

, Remember the ocean is briny, it's salt water! Salt in your eyes will not feel good, but its also water. Do the steps mentioned above in a calm part of the surf. You could swim out to where it's over your head or could bend over from the waist like you're bending over the sink. I would also recommend to do the sink first, then hit the waves. (:

, This is actually a bit harder than opening your eyes. It's mental and physical control. You're expanding your lungs, holding air, and meditating your mind to calm it into a state that yes, I'm not breathing but I'm not dying. If you stop breathing, your body automatically goes into distress mode. Plus, you're muscles and blood needs oxygen. Learning to control your physical and mental needs takes a lot of practice.

, Control your heart rate, and breathe from your stomach/diaphragm. What this means is your whole torso should expand, not just your chest. You'll feel that you breathe deeper and once you get used to breathing that way, trying to breathe ""normally"" will feel shallow. Learning deep stomach breathing may make you feel dizzy at first.

, Don't try counting in your head. Focus entirely on your breathing, keeping it even, under control, and at a moderate pace. Don't puff out your cheeks. You're letting that air escape your lungs and and pushing with your stomach. Hold it in your throat when pausing.

Hold onto a pool wall or lane marker.,

Repeat with the opposite leg.,
Continue alternating legs to kick.,
Try a kickboard.,
Push off from a pool wall.,
Try adding arm strokes at the same time.,
Try a freestyle stroke.,
Try a backstroke.,
Do a dog paddle.",How to Flutter Kick," Grasp a wall of the pool, a lane marker, or another stationary object that allows you to extend your body in the water behind it. Hold your arms out straight from the wall, with the rest of your body as horizontal as possible in the water.


Ideally, have your face submerged in the water so that your head is in the same line as your body. Obtain a snorkeling mask to make it easier to maintain this position without having to bring your face up for air.
You can have your head out of the water to breathe, but it may be more difficult to remain horizontal and stable in the water this way.;
, Flex the hip of one leg slightly to push the leg down, and continue the motion down the leg by slightly bending the knee and powerfully pushing down with the top of the foot.









Make sure your toes are pointed and turned slightly inward. Imagine that the widest part of the top of your foot is as parallel as possible to the pool floor.
Avoid bending your knee too much as you kick the leg down, as if you were pedaling a bike rather than kicking. Keep the leg mostly straight; the power driven by the hip will naturally move the knee slightly., Let the first leg float up in the water while you repeat the same kick with the opposite leg, remembering to drive the downward motion from the hip and push with a pointed toe.









Make sure that while you’re alternating kicking legs, neither foot breaks the surface of the water. Your feet should also not be moving too far below the line of your body., Keep kicking one leg down while the other floats up, and increasing the speed until you are alternating quickly.









Observe how the force of the kick propels your hips and legs upward. You can adjust the strength of the kick to the point where your whole body is floating in an even, horizontal line in the water.If you have trouble with your legs sinking down too low, try pushing your chest slightly further down in the water. If your legs are rising up too much, do the opposite, or kick at a lower strength and speed.See if you can maintain the kick and your balanced, horizontal position in the water while barely holding onto or relying on the wall or lane marker anymore for support. This will prepare you to start moving in the water with the kick.

, Obtain a kickboard for the pool and use it to support your hands out in front of you. Assume the same horizontal position with your body in the water, then perform the flutter kick as you did holding onto the wall.


Notice how the kick feels as it works to propel you forward in the water as well as hold you up. Adjust the strength and speed of your kick accordingly.
You can hold your head out of the water so you don’t have to pause to breathe, but you may not find the right horizontal balance as you will when you submerge your face into the water and come up for breath when you need it.

, Push yourself off of a pool wall using your legs, and straighten your body out horizontally underwater. Glide through the water until you feel you are losing momentum, then begin to do the flutter kick.








Try to make your body as streamlined as possible when you glide away from the wall. Place arms in a torpedo position out in front of you, one hand on top of the other, and point your toes.
If you like, you can just push off from the wall and glide a few times without kicking at all to get a feel for the right streamlined position of your body through the water. When you add on the kick, it should only be to maintain this same streamlined, balanced position., Move your arms in sync with the flutter kick for a simple freestyle stroke. Your right arm comes out of the water and above your head to reenter the water in front of you at the same time as your left leg kicks down. Repeat on the opposite side.


Try a 2-beat kick by kicking twice (once with each leg) for each cycle (one stroke on each arm). This timing is often used by long-distance swimmers and triathletes.
Do a 4-beat kick by kicking four times (twice per leg) for each cycle (one stroke on each arm). This timing is often considered the most natural speed, and can be used by short-, middle-, and long-distance swimmers.
Try the 6-beat kick by kicking six times (three times per leg) for each cycle (one stroke on each arm). This speed is considered traditional for the flutter kick, and is used by short-distance and other swimmers., Do a freestyle stroke, also called a front crawl, by using the flutter kick simultaneously with a windmill motion of the arms. Each arm comes up out of the water to come down and “scoop” the water in front of you, propelling you forward.








Reach your arm as far as possible ahead of you on each stroke, and remember to maintain the same balanced horizontal body position to complete your flutter kick. You’ll notice that the kick helps stabilize you in the water to support the movement of your arms.

, Execute a backstroke by positioning yourself face-up in the water and finding a balanced horizontal position in the water. Alternate rotating your arms in the same way as a freestyle stroke.









You’ll notice a slightly different feeling and movement of your legs when you do the flutter kick on your back, as your legs are now pushing up on the water instead of down. However, the movement is the same: drive the motion from your hips, point your toes, and don’t bend your knees too much., Though it’s not an official swim stroke, try the dog paddle as an intuitive way to stay afloat and swim short distances. Use the flutter kick while your head is above water and your arms make small circular motions under the water to propel you up and forward.


Note that this stroke is not ideal for swimming a significant distance, as you are not in a horizontal position and the arms and legs thus have to work harder to keep you afloat.

, This is a similar exercise to the one above, except laid down and more demanding. You can try doing it with a dumbbell or a barbell. It also uses the chest, which will help you in swimming, especially the butterfly and freestyle stroke.

, This part of the shoulder is used enormously in swimming but we are naturally created with that part of the muscle being weak. Click here to know how to isolate it.

, Start this exercise with lighter weight and progress slowly. You should hold the barbell in the air with your arms extended forward when you bring it up for at least 5 seconds to gain that muscular endurance.

, This will target your upper chest and front deltoids which are also activated heavily in all the strokes.

, This will target your obliques, which are quite weak in most humans today and this way you will avoid getting love handles.

, Not only is this a back extension but it requires more core stability because it is on a ball. Do not underestimate this exercise! If it is easy for you, then extend your arms straight forward or even hold weight in your hands.

, This exercise will help you get that explosive power when you are pushing yourself off the Starting Block and the Walls. It uses your whole body, especially your core.

, Why not back squats? Because the front squats require a lot of strength in the back, which a lot of people fail to have. The front squats also heavily activate the abs while the back squats don't.

, In the end, swimming is a body-weight sport so learning how to work your body aside with weights is essential. To get a stronger, faster and leaner body you should learn how to do the muscle up, pull overs, front and back levers, L-seats etc.

Begin by standing upright, feet hip-distance apart.
Close your eyes, and focus only on your breath.
It can be useful to engage the back of your throat when you exhale (produces a throaty sound).
Take about ten breath cycles.;
, If you really want to master the Dolphin Kick, you can't afford to neglect your core. While it might seem as if all of the generated power comes from the quads and legs in general, your core is a crucial part of it. After all, your legs are connected to your core and work with it while swimming. Consider the following exercise-sequence :


Start by standing upright with your feet hip-distance apart.
Roll your shoulders back a couple of times.
Draw your upper ribs in.
Make sure your tailbone is pointing straight down.

, Now that you've awakened your breath and core, try performing the rolling movement while standing. It's just as it sounds: picture a wave passing through your body, and mimic it.

, Having someone else watch you while you practice can help you define your strengths and weaknesses. Do you know anyone who swims regularly? They might be an even better choice as they'll have a solid idea of what the body should look like while performing certain motions.

, To warm up in the water, start by swimming in the pool as you regularly would. Get used to not being on land, and moving in the water.

, At first, stand upright in the pool and perform the same body roll motion you did when you were on land.

, Here are some techniques on how to do so:









Lie flat on your stomach, head in line with the body. Keep your face looking down.
Keep your legs and feet together, and the toes pointing in the direction of the pool end.
Press your chest down, and then release it.
Press your hips down at the same time, and then release them.
When you release your hips, press the chest down. Start sequence over.

, Your legs should follow the movements of your hips for proper Dolphin Kick techniques.









The legs should go down when your hips do. Knees should be slightly bent during this motion.
The legs should follow your hips when they go up. The knees extend at this point.
Add some power and execute the kick.

, If you're having difficulties with your Dolphin Kick techniques, try flipping over onto your back. Dolphin Kicks tend to be easier when you try them on your back. This allows you to keep a tight core while maintaining movement in your body.








, It's good to keep the wave-like nature of the move in mind. Try to always execute Dolphin Kick related motions in an undulating fashion.

, Your thighs should follow your hips in their downward movement. Keep your legs slightly bent at the knees.








, As your hips move up you should straighten your legs, and perform a whipping movement.








, When your hips go up, allow your upper legs to follow the upward movement. Then start the cycle over.

, Frequently, people are quite rigid when they execute their Dolphin Kicks. Try to avoid jerky movements with a break at the end of the downward kick.









Once you're finished with the downward movement of your feet, start moving them upward again.
Remember that the kicks should be flowing and smooth. you should ideally feel fluid from your hips to your toes.

Swim your usual backstroke.,
Go back out past the flags, and start swimming backstroke towards the wall.,
Continue to do a freestyle stroke and go directly into a turn as if you were doing freestyle.

,
When you come out of the turn, do not roll over as you do when doing freestyle, stay on your back, if you roll too much, you will get disqualified.,
Follow the steps above to count your strokes, then swim into the wall at a normal pace.
,
When you reach the second to last stroke before you reach the wall, throw your arm backward and arch your back, flicking your abs and legs behind you if you need an extra push.,
When your hand touches the wall, try to get your whole palm touching for as much traction as possible and pull your arm up to swing the rest of your body around.",How to Do a Flip Turn (Backstroke)," This part is crucial as you will be counting strokes. Since you are on your back, you will not be able to see if you are near the wall or not. If there are not flags hanging above your head, turn your head to a lane line and look for the last color block, that is were the flags would be. Swim backstroke from a few yards past the flags to pick up speed, and count your strokes as soon as your eyes pass the flags. This is how many strokes to a finish, subtract one for strokes for a turn.

, Count your strokes from the flag until you get to the number you found in part one for turns. Then using your hand that is out of the water cross it in front of your body to roll over as if you were doing freestyle.

,, Then continue swimming as normal.

,, This motion should look like an exaggerated butterfly kick performed on your back., Your feet should hit the wall quickly and you will have a great deal of momentum with which to push off."
"
Exercise your ankles.,
Balance your kick.,
Kick backwards.,
Kick with purpose.",How to Get Faster at Swimming Freestyle1," By working your ankles out, you’ll build ankle strength and flexibility. Increased strength and flexibility will help you start faster and turn quicker. To accomplish this, commit to exercises like:


Skipping rope
Standing on one leg
Squats
Ankle rockers. Do this by sitting on the back of your ankles, leaning back, and lifting your knees upward. Try to hold this for about a minute or two. Do several repetitions.
Ankle rotations. Simply rotate your ankles around in circles 15 to 20 times.;
, A balanced kick will help you move through the water in a much more consistent fashion. To improve your kick, commit to a vertical kicking training routine. To do this, stand in a moderately deep part of the pool and work on your swimming kick while standing up. To further improve the balance of your kick:


Use a weight belt or drag sox.
Try kicking with swim fins., One of the biggest problems people have is that they kick downward rather than backward. Instead of this, move your legs (as a whole) backwards -- as if you are pushing back -- instead of kicking downward.Think of your legs as one large fin moving back and forth in the water.

, Concentrate and make sure that your kicks are deliberate. Make sure you are focused on how your body and legs are moving together. If you’re unfocused, you may kick, but you won’t kick with purpose and in an effective manner. In the end, you may wind up zig-zagging or slowing yourself down."
"
Point your head forward.,
Hold your hands flat.,
Catch the water with your hands.,
Avoid rotating your shoulders too much.,
Swim straight.",How to Get Faster at Swimming Freestyle2," Your head should be pointed forward just slightly. Make sure to avoid straining your neck. If your head is turned to the side slightly or you move it around, you’ll wind up slowing yourself down.


Your neck should not be buried in your shoulders.
Avoid tucking your chin down., Your hands should be held flat at shoulder width. Your pinkies and thumbs should be parallel with your other fingers. This should give you a lot more power as you move through the water., Your fingertips should point down toward the bottom of the pool as you paddle through the water. If they’re not, you’ll lose energy and won’t be able to move as fast as you could otherwise., By rotating your shoulders, you’ll wind up making your hips turn. This will ultimately slow you down and make you lose power and momentum. Instead, focus on moving your arms as if you are paddling on a surfboard., Try to follow the line on the bottom of the pool as best as you can. If there is no line, make sure you stay straight in your swimming lane. In addition, make sure your arms don’t cross over the middle of your body when you are completing your strokes.


Your right or left hand should never go near the opposite side of the body."
"
Breathe regularly.,
Take a break after your arms enter the water.,
Allow your release and recovery to be natural.",How to Get Faster at Swimming Freestyle3," Take moderate-sized breaths as your head turns to the side. Then, slowly exhale as your head moves underwater. Do not:


Breathe too deeply. Ultimately, moderate sized, regular breaths are more important than deep breaths.
Hold your breath., Once your arms have entered the water, take a slight pause. This way, you’ll let the momentum of your stroke move you. You’ll also be able to recharge a little bit before continuing with the next stroke.


The pause you should take will be very short, perhaps about a second or so., Don’t force your release and recovery after your power phase. Let it all happen naturally – your arm should naturally move into recovery as your hand moves close to your hip.


The angle of your elbow doesn’t really matter during release and recovery."
"
Create a routine.,
Increase the number of yards you swim per week.,
Do some closed-fist swimming.,
Try underwater freestyle.,
Swim with your head up.,
Drag your hand during the recovery phase of normal freestyle.,
Use dolphin kicks.",How to Get Faster at Swimming Freestyle4," While it’s probably impossible for you to spend every day in the pool, you can create a regular routine that will provide you with the experience needed to swim faster. Set a goal of swimming for one hour per day, at least three days a week.


Set time aside before or after work or school.
Spend part of a weekend day swimming., One of the most important factors in swimming faster is pushing yourself to beat your old records. As a result, you should constantly push yourself to improve the number of yards you swim for any given amount of time.


If you swim 1500 yards an hour, challenge yourself to eventually move up to 3000 yards an hour. While this may seem like a big increase, you’ll be able to do it over time.
Use a timer to challenge yourself to go further in a certain mount of time., Instead holding your hand out flat or cupped as you swim, make a fist. This will lessen the momentum you make with your hands, and force your arms to work harder. This will help train you to use your forearms more than you normally do., Swim underwater just as you would above water. This will get you used to having much more resistance as you swim. As a result, when you return to above water freestyle, you’ll be able to swim faster.


Mix up your normal routine by swimming underwater for some laps., Instead of tilting your head underwater as you swim, keep it above water the entire time. This requires you to kick harder and faster to move straight and quick. After doing it for a while, you’ll find you have better control of your body.Try this for a few of your laps when you practice swimming.

, Move your hand out to create some resistance in the water after you've made your big stroke. After doing this for a while, you’ll feel much more power when you swim normally.


Try dragging your hand periodically when you swim., Dolphin kicks are when you move both of your legs together as if they are the fin of a dolphin. This works because it’ll get you used to a certain rhythm.


Try swimming with dolphin kicks for half an hour at least once a week."
"
Plan a swimming routine.,
Structure your swim sessions to promote fitness.,
Work on your breathing.,
Develop your backstroke.,
Strengthen your breaststroke.,
Isolate a single stroke per exercise.,
Learn how to do a flip turn.",How to Exercise to Become a Better Swimmer1," You don't need to work out everyday, but try commit to at least three days a week. Decide what time works best for you. Some people find it helpful to swim before work, while others benefit more from swimming after work. It just depends on what your schedule is.


It will take your body some time to form the rhythms between your stroke and breathe.While you are first starting, commit yourself to swim at least 10 minutes three to five times a week. Then slowly push on to thirty minutes or more.;
, A 2-hour swim session might look like this:


Warmup - 15 mins, typically 200m IM then 200m each stroke individually, done at strength pace (focusing on applying constant strong pressure on each movement).
Kick or Pull - 15 mins. It's a great way to loosen up muscles and to start to warm up the legs or warm and get into a rhythm.
Hypoxic - 5 mins, usually done before or after the main set, hypoxic describes the holding of breath under duress or exercise. Do sprints while only taking 1 or 2 breaths per length, or butterfly kick underwater to halfway and then butterfly (breathing every 3 strokes) for the rest of the length. Don't do hypoxic training for very long if you expect to be doing a main set afterwards.
Main Set - 35 mins A short amount of lengths done at high intensity on fast times or lower intensity but lots of laps without rest. A good example is 5 x 50m freestyle on 40 seconds with a target of 30.
Warmdown - Very important, warmdown gives swimmers a chance to recover and stretch out their muscles. You should be aiming to have a good DPS (distance per stroke; doing as little strokes per lap, should be doing 12-16 in a 25m pool).

, Focus on both your inhales and your exhales. When you're not breathing, don't move your head. Keeping your head in a fixed position is more efficient. Only tilt your head to breathe.


A lot of swimmers have this problem of not exhaling underwater. Make sure you exhale a bit when submerging back underwater to maintain breathing and prevent your nose from filling up with water.
Never tilt your head upwards when you need to take a breath. Always tilt your head to the side.
In Freestyle, keep one goggle in the water and one goggle out. This helps to make sure that you don't over-turn your head.
Try to breath every three or five strokes, to make sure you breath on both sides of your body.
Don't hold your breath.

, The backstroke can be one the most challenging strokes to accomplish. It requires strong back and shoulder muscles. The key to perform a fluid backstroke lies in your hips. Practice a simple drill of flutter kicks on your back while one arm is raised. Switch arms after a lap and then finish with a lap of normal backstroke.

, The breast stroke relies on the synchronization of your glide and stroke. This fluidity does not happen overnight. Pulling harder or trying to pull more water back can actually be counterproductive.


Make sure to always do a pullout. Pullouts give you a headstart and and are very important for your breaststroke being strong and fast.
Your arms shouldn't actually push water behind you, but instead you should focus on shaping an upside-down-heart with your hands.
Bring your hands together as you extend them forward. Use your elbows, not your arms, to push your hands forward., If you commit a full day to just one type of stroke, you'll sync into the rhythm of that stroke faster. You could even isolate one stroke for an entire week, then switch strokes the following week.

, This is a tricky maneuver that will increase your speed doing laps. Look for the ""big T."" The ""big T"" is the perpendicular line at the end of the lane in a lap pool. As your head crosses the T, tuck your chin into your chest while you are following through with a stroke. Then dolphin kick your legs for a final push.


Don't look up before doing the flip. The wall will always be there as long as you look for the ""big T"" at the bottom of the pool. This maneuver can be a challenge and it is recommend to have someone to show you first-hand how to do this.
To go faster, do a couple of dolphin kicks underwater in streamline position. Try to get past the flags above the pool if you can.

Learn the Front Crawl, sometimes known as freestyle or the front stroke.,
Do the Backstroke.,
Do the Breaststroke.",How to Do Three Basic Strokes while Swimming," The is the most basic stroke of them all, as well as the fastest. It involves your knees touching, kicking your legs, and raising your arms alternately out of the water, over your head, and back in the water again, in a windmill motion. As you lift one arm up, turn your head in that direction and take a breath, and as soon as your arm touches the water again, turn your face downwards again. Your hands should be 180' degrees (a straight line) from each other at all times.;
, Backstroke is pretty much the same as front stroke, apart from your body is the other way round. Instead of lying on your front, you lie on your back, kicking your legs the same way as you do in freestyle, and you raise your arms, which starts by your side, comes back over your head, and into the water. Once again, your hands should be 180' degrees from each other at all times.

, Breaststroke is a popular stroke for people who like, calm, relaxing swimming. this movement involves your feet staying together, bringing your legs up to your bum, and kicking out to the side, repeating this. Your arms start by your chest, push forward together, and separate and move in a circle motion until they meet back by your chest again. When your feet are by your bum, you start the arm movement. If you keep repeating this sequence, you will get into the swing of it. Some people put their face in the water and come up for air every 2/3 strokes, but some people keep their faces out. It is completely your choice as it doesn't affect the speed of the stroke at all.

Do the jump and dig technique.,
Try the stomp and push exercise.,
Practice a scissor press.,
Work on kicking.,

Do the ""fingertip drag"" drill in freestyle.",How to Exercise to Become a Better Swimmer2," One way of improving your swimming is by strengthening your technique. When you incorporate certain drills into your training, you'll benefit by strengthening your muscles and individual components of your stroke.

, Isolate your stroke to just one arm per lap. This will help keep your stroke symmetrical and balanced. Hold on to a kick-board if you are having trouble staying in a straight line. Keep your kick consistent and narrow throughout the drill.

, Keep one arm extended out in front of you while your body tilts onto its side, perpendicular to the water. Focus on maintaining a consistent kick. Your head will stay down in the water except when you rotate it to breathe. Switch arms after each lap.

, Practice your free stroke as you normally would, but keep your head extended out of the water, facing forward. This drill strengthens your kick, neck, and back muscles. Only practice this drill for shorts distances., There are plenty of pool exercises you can preform that don't require you to swim laps. Sometimes your gym or pool facility will have exercising equipment designed for the water like water gloves, paddles, or buoys.

, Position your legs in a wide stance in an upright position. Then bring your knees up to the surface and back to floor. While your knees are at the surface, plunge your hands down and scoop them up to the surface as your legs move back onto the ground., Position your legs in a wide stance and begin pumping them alternatively. Imagine you are doing high knees or squashing grapes. Extend your arms out away from you and bend them towards the bottom. As you are pumping your legs, do the same motion with your arms., Put one leg in front of the other in a plunge position, and keep your knee bent to a 90 degree angle. Hold your arms outwards, at the surface of the water, then bring them into your body.Use a buoy for increased tension.

,


You may use a kickboard that you can purchase or borrow from pool or gym.
Simply hold onto the kickboard and kick any kick you want. There are many different positions for your arms. Find whatever you like better.
You can also put your arms in a streamline and kick on your back.

,


Use a pull buoy that you can buy or borrow from your pool, gym, club, etc.
Put the buoy between you ankles or thighs, which ever you prefer, and pull.
Remember not to kick because it will make the pulling less effective.

, Instead of lifting your hand above the water, the swimmer drags his or her fingertips along the surface.

"

Warm up before you get in the pool.,
Strengthen your kicks.,
Work on your planks.,
Perform weightless exercises.,
Strengthen your core.,
Practice other sports outside the pool.",How to Exercise to Become a Better Swimmer3," If you are getting serious about swimming then you should be warming up outside the pool (no more than 30 mins is necessary) before you go swimming. Do hamstring stretches, prone holds, sprinting, push ups, sit-ups, burpees, and streamline burpees (where you have to do a burpee but end in a tight streamline).

, If you can't make it to the pool you can still improve your strokes and build muscle. Practicing flutter kicks can be a great exercise for your core. Lay on your back and position your hands together underneath your rear. Then elevate your legs lightly and begin kicking your legs alternately. Try doing this for about thirty seconds, rest, and repeat.

, Planks are effective body weight exercises that strengthen your upper and lower body, as well as your shoulders, arms, and glutes. This is a great out of water exercise. Practice these steps to perfect your planks:


Position yourself like you are about to do a push-up. Ground your arms slightly wider than your shoulders length.
Use your toes to hold your feet and squeeze your glutes (your butt), to stabilize your body.
Align your head to be in line with your back. Focus looking down at a single spot on the floor.
Hold this position for about twenty seconds. You want to make sure that your legs aren't holding any of the pressure. Practice this at intervals that are comfortable to you., You don't need to hit the gym every time you need to workout. Set yourself up for a routine of about twenty minutes. Try a few of these in your exercise:


10-15 reps of push-up
20-30 reps of crunches
5-10 reps of pull ups
10-15 reps of goblet squats
Rest for a minute and repeat, Your core is the most important group of muscles that helps you do just about everything.Swimming relies heavily on the strength of your core. Practice a few routines like these:


The bird dog position. Get on your hands and knees, and hold your spine as flat as possible. Then extend your left arm and right leg out away from your body. Do not raise your limbs over your spine, but rather keep them on level with your back. Hold this position for three-four seconds and then switch limbs.
V-Sits. Start in a seated position and raise your legs to a 45 degree angle. Extend your arms out to your knees and hold this position for 10-30 seconds.
Scissor crunches. Lie on your back and extend your legs flat on the ground. Keep your hands down by your side. Raise your right leg straight up towards the ceiling and lift your left leg about three to four inches off the ground. Take your left arm and extend it to meet your right foot up by the ceiling. Hold this pose for about 10-30 seconds and then switch limbs., Keeping up your cardiovascular system when you don't have a chance to hit the pool will help you stay in shape. Soccer is a great sport that will challenge your lungs and muscles. It also takes a good deal of hand eye coordination that parallels to syncing into your breathe and stroke.

Get a swim coach.,
Join a swim group.,
Join a gym with a pool.,
Ask a friend for support.",How to Exercise to Become a Better Swimmer4," Many pools and clubs have programs available for kids, but few accommodate aspiring adults or teens. Seek out someone who has had experience working with adults. Make sure their personality fits with yours. You'll need someone who can listen and provide feedback on your strokes., The U.S. Masters Swim Group is a good program for people over twenty looking for a group to swim with. They vary from complete beginners to more seasoned athletes.


Your local gym or health club might also offer something similar, and could be a better alternative.

, You'll find that many facilities near you have pools. Shop around and find the one that is best fit for your price range that has a decent pool.

, If you are committing yourself to something physically demanding, it might be good for you to have someone who will support you. This person doesn't need to do the exercises with you, but they'll merely act as a support system if you become discouraged.


Having a friend who is willing to commit to a swim routine with you is an extra bonus and a good friend.

Know how to get out of a river current.",How to Swim," A lot of people put off learning how to swim because they're afraid of drowning. While drownings do occur, most of them could have been prevented by simple safety measures. Follow these guidelines whenever you're swimming, and the odds of drowning will decrease dramatically:


Don't swim alone. Always go swimming with one other person who is a strong swimmer, if not several other people. An area with a lifeguard is usually a best place to swim.
Don't start out swimming in moving water. If you're learning to swim in an ocean or river, you'll need to be more aware of the motion of the water. If you must learn to swim this way, try to make sure you're with someone who knows what he or she is doing, and be sure to read the step about getting out of a riptide or a rushing river (below).
Stay within a depth you can handle. When you're first learning how to swim, don't venture into water that's too deep for you to stand in. That way, if something goes amiss, you can simply stand up and breathe.
Avoid swimming during inclement weather conditions. Swimming in a light rain shower should be fine, but if you see or hear a storm approaching, get out of the water immediately. This rule is to be followed regardless of how well you can swim.
Don't swim in water that's too cold. Moving your limbs to paddle can become suddenly difficult if you're in frigid water.;
, When you're in the water, hold on to the side of the pool or a dock, and let your legs float out behind you - they should lift easily if you let them. But, for some people, they like to sink to the bottom, while your upper body floats. Don't worry just retry the method again. Practice doing this on your stomach and on your back, until you're used to letting half of your body float.









Try floating on your back or your stomach as soon as you're ready. Stay in a shallow depth so that you can simply stand up if it's not working out. It might feel weird to have water around your ears while your nose and mouth are in the air, but you'll get used to it. For extra stability, put out your arms at a right angle so that your body is in a ""T"" shape.

, Always remember that you have a fallback if you're in an unmanageable depth or you simply can't move your limbs - floating on your back. Don't flail around or start breathing quickly if you can't swim; simply lie back as flat as you can, and let the water carry you while you regain your composure.








, While you're still in a shallow depth, take a deep breath and put your face underwater. Slowly exhale out your nose until you're out of breath, then come back up. Bubbles should come out. You can also exhale out of your mouth, but usually in big bubbles until you finally let out a stream of bubbles.









If you're uncomfortable exhaling through your nose, you can hold it closed or wear a nose plug and exhale through your mouth.

, Wearing goggles can help you feel more comfortable opening your eyes underwater, and might allow you to see more clearly. Find a pair with spongy circles around the eyes and dip them in the water, so that they'll stick to your skin. Tighten the strap around the back of your head so that the goggles fit snugly.

, Whether you're floating on your back or still holding on to the side of the pool, you can practice kicking. (To see how far each kick can propel you, practice it using a kickboard. This allows you to focus on your kicking technique without worrying about keeping your head above water.)









Try a flutter kick. Point your toes out like a ballerina, keep your legs mostly straight, and alternate legs as you make small kicks. You should feel the most flexion in your ankles.
Try a whip kick. Keep your legs held tightly together from your hips to your knees, and from your knees to your ankles. Bend your knees so that your shins come up to about a 90-degree angle, then quickly bring your shins apart and move them in a circular motion, keeping your thighs together the whole time. (That is, trace half a circle with each leg, moving your right leg to the right and your left leg to the left.) Bring your shins back together at the bottom of the circle, and lift them up again to restart the kick.
Try an eggbeater kick. This kick is commonly used to tread water, and stay in a vertical position with your head and shoulders above water. Start with your knees bent and your legs slightly wider than hip-width apart. Then ""pedal"" each leg as you would on a bike, only they'll go in opposite directions: while one leg pedals ""forward,"" the other leg should pedal ""backward."" This one takes some practice to get used to, but it's handy for ""resting"" when your feet can't touch bottom.

, Crawls are great strokes to learn as a beginner, and they'll move you pretty quickly. Here's how to do them:










Try a backstroke first. Float flat on your back, and do a flutter kick with your legs. With your arms, do the ""crawl"" motion, lifting one arm straight into the air and keeping it straight as it re-enters the water next to your head. Once it's underwater, bend it to bring it back to a straight position next to your side, and repeat. Alternate arms as you swim, and try to keep your fingers together and your hands as flat as possible.
Try a front stroke (also known as a freestyle or American crawl). Floating on your stomach, do a flutter kick with your legs and use your arms to ""crawl"" forward. Bring one arm out of the water so that it's ""reaching"" forward, then bring it back down and use your cupped hand to ""push"" the water behind you. Alternate arms. To breathe, turn your head to one side under the arm that's currently crawling, lifting enough for you to take a breath. Take a breath under the same arm each time, so that you're breathing once every two strokes.

, Treading water can help you catch your breath and keep your head up without actually swimming. Do the eggbeater kick listed above, and use your hands to keep your balance by ""sculling"" - keep your forearms flat on the surface of the water, and imagine they're butter knives spreading on a piece of toast. Move one arm in a clockwise circle, and the other arm in a counterclockwise circle.








, If you're below water and would like to come up, use your arms to propel yourself. Put them straight up above your head, and quickly bring them down to your sides. This should push you up a few feet. Repeat until you break the surface.

, Once you're more comfortable in the water, you can start learning new strokes that will move you more quickly or with less energy. Try these:









Learn the dolphin stroke.
The butterfly stroke .
Swim the breaststroke.
Do the sidestroke.
Try swimming laps.

, Dives can be a fun way to get into the water and start a stroke. Start with a basic dive, and move on to more complicated swan dive, back dive, and rolling dive.










Always make sure the water is deep enough before you dive. At a bare minimum, the water should be 9 or 10 feet (2.7 or 3.0 m) deep; if you're a tall person, make it at least 11 or 12 feet (3.4 or 3.7 m).

, If you're swimming in the ocean, you might get caught in a riptide. Knowing what to do can save your life, so try to memorize these steps before you get into the water.


Do not panic. This is, by far, the most important step of all. By flailing and panicking, you could actually keep yourself under the water.
Swim sideways. Do not try to swim directly to shore or directly out further into the ocean. Instead, try to swim in a line that's exactly parallel to the shoreline.
Swim in a stroke that allows you to breathe. Swim with the strongest stroke you can do that also allows you plenty of room to breathe. This might be a sidestroke, front crawl, or breaststroke.
Keep swimming until you're out of the riptide. You might have to swim quite far before you're safely out of the riptide, but keep going. You don't want to undo the good work you've done so far by heading for shore at the wrong time.
If possible call out for help. If you can, motion to the lifeguard or yell ""Help!"" as soon as possible. However, don't do this if it means sacrificing a breath or if you have to stop swimming - it's better to keep yourself moving.

, If you're caught in a river that's flowing too quickly or pushing you under, follow these steps to get out:


Don't flail or panic. As with a riptide, panicking and flailing your limbs can push you deeper into the water. Try to take even breaths and remain calm.
Aim to swim diagonally toward the shoreline. Swimming toward the shoreline at a 90-degree angle will force you to fight with the current too much, and might cause you to become exhausted quickly. Instead, plan to get to the shoreline at a diagonal angle that goes with the current.
Don't try to swim upstream. You'll spend too much energy for not enough results. Only try to swim upstream if there's immediate danger downstream, such as sharp rocks or a waterfall.

If you’re nervous about being in water try blowing some bubbles to relax. First, take a deep breath. Bend your legs until your face is underwater, keeping your eyes closed. Exhale slowly, blowing out bubbles. This will help you relax.Don’t start swimming until you’ve relaxed. If you swim while you’re stressed out you risk injuring yourself or drowning.
Try opening your eyes underwater while you blow bubbles. This will also help you relax.;
, Stretch your arms in front of you, keeping your head above the water. Stretch your legs loosely out underneath you. You can keep your feet on the bottom of the pool until you start swimming. Remember to breathe deeply and relax.Don’t lie completely flat or stay completely horizontal. Try to find a point in between where your body is almost floating.
Make sure to do this in shallow water. If you need to, you can stand up to breathe or float until you catch your breath.

, Cup both hands by pressing your fingers together tightly and bowing your palm out. Extend your hands one at a time and pull water towards yourself in a scooping motion. You will feel yourself moving forward a bit when you scoop the water. Practice this motion until you’re comfortable with it.Some people prefer to scoop water in a downward motion instead of towards themselves.
Your hands should be under the water at all times.

, Your legs will keep you afloat while your arms move you forward. While scooping water with your arms, kick your feet under the water. You can kick in a “bicycle” motion by kicking your legs in circles or a “frog kick” motion by kicking your legs out. Practice each kicking motion and decide which is more comfortable for you. Breathe deeply. Keep your head over the surface of the water to allow you to breathe easily.
If you find yourself struggling to swim or breathe, stand up and take a break.

, If you find yourself straining your neck, keep your head close to the surface of the water. Raise your head above the surface when you want to inhale and slowly exhale while your face is in the water. Make sure you’re staying calm at all times.If you’re having too much trouble keeping your head above water you need to paddle harder with your hands.
If you find yourself getting worn out, either stand up or turn onto your back and float until you catch your breath.

, If you’re having trouble staying close to the surface of the water this means you need to kick harder with your feet. Kicking your feet will keep you afloat but only if you’re kicking hard enough. Similarly, if you find yourself moving forward too slowly, paddle harder with your hands.


If you’re scooping the water towards yourself, scoop the water down instead. You won’t go forward as fast but it will help you stay afloat.
If you’re struggling to do a bicycle kick, switch to a frog kick (and vice versa).

, Floating is a life-saving technique that will help you catch your breath. When you’re swimming in deep water, you won’t always have the opportunity to stand up or grab on to something to take a break. Furthermore, the dog paddle is a great swimming technique for beginners but it can tire a swimmer out easily. Learn to float to reduce the risk of drowning.


Practice floating in the shallow end of the pool. If you have trouble staying above the water you can stand up to catch your breath.

, It’s hard to float when your muscles are tensed up. Turn on your back in the water and stretch your arms and legs out, flattening your body.Relax your neck and let your head dip into the water. However, make sure that your face doesn’t become submerged.


If you’re worried about getting water in your ear, wear a swimmer cap while swimming.
If you’re having trouble relaxing try closing your eyes while you float.

, First, breathe deeply. Filling your lungs with air will help you float above the water. If your legs are sinking too much, stretch your arms out behind your head, keeping them in the water.If you’re still having trouble keeping your legs afloat, kick your legs slightly.


If you’re having trouble breathing when you exhale, kick your legs slightly. This will help you stay afloat until you draw your next breath.
Try to avoid using your hands to paddle. Instead, spread your hands and let your arms float.

, Most people prefer to float on their backs so that they can breathe while they float. However, if you’d like to float face down, the technique is very similar.Take a deep breath and hold it. Submerge your face in the water and stretch your arms and legs out like a starfish. When you need to breathe again, either stop floating or gently turn onto your back to take a breath.


Push your chest into the water to help keep your legs afloat.
Kick your feet gently if you’re having trouble floating.

, If you panic while you’re swimming you are at risk for drowning. Focus on your breathing and your form.If you’re in the deep end of a pool, calmly find your way to the shallow end. If you’re out in a larger body of water, look for something to stand on or something to hold on to.


If you need help calming down, float on your back and focus on breathing deeply.
When you panic, you become short of breath. This can make it harder to float.

, If you aren’t a confident swimmer wear a lifejacket, especially when you’re swimming in large bodies of water. An inexperienced swimmer can usually make it to the edge of the pool, but they might have trouble making it to the shore. Fortunately, you can use the correct dog paddle form when wearing a life jacket.


If you don’t want to wear a lifejacket but still want to be safe, use a Safer Swimmer. This is a small life buoy that attaches to a belt and floats behind you as you swim.When in doubt, have children wear a life jacket. It’s better to be safe than sorry.

, Never swim alone. If you have a panic attack in the water or have trouble staying afloat your friend will be able to help you. Try to swim at pools that employ lifeguards. Lifeguards are trained to help you if you’re drowning and to administer basic first aid.


Have a cell phone nearby when you swim just in case you need to call your local emergency number.
Always obey pool rules and regulations.

You can get a feel for butterfly and you will get better if you actually know what to do with your arms and legs. Do a few drills to help with the part of butterfly you are weak on (arms or legs).
, Do a normal dive as you would do for any other stroke. After you dive in, put your arms above your head and put one hand on top of the other and do about three dolphin kicks in the water before you put your arms out of the water., When doing dolphin kicks (the required kicks for butterfly) always keep your legs together. Don’t let them drift apart or start doing freestyle or breaststroke kicks., When you aren’t above the water, always keep your arms between your head and your hands together. Don’t start doing freestyle or breaststroke., Don’t put one arm out of the water before the other. It is essential the both arms come out of the water synchronized., This is the thing that judges look at the most. It is required that you touch the wall with two hands simultaneously at the turn and at the end."

Use the dolphin kick with freestyle arms to increase stroke rate.",How to Do the Dolphin Stroke Underwater," Stretch your hands in front of you in a streamline position. Keep your feet and legs straight and together, and keep your core tense.


You should start off low enough in the water that you’ll be able to keep your whole body underwater while you execute the stroke. You might need to start off at a slight downward angle in order to achieve this, and it will probably take some practice.
Be sure to breathe in fully before starting, since you’ll be under water for a while.
You can do the dolphin stroke on your back, your front, or even your side, but when you’re learning it, it’s probably easier to start prone, with your face toward the bottom of the pool.;
, Tilt your pelvis forward slightly to drive this motion. This part of the stroke is the backward kick, and it is meant to get your body into position. Focus on achieving a full extension with your legs.

, Tilt your pelvis backward to drive this part of the stroke. This is the forward kick, which provides the stroke’s propulsion. Your legs should extend in front of your body line during this part of the kick.

, Feet, like a dolphin’s fins, generate much of the thrust in this kick. Fully extending your ankles can maximize this effect.This is an unusual position in daily life, but strong, flexible ankles will improve all of your swimming kicks, not only the dolphin.


In essence, you are pushing water, not only up and down, but also backward with this kick. Flexible, extended ankles are crucial to doing this effectively.Strengthen and stretch your ankles by tracing the alphabet with your feet. Lie on your back in a comfortable position and write each letter, lowercase and uppercase, in the air with each foot., Don’t use the motion of your hips to stay underwater. Instead, control your depth using your arms. By keeping your arms in streamline position and pointing them slightly toward the bottom of the pool, you will resist the tendency of your body to float to the surface.The kick’s power is based in part on the insight that kicking underwater avoids the resistance created by turbulence and air at the surface., Using a wall will help you isolate the pelvis and focus on building comfort and strength with this motion. In addition, the wall will keep your arms and shoulders in line, similar to the position you will want to maintain in the water.


Stand with your upper back against the wall and your feet twelve to eighteen inches from the wall. Hold your arms above your head in streamline position. Tilt your pelvis backward by slowly crunching your abdomen in. Bring your middle and lower back slowly in contact with the wall as you do this. Then, reverse the motions. Repeat up to five times.Turn around and stand with your feet about eighteen inches from the wall. Keeping your pelvis above your feet, hold your arms above your head in streamline position and rest them on the wall. Rotating your pelvis forward, slowly bring the rest of your torso and then your thighs into contact with the wall. Reverse these motions and repeat up to five times., Hold the kickboard level in front of you. Extend your arms instead and keep your head up. Do not “pump” the kickboard, but maintain an even, level position, keeping your arms and your shoulders in a steady plane. Imagine you are leaning against a wall in order to keep your torso and arms still; the motion should come from your pelvis and legs.When you feel comfortable with this drill, try the same thing without the kickboard.You may also practice this drill in deep water to build the necessary amplitude., Push off from the wall at the surface and oriented on one side. Extend the bottom arm in front of you and stretch the other arm along the top of your body. Stay in the middle of the lane. This drill helps to develop the symmetry required of the stroke., The dolphin kick can help you develop a faster stroke rate. Match one stroke with each kick for a short distance in this drill, not pausing to breathe."

, It's divided into an arbitrary number of 'jams', which each last up to two minutes. The point of the game is for each team to get their point scorer, or 'jammer', past all the opposing skaters, as many times as possible. The 'pack' of skaters block against each other, trying to clear space for their jammer, while getting in the way of the opposing jammer.

, This happens when one of the jammers emerges first from the pack in their first lap through. This jammer now has the power to end the jam before two minutes elapse (the maximum time per jam). This can be a big strategic advantage for her team.

, They usually don't bite and probably appreciate the positive attention. Better yet, since a ref might not recall why he sent that skater to the box, ask your fellow fans; even if they're wearing T-shirts, buttons or tattoos of a different favorite team, they don't bite either and are usually happy to explain a finer point - as long as you wait until the current jam ends.

See if they know the staff.,
Determine if they know statistics.,
See if they know any historical information about the team.,
Count how many teams they support.,
Listen to their reasons for supporting the team.,
See if they only support the best teams in the league.",How to Identify a Bandwagon Fan1," True fans of a team will know the names of more than just the star player on the team. See if they know other players, coaches, owners, and former players. This will help determine if they have any loyalty towards the team.


Knowing the play-makers is great. But a true fan needs to know more than the offensive players. They need to know what's going on on both sides of the ball.Not every fan follows what goes on behind the scenes so cut them some slack if they don't know the athletic trainer or the newest draft picks.;
, Knowing statistics takes both time and effort. Do they know the average number of points scored per game? Do they know where the team ranks offensively and defensively? True fans always find ways to track the progress of their favorite team.Their knowledge should go beyond stats for the star player or the team's record. They should be able to discuss the teams status as if they were commentators for ESPN, because it is both informative and entertaining for real fans.

, It's easy to know about a team's current progress, but it's more difficult to know about the history of a team. A fan who has been loyal for years will know past players, championship years, and significant games.


Many fans will also have personal stories associated with the team. For example, they'll know exactly where they were when the Houston Rockets won back-to-back championships in 1994 and 1995.
Many bandwagon fans only follow teams who have been successful over the last few years and will not know history that stretches beyond the team's current winning streak., Fake fans usually divide their loyalty among more than one team. The more teams they support, the less of a true fan they are. Choosing a favorite sports team is like choosing a wife--you can only have one.In different sports, there are rules about teams you cannot support at the same time. For example, in baseball you can't root for both the Yankees and the Mets.In football, you can't cheer for both the Texans and the Cowboys.

, Most of the time loyalty to a team is determined by where you live or your support for a player that you idolized as a kid.Bandwagon fans usually have flimsy excuses for why they support a team.


For example, reasons such as liking the team colors, having a spouse that supports the team, or picking the favorite team as a kid are not viable reasons.
If your favorite team relocates to a different city then the rules change. You are now free to turn your back on that team.
If you grew up in a city that didn't have a team for a specific sport, you're then able to pick a team (with good reason of course)., If the fan only supports the #1 teams in football, baseball, basketball, soccer or other major league sports, they are likely not supporting the team, but supporting the winning streak. There will be times when your favorite team will consistently be successful; but it's a strange phenomena when ALL of the teams you support are doing well.


For example, it's perfectly acceptable to support the New England Patriots and their success. But to support them, the Chicago Blackhawks, the San Francisco Giants, and the Golden State Warriors at the same time is a sign of being a bandwagon fan."
"
Notice if they go to games only when the team is successful.,
Ask why they leave the game early.,
Determine if they go to live games.,
See if they support the team only during playoffs.,
Determine if they jump off the wagon.",How to Identify a Bandwagon Fan2," It's difficult to support a team when they are in a slump, but real fans do just that. Even if a real fan curses their team, they are there to support them the next game. Bandwagon fans jump off the wagon at the first sign of trouble.Going to a game takes more effort and more money. Bandwagon fans don't want to invest either if the team isn't doing well.
The same is true of watching games on television.

, True fans stay at a game until the bitter end--even if they know the result will be less than desirable. On the other hand, bandwagon fans tend to walk out and stop offering support to the team.


Bandwagon fans often miss out on some of the best comebacks in sports because they choose to walk out during tough times., Many fans go to live sporting events for the experience of being around like-minded, passionate individuals.Bandwagon fans don't value the experience because they aren't as emotionally invested as real fans. Even if it means braving the cold or paying for over-priced beer, real fans will try to attend at least one game during the season.


Some bandwagon fans will attend a game or two just to be able to say that they have. They are unlikely to attend games that aren't convenient. For example, when the weather is bad, when the tickets are too pricey, or when the game falls on a workday.

, This has a bit to do with the team being successful, but it also has to do with the importance of the game. Sports seasons can be long and grueling so bandwagon fans like to skip the regular season games and jump right to the good part.


Playoff games occur after the regular season and are tournament style games that lead up to the championship.Playoffs also bring out bandwagon fans whose ""first choice"" didn't make the playoffs. In order to have someone to root for, they will choose a team randomly and only for that season., This is also known as wavering in their support of the team. If a fan stops supporting their team if they lose a playoff game, championship game, or don't make the playoffs at all, they're exhibiting behavior consistent with that of a bandwagon fan.

"
"
See if they own a throwback jersey.,
Notice if they ever boo their team.,
Determine if they support their team's players more than any others.",How to Identify a Bandwagon Fan3," A throwback jersey is one that duplicates a jersey worn by a team or player from the past.Real fans tend to purchase throwback jerseys (along side more modern sports gear) because they actually know the history of the team and its players.On the contrary, bandwagon fans typically purchase team gear that represents the newest logos, colors, and players.
True fans are also more likely to spend big bucks on team gear and throwbacks are usually more authentic and costly.

, True fans will never boo their team because they are trying to inspire them, not make them feel worse. It's okay to be angry with a less than perfect performance, but making your team feel like trash won't help. Real fans stick with their team for better or for worse., A true fan's loyalty is always to his or her team first. That doesn't mean that they can't support or like other players, but it does mean that their loyalty lies with their team's players first.


For example, it's fine to appreciate great players like Peyton Manning but if you're a New England fan you support Tom Brady first.
Additionally, if you have players who are on your fantasy football team but are not on your favorite football team, you can support them only as far as it doesn't interfere with your favorite team's success."

Be gradual.,
Look for new musicians, actors, actresses etc to replace the one you don't like anymore.,
If you don't like them anymore, it just means you grew out of their music, films, etc.,
Try not to dislike the artist simply because they've lost popularity, or were never popular to start with.",How to Stop Being a Fan," Don't throw everything out at once, unless you absolutely can't stand the artist. Make a plan to gradually get rid of everything in a timely manner. You may realize that you don't want to throw things out after all. Moderation is better, and you may regret it if you get rid of all of your things. Try this gradual plan:


To ease the first feelings, vent by choosing a picture of the artist that you don't like as much. Crumple it up and throw it away in a trash can that you can't see into.
In a few days, choose your least favorite CDs, movies, etc., and give them to a friend so you can still use them if you decide you want to.
In another 2 days or so, if you still have strong feelings, gather up three to five more of the things you have of them and discard. Throw away paper, and donate or sell CDs, books, and movies.
After about two weeks have passed, if your feelings are still there, then it's a good chance that you will never like this artist again. Get rid of everything you have of theirs, except for your favorite special thing. Hide this somewhere, or send to a relative or friend to keep for you.
Once a month has passed, you can either destroy that one special thing, or you may decide you want it back.;
, You always need someone to look up to and be a fan of, so try to find one.


Look for one that sings songs or acts in movies that are a style you like (western, horror, etc.)
Look for one who just all around appeals to you. Don't settle for halves, or you'll just be doing this all over again in a few weeks.

, If anybody asks, just say that you grew bored with what they're doing. Don't use them as a vent for your feelings, and don't let anyone pry into your business, or put you down because you don't like them. It's not anyone else's business which celebrities you like and don't like.

, You have a right to develop your tastes as you see fit, so don't abandon the music and films you've loved because of popularity. Don't abandon them just because someone puts you down (see the last step). You have a right to like who you like and it isn't anyone else's business.

If someone has a designated space that's easy to find you can drop off your food and then park or park and haul your food. Many people bring luggage carts or wagons for ease of transport.;
,


These may be highly sought after spaces.
You may need to build seniority, be affiliated with a company or buy from an established parker to get a really good one.
People often sell their parking privileges and passes when moving. Check the school paper, craigslist, alumni organization, etc.

, Certain foods and beverages may be tradition in certain areas. Some foods can be prepared on site and others prepared in advance and brought in on platters.

, You'll need time to set up, prepare foods, enjoy your time together, pack up, clean up and get inside.

, With others tailgating it may be hard for your friends to find you in a sea of people.

, In most US stadium parking lots people can bring coolers with alcoholic beverages, gas or charcoal grills, catering tables, and everything from beer cans to fine china.


If you have doubts you can ask other tailgaters. Since there isn't a fee to enter the parking area on foot you can do a walk through and talk to other tailgaters about the dos and don't s as well as helpful tips. Most are very friendly and will gladly offer advice.
So long as you stay in the parking area you are pretty much free to party as you please so long as you aren't a troublemaker.

, Set your grill up behind the SUV or truck, put your canopy up next to your grill and the T.V. under the canopy on a table or in the back of your SUV or truck.


Set up plenty of chairs for your group or extras if you're expecting friends. Have friends bring their own. Keep a few chairs around for those guest that may stop in for a while to socialize.
If you get bored of watching the other sports games on TV then you can pull out a football, baseball, or other ball that you might have brought along with you to pass around with some one.
Consider bringing a TV and attaching a game system with sports games or other fun games for the group attending.
Many tailgaters listen to pre-game shows on the radio. Make sure you have the battery strength or pack a separate radio. You don't want to kill your vehicle battery.
If your car isn't equipped you can have an A/C plug kit and inverter installed to operate electric equipment.

, Your arriving friends may need direction if they can't find you.

,, Warm foods can be packed with hot packs in coolers to stay warm but avoid foods that haven't been packed safely.

, People will be hungry and the post game tailgate is a great way to relax and discuss the game while traffic clears out.

, The use of these may also depend on local drought conditions.

,, Add your own special touches. Modify it to offer more cool treats on warm days and bring plenty of hot comfort foods for cold days.

Squash;
, Instead of looking for 80%/20% ground beef, go for 90% lean packages. Weigh your options between using ground beef versus ground turkey or ground chicken. If you need an additional protein push, add some mashed beans into the raw mixture before preparing into burger patties or as sloppy joes. Always try to serve boneless, skinless chicken breasts if you're not planning finger foods.

, Make lettuce wraps with your chicken and prick a toothpick in the center of each to hold everything together. Use whole wheat buns instead of regular white hamburger buns. Provide fresh cut up vegetable slices, pita chips, or baked chips rather than processed bags of chips.

, Some things, for example, chicken wings, might be purchased from restaurants in bulk to relieve time and would be considered a convenience to many. However, deep fried foods are always saturated in fat while cooking, in which makes the food absorb the greasiness. Make time in your morning before you head off and prepare a few batches of baked foods.

, Making your own dips are fast and can be prepared in advance. It's also great because you know exactly what is in it, rather than processed store bought containers. Think of ways to use fat free cream cheese, yogurt, or pureed vegetables. Incorporate a pureed bean dip or salsa into your list of foods.

, You may be tempted to pack a cooler with any popular beer brand, but if you're wanting alcoholic beverages, try to get something with the lowest calories and fat. Always have alcoholic beverages in moderation, whether you're in public or not, and have a designated driver at all times.

Repeat the previous step until you feel comfortable being underwater without holding your nose.

",How to Swim Underwater Without Holding Your Nose1,"


Standing by the edge of the pool will ensure that you feel secure while you go through the following steps.
It is a good idea to stand waist- or chest-deep in the pool, whichever you are more comfortable with.;
, Exhaling through your nose is the main way to be sure that water doesn't get into it. Try to exhale slowly after you dunk your head into the water so that you can stay underwater longer. ,"
"
Now that you are getting used to being underwater without holding your nose, try it out while swimming.,
Start by going underwater and pushing off of the edge of the pool.,
Start swimming!,
Keep swimming the shorter length of the pool until you feel comfortable.

",How to Swim Underwater Without Holding Your Nose2," Swim along the shorter length of the pool near the edge while you follow the steps below. Using a shorter distance and the edge as a guide will allow you to build up to bigger challenges.

,


Try this a few times before actually swimming all the way across.
If you find that water is going up your nose after you kick off, repeat the process.
Make sure that you are exhaling through your nose while you push off of the side of the pool.

, Once you have gotten used to pushing off of the edge of the pool without holding your nose, start swimming across the pool.


While using strokes such as Freestyle, Froggy, or Butterfly, where you are swimming ""horizontally,"" keep your head facing down towards the bottom of the pool.
As always, make sure that you are blowing air out through your nose while your head is submerged.Come up for air after 1-3 ""strokes"" or as needed, then dip your head back into the water, exhaling through your nose.

Start by taking a huge breath and putting your head underwater.,
Swim a lap without holding your nose.",How to Swim Underwater Without Holding Your Nose3," Without overthinking it, begin swimming across the pool. Using all of the steps above, you should now be able to swim the entire length of the pool without holding your nose!


Be confident in yourself and your ability as a swimmer, but don't forget that your comfort and feeling of safety while swimming is the most important thing. Use the edge of the pool as needed until you feel that you can swim the entire length of the pool without using it.
As you swim more, you will find it easier to go farther without feeling that you need to hold your nose. Your body will acclimate to this process over time.
Also, as you begin swimming faster, water will be less likely to go into your nose.

Have a good diving technique.,
Work the backstroke and breaststroke, and bring the freestyle home.,
When you get to the wall, touch it with 2 hands and quickly flip over onto your back.,
To switch to breaststroke, count your strokes again from the flags into the wall, and when you touch the wall, just turn around and start doing breaststroke.,
When you get to the wall, turn and start your last 50 freestyle.",How to Swim the 200 Individual Medley," The key is to use all of your strength to rocket yourself off the block and into the water. Many people make the mistake of slightly rolling back for more power, but all that does is slows you down, because while the other swimmers are in the air, you're just going to be coming forward.;
, So once you come off your starting block, start with a rather aggressive but consistent dolphin kick, and break out just beyond the flags. Remember not to breathe on the first three strokes off the wall. Even if it's hard, it will get you ahead in the race. When you come to the wall at the other end, stay low on your turns, so only your collarbone comes out of the water. Then start the last 25 meters (82.0 ft) of butterfly.

, Push off underwater with a dolphin kick and also break out just after the flags. NOW start the backstroke. Keep in mind to have good shoulder rotation and pull hard underwater with your hand. Now the backstroke flip turn is really important. Once you see the flags, count about 4-5 strokes, and while pulling with your hand, rotate onto your stomach and flip just like you would a freestyle flip turn. Then instead of rotating onto your stomach again once you come off the wall, keep going on your back towards the other end of the pool.

, Have a powerful kick and remember to glide. Another important factor is to keep your arms in front of you. If you bring them too far back, the officials will count that as a pull and you will get disqualified. And don't slow down. Keep going at a fast pace. At most times people decide to slow down, and that costs them the race. And remember to touch with 2 hands on both walls.

, This should be all out, and forget about how tired you are. Thinking about that will get you even more tired. On your turn, remember to have your arms pressed in against you and not out on either side of you.

Look around.,
Close your eyes and hold your breath.,
Try to swim in a straight line.,
Keep hands and legs moving to stay submerged.,

Be calm.,

Test the water.,
Continue to acclimate your eyes.,
Rinse your eyes after you're out.,
Check the chlorine level.,
Splash pool water onto your eyes.,
Swim for a while with eyes open.,
Rinse eyes once out of the water.",How to Swim Underwater Without Goggles," Since you won't be able to see underwater nearly as well as you would with goggles on, have a look around before you go under the surface. If in a pool, know how close you are to which walls and how close you are to anyone else swimming alongside you. If swimming in fresh water, know your orientation and which directions lead to shallow or deeper water.;
, Before you submerge, have your eyes closed and take a big breath. Be sure wherever you're thinking of swimming is somewhere you can get to on one breath if you'd like to remain underwater the entire time. Otherwise you'll need to come up for air.

, To avoid running into anything or anybody, know the direction you'd like to go before heading underwater. Keep in that direction as best as you can until you reach your destination. Be sure when you swim that both sides of your body are in sync to avoid drifting to the left or right.

, Provided you want to stay underwater, be sure to always push yourself slightly down with each stroke to counter-act your own buoyancy. Use this as well to know how close you might be to the surface. Stick an arm up at any point towards the surface, and if your arm reaches air, you may need to go down a bit.

, Unless it's a particularly short distance, you'll probably need to surface and catch your breath. Try and notice how far you've swum and if you've veered from your desired path at all. Take a moment to readjust before submerging again.

, If they know where they're going, ask if they wouldn't mind if you held on (lightly) to their ankle or reached out in front of you from time to time to check your bearings. This is helpful if you're especially concerned of becoming disoriented or running into something on your way to where you're going.

, Know that at any moment you could return to the surface and continue breathing normally. If you run into anybody, don't worry; apologize and make reference to your lack of goggles when you were swimming underwater.

, The biggest risk with having your eyes open underwater is the possibility of contamination. If the water seems especially murky or if it smells bad, consider keeping your head above water. Keep your eyes closed if you have to swim underwater in fresh water that is less than clean.


Never swim underwater in sea water without goggles. The salt water of the ocean burns the cornea.

, Dip your head underwater and open your eyes. More than likely it won't be especially comfortable and your vision will most likely be very blurry. Some can see better underwater than others, but you'll probably only be able to make out rough shapes and shadows. Blink your eyes several times before coming back up above the water., Your vision will remain blurry, but if you continue to swim underwater with your eyes open for longer and longer the uncomfortable feeling should pass. Avoid touching your eyes while underwater so as not to push any particulate in the water onto your eye or under your eyelid.

, While not necessary, it's a good idea to rinse your eyes with clean water or saline after swimming without goggles. A good rinse should knock anything potentially harmful that might've gotten in your eye while swimming.


If you wear contact lenses, it is advised that you never open your eyes underwater without goggles. The lens provides a place for debris to get stuck in your eye, risking harm. If you do swim with them, take them out and rinse both them and your eyes after the fact., If you have your own pool, make sure it has not been ""shocked,"" or chlorine treated, recently. If the level of chlorine is too high in the pool, it will cause your eyes to burn more than they would normally, and the feeling may not pass. A sure sign of recent treatment is an excessive chlorine smell., Before submerging your head completely, keep your eyes open while splashing water onto your face. Going straight underwater with your eyes open will be too uncomfortable for some. This splashing is a more comfortable way of acclimating your eyes ahead of going underwater.

, The burning may continue, but should abate as you spend more time underwater with your eyes open. To avoid any additional discomfort, keep your eyes closed when swimming forward underwater. If you keep your eyes open the water moving past your face will move along the surface of your eyes, causing friction where otherwise there was none., Do this step to wash out any chlorine left on or around your eye/eyelid. Beyond this, it's generally recommended to wash your hair and body after any swim in chlorinated water; if left on the skin it tends to dry it out, and may become uncomfortable.

Put your hand into the water fingers first about 15 inches above your head. Your palm should be tilted at a 45 degree angle facing out so your index and middle finger enter the water first. Your wrist should be tilted down and positioned above the fingers, and your elbow will be raised above the wrist. Your hand should make as little splash as possible during entry. Once your hand is in the water, extend your arm another 4 inchesOnce your hand is in the water, press your hand down and out with your fingers spread out slightly. This is called “getting a feel” for the water or “the catch”.
If you want to work on your hand technique, you can wear hand paddles to help you concentrate on how your hands are entering and exiting the water.
Avoid putting your hand into the water just above your head. It will slow you down and hurt your technique.
Do not smack the water with your arms, instead, once your hand enters the water, follow the motion and glide your arm into the water.;
, Your arm will act as a lever during this phase of the stroke. As you stroke, your body will rotate toward the arm that is in the motion of stroking. Move your forearm and hand downward and back with your elbow held at about a 45 degree angle. Your elbow should stay stay high in the water during this phase of your stroke. Concentrate on going through the downsweep smoothly.









This phase should happen in a rapid motion. However, avoid trying to go faster during this phase because it won’t propel you forward much but could create drag.

, During this part of the stroke, use your hand like a paddle and move as much water as possible. This is where you start to move your body forward with your arm stroke movement. It is the first part of the “propulsive” phase. And your upper arm will move inward toward your chest and ribcage. Your elbow will go starting moving into a 90 degree angle. When your hand starts to approach the midpoint of your body, you have reached the backsweep.








Keep your arms closer to being under you instead of stroking at your sides.

, This is the second “propulsive” phase where you can gain speed in your stroke. Right as your hand gets to the midpoint of your body you will stop pulling and start pushing water. Keep pushing water out and up until your arm hits the line of your thigh. This part of the stroke will be the most rapid phase and can be the most powerful at propelling you forward.








, During the release your arm doesn’t move you forward, but it does provide support for the arm which is pulling underwater. It is important to work on your release technique so that your hand entry is clean. To end your stroke, launch your hand forward in line with your shoulder out of the water. Your fingers should hang loosely above the water and your hand should swing wider than your arm. Your arm should be relaxed and should swing wide, too.Concentrate on rotating your arm forward, and do not force a down rotation at the end of the release.

, Although kicking accounts for only 10-15% of the power in your stroke, it is still an important part of your freestyle technique. Keep your hips close to the surface of the water and make a series of quick kicks. You want to focus on minimizing drag while you propel yourself forward; therefore, your kicking range of motion should be narrow. Your legs should not kick out of the water and neither should they break below the line of your body.









Kick from the hips and thighs. Do not kick from your knees, this is called a bicycle kick, and it will cause more drag. You may slightly bend your knees while you kick, but this should not be where your power is coming from. , The two-beat kick requires less power and is used by long distance and middle distance swimmers. You kick one leg per stroke cycle. One stroke cycle means the stroke of one arm. Kick one leg in conjunction with the insweep of the opposite arm. (The insweep is when the arm starts pulling water toward the midsection of the body.) If you can think about how your arms and legs sync while you are walking, how your arm moves forward at the same time as the opposite leg, you can imagine how your kicking should be synced with your arm stroke in a similar way.The six-beat kick requires that you kick three times per arm stroke cycle. The third beat of the kicking cycle will start during the recovery phase. This is a faster kick that is used by faster swimmers.

, If your toes aren’t pointed while you kick then there will be extra drag caused by your exposed forefoot. Your toes should face inward, and your big toes should come close to touching as you kick. When you point your toes, you are exercising the flexibility in your ankles. If you are having difficulty with ankle flexibility, consider using mid-length flippers to practice your kick.


You can focus on both your freestyle arm and leg techniques more easily with the extra propulsion that flippers provide. But only use your flippers to help train your feet during drills., Rotating your body correctly will help you with many important aspects of your stroke. First, you can put more power into your arm stroke. Second, you will minimize drag. And third, it will enable you to breathe correctly. As you rotate your body left and right with your alternating arm strokes, your body should be moving in the water about 30 degrees from the surface on both sides. Remember to swim mostly on your stomach and not on your side.








Rotate your body forward as well. Your arm and shoulders should extend forward and your body should rotate forward after your hand and arm have entered the water.
Your fully extended shoulder should stay tucked near your cheek. Do not move your shoulder further away from your body, or this will cause drag.
Focus on rotating your body from the hips and not from the shoulders.

, This will allow you to keep your neck muscles and your head relaxed. If you turn just your head, you can put unnecessary stress on your neck. Keep your forehead and the crown of your head slightly submerged while you breathe. Imagine you have a wine glass balanced on the side of your head that you cannot spill.








Do not over rotate. You only want tilt your body 30 degrees in one direction or the other.
Do not hold your breath longer than you need to when you swim. Breathe at every stroke if you feel the need.
Do not lift your head up- this will cause your hips and legs to fall, and you will have to work to regain your balance.
Continue to keep your body and arms outstretched while you breathe. Keep your body straight, and do not lose your extension while you breathe.

, If you hold your breath, you may develop feelings of anxiety while you are swimming that will slow you down and distract you. You can practice blowing out bubbles in shallow water. Exhale 70% through your mouth and 30% through your nose. And exhale the last 20% with more force. Submerge your face and sigh or hum through your nose or mouth to create a stream of bubbles.








While underwater, make sure to exhale out all of the air so that you are not having to exhale any last bit of air when you should be inhaling.

, The water should rest between your hairline and your eyebrows. Keep your neck and upper-back muscles relaxed while you swim. Your head should be cocked about 45 degrees forward. If you move your head down too much toward your chest, it will cause more resistance.

, Work on isolated parts of your stroke and breathing techniques through practice drills on land and in the water. Concentrating on different parts of your stroke that you need work on will help you develop a stronger complete stroke.









Practice your arm stroke, body rotation and head position on land. Bend forward at your waist, and go through the five stages of the arm stroke: entry, downsweep, insweep, backsweep, release. Practice rotating your body correctly, and practice keeping your head still at the side when you breathe. Rotate your shoulders to work on a longer stroke. Over exaggerate the rotation while you practice, and it will help create muscle memory for when you swim.
Do breathing drills. Kick off the wall and keep your right arm extended in front of you. Use your left arm to stroke, and on your second stroke, take a breath on your left side. Practice blowing bubbles out of your mouth and nose completely and inhaling a full breath through your mouth. Then alternate sides and do the same drill on your right side. This will help you become comfortable with your inhaling and exhaling techniques and establish a breathing pattern. Concentrate on only rotating enough for you to get a full breath.
Practice kicking drills. Push off the wall with your feet and extend your hands and arms out in front of you. Keeping your head under water, kick vigorously for as long as your breath will last. You do not want to focus on going fast, instead, try to focus on your technique. Keep your toes pointed, your feet pointed inward so your toes are almost touching, your hips up, and your kick high. Keep your legs relaxed, and kick from your thighs. Repeat this drill 3-4 times.

, You do not have to wear goggles to swim freestyle; however, when you have to close your eyes while you swim, it can make you anxious. And it will make it more difficult to concentrate on your stroke. When you wear goggles, it can help you stay balanced and oriented. You will know when to stop because you will be able to see the walls of the pool, and you won’t have to worry about bumping into other swimmers.


Adjust your strap, pulling the straps until the goggles fit on your face firmly and comfortably.
Adjust the nose bridge. Pull on both sides of the strap if the nose bridge is a strap. The nose bridge fits properly if you press your goggles up to your eyes and they suction to your eyes without a problem.
Fit the goggles to your head by putting the eye cups up to your eyes so that they suction to your face, and then with your thumbs, move the strap behind your head so that your goggles are firmly in place.

FanDuel occasionally hosts contests with cash prizes that don’t require an entry fee, but these are too few and far between to make a tidy profit from. You will thus need to buy your way into more contests, and you can only do so if you have added funds into your account. You can do this using PayPal or your credit card.
, Open the sidebar by tapping the three green horizontal bars on the upper left-hand side of the lobby screen. Tap “Add Funds,” and select how much you want to put into your FanDuel account: $10, $25, $100, or $200.


Deposit using PayPal—Select “PayPal” as your payment method. You will be led to a separate screen where you will confirm the information before being prompted for the email associated with your PayPal account as well as the password for the said account. Provide all the information requested in this screen as well as subsequent screens, and wait for PayPal to make the transfer.

Deposit using your credit card—Select “Credit Card” as your payment method, and you will be asked to provide your cardholder name, the card number, the expiration date, the CVV, the state/province where the card is valid, and the ZIP code indicated on your card. Provide all this information, hit “Deposit Funds,” and wait for your bank to make the transfer.

, When you make your first deposit, you get a hefty bonus on top of the amount you paid. This is not the only way to gain bonuses though. Sites like GoodSearch, PromoCodeKings, RotoGrinders, and even FanDuel itself sometimes chuck out promo codes that add extra value to the cash you deposit into your FanDuel account., The aforementioned bonuses will only be credited into your account when you join contests with entry fees. These bonuses will be credited at a rate of 4% of each entry fee you pay to join a contest. Let’s say you a contest with a $100 entry fee. You’ll get $4 credited to your account. Do note that the bonuses you gain will expire after a set period of days. This means you need to join as many paid contests as possible in order to profit from these bonuses.The only exception to this is the first-time bonus given to new players. This does not expire, meaning you can take as long as you want to make use of the bonus cash.

, 50/50 and head-to-head contests spreads the risk around. The latter requires you to beat the score of only one opponent, while the former requires you to beat the average points generated by all participants of the contest. You thus stand a better chance of winning if your lineup consists of players that perform consistently well and are able to generate a predictable amount of fantasy points in each game. These “high-floor” lineups are thus ideal for 50/50 and head-to-head contests., League, qualifier, and tournament contests reward a large sum of money for players that manage to place in the top positions. These rewards are huge, but the slots are limited, meaning that you’ll want to pick a lineup that can draw up a huge pool of points if they manage to do well in a particular game. All you need to do is win once, and you stand to gain a ridiculously large return on the cash you put into these games. This is how “high-ceiling” lineups work best for leagues, qualifiers and tournaments., FanDuels sometimes hold contests that allow you to place multiple entries in a single contest. These multi-entry contests give you some wiggle room to experiment with multiple lineups, which in turn allows you to spread the risk by assigning multiple lineups composed of different picks. This is especially useful when you want to try out a bunch of sleeper players that you think will bring in a lot of points despite costing only a little in terms of salary., When you’re forming a lineup for a specific contest, you will need as much information as possible in order to pick the right player for your strategy. Tapping a player’s portrait on the roster screen will lead you to a screen where you can review a player’s game log as well as read up on the latest news about that player’s status in the league. This is an immensely useful tool for drafting rosters with a higher chance for victory, and one that you should not forget to use., It can be easy to overestimate your success when you remember those handful of wins while forgetting those truckload of losses. You can solve this dilemma by creating a spreadsheet. Enter all your entry fees in one column while entering all your winnings in another column. Sum up the earnings, sum up the losses and divide your winnings by your expenditures. You’ll come up with an earnings ratio, a convenient number that you can use to track the profitability of your lineups in each season. The higher it goes, the higher your returns on the money that you put into your FanDuel account., Go to the FanDuel home screen and open the sidebar by tapping the three green horizontal lines on the upper left-hand side of your screen.

Keep your body flat like a plank.,
Be comfortable with the water covering the sides of your head.,
Use a ""flutter"" kick.,
Use a long, fluid arm motion.,
Position your hands to minimize resistance.,
Rotate your shoulders and hips with each stroke.,
Breathe once per arm cycle.,
Use flip turns to turn around quickly.,
If indoors, use the ceiling to keep yourself straight.",How to Swim Backstroke Perfectly," When you're doing the backstroke, you want your body to lay as flat on the surface of the water as possible. The smaller your profile in the water, the less resistance you'll feel as you swim and the easier it will be to go fast.









Most people have a hard time getting their hips to float on the surface of the water, so they sink down a little below the surface. This is OK but try to keep your hips as close to the surface as possible. It will be easier to keep yourself flat once you are moving.;
, The backstroke (like most swimming strokes) is all about making the most efficient use of your energy possible. One easy way to do this is to let your head sit semi-submerged in the water. The water should cover your ears almost completely. It may touch the corners of your face, but it shouldn't be getting into your eyes, nose, or mouth.









If you don't like the feeling of the water covering your ears, consider investing in a swimming cap or a set of swimmer's ear plugs. Trying to keep your ears out of the water will tire out your neck and spend energy that you could be using to swim.

, As soon as you're in position on your back, start kicking. Your legs should be straightened, close together, and lined up below your hips. Use short kicking motions to propel yourself forward. As you raise one leg, kick the other down (and vice versa).









For best results, keep your legs straight and kick from your hips rather than from your knees.This will give you more power and prevent you from getting sore knees.

, As you start to kick forward, keep your arms at your sides. Reach one arm up in front of you. It should point toward the sky or ceiling. Bring it up over your head, by your ear, and down into the water — it will be pointing in the direction you're traveling.









When your arm hits the water, bring it down and scull outward to propel yourself forward. As you do this, raise the other arm and perform the same motion. Repeat. This should feel natural. Try to keep a steady rhythm between your arms and legs because that will make your swimming faster and easier!

, To swim as importantly as possible, remember that your hands should enter and exit the water with their edges first, not their palms. When you lift your arm out of the water, lead with your thumb. When it enters the water, lead with your pinky finger.









When your hand is under the water pulling you forward, rotate it so your palm is facing your feet. This will give you the propulsive energy to go forward.

, Your motions in the pool shouldn't be rigid like a steamboat. Instead, keep them fluid and flexible to get through the water as efficiently as possible. See below:









As you raise each arm, rotate your shoulder upwards. Rotate the opposite shoulder downwards — you should be using it to pull the other hand under the water.
Similarly, twist your hips slightly with each kick. You should have an ever-so-slight ""wiggling"" motion — your right hip should go down when your right leg kicks and vice versa.

, A good policy is to breathe in as one arms leaves the water, then breathe out as the other leaves the water. Repeat this pattern with deep breaths to keep your breath steady.








Deep, steady breathing is important even though the backstroke allows you to breathe whenever you want. Breathing at a regular pace allows you to keep your backstroke up (with good form) for as long as possible.

, As you approach a wall, turn over on to your front so you can see where you're going.









Make sure to get a stroke count (the number of backstroke strokes it takes you to get from the flags to the wall), as it will help greatly with your flipturn. When finding your stroke count, count from the flags all the way until you hit the wall. Try taking one stroke off of your stroke count when you do your flipturn. Experiment a little bit, and see what works and is the most comfortable for you.
Once you've figured your stroke count, as you take your last stroke on your back, gradually flip your body over, and simultaneously take one freestyle stroke, and use the stroke to pull yourself into the wall. This motion might feel a bit awkward at first, but keep practicing it, and it will soon feel natural. Then, somersault forward underwater, then stretch your legs out to plant your feet on the wall. Kick off with your legs as you squeeze your arms to your ears and make a ""point"" with your hands. Stay in a tight streamline until you resurface. Keep up a streamline kick until you break the surface, then start your stroke again.
It can take a little practice to learn when exactly to turn over onto your front. Ideally, you want to do it when you're just a stroke or two from the edge of the pool.

, When you're swimming in an indoor pool, you can use the ceiling to make sure you don't veer off-course. Look for a line or pattern in the ceiling material. As you swim, keep your eyes open and focused on the ceiling. Keep this pattern oriented the same way as you swim to keep yourself traveling in a straight line.









If you're swimming outside, you have fewer options. If there are clouds out, you can keep the clouds oriented the same way to travel in a straight line. If not, try keeping the sun on the same side of your body. Keeping your bearings when it's overcast is difficult since you have few visible reference points.

Step up onto the starting block.,
Select your entry point visually and mentally.,
Leap off the starting block once the starting “beep” goes off.,

Swim freestyle once you break the surface after about 5 yards (4.6 m) of underwater dolphin kick.,
Roll on to the side (so that this arm is facing down towards the bottom) that is going to pull first.,
Take the arm facing the bottom out of streamline position and pull it straight back in a forceful motion.,
Recover the arm that has just pulled over the water quickly in a bent but relaxed position.,
Engage the arm that has not pulled in a slightly bent position about 6 – 8 inches (20.3 cm) below the surface.

,
Thrust arm into the water so that it is completely straight and is about 4 – 6 inches (15.2 cm) below the surface.,

Repeat until you touch the wall on a final stroke at the finish of your swim.,
End in a sportsmanlike way.",How to Swim a 50 Yard Freestyle," When the starter tells you to take your mark, get ready to dive, but stay absolutely still, or you might get a disqualification.;
, Before you dive, pick your target in the water where you want to dive. This will help to psych you for the race and ensure correct entry.

, Use your legs to spring off the block and into the water when the starting blare goes off. Be sure to leap outwards toward the flags and be in a streamline position before entering the water. Make sure you are not just dropping into the water 2 feet from the starting block.


Practicing and perfecting a racing dive can be critical in lowering times.
Be sure to cover the most horizontal distance possible while diving.

, Continue this for around 5 yards/meters or longer if desired. Do not exceed 15 yards/meters.


Make sure your dolphin kick originates in your hips, and you are not relying on your knees to create power for the kick (this mistake is made very often by swimmers).

, Perform an aggressive breakout.

, Be sure to be in stream line position through this step. Do not breathe on the first or second stroke from the start.

, By doing this it will cause the rest of the body to rotate to the other side.

, At this point, this arm that has not entered the water yet.

,, At this point, the arm should be slightly outside shoulders width.

, Be sure to engage hips before pulling in order to maximize the effect.

,, Also, reach in front of your shoulders (all the way) and pull your hand underwater while bending slightly at the elbows for a powerful pull. This reduces drag caused by the head and shoulders. Another way of reducing drag is by keeping a steady kick and not letting your hips and legs sink. By keeping your legs elevated, you are in a more streamlined position, therefore you go faster.

, Do not dive under the water surface; flip at the surface!

, To increase speed of the flip-turn, lead the body with the head and focus on a tight flip, tuck the knees, with the legs moving very quickly when above the surface.


The key to flip turns is to finish it quickly and get off the wall faster. You can do that by having your hands at your sides after your last stroke before the wall. So after you take your last stroke, glide to the wall with your hands by your sides, and flip at the exact moment (about a foot and a half away from the wall). Then, plant your feet on the wall, and if you kept your hands in the same position when you glided, they should already be in a streamline position above your head.

, As you are flipped onto your back, twist to rotate to the correct position while pushing. Use a powerful dolphin kick to quickly speed up for about 5 - 10 yards/meters.

, Although you may be tired, do not slow down even the slightest bit. It might cost you the race. So gather up all your last strength, and for the last 5 yards (4.6 m), sprint like you never sprinted before.


When finishing, focus on touching the wall while still going as fast as possible, do not breathe in the final 5 yards/meters so that you can focus on speed not on getting your next breath.

, Just make sure to hit the touch pad hard enough so your time shows up.


Touch with the recovery arm so that the hand is above the surface, so that it moves fastest and is visible.

, Make sure to say ""good race"" or ""you did great"" to the person you were racing. The coaches might notice you having a good attitude, whether you won or lost.


After you climb out, thank the timers for getting your time (which you should probably ask them after you leave the starting area). Most of them are volunteers, so it would make them feel appreciated.

Get medical help.",How to Survive a Fast River Current," Swimming is a hazardous activity, even for people who are strong swimmers. Areas which are not monitored or designated for swimming are much more so. Even though swimming in a river on a hot day is a great pleasure, very often there are not the safeguards one would find at a pool or a life guard protected beach.


Humans do not swim well. Humans are not well-designed for swimming. An Olympic-class athlete can swim about 4.5 m.p.h, or about 2 meters a second. The average swimmer is much less than that. It does not take much of a current to overcome a swimmer's abilities.
Most drownings take place in outdoor water bodies.;
, Rivers are natural features, which are often inconstant and change from day to day, season to season. Rivers may have very fast currents, and getting caught in rushing water can be very dangerous. Also, it is not always easy or obvious that a waterway has a strong current. Check for:


Weather. If it has been raining heavily, chances are good that the water level is up.
""Flash flood"" prone areas. Some rivers are noted for suddenly flooding due to mountain rain or other geological conditions.
Obvious fast-moving currents, waves and rapids, even in shallow water.
Hazards, such as dams, underwater obstacles, or rocks or debris moving on the surface or along the bottom of the water.

, Throwing objects, especially buoyant objects, such as wood, a stick, soda bottle or a ball into the middle of the river will begin to give you an idea of the speed.




But remember, there is sometimes a current on the surface, and an undercurrent. The speed on the surface will not give you an indication of the undercurrent.
Just because the surface is moving slow does not mean it is safe.



, Be sure to provide appropriate supervision.


Ensure everyone learns to swim well by enrolling them in age-appropriate learn-to-swim courses. However, this does not mean people are protected from mishaps. In the case of small children, it can actually make them over-confident of abilities.
Have weak swimmers wear U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jackets whenever they are in, on or around water. Do not rely upon water wings or inflatable toys; they can enable swimmers to go beyond their ability or suddenly deflate, which could lead to a drowning situation.

,


Always swim with a buddy. Never swim alone, or with someone who cannot swim.
 Always enter unknown or shallow water cautiously, feet first.
Be safe for diving. Diving areas should be at least 9 feet deep with no underwater obstacles. Rivers typically rise and lower in height, and the riverbed may shift--it is usually not possible to know if it is truly safe for diving.

Do not jump from a great height, such as a tree, ledge or bridge. 
Be careful when standing to prevent being knocked over by currents or waves.
Do not use alcohol and/or drugs before or while swimming, diving or supervising swimmers.

, As with a riptide, panicking and flailing your limbs can push you deeper into the water. Try to take even breaths and remain calm. Hyperventilating can cause you to under. Breathing in can cause you to be more buoyant, helping to reduce sinking.

, Do not try to swim straight towards the shore, as you will fight with the current too much and waste energy. Try to swim at a 45° angle; you will move down further than if you were swimming without a current.

, It will not work. If you are swept away you are already in current too strong for you to overcome that way.

, This is the way most experts recommend. This way, your head is protected. Your legs and feet will take any of the damage from rocks and debris. The top half of your feet should be poking out of the water, flexed, and your head should be above water as well. Look downstream and keep calm, as well as breathing with the flow of the water, to keep from swallowing too much water. When you come up on a calmer area, flip over and swim diagonally toward shore, with the flow of the current.

, Make as much noise and draw as much attention as you can  With this, would-be rescuers can not only keep you above the water, but pull you back in.


It's helpful to bring a life buoy (a.k.a a ring buoy). This way, you can both stay above the water, and get pulled back in.

, Chances are good that you will be absolutely fine, but an incident like this needs a medical examination. Usually a 911 (emergency) call will summon paramedics and EMT.


Long periods in cool or cold water put you at risk of hypothermia and frostbite.
You may have ingested a large amount of water, especially if you became panicky.
You may be in shock, psychologically or physically.

Seek medical immediately if you suspect a concussion, or other injury. Likewise if anyone is injured, or is unresponsive, call your local emergency services.

",How to Swim a 1650 Freestyle in a Meet," Yes, swimming an entire mile in a meet can be intimidating. However, you probably swim several, broken up miles every practice. Don't let the distance freak you out.;
, Try to take several deep breaths before beginning the race to calm your nerves. If you're nervous, your arms and legs will begin to hurt much earlier than they would otherwise.

, Every person has a different pace that they can hold for a long time. Find the pace that works best for you. It should be suitably fast, but not a sprint. If you have swum a 500, then just go a little bit slower.

, It is very easy to become terrified as your event comes closer. Just relax and don't worry.

, A counter counts your laps on a little plastic board, which they put in the water for you to see, so that you know when you're done. What, you didn't think you were going to count all that on your own, did you?

Swimming can take the place of other cardio workouts., While you may think that weight training could increase your lung capacity and the ability of your body to process oxygen, it might undermine your goal of staying underwater long. This is because the more muscle mass you have, the more oxygen your body will need.


Consider a light weight-training routine in which you tone your body and increase certain muscle groups – like your arms and legs. Targeting certain muscle groups could help you support the weight of an oxygen tank or other equipment (if you scuba)., One of the most important factors in staying underwater a long time is being able to relax while underwater. If you’re anxious or nervous, you will breathe deeper and use more air. As a result, spend as much time underwater as you can.Consider getting broad experience in different bodies of water. This way, you’ll be able to adjust quickly to new circumstances.
Try different activities in the water, like snorkeling or scuba diving.

, In the end, the more you move, the more air you’ll use and the quicker you’ll have to return to the surface. To avoid this, try to stay as still as possible. If you do have to move, do so deliberately and calmly. You’ll find that by staying still, you’ll be able to stay underwater longer., The closer you stay to the surface, the less air you’ll use. Because of this, avoid going deep as it will drain your air quicker.


If you’re in a swimming pool, stick to the shallow end and stay just below the surface.
If you’re in a natural body of water, try to hold on to something that keeps you near the surface. For example, try to hold on to a dock post., The second you start to feel light-headed, you should return to the surface. If you stay underwater without oxygen, you risk brain damage or drowning.Call emergency services immediately if someone loses consciousness while underwater.

, Instead of breathing regularly while you swim, consider holding your breath. Do this for a certain amount of time, like 30 seconds to 1 minute. This will slowly train your mind and body. To do this:


Warm up, without holding your breath, with a 400-meter swim.
Complete sets of 25-meter freestyle swims without breathing. Try to do 10 sets of these. Allow yourself 15 to 30 seconds to breathe in-between sets., Perhaps the best tool in training yourself to stay underwater is a timer. Use a timer to establish a baseline for how long you stay under. Then, time yourself every time you go underwater and try to beat your best time., After you have a baseline of how long you can stay underwater, you should challenge yourself to increase that time slowly. You’ll find that increasing the amount of time you’re underwater by a few seconds a week could have huge results over the course of many weeks or months.


Set a goal of increasing your time underwater by 5% to 10% a week or a month, depending on your ability. Remember, though, it is best to focus on slow progress.

, Take a deep breath through your mouth. Hold it for a second. Use your mouth to exhale for 10 seconds. Make sure your mouth isn’t open very much as you exhale. Do this for a minute and a half.


You can practice breathing while in the water or while on land.
Practice at least 3 times a week, until you are completely comfortable with deep breathing.
By practicing, you'll condition yourself to deep breathing and be able to increase the amount of time you stay underwater., Once you've mastered deep breathing, you can train yourself to alternate breathing and holding your breath. Start by holding your breath for 30 seconds and then breathing for a minute. Do this for a given amount of time.


Consider doing a 5-minute warmup workout before your breathing exercises. Try swimming or running for a few minutes. This will get your heart rate up and get you breathing faster."
"
Before you even think about performing complex movements, there is a lot of work to be done.,
Being relatively fit is also a good thing.,
Do you have solid core strength?,
Are your arms strong enough to withstand endless use?,
Flexibility is key to synchronized swimming.,
Now it is time to gather your much-needed supplies essential for synchronized swimming.,
It is now time to start swimming.,
If you are not able to find a coach, don't be afraid, jump in!,
Start by stretching, as outlined above.,
Let's start with the basic sculls.,
Support scull: You will do this scull when you are upside down underwater, but for now, stand in the shallow end.,
Now go out into deep water and go an inverted tuck, basically like a somersault position, but you are stopping halfway through.,
Eggbeater: Pretend you are sitting in a chair in the shallow end.,
Here is one basic move.,
Now that you now the basic skills of synchronized swimming, show your friends!",How to Start Synchronized Swimming," If you are not comfortable swimming in deep water, take a few swimming lessons. You do not want to be upside down and hitting your head in the shallow end, that's why a deep pool is essential.;
, Try running around the block three times a week or going on a treadmill is good. You don't have to be bodybuilder fit, but enough so you won't get tired after fifteen minutes.

, Movements upside down require a surprising amount of effort from your core. Crunches and ""the plank"" are good things to do.

, If not, using some light (no more than ten pound ones) weights is an excellent way to build up arm strength.

, You want to avoid injury as much as possible. Stretches such as lunges, pigeon, butterfly, straddle, pike position are the most influential. Synchronized swimmers often test their flexibility by using splits (left, right, and middle). Try attempting them, but don't force yourself to go flat. It takes years to get that amount of flexibility. Don't forget to stretch your arms as well.

, Here is a good list:

A good one-piece (no bikinis) swimsuit






1 swim cap (I prefer silicone caps myself, latex caps damage your hair, even though silicone is more expensive.)






At least one pair of goggles, as sometimes they break






1 or 2 nose plugs (I find it better to get the professional or competitive nose clips. They stay on your nose much better than the cheap plastic ones. Usually they are peachy-coloured, making them quite easy to lose.)






1 or 2 towels






1 pair of flips flops or 'Crocs' to wear on deck. (You can often pick up a virus from walking barefoot on the deck, resulting in nasty warts or infections.)






Shampoo, conditioner, or other hair products






1 hairbrush






1 large bag to carry everything in.







, The best way to give you a good introduction to synchronized swimming is to start with a qualified coach (not just the lifeguard at the local pool). Check with your region's local synchro organization. Often they will direct you to a club or coach.

, (Not literally!)

, Then, get into the pool and start swimming. You can do freestyle (front crawl), backstroke, breaststroke, fly, whatever gets you warmed up. A good rule is to stop after ten minutes.

, Headfirst scull: Lay your hands flat on the water, palms facing the bottom of the pool. They should be under your bum. Tilt your hands so your thumb is just in the water, and like a paddle push your hand outwards. Now tilt your hands so your pinkie finger is just in the water, and pull your hand back into you. Do this with both hands at the same time. To keep yourself stationary, don't point your fingers upwards, as it will make you move forwards. Sometimes, making a slight figure-eight will help people, too. You can do this scull laying on your back. This scull will work if you lay on your stomach, but scull underneath your chest, instead.

, Lay your hands in the water, palms facing upward towards the ceiling. Pull your hands towards you so that they are parallel with your side. You arms should be in a shape of an ""L"". Hold your hands flat and touch your pinkies together. You should feel like you are holding a tray and they are clanking together. Repeat to yourself, ""in, out, in, out"".

, Your shins should be breaking the surface. Lean back underwater so only your legs are tucked into the somersault. Try support scull then. You should feel your shins being lifted out of the water.

, Put your shoulders back and chin up. Remember the headfirst sculling I explained? Stick your hands on either side of you, so you are making an ""L"" with your arms in the water and start sculling. Now the hard part. With your left leg, make a counter-clockwise circle. With your right leg, make a clock-wise circle. Keep alternating leg circles, keeping a fast pace. You are now doing eggbeater! Remember to keep sculling at the same time. This is what swimmers use to keep themselves out of the water when they are lifting their arms out of the water.

, Lay on your back. Bend down so that your head and your feet meet. Next scull at your feet. Now push up so that your feet and your calves are in the air.

, Or better yet, keep trying to further expand your skills with a coach!

US residents in Iowa, Arizona, Montana, Louisiana or Washington cannot legally play FanDuel for cash. This is the condensed version, and you can find the more complete rules for eligibility on FanDuel’s Terms of Use webpage over at fanduel.com/terms., FanDuel supports iOS and Android, with an app in each operating system’s app store—iTunes and the Google Play Store, respectively. FanDuel also hosts useful links on their iPhone page (fanduel.com/iphone) and their Android page (fanduel.com/android). You can follow these links to bring you to the iTunes and Google Play Store using a browser.

If you are having problems downloading the FanDuel app on the Google Play Store, you can manually download the app from the FanDuel website. You can find it on fanduel.com/android-download, along with additional instructions from FanDuel on how to install it on your Android device. It is not possible to manually install the iOS version of the app.
The FanDuel Live Scoring app is different from the full FanDuel app. The latter lets you create lineups and participate in contests, while the former only tracks the stats of teams that you created beforehand.

, Once you have the app installed, find the app icon on your home screen or app drawer. It’s the gray icon with an italicized F and a football on it. Tap to launch the app., You can sign up on the FanDuel app itself by tapping “Join” when the app loads up. You’ll need to provide your full name, email address, username of choice along with a password for your account. If you have a promo code on hand, this is also where you can key it in for deposit bonuses.

If you already have an account with FanDuel, you can proceed to log in.

, If you already have a FanDuel account, you can type in your username and password on the startup screen. The app will remember your username and password the next time you start it up., If someone else shares your device or you’re borrowing someone else’s device to check your roster, you will need to log out after you’re done using it. You can do this by opening the app menu, which is accomplished by tapping the three green horizontal bars on the upper left-hand side of the home screen. This is where you’ll find the option to log your account out of the FanDuel app., When you first log on to your FanDuel profile, look at the upper left-hand corner of your screen. You will see three green horizontal lines. Tapping those lines will reveal a menu with various options—including options to add funds, withdraw funds, and review your transaction history. This is your sidebar menu., Once you’ve tapped the “Add Funds” option, you will be led to a screen where you’ll be asked how much you want to deposit. FanDuel has set the minimum deposit at $10.00 but gives you the option to deposit $25, $100 or $200 at a time. Select one of these options, then move on to the specific method of paying for the funds., FanDuel accepts payments from PayPal and most major credit cards—Visa, American Express, and Discovery being the most prominent. If you pick PayPal, you’ll be led to a screen where you’ll have to tap in your PayPal username and password. Follow all the instructions on the screen, confirm the purchase, and then you’ll be returned to the FanDuel app. If you choose to pay with your credit card, you will be led to a screen where you’ll enter the cardholder name, the card number, the expiration date of the card, the CVV, the province and the zip code. Be sure that all information you put in here is exactly the same as the numbers and letters on your card.

There is a waiting period before your funds are transferred to your account. This period varies between providers, although PayPal is usually able to make transfers within 24 hours.

, You also earn FanDuel Points each time you enter a game, win or lose. Earning enough FDPs allows you to enter contests that you would normally have to pay for, as well as a chance to enter a FanDuel freeroll contest. Both options allow you to join contests with cash prizes without actually having to buy into them., Once you’ve installed the app on your mobile device of choice, the next thing you want to do is pick the fantasy sports you want to participate in. FanDuel supports leagues for the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, CFB, and CBB, though only leagues with open games will be available to participate in. You’ll find a list of available leagues on the lobby screen, which is the first screen you’ll see when you log into the FanDuel app. Once you pick a sport, you will then pick the date and time for the games you want to base your fantasy sports competitions on., Immediately after selecting the games you want to play in, you will be led to a screen with a list of contest types. Simply tap the contest mechanics you wish to work with and you should be good.


Featured contests are contests being promoted by FanDuel.

League contests have multiple prize positions that dole out prizes that go up in increments for those who place accordingly.

50/50 where the upper half of the participants receives double the fees they paid to join contests. This is also called double-ups.

Tournament is similar to League contests except there are a lot more participants and significantly larger prize pools.

Head to Head is a competition between two players, with the winner taking all of the advertised prize money.

Multiplier winners will receive their prize entry multiplied by a certain number, usually between five to ten times what they paid to join.

, Once you select the type of contests you want to join, you will be led to another screen where you will review the individual contests that are up on FanDuel. Review the list of available contests, and select the ones that you want to participate in by tapping them.

You can sort contests by name, by the number of entries, by the size of the contest, by the entry fee, or by the prize payout.
Once you select a contest, you can learn more about its specifics by tapping the small green “i” button on the upper right-hand side of the screen. This will show you more information about the participants, the specific games covered by the contest, the prizes to be won, and with the rules of the contest.
A blue “g” icon near the contest’s name means that the contest is guaranteed. Guaranteed contests will continue even when not enough entries join in to fill the contest. By contrast, not guaranteed contests will be cancelled if the slots are not all filled by the time the games start.
An orange “m” icon near the contest’s name means that the contest is multi-entry. This means that you can place multiple entries into the contest, which is useful when you want to improve your chances of winning by entering multiple lineups.

, This comes after selecting a contest to join, and where you will be presented with a list of positions to fill up/tapping each position will present you with an extensive list of players that will be available for that specific position. Select players to fill up the slots on your fantasy lineup by tapping the plus sign beside their names and portraits.

Each sport has its own rules and regulations covering how you shape your lineup, but a few general rules apply to all sports. First off, you need to hire players while staying under the indicated salary limit (e.g., $35,000 for the MLB; $60,000 for the NFL). A player’s Fantasy Points Per Game (FPPG) score will also be a useful basis for formulating your initial lineup.
You can also check out a lot of useful information on a player by tapping his portrait. Doing so will lead you to a screen where you can review a summary of his overall performance, a log of his performance in recent games, and a news portal that not only presents the latest updates on the player’s status but a brief analysis to help you make a more informed decision.

, The FanDuel home screen has three sections where you can review upcoming contests that you have rosters lined up for, live contests that are going on at the moment, and recent contests that you’ve participated in. Tapping the “Upcoming,” “Live,” and “Recent” buttons on the home screen will allow you to review the contests and the lineups you drafted for each of them. Use this to have an easier time staying updated on the status of your players before the contest begins, tracking how well your rosters are performing in ongoing games, and reviewing their post-game statistics., If you have won money from your games or simply wish to pull money out of your account, open the sidebar. Do this by tapping the three green horizontal bars on the upper left-hand side of the lobby screen., You will be led to a screen giving you a choice between withdrawing money via a PayPal transfer or via a paper check. Select which option you want to work with., Selecting this option will by default withdraw funds to the same PayPal account you used to deposit cash into the account. If you don’t have a PayPal account linked to your FanDuel account, or wish to use a separate PayPal account to receive those funds, FanDuel will perform additional security checks. Provide the requested information as necessary and submit it all in order to get your PayPal withdrawal request started up. The transfer should be completed within 48 hours or in the next business day should the request be made during a weekend., Selecting this option will lead you to a screen with boxes requesting your name, the amount you want to withdraw and your complete address. Provide the information required and hit “Submit” to begin the withdrawal process.

If you plan to withdraw earnings in excess of $250 using paper checks, FanDuel will ask for a valid mailing address as well as you social security number. This is for both security and tax-related purposes. Paper checks will need 7-10 days to clear out. You may need to submit a ticket to FanDuel’s support pageindicating your intent to withdraw using checks if you encounter troubles withdrawing cash via the FanDuel app."

Keep loving fantasy football.",How to Win at the DraftKings App Fantasy Football," Being intimately familiar with the ins and outs of your chosen football league is the first step to winning at fantasy football. The more games you watch, the more information you’ll have to work with in your fantasy football league.

Learn to watch with an eye for player performance. Take note of players that got lots of yards in the games, who are able to consistently generate points due to great performance instead of dumb luck, and you’ll see which players have the potential to bring in the most fantasy football points in the long run.
Stay moderately sober while watching. DraftKings will automate the scoring for you, but you’ll actually need to understand what you’re watching if you want to grab information that’ll help you win at fantasy football.;
, There’s a DraftKings rule set for the NFL (draftkings.com/help/nfl) and there’s a rule set for the CFB (draftkings.com/help/cfb). Study them so that you know which specific player actions will translate to points on the DraftKings app. This will also help you pick players that will haul in the most points for your DraftKings lineups, especially since teams that win the NFL don’t necessarily translate to winning DraftKings contests.

A distinct scoring system for defensive plays is the biggest difference between the NFL and the CFB in the scoring system for DraftKings. DraftKings awards points for defensive actions in the NFL, such as blocked punts and preventing the attacking team from scoring any points at all. On the other hand, DraftKings will only dole out points for offensive actions in the CFB, such as passing touchdowns or rushing/receiving/passing yards.
Note that you get 3 bonus points whenever a player on your lineup passes 300 yards, receiving 100-plus yards, and rushing 100-plus yards. This is one reason to invest any surplus salary on elite players who manage to consistently reach these yards throughout their games.

, One of the biggest mistakes you can make in fantasy football is to form a lineup based not on their in-game performance but on your personal preferences. If you want a fantasy lineup that will actually win, then you need to set aside both your fan favorites and despised rivals. Pick players that will perform best given the circumstances at any given game week., Your objective is not to pick a lineup that will win the league but a lineup that will bring in the most points. Winning at fantasy football involves picking a lineup that will accrue the most points in any given game, with individual performance determining the points that will pop up on your DraftKings app., Fantasy points per game (FPPG) and opponent rank versus position (OPRK) are good reference points for drafting your initial lineup. From here on out though, you need to do research on the players you are considering for your fantasy lineup. A quick Google search will lead you to various articles and opinion pieces on that particular player; offering even more insight on his potential performance in future games., This will give you enough time to modify your team should something unforeseen happen to your lineup, like injuries or transfers. This will also help prevent you from submitting an early lineup and then totally forgetting about it until after the game is over. Submitting your lineup around an hour or even half an hour before the games will also serve to hype you up so that you play close attention to the performance of your picks. DraftKings will close lineups five minutes before the game is scheduled to begin. Finalizing your lineup about an hour or half an hour before the game starts is doable if you’ve done your research beforehand to confidently lock-in your lineup before the time limit is up.
You will also have the option to make late swaps in mid-afternoon games and beyond. This will help you fill out positions that were emptied out due to the player not being able to play for one reason or another. Late swaps also let you balance risk to either recover from unexpectedly weak performances or switch to safer picks if your lineup has performed much better than you anticipated., When you finalize your lineup, you absolutely must watch your players as they play their respective games. Compare their in-game performance to the stats on the DraftKings app, and you’ll be able to better determine if you’ll pick that player up in future games or if you’ll drop him for another, better-performing player.

Be especially mindful of fatigue and injuries accrued during games. An injured player or one that has already been through multiple games will doubtlessly perform less optimally than when they are in tip-top condition.
Again, note how consistently they perform in their matches. A player that accrues points through consistent yards or tackles is a more valuable than a player who scores a lucky touchdown only once and then does little else throughout the game.

, Sleepers are players that perform surprisingly well despite being ranked low and ignored by most fantasy football managers. If you successfully pick a sleeper that nobody else picked up, then you stand to gain more points than your competitors.

This step involves an absurd amount of research, gut instinct and a dash of luck. If you commit the time and the effort though, you’ll eventually start picking up patterns in player performance (and even player attitude) that may indicate their sleeper status.

, The free contests cost nothing to enter and are the perfect training grounds for you to test out your lineups without having to worry about losing money or losing face., Remember that fantasy football is a game not just of the mind but of the heart. Have fun picking out your fantasy lineup on the DraftKings app, and you’ll find it a lot easier to skim through all the stats and numbers to pick that lineup that’ll bring you victory on game-day!"

, Depending on the time of year, there are many different options to pick from. It is probably best to stay away from creating multiple lineups in multiple sports in one night; this will take your attention away from detail. One lineup per night in only one sport will allow the most focus and produce the best result. The different sports options are:


Baseball
Basketball
Football
Hockey
Golf
Soccer
College football and basketball
Mixed martial arts
Nascar

, There are thousands of contests for each sport. Each contest is different in its own way. For instance, each one has different entry fees, different amounts of people allowed in and different payouts to different positions. The secret is in picking the perfect contest that can be a lock. If you're really interested in gaining small amounts of money over long periods of time, enter double-up contests. Normally the top half of people double the money they put in.

, The biggest downfall amongst daily fantasy sports players is entering the contests that have a million dollar payout to first place.The chance that would ever happen to you is slim to none so it's best to stay away from those. The best ones to enter are anywhere from $1 to $5. This way, if you don't end up winning any money with your lineup for that night, you are not too deep in the hole.

, The smaller contests normally are the safest bet. Anywhere from 15 to 500 people is a good amount. The larger contests feature so many people that even if your lineup is solid, there is a very good chance you'll be lost in the chaos of all the other lineups as there is a far greater chance of many more people coming up with a better combination that you did., A classic mistake of many people is spending too much money in the same night, whether it's entering the same lineup in as many contests as possible or creating multiple lineups and inserting them into many different contests. This is a one-way ticket to losing all of your money and giving yourself a gambling addiction., Another mistake of people is creating multiple lineups. This will only cause you harm. People who make multiple lineups lose focus and are unable to come up with a winning lineup in their mind so they make as many as possible in hopes that at least one will pay-out. The chances of winning are actually much greater if you focus on the lone lineup you created because you will have devoted all of your time into it., Making a lineup every night will not only get you addicted, but it will decrease your chances of winning money. Many nights will only feature two or three games in some sports, in which case you should stay away. With less possible combinations of players for a lineup, you will be forced to pick players you may have never heard of and most of the time it will not end well., The fun part has arrived. Each player is given a price value and depending on the sport, you will have a certain number at each position to pick. Each contest gives you ""$50,000"" and you must create a lineup using that money. The best players are worth the most so you can't just stack the deck. However, it's always a good idea to spend big in a few positions, especially for a player who is a lock to get you a lot of points.

, Always do as much research as possible before creating your lineup. Home teams are generally a safe bet as well as players on particularly good teams. Always look to see the team they are facing off against as well. When a really good team is playing a really bad team, it may not be a bad idea to pick a couple players from the good team, especially if some of them are cheap. The cheap players are the most important because they are what allow you to spend big in other positions. Always pick cheap players from good teams. There are many other things that can help out your lineup, the question is are you willing to do the work?"

Price isn't everything.",How to Win at Premier League Fantasy Football," Before the season starts, ensure that you are up to date on all transfer news and pre-season player performance. Selecting the right in-form mid-price player at the start of the season may make all the difference by the end of the season.;
, This includes transfers, injuries and which players are on form. If you know which players are playing, and playing well, you can instantly gain an advantage over other players who may be left with players in their teams who are simply warming the bench.

, This refers to both price and teams. Teams: Selecting your FPL team from a range of teams ensures you are well covered in the event that one side does particularly well or badly in any given weekend. Price: Ensure that the selection of 1-3 high price players is not at the expense of the rest of your team. It is important that not only 1-3 players are relied upon to score all of your points. If there is an injury, or if the players form drops, it can hurt your points in a big way.

, While it is important to try to cover most big teams in attack / defense, you can reap large returns if you know what games lay ahead and plan your team appropriately. It is possible to pick out teams with good chances of clean sheets or goals and bring those players in without too many points hits for transfers. This is made easier by websites that provide a statistical rating of fixture difficulty.

, The defenders and goalkeepers get points for keeping clean sheets, but it is too much of a gamble to have two players from one team (unless both are very cheap, keep regular clean sheets or you have identified a team with a particularly ‘easy’ run of fixtures). For this reason you should spread the defenders and goalkeepers across a variety of teams who keep cleans sheets, which ultimately should meet the points haul is consistent.

, While the majority of points in the defense are scored via clean sheets and great defensive contributions, attacking defenders will provide much greater returns for value. Look for defenders that play more of an attacking game. These are typically those that play right / left back and attack up the flank.

, Make sure you have one good attacking player for each big team; this means that if any team scores a large number of goals in a match you have one player who is bound to have gained you good points for goals and assists.

, It is often the case that players are played out of position on an extended basis. These players may offer excellent returns if they are played in a more attacking role than others in a similar position. A defender playing as a mid-fielder or mid-fielder playing as a forward will generally provide far greater points returns than the comparative players in that position.

, The better websites will give you a statistical analysis of player performance, form and value for money. In addition to the valuable advice they provide, the comments sections are a great opportunity to test your plans and have other experienced players evaluate your team for personalized advice.

, But it can be an indicator. If a particular player’s price is increasing it may be an indicator that they are in-form or have a great run of fixtures. To stay ahead of these trends, you can follow websites which update on a daily basis. That being said, price may be deceptive. Players with a high price tag may not necessarily give the best returns. Stay on the alert for low-mid range players that score regularly and provide the differential on other teams. In this regard it is important to maintain the research effort you put in to start with.

You should definitely swap out a pick if you learn that he was injured, is facing suspension for an offense, is being traded at the last minute, or basically learn about anything that causes a player in your lineup to be unable to participate or perform well in the coming game. Even foul weather could mess up your fantasy lineup’s performance if your team is suddenly unable to play.
, If you’ve had a pretty bad day and your picks are lagging behind your competitors, you could switch to a high-risk, high-reward lineup. Players with a reputation for suddenly breaking out and scoring big will thus be useful when you find yourself in the underdog situation. If they go bust, then you don’t stand to lose much since you’re already at the bottom. But if they manage to grab a lot of yards, then you stand to regain ground and catch up to your competitors who played it too safely.

In cases like these, you’ll want to focus on your wide receivers (WR) and tight ends (TE). Spending more for ‘elite’ players on these positions will give you the chance to gain a score boost to get back in the game. This is especially useful in head-to-head matches where you have only one opponent to deal with.

, If your team has been doing very well and you’re taking a large lead against your competitors, then you will want a lineup that is stable and brings in a steady stream of points. In order to do that, you can make late swaps to invest in a good running back (RB) that will bring in the points at a more reliable rate. This does not mean that you should be complacent about your picks though. As mentioned earlier, an underdog who suddenly switches to a high-risk, high-reward lineup could catch up to you if your team doesn’t earn enough points to keep their lead., The FLEX is an ideal position to increase the volatility of your lineup or keep it down to more stable levels. If you are in dire need of points, you can pick up an extra WR or TE to increase the maximum number of points you can earn. If you are enjoying a surplus of points, switch to an RB so that you’ll keep earning points and reduce the chances that you lose your comfortable lead should a WR or TE not find a chance to score big.You can also use the FLEX to hedge your current position. This means spreading your lineup in a way where you have players that can reliably bring in points and another set of players that have the potential to score big. Even if your high-risk players bomb, the rest of your lineup can bring in enough points to keep you in the game. If your high-risk players do pull through though, you can expect a substantial lead over your opponents. This offers a good balance between stability and variance if you’re in a good position and want to prevent your competitors from pulling nasty upsets to steal your lead., If you have access to information that goes against commonly held beliefs and expectations, then the late swap is one of the best ways to put that knowledge to good use. You can refine your predictions based on the performance of your lineup in the early games and then act on the information you possess as you see fit. If you are able to handle this right, you could find yourself shooting up the leaderboards since few (if any) other people are using your lineup. On the other hand, you could also find yourself irredeemably shot down if your educated guesses don’t work out in the end. "

, These are usually writers who have strong connections to the team or to sources that follow the team. You do not need to follow everything they say, but they can give you a strong vibe on a player who was not drafted in your fantasy draft., Sometimes a player can come down with a minor injury causing another fantasy owner to become impatient and waive him.

Playing in a league allows you to build relationships and camaraderie, as well as providing an extra incentive to choose your players wisely. There are several types of leagues to consider, so try to pick one that fits in with your commitment, your experience, and your seriousness.;
, In head-to-head play, your team matches up against a different team each week, and the team that receives the most points is declared the winner. In a total points league, teams accrue points throughout the season on an ongoing basis. At the end of the regular season, teams with the best won/loss records meet in the playoffs to decide an eventual champion.


Head-to-head leagues are fun to play with your friends, so you can have fun trash-talking during the week, leading up to an end-of-season playoff among the teams with the best records.
Points leagues are good if you like watching the NFL games over the course of the weekend, giving you more stake in the action when your players are playing and keeping track of the individual players. It's better if you have less time to commit to the season.

, You can choose between various ways of accumulating points for the performance of the players you draft, as well as the structure of the roster. Most normally you'll play the head coach, playing individual players and picking the best guys to give you the best chance of winning.


In terms of scoring, most leagues employ a ""points for reception"" scoring style, which gives points not just for points scored by individual players, but for stats like receptions, yardage gained, and sacks. The score-tallying won't affect the way you ""play"" fantasy football, but it might affect the way you choose players to play week-to-week.IDP, Individual Defensive Players, options utilize defensive players on an individual basis, as well as using team defensive units. Other leagues simply use team defenses. The additional players and positions to fill require owners in an IDP league to do a lot more research to determine which defensive players to draft and when to draft them, and makes it more difficult to determine which players and positions are most important. However, these leagues can be rewarding to win for big football fans.

, You can sign up for leagues via ESPN and Yahoo, probably the two most popular ways to play. Go to their Fantasy Football tab and search for open standard leagues that are free, or contact friends that play in leagues you'd like to join and get the administrator to give you an invitation.You can start new leagues, but try to get a little experience in different types of playing and play a few fantasy seasons before you try to start a league of your own.

, Just like regular football, fantasy football leagues hold drafts each season. Players can be ""dropped"" to become free agents, and trades are possible, but for the most part you'll be assembling your team from the players you draft, so it helps to have some familiarity with the big names and talents. There are two basic types of drafts:


In a serpentine draft, owners take turns drafting players in the interest of fairness. For instance, the owner who picks first in odd rounds picks last in even rounds, and so on.
In an auction draft, each owner has a predetermined, imaginary budget to spend on players. Players are listed auction-style, going to the team of the owner who bids highest.

, A mistake a lot of fantasy rookies make is selecting their favorite quarterback right out of the gate and then moving on to other positions. By the time they get around to picking a backup, there's only the 3rd-stringer who played college ball at Southeastern Louisiana Tech left. Oops.Draw up a draft-day cheat sheet. Your cheat sheet should list your ideal picks, as well as back-ups and long-shots. Cover it as well as you can during the draft and keep a running tally of picks you grab and how much money you have left, as well as your ideal picks that get snatched up by someone else. For instance, you could have a few highlighters on-hand to mark who gets what.

, Shake up your roster by drafting a few rookies who could go big. Part of the fun of fantasy football is seeing a sleeper player suddenly score huge points out of nowhere.


Save your hometown heroes until you've got the major choices figured out. If you're a big Dallas Cowboys fan and you want to pick a bunch of their players, you might get into a kind of trap when they all have a bye-week at the same time. Be wary of picking too many players from the same team.
Get the best players at the high-stat positions figured out. Remember, you're not making a real football team, so you don't really need role players. They help, but you want guys who are going to build lots of stats.

, In a fantasy football league, a free agent is any player who is not currently on a league team (i.e., did not get picked in the draft or was dropped by a team at some point throughout the season). As the season goes on, a player's real-life performance might inspire you to pick him up as a free agent for your fantasy league. Generally, free agent picks are submitted after the weekly Monday night football game and processed later in the week.


If more than one team wants to pick up a free agent, the player goes to the team with the highest waiver wire ranking. Waver wire ranking is determined by a variety of factors, including win-loss record and the number of free agents that team has already added. After adding a player to your team from free agency you go back to the bottom of the waiver wire list. Different leagues might have different methods for calculating these rankings.

, Just as in regular football, fantasy owners can trade players. Some leagues have specific trade deadlines established. They may also have all the owners in the league vote on whether or not a trade can proceed.


Trades within fantasy leagues can be controversial, and may require the intervention of a fantasy trade referee. There are several trade referee websites where an objective third-party will rule on the validity and fairness of a certain trade.

, From week to week during the NFL season, you'll be able to slot players in all the major positions, picking your starters for the week. Their performance in their game will gain you points in your game.


Make sure the player is available. Usually, these players will be labeled with an ""A"" for active. If they're injured or their team is on bye, they'll be inactive and you'll have to replace them with other players.One particularly helpful stat to take a look at when you're trying to decide which of your QBs and which of your RBs to play, is the strength of the player's opponent for the next week. If you've got the undeniably-great Peyton Manning on your roster, but also the equally-great Tom Brady, see who each of them are playing that week. If Manning's playing the best team in the nation, but Brady's got a team in the gutter, it would help to take that into account.

, Most leagues have a predetermined number of players an owner must have on a roster, and each player is assigned a position. You might also have ""starters,"" which must be used in each game, as well as players that you ""bench"" for specific games. Owners are required to choose their starters for each week's games before a deadline.

, Watch the game and see how your players do! Each individual league will have its own scoring system. However, one thing remains the same: the real-life actions of your players on the field that week will determine how many points your team earns compared to your opponent's team. When the day of games is over, you'll be able to log into your league page and see how you held up.

, If you've got a good starting line-up that's working well for you, what are you gonna do in a couple weeks when your starting skills-position players are all going to be out? Who's going to back them up? Draft a team that won't be decimated on one bad bye week and start planning now for those gap weeks. Make sure you have sufficient back-ups without overlapping byes.

, As the draft goes on, have a running list of players you would consider trading or for whom you would trade. For a player you really want on your roster, develop a killer trade strategy beforehand in case he goes to someone else.

, Fantasy football basically gives your regular NFL obsession an added dimension by giving you more of an attachment to the individual players. You'll suddenly have a big stake in how the Seahawks play if you've got Golden Tate on your fantasy football team, even if you've never been to Seattle. Watch, check the stats, and have fun."

Once you do this, pick the date and the start time of the specific games you want.
, Public leagues are open to anyone who wants to join the football contests you’ll create. Private leagues, on the other hand, are invitation-only contests. DraftKings lets you invite other players to private contests through email, the DraftKings friends list, or through other leagues.

All entry fees will be refunded if the league’s slots are not filled up. If you create a 50-man league, those 50 spots have to be filled up. Otherwise the league will not run and all entry fees will be returned to those who joined., Leagues can vary in size anywhere between three and a hundred people at a time. You can increase the size of the league in increments of one up to 20 (e.g. 3, 4, 5, 6… 18, 19 and then 20). After 20, the league sizes will increase in increments of five up to 40 (e.g. 20, 25, 30, 35 and then 40). You will then have the option to increase the size to 50, 75 and finally 100., You can create a free league that costs no money to join. You can also pick one of the following entry fees: $1.00, $2.00, $5.00. $10.00, $20.00, $50.00, $109.00, $215.00, $530.00, $1060.00, $5300.00 and finally $10600.00., You can select between Winner Takes All, 50/50, and Top 2, 3 and 5 Players.

Winner Take All is where the highest-scoring player takes the entire prize pool.
50/50 will divide the league into two by score – the top half and the bottom half. The top half will receive double the entry fees they paid as a reward (i.e. a winning player will receive $40 if he paid a $20 entry fee and was able to score well enough to place on the upper half of the league).
The Top 2, 3 and 5 Player prize structures will award the prize pool to the top 2, 3 and 5 highest-scoring players. For example, setting a Top 5 prize for a 100-man league with a $1,000 prize pool means that the five highest-scoring players will each receive $200, which is the $1,000 prize pool divided by five.

, This is pretty straightforward. Just give your fantasy league a name of your choosing, and tap in a message. The message is optional though, and you can skip it if you want to., Once you create a league, you will be reserved a spot in the league you just created. You will then be directed to a screen where you can create a lineup from scratch or import one if you’ve already created a lineup in advance."

FanDuel contests draw players from all the games that will be going down in a day and will award fantasy points based on their performance. If you put your personal preferences above the hard numbers that the players are generating in their games, then you are all but guaranteed to lose against other managers who are not so discerning about their fantasy football lineups., FanDuel uses a daily contest system, not a weekly or season-long system. This means that every FanDuel contest will base their results on a single day’s matches. This is relevant to your lineup because you want to maximize points for that match you are participating in. An elite quarterback who scores brilliantly during the season will not generate points for you if an injury forces him to skip the game on your contest’s date. In short, you will want to draft a lineup that has the most potential to score the highest on a day that you hold your contests in., The way a particular contest determines pays out winners is a huge factor in determining your overall strategy in picking a lineup. There is no guarantee of victory, of course, but adopting the right strategy will help increase your win rates in the long run. You will want to swing the odds in your favor, and picking the right lineup for each prize structure will help you do just that.


Head-to-head and 50/50 contests will pay out cash to players who manage to beat either their opponent or half of their total opponents in a particular contest. Their prize structures thus encourage forming a lineup that is able to generate a decent amount of points in any given week—a low-risk “high floor” lineup, as the term goes. The payout is low, so you’ll want to win as often as possible with lineups that are able to generate enough points to beat out the opposition. This is because these kinds of contests pay the same amount of cash whether you gain a one-point or one hundred-point advantage over your opponents.
By contrast, league and tournament contests will only reward players who manage to place on the top spots of their contests. These kinds of contests have prize structures that pay out big for lineups that are able to score the highest. Picking “high ceiling” lineups for these contests are thus recommended, as you only need to win once to win big., This is because FanDuel takes a more balanced approach to scoring—awarding 1 point per 25 yards instead of per 20 yards, 4 points instead of 6 per touchdown, -1 instead of -2 points per interception, and 0.5 points instead of 1 point per reception. Going elite-heavy and filling the rest of your lineup with low-scoring unknowns in FanDuel will thus reward you with less points than when you seed your lineup with one or two elites and the rest with decent players., Low-scoring unknowns and high-scoring unknowns are two different breeds of football players. The latter type are called sleepers, and finding them before other FanDuel competitors pick up on their potential will allow you to create a high-scoring lineup without maxing out your salary cap too soon. This is why it is important to use the FanDuel app during your spare time to review the stats and latest updates on players that you are not quite familiar with. Simply browse through the available players while reviewing their performances in past games, and you raise your chances of finding sleepers that you can use to augment your FanDuel lineups. , You can find a lot of information within the FanDuel app, but third-party sources provide tools that can help you learn more about your potential picks. These can help you spot a ton of useful information at a glance, from a player’s Opponent Ranking (OPRK) in coming matches to a consistency calculator to show you how the player has performed throughout his career.

Rotowire’s NFL Optimizer toolis useful for making informed guesses. Its money-line definition and point spread tools help you out by projecting how well a player’s team will do in their upcoming game.
FFToday’s Consistency Calculatoris best used to see how a specific player has been doing in his career—and whether that player is surging up to elite status or slipping in performance as the years grind on by.
FantasyPros has a nifty Value Plays tool.This tool will be useful in determining whether a specific player is worth the salary that he demands when it comes to your FanDuel lineup.

, The last thing you can do to create better-performing lineups is to objectively assess their performance after a game ends. This is because the occasional victory can mask your burgeoning losses in the long run. The opposite is also true, where multiple defeats can discourage you and prevent you from realizing that those few big wins bring in more cash than you pull out.


Create one worksheet to list down your lineups. List down the players of your lineup and use a system to assign them codes. One simple but useful system is to use the date and time of the games that your lineup participated in. For example, you can use the code “100415_01” to designate the first lineup that you picked to play on October 04, 2015. Add a line detailing your explanation for picking this lineup to help refresh your memory when you review the spreadsheet.

Create another worksheet for performance and accounting purposes. List down the code of your lineup (e.g., “100415_01”) in one column, then the total fantasy points that lineup generated in another column, the entry fee you paid in the third column and the total winnings you gained in the fourth column. Use these numbers to determine just how effective your lineups are, and whether your strategies are working or if you need to tweak them for future contests.

Shift your strategy with a late swap if you need to.",How to Draft Your Fantasy Football Team in the DraftKings App," When you first create a fantasy football team on the DraftKings app, you will see three statistics for each player: fantasy points per game (FPPG) opponent rank vs position (OPRK), and the salary, or the cost, to pick a player for your draft. High FPPG numbers are an early indicator of that player’s ability to score points as determined by DraftKings. Green OPRK ranks mean that a player’s opponent in the coming match is expected to fare poorly against that pick, while a red OPRK rank signals that the potential pick may not fare well against his opponent. Picks with high salaries tend to perform better, which is why players are willing to pay more for them.;
, FPPG, OPRK, and salaries will only serve as a rough guide for you to draft your team. In-depth research, however, will reveal key differences between seemingly equal players. When researching your players, keep an eye on the following points:


Injuries. Find another pick if the player incurred an injury in practice or in recent games that could affect their performance.
Consistency. A player who is able to gain more points through consistently executing successful passes and receptions will be much more valuable than another player who scored one or two lucky touchdowns.
Receptions. DraftKings puts a lot of points on receptions, so a player that is able to grab a lot of receptions in most of his games has the potential to bring in more points for your team., The scores of your players are not affected by the success or defeat of their league team. The team of your quarterback (QB) could be clobbered at the NFL or CFB, but your QB of choice could still bring in huge points on DraftKings if he’s been consistently passing more than 300 yards in his games. This is why the individual performance of your pick’s plays is more important in the DraftKings scoring system than the performance of the team.


Do away with fandoms and rivalries for the meantime. A fantasy football manager who picks (or ignores) players out of passion instead of their performance will almost always lose against another player who does otherwise.

, There’s a big difference between the scoring system DraftKings uses for the NFLand the CFB. DraftKings rewards points for defensive plays in the NFL, while only offensive plays will be scored in the CFB. This means that while you need to consider both offensive and defensive capabilities for NFL contests, you only need to look for CFB players that excel at offense if you want to maximize points on the DraftKings app.

, A player generates 3 bonus points for 300+ passed yards, 100+ received yards, or 100+ rushed yards. These bonus points are usually earned by ‘elite’ players that demand a high salary in exchange for their strong performances. If you are able to stay within the $50,000 budget though, elites who can consistently bring in these bonus points could mean the difference between victory and defeat in contests.


This is especially important to remember when filling up your FLEX position. Paying good money for a high-performing wide receiver (WR) or tight end (TE) has the potential to generate a lot of points on top of the WR or TE you picked up for their default positions in the team.

, DraftKings lets players swap players in their lineups even after the first game of the day kicks off. This is an invaluable tool for the proactive fantasy football manager, as it lets you sub out underperforming players for high-risk, high-reward ones that could make up for the lost points. Late swaps also let you switch to safer, more reliable options if you have already achieved a comfortable lead over your opponents."

, Free leagues or low entry fees are excellent for new players seeking to create a casual and experimental environment while drafting teams for each of the game days.

This is easily done as your mobile device should have a browser built into the system., Once you’ve logged into the FanDuel website using a browser, tap the “Create Contest” on the upper right-hand side of the Lobby screen. Select the specific league you want to draw your games (NFL or CFB), set the date and time for your contest. Select the “League” contest type, set the contest to “Friends Only,” select the size of the league, set the entry fee and set the prize structure. Name your contest if you wish. You will then be moved to a screen where you’ll draft your roster, although you don’t need to do this at that moment. You can form your team any time before the games start, but the important thing is that the contest has been created and you can start inviting people to join in., If you want to create a private league between friends, they need to be signed up on FanDuel. You then need to send out invites to their FanDuel accounts once the contest has been created for them to be added to your friends list., FanDuel will cancel any privately created contest if the entries are not all filled. This is why it is very important that the people you invite to the league will be able to fill their lineups before the game is scheduled to begin. If someone is unable to do so and the games are about to begin, you can email FanDuel support and make a request to open up your contest to the public in order to fill the slots. Or you can cancel the slots and adjust your league stats accordingly., FanDuel focuses on daily games, not weekly or season-long leagues. This means that you’ll have to manually track each individual participant’s scores. This is best done using a spreadsheet set up to automatically calculate scores for you., List down the names of all your participants in the first column. On the second column, jot down the total points each participant’s fantasy lineup has accrued during the day’s games. Copy this format from the third column onwards. This will give you a record for everyone’s performance throughout the season’s games.

You can also calculate the average rank of each participant accumulates over multiple game days. This statistic will be pretty useful for determining the overall winner in your custom-built league by determining who finishes the highest once the league is done and over with.
Use colors to make the spreadsheet easier to understand and more interesting to check out. One example is to shade the cell one color (light gold) to indicate the overall winner of the week, another color (light silver) for the second-placer and another color (light bronze) for the third-placer.
It is also highly recommended that you incentivize players to keep participating each week. You can do this by offering an additional prize for top-scoring players, like treating him or her to free beers on top of the cash prize gained by winning the day’s fantasy contest. You can go the opposite route by having the last-placer treat everyone with beers. These incentives will keep players interested in the league while doing their best to formulate a high-scoring lineup.

Don't waste a penny on newsstand rankings. These are published in May and by the time your draft rolls around, they're as good as obsolete. Instead, peruse local newspaper sports sections during training camp: you'll find more injury updates than you know what to do with, and you'll find super-sleepers. For instance, for news on the Vikings, do a Google search for ""Minneapolis"" and ""newspaper"". You'll find the Star Tribune and Pioneer Press, both of which could be invaluable. For example, this method was used for drafting Nate Burleson, a truly worthy 4th WR find.
Watch the runs. A run means, everyone starts drafting from the same position. For example, say you plan on taking your starting quarterback in round 4, and in round 3 there becomes a run on quarterbacks, alter your draft strategy and grab him then.
Don't ever draft a defense or a kicker before you've filled most of your skill positions. Defense is basically luck of the draw and week to week match-ups. Consider drafting 16 defenses, that is, draft a moderate team, and then wait a week. Find out who is playing a team with a green quarterback or weak offense and then pick them up. You can find a ripe match-up every week.
As for kickers, just grab a dome booter and you'll be fine.
Find the contract kids. Every year players playing out the last year of their contract perform at much higher levels than their counterparts who've signed fat salary sheets.
Read How to draft your fantasy football team.;
, Even if you're playing in a league with friends only, the money aspect makes it much more fun and exciting. It doesn't need to be a lot, just a few dollars.

, If you have picked 3-5, trade down. You'll feel much better about taking two players back to back than you will seeing your favorites fly off the board every other pick.


Wait a few weeks before dropping or trading away players you picked within the first 10 rounds of the draft and be patient with wide receivers who tend to post inconsistent numbers from week to week. Players suffering from an entire season's injury are an exception.

, Take your league scoring system, grab a calculator and a paper box score section. Find out if your league is skewed to quarterbacks or running backs. Chances are it's biased, even if the creator doesn't know it. If it creates parity under center, then hold off on your signal caller and go to the ground or vice versa. This is an unbelievably important task. There are even services online that will take your league scoring system and analyze it for you.

, Don't let one weird game or one week take out four or five players. If you load up with Bengals and Ravens, and they play a game that goes low because of snow, you are dead. Essentially, keep your eggs in many different baskets.

, Free agents are players who don't belong to any of your league's teams. Free agents become available on a Tuesday, on a first come, first served basis. Use your football news knowledge to claim good free agents. You'll need to drop a player or two to make room for them on your roster but it's worth it if you spot a good player.


Trade with other teams to obtain key players to fill gaps in your roster. Be aware that trades need to be submitted to the commissioner before a set deadline, and they can be rejected sometimes.

, The clincher is complacency. If you've got it, you're in trouble. Recognize when your draft is a bit of a crap shoot – the key is recognizing mistakes and acting on them, as well as being ahead of your opponents by knowing the players and game schedule well. If someone goes down early, log on and grab his back-up first. If someone busts out a big game or two, sign him up! Don't pass on the next Kurt Warner, Stephen Davis or even, Billy Volek.


Follow the football news regularly. Take note of injuries and players who perform above or below expectations. Keep a constant eye on weekly match-ups.
Sign up for an update service that keeps you on top of developments during the season. While these services vary greatly in quality, keep looking for a good one and use it; they're essential if you want to reach the playoffs.
Grab running backs whose stats are on the upswing. Keep them on your roster as bargaining chips for trades: running backs are always in demand. A key to drafting running backs is making sure their offensive line is good. A great example is the Dallas Cowboy's O-line.

, Every Sunday and Monday, be sure to watch the games for enjoyment and to glean more valuable information.

, Fantasy football is a blast, if you remember to talk good-natured trash to your victims. It'll spur rivalries, keep things competitive and ensure feelings of victory when you take the cake. Make sure you draft a kicker in the first and second round.

Start your research early.,
Consult mock drafts.,
Keep a close eye on the IR.,
Know your league.,
Draft using the points system.,
Never take a kicker before round 9, and probably not before the last 2 rounds.,
Pay attention to BYE weeks.,
Don't draft all of your favorite players from your favorite team.,
Don't forget about 'handcuff players'.",How to Draft Your Fantasy Football Team," There are a number of good online resources to study, and starting your research early can save you the trouble of getting sucked in by the preseason hype that often explodes around unproven players in the days leading up to most fantasy drafts.;
, There are people that get paid to do 'mock drafts', and they generally do their homework. You don't have to draft exactly what they do, but it gives you a starting point. There a lots of free 'cheat sheets' available online.

, Don't lock anything in until right before your draft begins. Look at the players you hope to draft, track how they perform in the preseason and keep abreast of their practice schedule as it can often indicate a lingering injury that would severely threaten their fantasy value.

, Different Fantasy Football leagues score in different ways. The specifics of how your league scores might make WRs or TEs more valuable and these differences will not be reflected on mock-draft charts or power rankings.

, Generally, RBs are the position that will give you the most points. Start with those and work your way down the list. Some people draft RBs with their first 3-5 rounds. This is really not needed unless no one else is drafting RBs. Do the first round, perhaps the secondary, and only the third if some stud just falls in your lap.


A quick guide to what order positions should drafted in is ""RB, WR, QB, Def, TE, and K"". This can be changed a bit depending on what is on the draft board.
Depending on the league, you usually get nine starters and about five backup players. So an actual draft order could look like this: RB, RB, WR, WR, QB, WR, RB, WR, TE, DEF, QB, WR, TE, K.

, No kicker will be more beneficial than a backup position.

, Who wants to draft a backup RB/WR that has the same BYE week as your starters, or 2 starters with the same BYE week?

, Try to limit it to two players per team. Covering your BYE weeks can be a real pain with three of them on the same team.

, Players that would take over in the event of your super stud getting injured. Someone will take them the second an injury is reported.

Emerge from the water.",How to Stay Underwater in a Swimming Pool," Stand or sit still. Breathing slowly and deeply, take several full breaths. At the top of an inhale, hold your breath by closing the back of your throat. Use a stopwatch to time how long you can hold your breath. If you're happy with the time, you may feel ready to hit the pool. If not, you can increase your lung strength and capacity through breathing exercises and regular physical activity.


You may have heard that people can hold their breath underwater for several minutes. This is thanks to the mammalian diving reflex,which makes it possible for mammals to hold their breath longer underwater than on land. This is a survival instinct and is not to be relied upon. Further, people who set records for holding their breath regularly practice their endurance and do so under particular conditions.;
, Just because you are constantly breathing doesn't mean you are getting the most out of your breath. Abdominal breathing exercises that strengthen your lungs and diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen, can help you to breathe more consciously and efficiently.Lie down on a flat surface. Use a pillow under your head if desired, and/or under your knees, if you have pain in your low back.
Place one hand on your chest, in the area of your heart, and the other just below your rib cage.
Breathe in slowly through your nose. The hand on your belly should rise, but the hand on your chest should remain still.
Contract your stomach muscles and exhale slowly for six seconds through puckered lips. Again, the hand on your chest should remain still throughout the exhale.
Practice this sequence 5-10 minutes a few times a day. As the exercise becomes more habitual and easy, you may place a book, bag of rice, or sandbag (available at yoga supply stores) on your abdomen to increase the strength of your diaphragm.

, This is exercise that increases your heart rate. Improved cardio-respiratory function and more efficient use of oxygen are some of the benefits of a regular fitness routine. For general health, adults are advised to get 30 minutes or more of moderate physical exercise most days of the week.Running, biking, swimming, aerobics classes, and even dancing are all aerobic activities. Try multiple activities to identify an exercise that is enjoyable to you. If you enjoy an exercise activity, you will more likely stick to it.
Establish an exercise routine. Routines help make exercise into a regular habit. Try working out at various times in the day and evening to determine when it is most convenient for you to exercise.
Even small amounts of physical activity, e.g., five to ten minutes of walking, can improve your physical health. Aim to accumulate a total of 30 minutes of exercise a day., Many public pools in the United States have banned long breath-holding because of the risk of hypoxia (low oxygen), which can impair brain function, cause unconsciousness, and death., You can completely submerge yourself in any body of water that is higher than you are tall, or that will cover your head when sitting (or even lying down, such as in a wading pool). The most important factor to consider for picking a spot is to observe your surroundings. Always approach holding your breath underwater with caution, especially in a crowded public pool where people are engaged in many different activities and not paying attention to others.


If you want to sink to the bottom of a pool, you may think choosing a spot near the wall is safest. But, remember that people will be entering the water around all edges of a pool. It may be better to find a relatively isolated place, away from where people may be entering the water and away from large groups. Also, keep your distance from the pool drain, which can exert hundreds of pounds of suction and can cause injury and death.Have a friend keep an eye out for you while you’re below the surface.
If you’re swimming underwater, keep an eye out for traffic and remember that other swimmers will not necessarily be looking out for you. Ideally you can chart a clear path ahead of you to the other side, one that will stay clear until you get there.

, If you're in the shallow side of the pool, you will likely be standing. If you're in a part of the pool where the water is higher than you are tall, your body will assume a vertical position with ease as, generally, your lower body will be heavier than your upper body. , Do not hyperventilate. Taking several fast breaths in a row before submerging yourself is known as DUBB, ""dangerous underwater breath-holding behaviors"" and can cause hypoxic blackout, which can lead to brain damage, fainting, and death., Pull your knees in and hold them close to your chest by wrapping your arms around them. This tucked position changes the amount of space you're taking up in the water and will allow you to fall deeper into the water and to more easily remain underwater.


Objects, and bodies, sink in water if they have a higher density than the body of water.An object's density depends on its mass and volume--the amount of space it takes up.As such, taking up less space in the water will help you sink.

, Release air bubbles slowly through your nose. You can let them out of your mouth as well and they can be bigger, but you'll sink faster. You may also do both and let out small bits of air, puffing your cheeks between blowing air out. Let your head and body sink into the water. When your feet hit the bottom of the pool, sit in a comfortable position, such as cross-legged or holding on to your knees in front of you.

, When you’re ready or running out of breath, look up to make sure nothing and no one is in your way to the pool’s surface. Whether seated or standing, press firmly into your feet and stretch your arms skyward to shoot or swim upwards.

, Remember to avoid hyperventilating--taking quick or shallow breaths. This behavior is dangerous because your body will lose oxygen more quickly and you may suffer hypoxic blackout and even death., As you fall below the surface of the water, assume a horizontal position parallel to the pool floor. Keep your head and eyes in a neutral position facing the bottom of the pool and bring your arms up over your head, squeezing them alongside your ears.

, Keep your torso and arms in a streamlined position, bend your knees, and plant both of your feet on the wall. Press firmly into both of your feet to push you forward and give your body momentum.

, This kick is considered the most powerful for swimming underwater.Keep your legs and feet together and bend your knees slightly. Kick both legs forward simultaneously, finishing with them slightly in front of the body. Repeat until you reach the other side of the pool, coming up for air if necessary.


The power of dolphin kick comes from moving your legs like a whip. Focus on fully extending your legs to get the most power from the kick., This streamlined position is the most efficient for cutting through the water as quickly as possible and will alert you to obstacles ahead of you.

, When your hands meet the pool wall, use them to push against the wall to bring you to the surface.

Start by studying the rules of the fantasy football league you want to play in.,
Create or join a contest.,
Select a league and pick the date and time of the game you want to play in.,
Come up with an initial selection of potential players.,
Check your potential lineup for any injuries.,
Note the opponents that your selections will face.,
Lock in your selection for the week.,
Watch the games and note the performance of your selections.",How to Build a DraftKings Weekly Fantasy Football Lineup," There’s one set of rules for the NFL(draftkings.com/help/nfl) and another set of rules for the CFB (draftkings.com/help/cfb). Do note the contest rules as well as the additional rules. For example, DraftKings will not offer player trades or player benches for the contests since it operates its games on a weekly basis.
, You have two choices here: you can select “Play Now” to join existing contests, or you can select “Create a Contest” where you can set the fees and conditions yourself.

Start with public contests that have no entry fees if you’re new to fantasy football. This will help you gain experience and become more familiar with how things work on the DraftKings app before you put down money (or your pride) on a serious lineup.

, You can actually create a lineup in advance, but you’ll only be able to formulate a DraftKings lineup for upcoming games. This adds an element of urgency in drafting your lineup, so keep an eye out for when DraftKings opens up the option to create a team for the next games., Start by setting aside your personal preferences and look at the hard stats of players – even from teams you don’t like. Look at numbers, and you’ll already have a step up over other fantasy football fans who can’t let go of their fandom.

Review the stats you find on the DraftKings app. You have Opponent Ranking VS Position (OPRK), average Fantasy Points per Game (FPPG), and Salary. Higher FPPG ratings are a good sign, OPRK ranks that are green are also a good sign. These will be useful for coming up with an initial fantasy lineup.
Google will be your best friend. This will not only give you information about players that you’ll find useful, but may also lead you to fantasy football pundits that can give you a new perspective with their opinions.
Go for aggressive players that get a lot of stuff done in their games (e.g. gaining yards, field goals, touchdowns, interceptions, fumble recoveries, etc.) to gain large numbers of points for your fantasy league lineup.

, A high-performing athlete with a good track record may suddenly lose steam in the game if a recent injury flares up. Go for healthy athletes, and your fantasy lineup will be less likely to get burnt by a player flagging out due to an injury. Be wary of players who have also gone through multiple consecutive games, as fatigue can hurt their performance while raising the risk of injuries., Pick players going up against teams with weak defenses and/or weak offenses while shying away from selections from teams that will go up against league powerhouses. The objective of your DraftKings app lineup is not to create a lineup that will win the league but will gain as many points as possible in their weekly games., Try to lock in as late as possible to accommodate injuries, cancellations or dropouts that may occur. The deadline for forming your roster is five minutes before the game itself, so half an hour before the game itself is a good time to lock in your selection.

You’ll also be able to make late swaps for the mid-afternoon and evening games. This option if extremely useful if you want to modify your lineups based on the performance of your team during the early games. Did your picks perform surprisingly well during the first few rounds? Try swapping a few positions out for high-risk, high-reward picks for a wide lead over your opponents. Are some of your picks underperforming? Swap them out for players known to be more consistent in their plays.

, Were they aggressive and constantly getting things done, or were they passive and not scoring as many points for you as you had hoped? This will help you determine the performance of your lineup with regard to fantasy football, which in turn will help you refine your lineup in future contests.

Post-game analytical pieces backed up by hard data (yards, passes, etc.) will be useful at this phase. They’ll help you look at just how much a player did or did not didn’t do in the last match. DraftKings has a useful Playbook section where you can do research and pick up tips for strategies,although websites like FantasyPros,Scout’s FFToolBox,and FantasyFootballAnalyticsoffer great research tools as well.
Watch other games even when you’re not actively engaged in a fantasy football contest involving those games. This will help you spot sleepers – rising football stars that have yet to be widely recognized and have performed surprisingly better than their rankings. Identifying sleepers will come in handy for future weekly games when they come up on your DraftKings app.

Analyze if your child is ready.,
Know the benefits of joining a swimming team.,
Find out what it will cost.,
 Select the right program.,
Make your selection work.",How to Select Your Child's First Swim Team," Begin by knowing your swimmer’s current ability and interest in competition. Don’t place a swimmer in a program that is too advanced for their skills or interest level. This is a common sense approach that unfortunately many parents ignore. You can’t swim fast until you can execute the strokes correctly.


A good place to start is in a USA Swimming program with entry level swimmers. This way you get certified and motivated coaches. They are interested in swimmer development and their own advancement as a coach.
Other options include YMCA, local recreation or club programs. Swimming organizations such as USA Swimming and the YMCA have extensive training programs for all aspects of the sport. They require certified coaches and meet officials for all levels of training and competition. 
Remember, sports participation should be about having fun while learning to set goals and work towards achieving them. Sports develop these skills needed for success in life. Olympians, rocket scientists, artists and so forth have different and unique abilities that make them exceptional. So do the rest of us. The trick is finding what those abilities are and learning how to develop them. Timed or scored performance sports speed learning how to improve because improvement is always being measured, even in practice.;
, It is important to understand what a first time swimmer’s goals should be. Goals change and grow in importance with age. For children under 12, the only goals that matter are they enjoy competition, swim faster because of technique mastery and enjoy the training process. Achieving these goals helps develop their lifetime learning abilities.


The first few years of training focus on building technical skills and strength. Measure success in terms of personal improvement not awards. A full time commitment is best made between ages 12 and 14. Many children in that age range start to focus on a specific activity or sport. Others continue just for the enjoyment of the sport.

, The expense of being on a team varies greatly. The better the team reputation the higher the cost is likely to be. There are exceptions to this, so comparative shopping is important. YMCAs, for example, offer financial assistance to eligible members.


Don’t forget the additional cost such as travel to and from practice, meet entry fees and team suits. The cost of suits and equipment is lower than what is required for many sports. Many teams get their equipment from a manufacturer or swim shop; this saves you money. If the team does not do this, you can go online and price shop. 
Many swimmers never join a year-round swim team. Swim teams expect this and families can leave the team for the summer or other seasons if they have other activities during those periods. This is an important financial consideration when sorting out a child’s activity priorities.

, A short term program like a summer team is a good starting point. This will identify just how interested the child is in a commitment to swimming.


Before signing up, watch a few practices and attend a meet or two. Read articles on how the strokes should be done. Talk to the parents of other swimmers on the team. If your child has friends on the team, that is a plus. 
A coach with certification or college swimming experience will know proper stroke mechanics. It is important that they have the ability to teach the strokes properly while keeping the swimmers motivated. This is not always easy to do for an entry level team. The kids’ interests range from “I want to be in the Olympics” to “Why I am doing this?”
Watch how the coaches interact with the kids. Does the coach focus on how to do the strokes correctly or do they blame the swimmer for doing something wrong? The worst coaches will simply watch the swimmers go up and down the pool without providing comments and corrections. 
Look to see how the coach interacts with a swimmer who has just finished a bad race or was disqualified. That can be a very telling moment. It doesn’t take much knowledge to get a sense of how a coach will interact with your child.
Look for well organized practices and a program with good communications between the staff and parents. The details count. Pools can be dangerous places. The coach must be in control and ensure swimmer safety in the pool and the locker room. Practice sessions should be for children of similar ability and age. Preteens should not be in practice or locker rooms with high school kids! The team parents must assist providing supervision for the team or serve as officials at the meets. Few parents can attend every practice or meet. You have to trust the team to provide a safe environment when you cannot be present.

, The coach should be a good communicator. They ought to educate parents as well as the children. There must be two way communication and respect between swimmers, parents and coaches. As with life, what works for some people doesn’t work for others.


For beginners, clearly the most important factors are that the child will accept instruction, work hard and enjoy the process. The coach must have the ability to facilitate this development. For swimmers to reach their full potential there has to be a match of swimmer behavior and coaching style. 
Parents must trust the coaches. Don’t try to tell the coach how to coach, especially during practice. There are polite ways to express your concerns. It is to the coach’s benefit to make you a knowledgeable and understanding parent.
Swimmers often outgrow or get too good for their first team or practice group. When this happens, you are entering a whole new world of being a swim family.

Put protective gear on.,
Unzip the wetsuit.. You'll want to make sure that the suit is fully unzipped.,
Start with your feet and legs.,
Pull over your hips and torso next.,
Insert one arm at a time.,
Seal the deal.,
Lock it up.,
Check the fit.,
Finish up.,
Unzip.,
Remove the wetsuit from your neck and shoulders.,
Slide out your arms.,
Pull it down your torso and hips.,
Remove your legs.,
Clean the wetsuit.",How to Put on a Wetsuit," If desired, put on your protective gear now. This often includes a rashguard or rash suit usually made of Lycra.Of course, some people prefer to only wear their bathing suits, or even nothing at all.;
, With most wetsuits, the zipper will go in the back. If there are any hitches or kinks in the zipper, work them out now.

, Once you have the wetsuit lined up, pull your wetsuit over your foot and ankle, gradually working it up over the knee one leg at a time.Make sure that any wetsuit padding is properly aligned.There shouldn't be any large wrinkles or folds.Once the wetsuit is up around mid thigh, switch to the other leg.









If either you or the wetsuit is wet and you have difficulty pulling it on, consider using plastic bags or socks on your feet. This can make it easier.You can also use conditioner or vegetable oil as a lubricant.
Work out rolls and ripples in the wetsuit as you move up your legs.

, Once the suit is past mid thigh on both legs, gently pull the suit past your hips until the seam is nestled snugly in your crotch.Now pull the suit up over your torso and onto your shoulders. Your crotch shouldn't be pinched, but you shouldn't have any loose fabric or pockets either. It should feel like a firm second skin.









You can jump up and down to make sure that the fit is right.Loose pockets will circulate cold water, ruining the purpose of the wetsuit. The wetsuit shouldn't overly constrict movement either. If it feels too tight or like you can't move, take it off and get a bigger size before you waste more time.

, Use the same method that you did with your legs. Be careful with fingernails on the fabric.Gently pull the suit up your arms and then lift it onto your chest. Just like it was with your crotch, you'll want the wetsuit to be snug and tight without constricting movement.







, If you have a rear-zip wetsuit, have a friend help you zip up.Reaching and trying to zip it yourself can put strain on both the zipper and suit.








, Your suit should have Velcro fastenings over the zipper and at the neck area. Close these fastenings to prevent the zipper from unzipping and make your suit more watertight.







, Walk around, raise your knees, rotate your shoulders, bend your arms, and maybe do a few jumps or squats.While you should be able to feel the snugness of the wetsuit, your movement shouldn't be overly constricted. You shouldn't have any big pockets or loose areas either.








If your movement is constricted, take the suit off and get a bigger one.
If you have large pockets or loose areas, take the suit off and get a smaller one.

, Now that the suit is on and you have confirmed that it is properly sized, you can put your hood on if you are going to be using one. Congrats. Enjoy the water!








, If you were wearing a hood, remove it. Leave it inside out. Have a friend or partner unzip your wetsuit fully if it is a rear-zip wetsuit.

, Peel the wetsuit off of your neck and down your shoulders.To get it off of your shoulders it helps to slide a thumb between your shoulder and the wetsuit.







, One at a time, remove your arms from the wetsuit. Be sure to use your fingertips rather than fingernails. Pull each arm fully out of its sleeve, leaving the arms inside out.








, Peel the suit down your torso like a banana.Then you'll want to pull it past your hips in a single motion.Wiggle if you need to in order to get the wetsuit past your buttocks and out of your crotch.








, Roll the wetsuit down your legs.When you get to your ankles, put a hand inside of the wetsuit at the ankle and use it to hold the wetsuit leg open while you slide your foot out.Repeat with the other foot when you are done. Fortunately, taking off a wet wetsuit is far easier than putting one on!









Leave the wetsuit inside out so that it can get some fresh air.
Leaving the wetsuit inside out is necessary for proper cleaning... especially since a fair amount of the time, you might end up peeing inside your wetsuit.Peeing inside your wetsuit is fairly normal. Not only are you stuck in it for a long time, but the pee can make the wetsuit a lot warmer.

, Be sure to rinse the wetsuit down with cold, fresh water. Let the wetsuit hang dry. Never use heat or an automatic dryer to dry it. Heat can cause the rubber of the wetsuit to become brittle.


Be sure to clean the wetsuit thoroughly, especially on the inside!

See the inside of your swimming pool.,
Open your eyes in the open ocean.,
Look under a lake.,
Take your contacts out.",How to See Underwater1," It sounds simple, but anyone who’s tried it knows the sting that accompanies opening your eyes in a heavily chlorinated pool. Luckily, there are techniques available to acclimate your land-lubber’s eyes to the water. If those techniques don't prove satisfactory, however, it's recommended you turn to goggles or dive masks as a tool to safely see in the pool.


Practice at home by filling your sink or bathtub with water, plugging your nose, submerging your face, and then opening your eyes. Starting with water sources free of chlorine or debris will help you get use to the feeling of water on your eye, without additional discomfort.
Chlorinated pools are generally kept at a safe-for-swimming pH level of 7.0 to 7.6. This effectively kills bacteria, but not the various fats and oils we bring into the pool; these accumulated bodily byproducts are common eye irritants.
While exposure to normal amounts of chlorine is irritating, it will not cause permanent damage. It will, however, wash the protective tear film away from your cornea, actually making the eye more vulnerable to any bacteria which has survived the chlorinated pool.If your eyes become irritated, flush them with cool, fresh water, or utilize saline drops to ease the pain.;
, Swimming in a natural source of water means no chlorine for eye irritation, but prospective eye-openers should be aware: no chlorine equals “yes” to bacteria and debris. Near the shore, waves are constantly throwing sand and small rocks toward the beach, making corneal scratches from debris a possibility. Away from the shore, you'll have a more pleasant experience looking around underwater.


Careful about opening that mouth, too—while they’re not all as strictly harmful as they may sound, one gulp of seawater can contain millions of bacterial cells, tens of thousands of zooplankton, and hundreds of thousands of phytoplankton. , Bacteria is your major concern when opening your eyes in a freshwater lake. While it’s far from a given that you’ll have problems with the lake’s single-cell citizens, it’s recommended you use eye protection (goggles or a dive mask) when you want to see underwater. In shallower water, dirt and other hazardous particles from the lakebed can be kicked up while swimming and enter your eye.


Acanthamoeba is one particular nasty amoeba that can be found in fresh water (including, rarely, tap water). Infection can necessitate a cornea transplant. Lakes do provide a more comfortable experience for opening your eyes than a chlorinated pool, though, or the turbulent shoreline of beach. If you're willing to risk it, you can probably keep your eyes open longer here than in any other body of water! The dismal visibility in a lake, however, might not provide too much to see.

, In any of the above-mentioned environments, you'll want to remove your contact lenses before opening your eyes underwater. Although it's a bit of a risk for the lenses to float away (thought the water pressure will likely keep them in place), the greater danger is bacterial infection. If you wear glasses or contact, you can have your prescription put into a dive mask. Wearing a dive mask is a much safer alternative for seeing what's underwater than opening one's eyes, and is optimal for anyone who would be unable to see very well without their glasses.

Strap on some goggles.,
Wear a diving mask.,
Scuba dive.",How to See Underwater2," Goggles allow you to see clearly underwater without irritation, and their strap ensures they remain affixed to your head while swimming. They're secured easily: you place the lenses over your eyes, and then stretch the silicone strap around to the back of your head. The strap should press snugly against your temples, like glasses, but shouldn't hurt.


A pair of goggles is only as good as its seal, so if water's getting into your lenses you might want to try a different pair. The strap and lens shape should do all the work necessary for a good seal; you shouldn't have to repeatedly fix the suction by pressing them against your eye sockets.
Goggles are uniformly used by competitive swimmers, who can’t have their vision compromised by going without, or their speed compromised by using the less aerodynamic dive mask.
First realized in the polished tortoiseshells that fourteenth-century Persians used to protect their eyes while diving for pearls, goggles have gone through some significant improvements since then.Modern swim goggles provide excellent visibility and use plastic, silicone, and polycarbonate blends.

, A dive mask goes a step beyond goggles, covering your nose as well. If you’re uncomfortable blowing air out of your nose, this means no more awkward nose-holding when you’re underwater! Like goggles, dive masks are affixed to the head by a single strap, thicker than most goggles', and should remain on your face while swimming without requiring any manual application of pressure.


Dive masks work because their flat surface and the space between their window and your eyes allow your eyes to focus underwater. Light bends differently underwater than in air, and the mask’s design corrects this for you. Snorkels can be attached to the straps of diving masks, allowing you to float along the surface of the water with unlimited access to good, old-fashioned air.
If you wear glasses, you can have your prescription put into your mask! Diving with contact lenses is also possible, though you should stick to soft lenses if you head into the open ocean. Hard lenses can suction painfully to your eyes at greater depths., Diving with the aid of an oxygen tank (or a tank filled with another appropriate, compressed gas mixture) is known as scuba diving. Divers equip themselves with dive masks, wetsuits, fins, and buoyancy compensators to aid in their underwater movement as they explore the sea floor, shipwrecks, reefs, and cave systems. Search near you for diving certification programs if you’re interested! There is nuanced, particular safety information which must be learned in order minimize risk when traversing underwater environments that humans aren’t designed to live in.


Wetsuits absorb and retain a layer of water which your body will warm, in turn keeping you warmer. It gets cold down there!
Fins provide divers with faster propulsion, which is quite necessary considering the other gear they’re saddled with.
Buoyancy compensation works by inflating and deflating a special vest with air, in order to control the depth at which you float in the water. Weights are also used to aid in descent.
Reefs can be both natural, such as those involving large networks of coral, or artificial, when they’re structures which have been created or deliberately sunk by man.

Ride in a glass-bottom boat.,
Board a submarine.,
Walk the beach.",How to See Underwater3," Designed to allow passengers to view the water below them, the boats often tour reefs, shipwrecks, or other hotbeds of aquatic activity. Tours on these boats can be relatively affordable in comparison to other underwater exploration methods, and operate in many coastal cities and natural springs.

, While this isn’t a repeatable option for most (outside of buying a DVD of The Hunt for Red October) seeing as personal luxury subs start at around $600,000, both military and civilian submersible vehicles routinely patrol and investigate the briny depths. Tours of non-operational military subs are possible for a window into that underwater world, however, and companies in vacation destinations often offer submarine trips to tourists.


When discussing submersible platforms, HOVs are human operated vehicles, and ROVs are remotely operated vehicles. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s website contains information detailing multiple submersibles researchers use today (both HOV and ROV), including a model named “Alvin” that’s been in use since 1964! , Combing the shoreline for seashells, sand dollars, and sharks’ teeth allows us a unique, surface-dweller’s peek under the sea. It’s a little eerie when you think about it, considering the majority of what washes up is dead or dying, but humanity has learned much of the sea by what’s washed ashore. Indeed, until the last century, that’s how we gathered most of our knowledge about the ocean.


A living, adult giant squid wasn’t even able to be photographed until 2012. We only knew of its existence by pieces of the squid that became stranded on the beach, or by finding them in the bellies of sperm whales that themselves had washed ashore. (As stirring as it may be, anecdotal evidence presented by ancient mariners is, unfortunately, not considered proof.)
Strolls along the beach anywhere can yield once-in-a-lifetime encounters with the unfamiliar. Residents of Oxnard, California, along with other cities along North America’s pacific coast were acquainted with a sea creature entirely unknown to them (and to most people) when mass quantities of by-the-wind sailors (scientific name: Velella velella) were deposited on their beaches.

Pick a team.,
Watch them play, again.",How to Choose a Favorite Football Team," Many people by default support the team of the area they live in. This is perhaps the simplest and easiest way to pick a team to support. The benefits of this approach is that many of your friends and family will probably also support the same time. This will make game days more fun, as you’ll be able to join everyone in tailgate parties and more. Consider the following:


Does the city you live in have a football team?
If your city or town does not have a team, what big city with a team are you closest to? Support that team.
If you are equal distance to two teams, pick whichever you prefer, or whichever one your friends and family support.;
, Some people are lifelong supporters of one team. They support the team of their hometown where they grew up, and they support that team for the rest of their lives. You can go with this approach as well.


This will help you bond with family and friends who still live in that community, if you have moved.
This might feel natural because you are probably familiar with the mascot, the colors, and the fan culture of the team.
If you’ve moved far away, this might present a problem as you might not be able to attend many games in person., If we’re talking American college football, many people support the team of where they graduated or where they grew up. People do this for many reasons including tradition and emotionalism, but mostly because they associate their college football team with the good times they had in college. This is certainly a good way of determining what team to support., For many families, supporting a football team is tradition. Get behind that tradition and support the same team that your parents and grandparents supported. Not only will you be able to have more in common with your family, but you’ll be able to participate in football related events together, like tailgates and viewing parties. You’ll also be able to attend games together., Some people are moved by mascots and team colors. If this is the type of person you are, take a look at the wide variety of mascots and team colors of different teams around the country. On the contrary, you might not like a team’s mascot or colors, so you can easily eliminate them from your potential list., You might be the sort of person who likes supporting the underdog. In this case, take a look at a few teams that have been struggling in recent years. This can be fun, too, since a lot of people tend to support winners. When your team wins, you’ll have a lot more to celebrate., Perhaps an individual player or coach impresses you. This is definitely an acceptable way of picking a team to support. You can choose to follow that player or coach around as they are traded or begin working for new teams in the future. This way, you’ll be invested in a career and in someone’s talent, rather than just a team.


Often times people follow talented quarterbacks from team to team, so consider this.
Look into the quality of the coaching staff, you might be impressed and want to follow a team due to the coaches.
Sometimes you might not like a certain player or coach of a team, so you can eliminate a team based on this, too., A lot of people like to support teams that are currently winning. Teams that are currently winning are more likely to have very talented coaching staff and players, so this is a big draw for a lot of people.


Take a look at a list of teams that are currently performing the best nationally, or in your region.
Examine the track record of that team. Are they dominating this season? Did they dominate last season? Have they made it to bowl games, championships, or playoffs?
If you’re comfortable supporting the winning team, do so., The more you watch, the better you’ll know teams that you might want to support, and the easier it’ll be to eliminate possible choices. In fact, watching a significant amount of football on TV is the best way to educate yourself about the game and about teams.


Watch different teams from different regions.
Watch your local team, or the team your friends and family favor, play against a top ranking team.
Don’t be afraid to watch teams that are far removed from where you live., You shouldn’t really commit to supporting a team until you’ve seen them play live. Seeing a team play in person will give you a much better sense of whether or not you‘ll be comfortable supporting them in the future. Attending an actual game is very important in narrowing down your choices. Consider:


Attending a game will give you a sense of the specific fan culture of that team. You’ll see how fans tailgate, how they behave, and you’ll get a sense of whether or not you fit in.
Attending a home game for a prospective team will give you a sense of the atmosphere of their stadium. You’ll hear the songs they play and the announcer. You’ll also see the halftime show, hear the band, and see the cheerleaders.
Try to get good seats, rather than seats in the nosebleed section. This way, you’ll be closer to the action and you’ll be able to see how the players and coaching staff interact on the sidelines.

, If you’ve done your homework so far, you’ll have a fairly decent idea of what the stats mean (wins, losses, touchdowns, and more). Take your list and lookup the stats of the teams on it. The stats might speak to you, and might give you an idea of who to support and who not to support. , Since you’re trying to pick a favorite team for the long-haul, don’t rush the process. Set aside a month or two, or perhaps even the whole football season before you make up your mind. You’re going to want to review all of the teams you’ve considered fairly, and give yourself time to consider the many factors.

, After you’ve watched a number of games and considered other factors, make your list. Include 3 to 5 teams that have impressed you the most. This list does not need to include all winners, or all hometown teams. It can include teams that you like for any reason. Don’t feel like you need to justify putting a team on your list. You’re simply narrowing down the number of possible teams.


Include teams that you might have an emotional attachment to because of family, friends, or region.
Include teams that have individual players or coaching staff that you already support.
Don’t be afraid to include teams for any reasons. After all, this is all about your preference!

, Now that you’ve educated yourself about a number of teams you’re interested in, watching some of those teams again will gain you new insight. Watching your prospective teams, once you’ve narrowed down the selection, will give you a really good idea of which teams you favor more.Try to watch the teams on your list play against each other, if possible.
Watch more than one game for each team.
Attend more games in person, if you can.

, When you’ve got your list, start to narrow it down. What matters most to you? Is it individual talent, the coaching staff, hometown loyalty, or other factors? Ask yourself all of these questions, and eliminate one at a time from your list.


Make a list of pros and cons for each team.
Rank the teams based on emotional value, skills level of the team, or the importance of tradition (if your family supports the team).
Eliminate teams that don’t measure up., Once you’ve reviewed all of the necessary information, pick a team. This is the moment you’ve really been waiting for. You’ve done all of your homework and considered a number of factors, now you get to support the team that has won this vetting process., After you’ve vetted the team and decided to support them, watch another game. This should be a new experience for you. You’ll no longer be scrutinizing the team, but supporting them. You’ll take pleasure in their victories, and you’ll mourn their defeats.

, The University of Hawaii Warriors are known for their ""Ha'a"" or ritual dance before every game. Before kick off, the national anthem and the state song, ""Hawai'i Pono'i"", is sung.

, Also, periodically throughout the game, there's a color race game on the screen. People usually pick their color (red, blue, green, or yellow) and see if their color circle wins. This is just fun among fans, but actually the winning color represents the color section of the stadium and determines a random seat number for a prize.

, The wave usually takes place during time-outs and other ""time killer"" breaks. They start out from the sidelines, where people can encourage others to join and continue at least halfway to two thirds around the stadium before it dies out. The wave is repeated until the game resumes or if people seem uninterested at the time.

, You may see streams of people start walking out during the 4th quarter, especially when the point spreader is high. If you didn't catch the ""Ha'a"" before the game, the Warriors usually repeat it after the game as well.

As of 2015, Atlantic City, New Jersey has not legalized sports betting. However, recent legalization efforts may cause this to change in the future.;
, If you can't bet in a legal casino, the rest of your options fall into the realm of semi-legality. Some of these options are safer than others. For example, workplace pools almost never attract the attention of the law. You can feel reasonably safe about putting $20 or so into a small office pool during the playoffs.


This is because these kinds of betting opportunities aren't usually set up to make money for a bookkeeper or betting agency. In other words, since the participants in the pool are playing for each others' money and no one is taking a ""cut"" of the bets, authorities almost always tend to turn a blind eye., Online betting sites are technically illegal on a federal level under the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). However, this is typically only applied to the operators of the site. In practice, people who use online betting sites are virtually never prosecuted.Some states (like New Jersey) have even taken steps to legalize types of online gambling.


If you go this route, pick a popular, well-known site with a reputation for quality service. Sites like sportsbook.ag and bovada.lv are good choices. Don't pick an obscure site with suspect credentials — it can be difficult or impossible to get your money back if you fall for an online betting scam. See our article on spotting scams for more information.

, Making an informal, illegal bet with a bookmaker (or ""bookie"") is probably the least wise option when it comes to sports betting. While it's unlikely that you personally will be prosecuted, bookmaking is illegal in most parts of the U.S., so this option is forcing you to associate with criminal enterprises. In addition, since this is illegal, you won't have any recourse if your money is stolen or you are scammed.

Look the part.,
Next, KNOW YOUR TEAM!,
Have a couple of favorite players and coaches.,
It would be a great idea to maybe dedicate a room in your house toward Michigan Wolverines.,
Know the game schedule.,
When they score a touchdown, field goal, or intercept a pass, GO NUTS.,
Try to attend games as much as possible.,
Autographs are a MUST to being a great Michigan Wolverines fan.,
If you catch the game ball KEEP IT.",How to Become a Hardcore Michigan Wolverines Fan," When you're a Michigan Wolverines fan, it's important to show off your sense of appreciation and spirit for the team. It's good to invest in some good quality Michigan jerseys, hooded sweatshirts, t-shirts, and any other type of apparel you can think of. Also, wear Michigan hats, necklaces, earrings (if you're a girl), socks and shoes! Some great places to access this merchandise would be sports apparel stores (they have them at malls and shopping centers), and department stores such as Walmart, K-Mart, Kohl’s, Target, and even some Kroger's stores have them too!;
, If somebody asks you a question about who and what player played this year and who the coach and past coaches were you can't just sit there and drool on yourself. You'll become embarrassed and people will call you a poser. So it's a good idea for you to study it's roots and how the team was started, who the players and coaches (including past players and coaches) are, stats of the players and team, and anything else. You're probably freaking out about how you can do this. Don't worry. Just visit the team's website and go to the ""football"" section. There are also a great number of other websites you can check out that have information on the team's history and achievements throughout it's existence.

, Who do you think is the best on the team or who puts in the most effort? Who was your favorite coach? Also have a reason for selecting that specific person as your favorite. Don't just randomly pick somebody because they ""look cool"" or anything around that area. It doesn't make sense to do something like that right? It'll make you a whole better fan knowing who is who and the fact you aren't just doing it for no reason.

, Have you ever seen somebody in real life or television have a room completely decked out in their favorite team? That automatically puts you right up there with the more dedicated fans rather than with the people that THINK they are a fan. You could maybe decorate your family room, poker room, bedroom, or a bathroom in Michigan. Here's some ideas to get started:


Paint the walls (if you're allowed depending on what kind of housing you have) maize and blue. These are the team's colors. It'll make it a whole lot better than just plain boring white walls or a completely different color. Try not to use anything that resembles Ohio State in ANY WAY. This is Michigan's rival and you CAN'T support them WHATSOEVER.
Put up some Michigan border/wallpaper. You can get this at a crafts store like Jo-Ann Fabrics, Michaels, or a border/wallpaper outlet near you. They're sure to have sport's team wallpaper.
Furniture. Having your favorite team's logo on a couch, chair or table will totally bring the room to it's meaning. Go to some furniture stores and browse around online to find some good Michigan Wolverines furniture.
If you're re-doing your bedroom or bathroom, look for things like a logo bed set, rugs, banners to hang on the walls, shower curtain, soap dish, toothbrush holder, etc. Border stores might have things like this too and so do the bath and bedroom departments in certain stores.

Get some miscellaneous merchandise such as bobble-head dolls of players, coaches, banners, flags, foam fingers, hats, helmets, mugs, and anything else you can think of. Sport's stores and gift shops at malls are sure to have things like this, especially the ones in Michigan since this IS the team's state.

, Being a hardcore Michigan fan consists of NEVER missing any of their games. You can't just watch the rivalry game between them and Ohio State and that's it. You need to watch ALL of their games to know where they stand in the stats. Plus, you have to actually WATCH the whole thing. Fans of a team don't just watch ten minutes here and there. You have to enjoy them. Also know what days their games are. Even better if you memorize the schedule. People will be envious and amazed severely, making you a WAY better fan.

, Scream and shout ""YES!!!! GO!! GO!! GO!!!"" or ""GO BLUE!!! YEAH!!!"" Things like this are completely normal. It's good to get excited during events like these because it shows you're serious about being a fan. Also you should pay hard attention to what goes on in the game. And if they don't win, get a penalty or one of the players gets injured, support them NO MATTER WHAT. You can't just be a fan one minute and when they lose a game, hate them forever. That's hypocritical severely. You have to always give the team support no matter what comes in their way. It shows you respect and care for Michigan Wolverines.

, The tickets can get a bit pricey but WHO CARES! Make extra money by doing small jobs like delivering phone books, newspapers, a garage sale, mow people's lawns and save up for tickets. Make sure you get them before they're sold out. Also try to get good seats. Not to get stuck up at the top of the stadium and not able to see a thing. That REALLY sucks.

, Try as much as possible to find a way to get a player or coach's autograph on a football you brought, jersey, or anything else you can think of. These are moments you will remember.

, Don't just be a goody-goody two-shoes and throw it back. People will call you an idiot.

Get yourself some Chiefs clothes.,
Watch the games either in person or on television.,
Here are some things and words to know:


Arrowhead Stadium.,
Learn the history:


The 1960s: The Chiefs were originally the Dallas Texans.",How to Be a Kansas City Chiefs Fan," Jerseys, T-shirts, coats, and jackets are all good. You can buy them at the games, or in stores around Kansas City and the surrounding region. If you do not live in the Midwest, NFL.com sells Chiefs products as well.;
, They are always televised locally and occasionally on national TV. Tickets to home games are not cheap and can be hard to get. But if you are able to attend a game personally, it is fun and exciting. That's why the tickets aren't cheap.

, The field where the team plays all their home games. It is a large stadium, seating more than 79,000 people. It is known as one of the league's loudest stadiums because of the Chiefs' enthusiastic fans.
KC Wolf. The mascot for the Chiefs. He is a wolf, possibly best known for tackling a drunk fan who jumped onto the field during a 2007 regular-season game. It has become an internet phenomenon on YouTube.
Dallas Texans. The Chiefs were originally from Texas before moving to KC in 1959, ten years before the Royals.
Truman Sports Complex. The sports facility that includes both Arrowhead and the Royals' Kauffman Stadium.
Clark Hunt. The owner of the franchise, son of Lamar Hunt, the original Chiefs owner who formed the American Football League (later the NFL's American Conference).
Scott Pioli. The Chiefs GM, replacing Carl Peterson who had been the GM from 1989-2008.
Andy Reid. The current head coach (2013-present) and former Eagles head coach. He replaced coach Romeo Crennel, who coached the team in 2012.
Alex Smith. The current quarterback (QB) for the Chiefs. He led the 49ers in 2012 before suffering a concussion during a game against the St. Louis Rams, in which Colin Kapernick replaced him and led the 49ers to the Super Bowl, which they eventually lost to the Ravens.
Dwayne Bowe. The Chiefs number one WR. He had consecutive 1,000 yard (914.4 m) seasons in his rookie and sophomore seasons but his 2009 season was derailed by a four-game suspension.
Jamaal Charles. The bright new Chiefs running back. He succeeded the controversial Larry Johnson. Following Johnson's release halfway though the 2009 season, Charles became the starting RB and rushed for 1,000 yards (914.4 m) while starting only eight games. He averaged more yards per carry after week nine than any other running back in the NFL except Chris Johnson of the Titans

, Dallas could not support two teams (the other being the Cowboys), so the Texans moved to Kansas City and were renamed. The Chiefs appeared in the first Super Bowl (1966-1967), but lost 35-10 to the Green Bay Packers. They returned to the Super Bowl in 1969-1970. Led by Hall of Fame QB Len Dawson, they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 23-7. They soon developed a heated rivalry with the Oakland Raiders that is still alive today.
The 1970s and 1980s: During the 1970s the aging Super Bowl team did not perform as well and were replaced with a new generation of players. The Chiefs became one of the worst NFL teams until 1986 when they made the playoffs for the first time since 1969. They returned to mediocrity for the remainder of the 1980s.
The 1990s: In 1989, Lamar Hunt hired GM Carl Peterson to try to turn the team around. In turn, coach Marty Schottenheimer was hired. New high-profile players were brought in, including Hall of Fame QB Joe Montana in the early 1990s. The Chiefs developed a dangerous ""Marty-ball"" defense. They were the winningest team in the 1990s. Despite this, they won only one playoff game (1993). Schottenheimer was fired after the 1998 season when the Chiefs went 7-9. He was replaced by Gunther Cunningham.
The 2000s: A few years later, Cunningham was replaced by legendary coach Dick Vermeil who had won a Super Bowl with the Rams a few years earlier. Vermeil brought in high-profile players and developed one of the most powerful offenses in NFL history. The Chiefs were number one in scoring from 2002 to 2004. Vermeil retired after the 2005 season. In 2006, the remnants of Vermeil's high-powered offense managed to put together a 9-7 season. They made the playoffs as a wild card team, but lost to the eventual Super Bowl Champion Colts in the first round. In 2007, the Chiefs were a mix of Edwards's new young players and Vermeil's aging veterans, finishing with a disappointing 4-12 record. Things did not improve in 2008, as the Chiefs fell to 2-14. Edwards was fired after 2008 and was replaced by Todd Haley as head coach. Peterson stepped down as GM and was replaced by Scott Pioli. The Chiefs won only four of their 16 games in 2009.

Build a bicycle trailer.,
Find a set of wheels that include an axle if there is one available.,
Buy or salvage a piece of plywood or some lumber that will function as the bed, or deck of the bike trailer.,
Use clamps to attach a piece of pipe under the bed you have built for your trailer.,
Remove one wheel from your axle assembly, and slide the axle through the pipe underneath the trailer bed.,
Attach a piece of thin pipe or tubing, 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) galvanized metal electrical conduit should work, to the center front of your trailer bed, again, either with clamps, or nails.

,
Bend the front tubing upward, ideally, without kinking it, at an angle which will allow you to attach it to the bike's frame just underneath the seat.,
Set the cargo you need to haul on your makeshift trailer, and find a safe place to practice towing it.,
Use string or cords, or build side rails on the makeshift trailer to keep your cargo in place.,
Mount a front handlebar basket on your bike for carrying smaller items.,
Locate a plastic milk crate or other lightweight plastic or wire mesh basket from a handy source.,Attach this basket to the handlebars with nylon zip ties or wire, and fashion support legs to the outer end of the front axle, or to the front wheel fender if it is strong enough to support the weight.,Check to make sure your basket doesn't interfere with your bike's steering before heading into traffic.",How to Transport Objects on a Bike," You can use small lawnmower wheels, old training wheels, or other junk parts, some surplus lumber, and some imagination and build one inexpensively.

, Some high wheel type lawnmowers have a back axle that can be modified easily to adapt to a trailer, but you may find wheels on toddler's bikes, garden carts, tricycles, or other things around the house that will work.

, You will need a piece of pipe for the axle housing, and another for the trailer tongue also, so while you are looking, keep an eye out for these items too.

, If you have no clamps, simply driving nails into the bottom of your bed and bending them over the pipe will work, at least temporarily.

, Note that the axle must be at least a couple of inches longer that the width of the bed. Fasten the axle with the bed centered between the wheels by drilling a hole just outside the pipe sleeve it fits through on each side of the bed and putting a pin in these holes.

,, You can drill a hole through this tubing at the upper end and use a wire obtained from a common coat hanger to tie the tongue of your trailer off, or you can build a hitch with a removable pin if you like.

, You need to remember that adding weight to the rear of the bike will change the bike's turning radius and feel, so do not attempt to tow your trailer where there is traffic until you are comfortable doing so.

, Optionally, for small cargo, you may want to use a large trash bag for a weatherproof covering while towing., These are available at bike shops, but also can be improvised if you can't afford one or only need it for one use.;
, Sometimes they are available from distributors who discard them when they sustain minor damage, and sometimes you may find one in a local junkyard, if you are an adventurous type.,,"
"
Always research the teams playing.,
Never bet more than you can afford to lose.,
When in doubt, bet for the strong quarterback.,
Consider your team's schedule.,
Be wary of banking on repeat performances.",How to Bet on Football2," When your money is on the line, don't follow your gut. Instead, use your head. There's no way to be absolutely certain who will win a given football game, even when one team is heavily favored. However, taking a careful look at the two teams' statistics will give you a better idea of who is likely to win. For NFL teams, basic stats are available for free from the league's official site.Below are just a few stats to consider:


Total offense (yards per game). The team that scores more points wins, so a strong offense is a good indicator of success.
Total defense (yards per game). Strong defenses shouldn't be ignored — under the right circumstances, they can shut down powerful offenses.
Rushing/passing stats (yards per game). Knowing both teams' offensive and defensive strengths can help you predict how each match-up will play out.

, This is true of all gambling in general. No matter how sure you are about your bet, there is always a chance that you'll lose everything you wagered, so never bet money you won't be able to get by without.


A good policy is to treat gambling as something to do only with your ""extra"" money. In other words, once all your bills are paid off, you've budgeted for your living expenses, and your financial obligations are met, you can use a small amount of whatever's left over for betting.

, Over time, minor changes in NFL rules can have major effects on the way games are played. The current rule set favors quarterbacks by making it harder for the defense to sack or put pressure on them without drawing a penalty.Because of this, teams with good quarterbacks currently have a slightly greater advantage than usual.


On the other hand, a bad quarterback can hamstring teams that have good stats otherwise. In the 2013 NFL season, 10 the 11 teams that threw the most interceptions failed to make the playoffs., If you're banking on one team to do well during a given season, be sure to note the teams they will be playing (as well as when and where). A favorable schedule can help a team get into the playoffs. A difficult one can make it very challenging even for a strong team.


For instance, if your team is playing their main division rivals during an away game, they'll lack the home field advantage that might have made the game more of a sure thing on a different schedule. On the other hand, if their schedule is packed with weak teams, they may easily cruise to the playoffs.

, There isn't any science to this, but teams that do very well during one season tend to do somewhat worse the following season. This can be due to many factors, including fatigue and a shorter off-season. If your favorite team went all the way to the Super Bowl last season, you may want to think twice about making a prop bet on them appearing again, even if you feel that they deserve it. Even the strongest teams can be vulnerable after a great season."

When in doubt, make a straight bet.,
Learn the basics of spread betting.,
Learn the basics of moneyline betting.,
Learn the basics of over/under bets.",How to Bet on Football3," For football, if a bet isn't otherwise labeled, it is usually offered at odds of 10/11.In other words, if you bet $11 dollars and win, you will make back your money plus $10 for a total of $21. This is called a ""straight bet"" and is very common in sports betting.

, Another common type of bet has to do with something called the ""spread"" or ""point spread."" In this type of betting, one team is favored to win the game by a certain number of points. If you bet on the favored team, it must win by this predetermined number of points (the spread). If it doesn't clear this hurdle, your bet loses, even if the team itself won. Conversely, a bet placed for the team predicted to lose will win if the other team can't make the minimum score (or ""cover the spread"").For example, let's say that Team A is favored to win by 6 points over Team B. You place a bet on Team A, but they only win by 3 points. In this case, you lose your money even though Team A won the game. If you had bet on Team B, you would have won money even though Team B lost the game.

, Another way that gamblers express odds is with a system called ""moneyline"" betting. In this system, each team is given either a positive or a negative number (like -500 or +350). A negative number means that you must wager that much money to earn $100 if the team wins. A positive number means that wagering $100 will earn you that much money if the team wins. In other words, teams with big negative numbers are heavily favored to win. Teams with big positive numbers are considered unlikely to win.


For example, let's say that Team A is rated at -300 and Team B is rated at $150. This means that we would have to bet $300 on Team A to win $100 if Team A wins. On the other hand, betting $100 on Team B will earn us $150 if Team B wins. In this case, it's often best to ""fade"" — make a small bet on the team with the positive number, or Team B. Team A has low reward potential.

, In this form of betting, it doesn't matter which team wins. Instead, you're trying to predict the total number of points scored by both teams. If the number of points is over a predetermined number, you win money if you place an ""over"" bet (and vice versa for ""under"").For example, let's say that a game between Team A and Team B has an over/under rating of 50. This means that the teams have to score a total of 50 points or more for the ""over"" bet to win. Otherwise, the ""under"" bet wins.

Get good locks.,
Lock it somewhere sensible.,
Lock it to something solid.,
Lock it tight.,
Register it.,Keep your bike in the shed so no one would steal it

,
If you have a drill, carve your name under the bike, so if they stole the bike, they couldn't take off your name without breaking the bike.",How to Stop Your Bike from Being Stolen," Spend money on good locks. No lock is totally thief proof - but the more you spend, the better the lock will be. As a rough-guideline, look to spend 20% of the value of your bike on locks. There are many different types. The more kinds you use, the harder the bike will be to steal. These are the most popular.


D or U locks are rigid steel locks that separate into two pieces. Get a lock that physically lock both ends of the U to the cross-bar. If you are going to get a cable lock for the front wheel, get the smallest lock possible, and lock it through the rim of the rear wheel.
Cable locks can been be looped around the bike and around larger objects like trees. Go for a thick one with interwoven threads - which will take a thief longer to cut through. However, any cable lock can be cut through in seconds with a good set of bolt cutters. In high-theft areas, they are only good for securing the front wheel to the frame.
There are also specially hardened bike chains which are the best option if you have to use non-standard things like lampposts to lock your bike to. If you have quick release mechanisms on your seat or wheels, you can also buy locking nuts and bolts. These can be undone with a uniquely shaped key - so passing thieves can't steal them.;
, Always lock your bike - even if you are only leaving it for a minute. Leave it in as public a place as possible. Ideally lock it where you can see it - or where lots of other people can. Never leave it in an isolated place. If you're going shopping, leave it locked up outside the shop. If you're just having a break, lock it up nearby to where you're sitting down.

, Make sure it is secured to an immovable object like a cycle anchor or railings. Some things that look solid are not, so check. If you're locking it to a post, make sure the post is at least 4m high, so thieves can't lift it off the top.

, Whatever lock you use, make sure you lock the frame and the wheels to something immovable. Make sure your d-lock is tight, so the lock is not hanging loose and there's no space between the bike and the object it's locked to. This makes it difficult to lever the lock open. Make sure the key-hole is pointing down - so thieves can't fill it with a corrosive fluid, or with glue, which means you can't move it, but they can come back and steal it later and when you leave it, remember to remove accessories like the lights - or the seat if you haven't fitted locking nuts.

, If you are unlucky enough to have your bike stolen, this will help you get it back. In most countries, there are schemes run by the police or online with whom you can register the unique frame number of your bike. The police also recommend that you take a photo of your bike and record its details, like the model and colour, as well as the frame number. Most importantly, make sure to TAG your bike in multiple places indicating where the bike is registered. If stolen, the thief will likely strip off what tags he easily sees, the one TAG he misses will be his undoing.

,, Even if they paint over your name, it will be rough, and your name will be visible.

Look up your state's regulations.,
Add a white front light.,
Install a rear red light.,
Load up on reflectors.",How to Stay Visible Riding a Bike at Night1," Each state has its own regulations regarding bike safety requirements. Following your state's laws about bicycle lights can offer you legal protection in the event of an accident. For instance, if your bike is not properly equipped, for instance, you will have a harder time claiming damages from a driver, and may even be partially at fault. Look up the website for your state's Department of Transportation for the rules that apply to you.For instance, the Washington State Department of transportation states that a white front light visible for 500 feet and a red rear reflector are required for night bicycle riding..;
, Some states require that you add a white front light to your bike for nighttime riding, but it is a good idea to add one for added protection either way. A light with good beam quality (i.e. wide, evenly lit, and projecting far into the distance) will cost upwards of $60 but serve you better in the long run. The same is true of a small, portable sized light. Look online, or visit bike stores or departments stores to purchase a front light that suits you.You should also opt for a USB-rechargeable model as opposed to AAA and AA battery powered versions, which require you to purchase and carry spare batteries.

, While rear red reflectors are required by law by most states for night cycling, a rear red light is also a good idea for keeping visible. In recent years, lights that blink have grown in popularity due to their effectiveness in making bicycles visible to drivers. They have also drawn criticism from some cyclists who claim that a blinking light alone is not enough to make their exact position on the road visible to drivers.Look for a model that features a mode combining a static LED with a flashing LED. This will attract a driver’s attention while simultaneously allowing them to gauge the distance between their vehicle and your bike.<

, Reflectors work by bouncing light back towards its source (i.e. light from a car’s headlights being reflected back towards the eyes of the driver.) Most bikes are equipped with foot pedal reflectors; front and rear reflectors should also be added, as they are legally required in most states (and can be purchased easily at a bike shop or department store.) Reflective tape can also be purchased to add to areas of your bike like the fenders, forks, and seat tubes.Note that reflective tape may be difficult to remove from your bike, so take time to think about where you want to apply it.
Spoke reflectors are another option, available in a wide range of colors and shapes.

Wear reflective clothing.,
Sport a headlamp.,
Signal clearly.,
Be extra vigilant.",How to Stay Visible Riding a Bike at Night2," To stay visible to drivers at night, you must not simply wear bright clothes, but reflective ones. Reflective strips on clothing move up and down as the cyclists move, which makes them visible to drivers. Look online or in a sports store for reflective jackets, pants, and shoes to make your nighttime cycling safer., Wearing a headlamp on your helmet will allow you to have a light that follows your vision as you move your head. Headlamps should attach securely to your helmet and tilt easily to accommodate the spaces you want to shed light on. Look online and in sports stores for different models.Note that a good quality headlamp can cost around $100.
An ideal choice for urban riding is a USB-rechargeable headlamp with a 500 Lumen output. For darker, rural settings, a light with a higher Lumen output is a better bet (e.g. 750 Lumen).

, Specific arm movements are used by cyclists to signal left-hand turns, right-hand turns, and stops to drivers near them. At night, make sure to signal broadly and clearly. These signals should start about a third of a block before your turn or stop, giving motorists ample time to slow down. To ensure visibility, make sure you have reflectors on your arms, wrists, or hands (e.g. reflective gloves.)For instance, it is imperative to signal a right hand turn so that the car behind you gives you enough time to complete the turn before continuing straight ahead.
If you are changing lanes, you must indicate your direction clearly to the vehicles behind you at least a third of a block before you make that switch.

, Cyclists and pedestrians alike tend to assume that they are more visible than they are to drivers, which can lead them to be less vigilant about their safety at night. Be conservative about your positioning and movements at night. For example, be especially cautious when crossing an intersection. In your dress and movement, do everything you can to be as conspicuous to drivers around you as you can be."
"
Ride on well-lit streets.,
Stay 3-4 feet away from the curb.,
Look for bike lanes.",How to Stay Visible Riding a Bike at Night3," Choosing well-lit streets to ride on is the best way to guarantee that you are visible to motorists at night. Opt for main streets in commercial areas, which are likely to have bright street lights to accommodate pedestrian traffic. Streets with restaurants, bars, cafes, and movie theatres are especially likely to be brightly lit throughout the night., To stay visible to pedestrians and motorists, stay 3-4 four feet away from the curb. The same applies to parked cars - keeping 3-4 feet away will prevent an accidents caused by a driver opening their car door in front of you. The distance will also offer a buffer against drivers pulling out of their parking spaces suddenly., Ride your bike in areas with designated bicycle lanes. You are more likely to be visible to drivers in an area where they are expecting you. Move a little further into the bicycle lane to make yourself easier to spot by drivers approaching from behind."

, Soft ground is probably the best to look for in case you fall over.,, You should notice that the back wheel will jump off the ground. Do this step a couple of times to get the feel for it., Now that you are used to the movement of the bicycle, try pulling down the front brake. At the same time, push your body and lean forwards towards the handlebar. Release the brake and pedal when the rear wheel gets to the floor and try the trick.,"
"
In the beginning of your bodyboarding career, you're going to want to keep in mind that this is a sport, it takes time to develop a familiarity with the water.,
After you have the right view of what you're going to be dedicating yourself too, you need to also keep in mind this sport is very physically demanding!,
Now before just running out into the water with your new sponge, make sure that you have the right size of board for your body type!,
Ok, so you got your board, you're ready to work out, next what you're going to need is fins.,
So you've got all the gear!,
Once you've spent a couple minutes analyzing the water, you're going to adjust your leash to your arm, and walk out holding onto your fins in one of your hands, once the water is up to about knee high, put on the fins and start paddling out.,
Prepare for a wave you aren't ready for.,
Ok!,
To go right, move your body to the inside (right) edge of the board and apply pressure with your right hip to the back edge.",How to Start Bodyboarding," If it was really easy everyone would be doing it!;
, You're going to need to hold your breath at times for a long duration of time, you're going to need to go under the water consistently over and over to get under waves and out to the sweet spot.

, They come in different sizes based on your height and weight. Having the right bodyboard will determine how fast you glide waves, how difficult the paddle out is, and how easy it will be to bust spins and airs.

, They go onto your feet, usually a good pair of fins today costs around 40-60$, but it's a very good investment. You will be able to swim circles around anyone without them, and they help you catch waves and maneuver through the water.

, You're ready to go out now. Before dashing into the water, check out the waves, check out the current, is it low tide? Is it a high tide? Why is there a big group of surfers in one spot, but nothing is going on? What is going to be the easiest way to get where they are, without getting hit by a big swell? How is the form on the waves? Are they taking a long time to break? Are they majority left waves or right waves?

, Usually while paddling you can use 2 methods, keeping your legs together and paddling with your arms, (like you would on a surfboard ), or positioning your hands on the front center of the board almost touching each other and paddling under the water with your fins. This cannot be stressed enough; while paddling make sure your fins are underneath the water, otherwise you aren't going to anywhere.

, So you're moving nicely out towards the water, but uh oh! You see a big wave that's getting ready to crash RIGHT in front of you, you're doomed!...not really. There is a really cool method of getting through these waves no problem and keep going towards the sweet spot, this method is called ""Duck Diving"".


Duck Diving isn't always the best way to get under a wave. If it's a big wave about to break right on your head, you might want to bail your board and let the leash do the work. However, in most situations, a well-timed, well-executed Duck Dive is definitely the most efficient way. Kick to gain forward momentum. When the whitewash or wave face is about six feet away, quickly grab your board about 1/3 of the way down the rails and do a push-up. At the same time, slide one knee onto the back tail section of your board. Just before the wave hits you, force all of your weight down onto the board trying to sink as much of the board and your body as possible. Keep your face close to the board and wait for the turbulence to pass over, then angle the board upward and pull your knee off the back. Your board should pop up. The key is to be able to sink your board. If your board is too big or you aren't doing the push-up right, you won't succeed, so practice in the flat water and you'll be ready to ""dunk"" the big ones!

, So you have made it out! It's time to catch your first wave! As the wave approaches, kick hard with your feet underwater! You can also help yourself catch the wave by pushing down on the nose of the board with one hand and paddling with the other. Once you've chosen to go right or left, it's time to get yourself in place on the board. Let's say you've chosen to go right. First, you should have made sure there was no one on the wave behind you coming toward you. If so, kick out right away.

, Slide your right hand to the top right corner with your right elbow planted firmly along the right edge of the board. Your left hand should be around 1/3 down the outside (left) edge of your board with your left arm slightly bent and the elbow in air. Your right hand and elbow are controlling your edge and keeping it in the wave and your left hand and arm are controlling your direction and turning ability. If you go left on the wave, just reverse all the body, hand and arm positions.

To start, lay on the board with your toes touching the tail. Make sure your hands are in the right position – don't grip the board at its sides, but instead place them flat on the board very close to your chest.
Lift up your chest using your hands. Remember to not look down – instead look straight up and don't move your head. Looking down or behind you can make you scared or unbalanced.;
, This is when you go from laying on your stomach with your hands on the ground by your chest and elbows bent to pushing up your chest with your hands then popping or jumping into standing position. Standing position on a surfboard is with bent knees, feet wide apart, and feet and body facing either the left or right (your good side or whatever feels comfortable) while looking forward.


You have to be good at doing quick take offs on the ground before moving to the water. When you've paddled into the wave and you feel it take you and the wave angles you down, that's when you have to quickly pop up to standing, using this technique.
Don't lean forward because you may flip your board over (scary!). A low center of gravity helps that, so bend your knees.

, This is where you kneel in between laying down on the board and standing up. Move up your left foot and place it where your knee used to be. Then bring your other leg up (your right one) to fully stand up. Place them about shoulder length apart and in the center of the board, in a sort of lunging position and twist with your hips until you are standing.


Put out your hands like they do in the movies – it actually works for the balance.
Once you have caught the wave, go from paddling position to a kneeling position by bringing your knees forward in one swift movement. Do not lean back while kneeling or you will fall off your board.

, A foam surfboard will be lightweight and easy to use. Make sure you're on a beach with waves that break far out instead of waves that break right on the beach – these waves are ideal for surfing.


Check the weather, too. Bad weather could lead to an unfortunate accident. And as for the shoreline, stick for something that isn't too rocky. That's a recipe for disaster.

, If you have a leash, put it around your ankle. This will prevent you from losing your board. Once your board is in the water, lay on your stomach and start paddling – one arm and then the other. Paddle over the forming waves, going far back to where the waves are just mere currents.


When you're ready, turn your board around and start paddling forward. You will probably catch a wave. When you do, put your hands on the board and lift your body up onto your feet. Start off crouching low and then slowly stand up with your arms out for balance. Do this until you get to shore.

, You want to be there and ready when it begins to roll over but before it actually does. As you come over it's edge, raise your torso up with your arms on either side of the board. Then, if you are a righty, put your left foot in front of your body and use it to lift up your right foot. Then ride the wave left or right as it crashes behind you.


For a while, you're going to be snapped off your surfboard by the water. Don't get discouraged; each time you go out into the water, you're perfecting just what it is you have to do. It's a normal part of the learning curve.

, Combine the following factors to form a solid foundation. This will enable you to stay stable and get the maximum ride out of the wave.


Place your front foot on the chest line and in a direction that goes across the deck, your back foot is placed so your legs are slightly wider than shoulder width.
Keep your knees bent at all times. This will lower your center of gravity and assist you in keeping your balance on the surfboard.
Push your hips forward to transfer your weight onto the front leg. Your back leg should dip in slightly to make your stance more comfortable and give you more style.
Keep your arms up, especially your front arm. Out stretch your front arm so you are reaching for the nose of the surfboard, your back arm should also be outstretched but don't worry too much about it.
Position your head up and looking forward. If your front arm is up, your head should be looking straight along it. Keeping your head up has been mentioned through a lot of my articles and is a major contributor in you achieving the best result from your surfing.

, Once catching a wave, your hands should be at about half of the board's length and your head should be about 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) away from the front of the board. Keep your arms up in ""surfer's position"" to establish directionality as you ride the wave and apply pressure or extra needed weight onto your front foot in accordance with your arms in order to steer.


Stand with your dominant foot on the middle of the board and your back foot about 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) away from the back of the board.

, You wouldn't bet on a baby to run a marathon, so don't insert yourself in the line up right away if you don't have to. Paddle out to sea and catch a broken wave in shallower, white water nearer to the shore.


Take a moment to master sitting on your board, too. While you're doing this, make sure you're always facing the waves – never turn your back on something that could seriously injure you. Anytime you're waiting for a wave, keep facing the horizon.

, This is a technique that allows you to go under breaking waves instead of getting pummeled time and time again each time you go out for a surf. There is a different technique for using a short or long board:


For short boards, gain speed as you approach the wave. Around 2 feet (0.6 m) before making contact with the water, grab the edges of the surfboard between the nose and middle of your board. Push you weight onto your hands until the nose goes under. Put your head down and your body will follow. Once your body is below the surface, take your front leg and bend it down, using that knee to push the tail under the wave. This momentum will put you in the water for only a second or two.
For long boards, push up your chest and let the wave pass under your body and over the board. The ""shoot and scoot"" method is where you sit on the back of your board and put the tail of it into the water, grabbing the edges of the board at the center so it raises above the wave.

, You don't just want to ride a wave to shore, you want to ride it parallel to shore for as long as possible. You want the longest possible ride with the most possible speed. Here's how:


Bend your knees to keep a low center of gravity. Lightly lean your weight in the direction you want to go, toward the face of the wave. This will push the rail of your board into the water and elicit a keel effect that cuts into the water, directing your board.
On a long board, use the rear section of your board to turn. If you lean too far forward, the rail will dig and you'll be off in no time.

, It'll take some time, but eventually you be able to predict wave behavior. In addition to being out there and in it, just observe the waves and how they act. Eventually you'll be able to spot the wave that's just right, the one that's in the Goldilocks zone. You'll be able to tell which waves are mushy and which are hollow, determining your course of action.

Practice prone surfing.,
Choose the right wave.,
Surf.,
Wipe out.",How to Surf a Wave in One Day," Before you start hanging ten on a 12 foot (3.7 m) wave in Hawaii, try riding your first few waves lying down. Practice your position and body movement on the beach. Lay your board down on the beach. Hold the sides of the board about 3 quarters of the way back. Pull yourself onto the board and lie face down. Keep your board in the "" chicken wings"" posture... and make sure your toes are touching the board's tail. Center your body on the board and keep it straight and lift your chin and chest. Now you are ready for the sea.;
, It's important to look for the right waves for your first attempt. These should be coming in a straight direction towards the beach and be foamy with plenty white-water. Place your board in the water and push it as you wade out. Keep wading until the water is waist deep, jump over any oncoming waves.

, Once again, before you start trying to surf a wave standing up, have a practice on the beach. Decide if you're ""regular"" surfer or a ""goofy"" surfer. A regular surfer puts their left foot forward. A goofy surfer puts their right foot forward. If you are lefty and you ride regular your left foot is forward and if you are goofy you will put your right foot forward. To work out what you are, try skidding on a flat surface and see what foot you put up front. Place your board on the sand and lie on it face down just as you were when riding in the prone position... turn your back foot so the inside of your ankle is touching the deck of the board. Next, lift you neck and chest up. Then slide your front foot forward to where your chest is. Slowly let go of the board... and stand up. Open your shoulders and arms for balance. Look at the beach as you ride in and bend your legs at the knees, putting a little weight on your front leg. And now your surfing!

, Just as there's a correct way to ride a wave, there's also a right way to fall off it. Be sure to fall off backwards into the waves and wrap your arms around your head to protect it against hard objects such as your board or rocks. Don't forget to take a full breath before hitting the water!

Wade out into shallow water and stand directly next to the board.,
Place your paddle horizontally across the board.,
Hold the board on its sides.,
Lift one knee out of the water, and pull the board toward you.,
Shift your weight so your body is directly above the paddleboard, and bring your other knee to rest on the traction pad.,
Consider taking a few strokes in the kneeling position so you can get a feel for the board.,
In the kneeling position, lean forward and place the paddle horizontally across the deck of the board.,
Slowly stand one foot at a time, placing your feet on the sweet spot where your knees where.,
Rise to a standing position, adjusting your feet as necessary.,
Start paddling!

",How to Stand Up on a Paddleboard," You'll want to be about knee-deep in the water when you mount your board, and you should stand on whichever side of the board you feel most comfortable.


Make sure the board is placed so the fin is down in the water.;
, The grip of the paddle should be aligned with one side of the board (the side closest to you) and the paddle is touching the water on the other side.

, The hand closest to your body will be gripping both the board and the paddle, which will help you maintain balance as you mount the board.

, This will allow you to place your knee on the ""sweet spot,"" which is just about the mid-point of the board. #* If your board has a handle, the ""sweet spot"" will often be where the handle is integrated.

, You should now be in a kneeling position, with both knees on the board, and feel relatively stable.

,


Check the board positioning as you do this: If the nose end comes out of the water, you're too far back on the board, and if the tail end comes out of the water, you're too far forward. Adjust your position as necessary so your board lies as flat as possible.

, Grip the sides of the board with both hands.

, Continue gripping the board to help stabilize yourself.

, They should be hip-width apart, and you should feel relatively stable. Make sure to bend your knees slightly and keep your core centered over the board.

Repair and don equipment.,

Skin dive.",How to Skin Dive," It's absolutely essential that your equipment fits comfortably. In addition, you may want to wear a weight belt, because you'll be buoyant when underwater holding a breath. A weight belt with a quick release buckle can be released and dropped very quickly if you get into trouble in the water. Thread some lead weights onto the belt and make sure they're secure. Use lead weights that weigh about 5 percent of your overall body weight if wearing just swimwear or a thin shorty. If diving in a full-length or thicker wetsuit, use 10 percent of your weight.;
, The pike dive is a headfirst surface dive that gets you underwater and heading downwards with the least amount of effort. Float in the face down position, bend forward at the waist and thrust your head straight down. At the same time lift your legs above the surface as if you were doing a handstand. As soon as your *Fins submerge, start to kick.

, This is optional, as there are dangers involved (see Warnings). Generally, hyperventilating lowers your body's carbon dioxide levels and tells your system to resist the urge to breathe. Contrary to popular belief, it does not increase oxygen levels.Take a sharp breath in and exhale slowly, emptying your lungs entirely of air. Do this three times, then finally take a full breath in, and dive.


As a safer alternative to hyperventilation, you can exhale fully once and then take a normal breath. You may be better off practicing resisting the instinct to breathe, rather than risking hyperventilation which can lead to drowning.

, Water, as you probably know, is heavy. This causes an increase in pressure underwater that squashes your air spaces. It's vital therefore that you equalize air spaces such as sinuses and ears to avoid discomfort. To equalize as you descend, pinch your nose closed and blow gently against your pinched nostrils - much like you would when ""popping"" your ears when flying in a plane. Equalize every metre or few feet, before you feel pain or discomfort. You also need to equalise your mask to avoid painful mask squeeze. Simply breathe out through your nose into the mask whenever you feel it tighten around your eyes and nose.

, The key to getting most out of skin diving is to relax. Finning efficiently and moving slowly will give you longer bottom time. Try not to use your arms while underwater. This only uses more energy and more oxygen. Use the scissors style kick, which is where you kick from the hips with your knees slightly bent.

, Mask flooding can be a normal part of skin diving. It can happen at any time. To clear your mask, simply tilt your head back and hold the top of the mask against your forehead. Exhale through your nose into the mask. As you do this, the air pushes out the water through the bottom of the mask.

, Start off by skin diving in a swimming pool or calm water, perhaps by a busy beach with little or no waves. Stay close to shore so you can get out of the water quickly and easily whenever you need to.

Make sure you have a ""foamie"" and not a ""woody"".,
Know that when you have your board, find a beach that you can is best for skimboarding.,
Wait until you have found a good beach, then get out your board and approach the water.,
Understand that right after a wave breaks, start running towards the water.,
Look to see when a thin film of water is on the sand, throw down the board.,
Know that if you have run onto your board successfully, you will be approaching a developing wave.,
Have fun!

",How to Skimboard on a Wave," Foamies are designed for riding waves, lighter, but cost more. Woodies are wooden fiberglass boards which are predominantly made for sand skimming, but if you cannot get a foamie, they will suffice.;
, You want a beach where the waves break close to shore and has a steep bank down near the water.

, Stand about ten feet away from the water and be prepared to throw down your board.

, Do not flat out sprint because you will fall off when you get on the board if you are a beginner.

, Don't throw it away from you, throw it down so you will run on to it in stride. Run onto it with your back leg first, then your front foot. Do not ""jump"" onto the board because it will break the surface tension of the water, slow you down, and cause you to sink faster. Keep all of your weight on your back leg so you glide into the water, instead of plowing through it.

, If it has not started to break yet you have three options. Option one is to hit the wave straight on a perform and aerial trick. Option two is to perform a wrap or a barrel wrap. Option three is to turn to the left or right (depending on which way the wave is breaking) and come back to shore.

Find a good location.,
Buy a board and surf wax.,
Find a good skim spot.,
Get in shape!,
Hold your board (preferably with one hand on the back tail and one hand on the side rail halfway up the board) out in front of you.,
When you have some speed, drop your board flat out in front of you on this thin coating of water (almost like dropping it on the sand itself).,
Get onto the board.,
Skim away.,
Pick out a good wave.",How to Skimboard," You don't have to live on a beach, but it would be easier so you could get more practice. Find a good beach, preferably one with either very little slope (for sand skimming) or very powerful shore break and steep slope (for wave skimming).;
, You should buy different types of boards for sand skimming and wave skimming. Smaller, flatter, wooden boards (which are cheaper) are designed more so for sand skimming (sideways along the shore, where it's flat), whereas the newer high-tech foam/carbon fiber boards are shaped for reaching waves. Some wooden boards arch in the middle, so that it only has about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of board touching the ground on each side of your skimboard. These are very good for sand skimming, at good places, you can go at least 60 feet (18.3 m). There are many types of wax (tropical for warm waters, cold for cold locations, etc.). If in a cold location, use tropical or warm water wax for base coat. Then cold water wax for top coat.

, This can be tough, but once you have a few places figured out, you'll always have somewhere to skim. San Diego, England, and Florida are some popular places.

, You don't want to injure yourself doing this. Make sure you can run, ride on a board, take a few falls, and get a little sand on your face when you learn to skim. Keep your leg and back muscles stretched, warm, and strong.

, If you're just going flat along the sand, wait until the last wave to come in is sucking back out. When there's a thin coating of water, between a couple millimeters and no more than a half inch, start running.

, The easiest way to do this is to get low to the ground and slide it out in front of you (to lead you just a little bit before you get on).

, Do not jump or hop onto the board. YOU WILL FALL and it will be boring. The only correct way to get on the board is to 'run' onto it, by placing your front foot a few inches past the middle first, then placing your back foot behind it. You may say, well I'll fall if I go one foot at a time. This is not the case. Properly done, you lose no speed as you get onto the board (Whereas if you jump onto it, the board is forced to break the surface tension of the water because of the sudden weight increase, taking away from the 'skim'). By gradually putting your weight onto the board, you will lose little or no speed. It's very smooth, and actually easier than jumping on once you're used to it.

, For sand skimming, it's simple...you just go, go, go...until you stop. You can stay straight, or you can try to do a shoot, or a big spin if you're lucky. Sand skimming is fun, but you can kick it up a notch by skimming waves.

, You'll need a wave that you can A) Reach, and B) Turn off of, or do an air off of. To help with speed as you go over deeper water, try side-slipping. This involves turning the board sideways as you go over flat sections of water (physics says it makes it lose speed at a slower rate). As you approach the wave, you'll need to start your turn by applying weight to your back inside/outside rail depending which way you're going. To lose less speed, try using the side rail more towards the middle of the board (instead of the back). This is much harder though, requires more practice and skill, and gives you less direct control of the wave. As you go up the face of the wave, you can turn off of it and come back down the other way towards shore. Eventually you may try aerials, grabs, and other tricks, too. Make sure to kick your tail out hard at the top of the wave as it starts to crest over to change directions and get a good spray going. This is all a very concise explanation of something very complicated and variable. Every beach, wave, sand texture, board, person, and condition is different. Experience is key in getting better.

Know how to judge which wave to take.,
Note where the wave peaks.,
Stay observant at all times.,
Learn about your local break.,
Know the Southern Californian wave types.",How to Spot a Wave While Surfing," There are many factors that need to be considered, but for the beginner, the color of the wave can help you determine whether or not you are in a good spot to paddle for it. The color of the wave will darken just prior to breaking. In order for your board to start sliding down the wave, it has to be going fast enough, and the wave has to be steep enough. 


Some longboarders use the 20 meter paddle technique. They start well before they have any chance of catching the wave, hoping to build enough speed so that they can start the slide as early as possible. This technique can be exhausting, but it's generally how beginners start and it's a relatively easy way to learn a proper take off (it's not a pop up, what are you a toaster pastry?). ;
, As you progress in your skills, you will probably learn that the best and easiest place to catch the wave is where it ""peaks"" or first starts to break. This is where the longest rides are obtainable and where the wave's real power is. Of course, there's greater risk of ""pearling"" (having the nose of your board dip into the water throwing you headlong forward). When you have sufficient skills, you'll be able to do a ""two paddle"" or a ""no paddle"" take off. You use minimum energy for maximum enjoyment. You will learn to use the power of the wave to carry you without having to take a stroke, or maybe just one or two.


The take off is the most important aspect in riding a wave. If you want to surf, master your take off and be prepared for the thrills of your life, if you progress far enough, otherwise, you might as well just sup.

, Observation and practice will sharpen your skills. 


Notice where the wave actually begins to break in your lineup. 
Notice how the more experienced surfers seem to hang out in a particular area? That's because that's the best place to catch the wave. 
The surfer closest to the crest has the right of way to the wave. Don't drop in. Doing so shows major disrespect for the surfer's ride, and that's not the reputation you want. 

, The tides have more to do with the quality of the waves you'll see than the time of day you get there. For example: Tourmaline Canyon Surfing Park, first municipal surfing park in the U.S. Unless the waves have some ""juice,"" (power) high tide will generally kill the wave. The wave doesn't care if you're there for ""dawn patrol.""

, Generally there are two kinds of waves you need to consider in So. Cal. There's the mushburger, and the barrel or tube. 


Mushburgers roll gently, are sometimes called ""fat"" and take a long time to begin to break.  They often ""roll"" underneath a surfer who hasn't gained enough speed to drop in or position enough to start the slide. The whitewater can be powerful depending on the size and strength of the wave. Don't be deceived though, what starts as a mushburger on the outside (the place farthest from the beach where the wave breaks) can easily become a steep, fast and radical wave on the inside (the place closest to the beach where the wave breaks). Learn your break!
The barrel or tube is more difficult to catch in that it generally doesn't build gradually, but shapes and breaks in a very short space of time and distance. When a wave is ""throwing a lip"" (the leading edge of the wave is thrown forward creating a hollow space within the wave, the barrel / tube), an inexperienced surfer can easily be ""thrown over the falls"" (unwittingly ride the wave from the inside out backward... most unpleasant), as the wave will carry the surfer and their board like a piece of driftwood to the shore. It is best to penetrate the wave low on the face and hope the current isn't strong enough to suck your board and yourself along with it. 

Just a word of advice. The barrel can be more difficult for the inexperienced surfer to drop in on because of the timing. Without the muscle memory that comes from practice, they will most likely pearl, lose their balance on the take off or separate from their board during the drop and be unable to ""land"" their take off. Practice will overcome all these defects. If your break throws a lip often, best thing to do is dig it! You're very lucky, because So. Cal. beaches aren't prone to barrels much. They happen, but like many things, if any of the conditions aren't working, it isn't happening. Once again, best thing to do is learn your break, and find out which spot works best for your style of surfing, assuming you're skilled enough to have developed a style.

Set up shop in a well-lit, open area with a table or rack that you can use to hold the board in place while you work. To shape your board, you’ll be making use of an electric power planer, a handsaw, a surform tool and a sandpaper block. It will also help to have a soft lead pencil and a straight edge or T-square for measuring.For your own safety, you’ll want to make sure you have eye and ear protection (lab safety goggles or woodworking glasses and a pair of noise-deadening earmuffs will work just fine) and that you’re wearing a respirator, as there will be lots of foam dust floating around the room once the shaping process is underway.;
, To get started, you’ll need to have your raw materials in order. The innards of a surfboard are made from lightweight foam, which big manufacturers buy and trim down to size. For the rider shaping his or her own board, however, there is the “blank,” a hunk of foam that has been cut into a rough surfboard shape that can then be shaved down to the surfer’s preferred specifications. Purchase a blank and get to work!It’s best to find a blank that’s larger than you want your finished board to be so that you’ll have more room for error in trimming and shaping the foam.Surfboard blanks only cost a fraction of what premade boards cost, and can be shaped in a matter of hours.

, Decide on the basic shape that you want your surfboard to have. It may be a longboard with a sharp, pointed nose, or a shorter performance board with a wide, rounded tail and shallow rails. Look up sample dimensions online for the type of surfboard you want to fashion, or use an old surfboard that rides well for reference. Trace the outline of your preferred board shape onto the rough foam blank. It may help to use a template or other visual aid to get the shape of the board right.Choose a shape for your surfboard that fits your own unique attributes and needs. The length and shape of your board might be impacted by your weight, body type, riding style or the kind of surf you usually ride.
If you already have a surfboard that you like and want to use it as a template, simply trace around it onto a few overlapping pieces of posterboard, then cut out the outline. Lay this outline over the foam surfboard blank as you cut it to get the right length and width., Take a handsaw and cut around the outline you just drew, starting at either the nose or tail and moving along one edge at a time. Use long, smooth strokes to avoid getting off track or breaking the foam. Don’t worry about being too precise, as you’ll continue to cut and shave the board as you go.Secure the board on your work table or rack (some shapers use special racks with built-in adjustable clamps, others use bungee cords or straps, or simply hold the board down with their free hand) so that it doesn’t slide around as you’re cutting it.

, Run a sanding block along the jagged edges of the foam blank to smooth them out. Get the edges as flat and even as you can, as they’ll be your starting point for shaping the rails (which impact how the board handles) later on. From here, you’ll be using finer techniques to bring out the finished shape of the board.Use the sandpaper to work out any imperfections made from sawing the outline.
The sides of the board should be as close to 90 degrees to the deck (top) and belly (bottom) as you can get them., Plug in the power planer and set it to the appropriate depth. Run the planer over the outer surface of the blank to shear away a thin layer of foam at a time. Repeat this process, always going back over the surface in the same direction, until the board is as thick or thin as you want it.If you’re new to shaping, adjust the power planer’s depth gauge to a shallow setting to avoid over shaping or accidentally taking off too much foam at once.
Mow the blank foam using smooth, straight sweeps. Rather than sliding the planer straight down the length of the board, start at the stringer (the line running through the midpoint of the board) and guide it from the centerline off the edge. This cuts down on the distance the planer has to travel, producing a more fluid and consistent shave., Now that the board is the correct shape and thickness, you can begin adding “rocker,” or upward curvature of the board. Do this by shaving away the foam near the nose or tail (or both, if you prefer) so that the end up the board turns up slightly. Since you’ll have to take off a lot of foam to form the rocker, it’s best to leave the blank a little thicker near the ends.You can attempt this with the power planer, but it may be easier to use a surform tool, as this will give you more manual control over how much foam you remove and prevent you from making irreparable mistakes.
Tail rocker allows the rider to manipulate the back end of the board for ease of turning and shifting, while nose rocker keeps the front end of the board from digging into the water as the surfer drops in., Finish shaping the deck by adding concave. Concave is a term used to describe the way the board curves inward at the bottom to catch the wave. After you decide whether you want deep or shallow concave, you can achieve the right amount using the surform tool to carve further into the belly.Concave creates traction for the surfer by “cupping” the water, making it easier to dig in.Since the rails of concave boards sit a little lower in the water, they naturally give up some speed and lift.

, The last step in shaping your surfboard is to shave and round out the rails, or the outer edges of the board. Using the surform tool, scrape away at the flat edge of the outline of the blank so that it forms a bevel. Do the same to both sides of the beveled edge where it comes to a point. Complete the rails by going over them with the sanding block, making the slope as smooth and gradual as possible.Most professional surfboard makers use a technique called “rail bands” when shaping the rails. Rail bands essentially function as a schematic for how the rails need to be shaved and blended as they meet the deck and belly of the board.As you shape the rails, crouch down periodically so you can examine the board at eye-level. This will help you pick up on any inconsistencies in thickness or slope.

, Surfboards with flat bottoms offer more surface area for gliding over the water, making for greater speed and balance. Their larger point of contact also makes them more stable in rough surf. Flat-bottoms work well with most types of boards, are are especially useful for fast, smooth waves.Heavier surfers may benefit from flat-bottomed boards because their increased surface area prevents the board from sinking into the water as much.Start out with a flat board until you get a sense of what you do and don’t like about it before moving on to more specialized contours.

, The underside of a single concave board features one broad upturned curve. This makes the board more hydrodynamic, as it conforms around swells and allows water to pass easily underneath. Because the rails sit lower in the water and provide more “grip,” concave boards are great for performance.Many competitive surfers prefer boards with deep single concave.
Single concave boards may be difficult to manage in choppy or turbulent surf., Double concave surfboards curve upwards on both sides of the stringer, resulting in a shallow “M” shape when viewed from a cross section. If you buy a premade board straight off the shelf, chances are it has a double concave body contour. The double curve streamlines the board creates lift, letting the rider stay more on top of the wave.The lift and controlled channeling of double concave surfboards makes them ideal for newer riders who are just learning.Use a rocksteady double concave board to work on correcting balance issues.

, This board style takes its name from the angled point of its underside. Similar to double concave boards, the Vee shape gives the rider greater leverage when carving and rapidly changing direction. The convex belly slices through the water, making it swift and easy to handle without compromising the rider’s footing.Vee shaped boards can be useful if you tend to change your foot positioning frequently as you ride.
This is a popular body style for big wave riding, as it enhances stability and steering and fine balancing ability."

Scan the sports section for highlights and regurgitate back in conversation.,
Know the basics of ""the game."",
Try to answer questions with questions.,
Always have an exit strategy in place.",How to Fake Knowledge of Sports," In addition to being used to collect droppings at the bottom of a bird cage, as a key ingredient for paper mache projects or to start a fire in your fireplace, the sports section of the newspaper serves another purpose. Believe it or not, it can be read. Not for enjoyment, mind you, but for intelligence gathering. Every morning, usually when I’m on the train heading into work, I spend about 10 minutes scanning the sports section. It gives me just enough information to fake the conversation for the day. It tells me who won, who lost and what the scores were. I also learn about key plays, major injuries or any controversial calls. Basically, the sports section distills a three-hour game into about a three-minute read. The key here is to make the headlines sound like your own words.;
, Simulating sports talk is like learning how to speak conversational French or Spanish. There are some basics you just need to know to get by. For example, when talking sports scores, know that football uses touchdowns, baseball runs, basketball points and hockey goals. Another basic? You absolutely, positively need to know the names of your home teams.

, If a sports talker asks “How ‘bout that game last night?” and you have no idea what game he or she is talking about, the safe answer is always “Can you believe it?”. The beauty of this answer is that its non-committal. It doesn’t say whether or not you watched the game and it doesn’t matter how the game turned out. It could have been great or lousy. “Can you believe it?” works for just about every scenario imaginable. Plus, you’ve applied the “reverse question block” where you answer a question with a question. This gets the sports talker talking more, which provides you with valuable sound bites to parrot back.

, This is where, in desperation, you throw up your hands in the middle of a sports conversation, shout “I can’t even talk about this anymore” and stomp off. This is acceptable as you're clearly emotional about the sport - as any true fan would be.

Find yourself a surfboard 8 foot (2.4 m) or taller.,
Make sure that the board has a non slippery surface before heading out.,

Get in the water and paddle.,
Find the sweet spot.,
Paddle with good posture.,
Get past the break and watch the sets, find the best area where the waves are breaking and reposition yourself just outside it to wait for the right wave.,
Turn and paddle hard to gain momentum once you spot your wave.,
Stand up!,
Lean one way or another and slowly turn, once you've caught the wave.,
After the initial dropping into a wave and making the bottom turn, the critical part of your ride is over.,
Don't get discouraged.",How to Ride Longboards," These typically will be more stable, and catch small waves better. The larger the board, the easier it is to stand on, but the harder it is to accelerate. I recommend to rent at a local surf shop or find a friend with an extra board.;
, See How to Wax a Surfboard.

, Expect on 1–2 foot (0.3–0.6 m) days, the 3 foot (0.9 m) wave of the day. Look for middle level tides as they usually yield waves. Long boarders should avoid waves where they ""wall-up"" in other words, there is no rolling barrel to ride.

, It's best to position yourself in the middle of the board bisecting the center of the board, lengthwise along the stringer.

, You do this by adjusting yourself forward and back along the center of the board. Usually the most efficient place to paddle from is when the nose of your board is just out of the water. You'll know you've found the sweet spot by how little effort it takes to make you and the board move.

, Arching your shoulders back while planting your abs to the board raises your leverage and helps propel you better with fewer strokes. Not to mention it helps you be able to get a better view of what swells are coming your way.

, Pick an area with fewer surfers that way there are less obstacles and people to worry about. Sit on your board as you wait, work on your balance and enjoy the water. This is my favorite part... the anticipation. Work on turning but leaning back on the tail and spinning your feet and making wide sweeping strokes with cupped hands.

, This is where most people fail. Not much is needed but you can't rely on the wave to accelerate you. With bigger boards accelerating enough to catch the wave could be a problem for new paddlers. Ask a friend to help push you into a wave or work on your paddling until you find that sweet spot and can drop in and go to next step.
If you nose dive as you're dropping in, one of two things will help stop this:


Backup on your board and put more weight back






The wave is getting too steep for your board, so catch the wave and drop in at an angle rather than straight.






When standing, stay crouched until momentum is gained







, Do it fast! Remember, you can never do it fast enough. The faster you can stand the more likely other surfers will clear your path or give you right of way. If someone has caught a wave between you and where the wave is breaking from, back off the wave. It is proper surfer etiquette and will save you dings and bruises. Remember to communicate as most surfers will be happy to help you out and to not get in a collision course.

, Get the feel for the stability of the board and the power of the wave or lack of it. Find the right angle that keeps you going and when comfortable try adjusting your footing and move about the board.

, Beyond this, occasionally have a long ride all the way to shore. The wave will never be perfect, there will be dead spots that a longboard can connect the peaks with and only the most talented short boarders can. To connect the small peaks use these techniques to get just a bit more speed:


Pounding the board up and down. Lift the board nose up and pound it down. Shortboarders are good at this, imitate their energetic pounding.






Run up to the nose to get more weight forward and to angle the board downwards. Scoot the board forward by jumping and landing with both feet and jerk the board forward. After the board scoots forward, you will be standing further back on the board where you can pound the board again.






Do and up/ down and instantly paddle with deep, double hand strokes. After the board is riding the wave again, jump up to your feet in one motion and continue steering and pounding. Practice on dry land, the instantaneous moving from the stand up to the prone position and vice versa.







, Get in the water as often as you can. Everyday for a week and you'll see yourself improve overnight. Watch surf videos like endless summer and ES2 and watch other surfers and their moves, how they walk the boards, hang five, ten, do cool tricks, catch waves, cut back and attempt to mimic them. All the while keep perfecting your paddling, turning, balance and speed at popping up to standing and you'll be a pro in no time. Bring a friend and have fun! There is nothing better than to share the experience of being out on the water with a good bud.

Make sure you know if you are regular(go forward with your left foot) or goofy (go forward with your right foot).,
Put your front foot on the front of the board in a comfortable position (mostly likely in the middle of the panel).

,
Push off with the back foot.,
Once you feel balanced, you should slowly start wiggling your back foot.

,
If you are unsure the safety of pushing off with your back foot whilst the board is held upright, lay the board tilted away from you, plant both feet correctly whilst its still lays on the ground, twist the front pad upright then propel.,
To do a tight turn, twist the front right or left and twist the back the opposite direction.

Take care of your new purchase!",How to Select a Wetsuit for Surfing," If you're not living in a tropical area and plan on surfing year round, you're going to need a wetsuit to help you stay warm in colder autumn, winter and spring conditions.


In warm areas like southern California, you can pretty much get by with two different types of wetsuits, a ""spring"" suit, which is also used in autumn and perhaps the summer depending on your tolerance levels. A full suit is recommended for the winter months. The full suit covers the entire body, from the neck to the feet and to the wrists.;
, Wetsuits have various thicknesses that are measured in millimeters. For example, a 3/2 will have a 3 mil thickness on the chest and back, a 2 mil thickness on the arms and legs. Most wetsuit companies offer 3 or 4 models with various features. Often the spring suit is the same as the full suit, minus the legs of course, for a particular model.

, The least expensive models will offer fewer features. The way the seams are sewn, for example, will vary on the inexpensive wetsuits and the more expensive models.


Less expensive models won't have taped seams either. Taped seams help keep the water out of the wetsuit by providing a barrier over the seams. The tape is applied so it makes a nice strong adhesion to the wetsuit material itself. It also helps the seams stay together longer.The type of neck enclosure also has a bearing on the cost of the wetsuit. Many wetsuits used to be made with a pull over type of enclosure. Most surfers found them awkward and uncomfortable, and they have now fallen out of favor. The more traditional velcro closure for the neck is now more common.

, Here's a quick guide to appropriate wetsuits temperatures:


55 - 65 degree water temperature - For real comfort, a 4/3 with taped seams, if you handle cold reasonably well, a 3/2 will suffice. The warmer you stay, the longer you can be in the water.
66 - 70 degree water temperature - A Spring suit of 2/1 or 3/2 should be ample for a two hour session.
70+ degrees; Most people trunk it at these temps or wear a rash guard or 1 mil jacket. The rash guard protects from abrasion caused by the wax on the deck of the board. It also provides some UV protection. A jacket will help you stay warmer as it keeps the wind off fairly well.

, There are some high end models that offer wool lining. These can be very warm and very expensive. Proper care of a wool lined wetsuit is paramount in order to maintain it's quality and usefulness for an extended period.

, Some of the high end wetsuits are made of materials that are evolutionary. The environmental concerns of the use of neoprene, etc. have forced the industry to look at other resources to be used to make suits, and they have been successful. There is lots of information available about the high end environmentally conscious suits, so suffice it to say that if you are in a financial position to be able to afford one, and are concerned with the environment, by all means...

, When you're out shopping for a wetsuit, although they are awkward to try on, do so! Consult the dealer for an appropriate size and squeeze your way in. Don't be surprised if you work up a sweat, a dry wetsuit in a surf store dressing room is a hot place to be!

, Not constricting, but snug. The neoprene will stretch ever so slightly with use, so getting it snug now will mean that it will fit properly longer. If you're a person with long legs, make certain that a full suit reaches to the bottom of your ankles, almost to the top of your foot. If you have a long torso, make certain there are no binds constricting your arms and in the crotch area.

, There should not be loose threads hanging about, and the zipper should be sewn straight up the back. Most wetsuit companies have stringent quality controls that avoid shipping sub standard suits out, but it happens, so best to check it before you buy it.

, Do they appear to be well crafted or of shoddy workmanship? If the suit is taped, are the ends of the tape properly adhered to the suit, or are they beginning to peel off? Does the zipper transit smoothly while you are trying on the suit? Both up and down?

, A wetsuit works by trapping a thin layer of water between your skin and the suit itself. Your body temperature warms the water and helps you stay warm. It is unavoidable however that you will get a cold stream of water down your neck, down your arm or up your leg at some time. This is completely normal and to be expected. The water will warm soon after entering, and you will be able to maintain a comfortable body temperature and complete your session.

, Regardless of how much you spend or how well you take care of your wetsuit, you can only expect to get 5 years good use of it. They wear out. The neoprene will crack and split, you'll get tears, abrasions that work their way through the material. It's great to have a newer wetsuit, but if you take care of the one you have, it should serve you well for many years.

Get on your board.,
Ride a wave


On a sand dune, place your board at a 45 degree angle facing downward.",How to Prepare Yourself for Your First Surf2,"


Trace the outline of your board in the sand.
Make a few marks where your feet should ideally land.
Do a few push-ups with the final one resulting in a jump up, trying to land your feet on those marks (centre fin rear and n/e/w/s centre of board).
Doing this often on land, even in your living room with a chalk outline will make the motion automatic.

,
Lie down on your board. Ask yourself how it feels.
Imagine the dune is moving forward, pushing you, lifting you to your feet.
Put your hands down palm flat, just on the inside of the rails, approx. two fifths of the way down from the nose (depending on the board).
Then jump in one motion to your feet, trying to land with you back foot centered between the rear fin(s) and your front foot in the center of the board.
Do this drill as often as possible, until the move is automatic.

Grab your board and approach the water.,
Paddle out until you find a small wave, even whitewash is good to start with (but even better it it's got some projectile juice!).,

Repeat as often as possible.

",How to Prepare Yourself for Your First Surf3,"


Let the water come to you, splash over your toes, and invite you in. Enter with respect.
Start paddling out. The nose of the board should float about an inch above the water, more if you arch your back. This helps you find the *sweet* spot with minimum drag and maximum projection with each paddle.

If the nose of your board is higher (more drag), shift up a little. If it's lower (nosediving), shift down.


Feel the balance.

Shift up carefully to avoid hurting your joints.,
Avoid choosing gears that ""crisscross"" the chain.",How to Shift Gears on a Bike," If you want to learn how to shift gears on your bike, you'll need a bike that has gears in the first place. Luckily, this is easy to check. Start by looking at the pedals. In the center of the pedals, there should be one or more metal rings with teeth on the outside that fit into the chain. These are the the front gears. Count how many gears you see.Most bikes will have between one and three front gears.;
, Now, look at the back wheel. You should see the chain run from the front gears over a different set of rings at the center of the wheel. These are the rear gears.Count how many you see.


If your bike has gears, there will usually be more rear gears than front gears. Some bikes have ten or more.

, Now, just multiply the number of front gears by the number of rear gears. This tells you the total number of gears your bike has.Some people also call this the number of ""speeds.""


For example, if you have three gears in the front and six gears in the back, your bike has 3 × 6 = 18 gears (or ""speeds""). If you have one gear in the front and seven gears in the back, your bike has 1 × 7 = 7 gears.
If your bike only has one gear in the front and one in the rear, it has 1 × 1 = 1 gear. This sort of bike is called a ""fixed-gear"" or ""fixie."" Unfortunately, you can't shift gears on fixed-gear bikes.

, Bikes with gears almost always have hand controls on the handlebars to use for shifting. When you use the left hand controls, a metal loop called a derailleur (""de-railer"") shifts the chain from side to side to make it catch on a new front gear. There are a few different mechanisms for shifting that are common on bikes. These include:


Grip shifters that you work by turning your wrist
Small levers above or below the handlebars that you work with your thumbs
Larger levers next to the handbrakes that you work with your finger tips
More rarely, electronic shifters or levers mounted on the frame of the bike

, The rear gears have their own derailleur. Using the right hand controls will move the rear derailleur side to side, making the chain catch on a new rear gear. The rear gears almost always use the same mechanism as the front gears.


If you can't keep your hand controls straight while you're riding, remember: ""right = rear.""

, You can change your gears to make riding your bike easier in certain situations. For example, shifting into a ""lower"" gear lets you pedal quicker and easier, but each pedal won't push you as far. There are two ways to do shift down:


Shift into a smaller gear in the front.

Shift into a bigger gear in the back.


, The opposite of shifting down is shifting up into a ""higher"" gear. These gears make it harder to pedal, but each pedal will push you further and make you go faster. There are also two ways to shift up:


Shift into a bigger gear in the front.

Shift into a smaller gear in the back.


, A good way to get the hang of shifting is to simply start doing it! Go someplace safe and flat (like a park) and start pedaling forward. Try using one of the hand controls to shift up or down. You should hear the chain click or rattle and you'll feel your pedals get either easier or harder to push depending on whether you shifted down or up. Try using both sets of controls to shift in both directions until you get the hang of them.

, If you're used to a bike that needed you to pedal backwards to brake, this can take some time getting used to. The chain can only catch on new gears if it is stretched tight, which requires you to pedal forward. If you shift while you're pedaling backwards or not pedaling at all, the chain won't be tight enough to catch. When you start pedaling again, it may rattle around or slip off of the gear. This isn't something you'll want to happen while riding.

, The first few pedals you take on your bike are often some of the hardest because you need to go from standing still to cruising speed. Whenever you start riding, shift down to a fairly low gear to make it quicker and easier to get back up to speed.


You'll also want to do this whenever you come to a complete stop and start pedaling again (like at a red light).
If you know you're going to stop riding soon, it's a good idea to shift into a low gear so you can get started easier next time. This is especially true if you know you'll have to get out of a tricky spot — like if your home's driveway goes uphill.

, As you get going faster and faster, you'll find that the lower gears start to feel ""too easy"" after a while. If you want to keep building up speed, shift up. You'll notice the pedals feel more difficult to push and you'll keep accelerating.


If you're riding around on moderate terrain (like city streets with a few minor hills), a ""middle"" gear will usually work well for your default cruising speed. For example, if you're on an 18-speed (three gears in front, six in the rear), using the second gear in the front and the third in the rear should give you a good ""middle of the road"" option.

, This is an important skill to learn — without it, you'll be stuck walking your bike up larger hills. It's almost impossible to get up a hill in high gear. However, lower gears let you pump your way up the hill slowly and steadily without too much extra effort.You may find it difficult to slowly climb hills in a low gear at first. Since you're moving at a low speed, it's a little more difficult to keep balanced than normal. However, moving slowly means it's easy to drop a foot to the ground if you lose your balance.

, If you're trying to build up as much speed as possible, using higher gears on this type of terrain is the way to go. Gradually shifting to your highest gears will allow you to keep accelerating at a steady rate until you reach your top speed. Be sure to ride especially carefully when you're going this fast — it's easier to hurt yourself.


Being in a high gear is one of the only ways to be able to speed up while you're going downhill. Lower gears won't turn the chain quick enough to keep up with the wheels when you're rolling downhill, making it basically impossible to speed up except from the hill itself.

, It can feel satisfying to ""pump"" your bike into motion in a high gear, but it may be bad for your body in the long run. Straining hard to push a bike that's in too high of gear can put stress on your joints (especially your knees), leading to soreness and even joint problems over time. It's also not as good of exercise for your heart and lungs as pedaling in a lower gear at a steadier pace.To be clear, you can use your bike's higher gears, but you should only shift into them gradually after you've already built up speed.

, As you shift your gears, if you look down at the chain, you may notice that it sometimes points in a slightly diagonal direction. This isn't a problem unless you pick gears that make the chain run at extreme diagonal angles. This can make the chain wear down and break over time and can cause rattling and slippage in the short term. In general, you'll want to avoid having the chain on either the biggest or smallest gears in both the front and in the rear. In other words:Don't use the largest front gear with the larger rear gears.

Don't use the smallest front gear with the smaller rear gears.

Check your cleats regularly.",How to Use Clipless Pedals," Not all cleats will fit into all pedals, so when you are purchasing these it’s important to make sure they’ll fit together. If you purchase from a bike shop, an employee should be able to help you make sure you get ones that go together.Some cleats and pedals are made so they only go together as a set, while others will be interchangeable.
You will have the option of pedals with clip-ins on both sides, which are good for commuting. Other pedals have a clip on only one side with the other side being flat, which is good if you want to ride without clips sometimes.;
, It’s important to have shoes that are made specifically for cycling because they are made to fit the cleats. Having an expert attach your cleats can be helpful to make sure they are angled on the shoes correctly. Most bike shops should have someone who can help you with the process.


The centerline of your shoe is not exactly the same as the centerline of the cleat, which is why it can be helpful to have someone more experienced attach them.
Cycling shoes will have small holes in the bottom where the cleat screws onto the shoe. The exact placement of the cleats is partly personal preference, so if you attach them and try them out on the pedals, you can adjust them if they don’t feel quite right.

, Float refers to how much your shoes can move around in the clips. When you start out, it’s better to make them loose until you get used to how it feels having your feet attached to the pedals. Lower tension can also make it easier to unclip while you get used to that.As you get used to clipless pedals, you can tighten the tension up to increase your riding efficiency.
To adjust the tension, use an allen wrench. On the part of the pedal with the spring, you’ll see a small hole where the allen wrench is inserted. You’ll also see on the side a small gauge that moves as you loosen and tighten the tension.

, The cleat and pedal attach to each other to hold your foot in place. When the mechanism engages, you’ll hear and feel a click with lets you know you’re clipped in.It’s best to clip in your non-dominant foot first so you can stay balanced on your dominant foot. It’s also easier to push off with your stronger foot.

, Once you clip your first foot in, move the pedal so that it’s ready to drive downward and propel your bike forward. Giving a hard initial pedal with this foot will help you build momentum before you clip your second foot in.It’s easier to clip in the second foot when you are already moving rather than trying to balance the bike while you clip in.

, You do not have to have both feet clipped in to be able to pedal your bike. You can pedal a bit with only one foot clipped in until you gain momentum. Once you are going steady, clip your second foot in and pedal as you normally would.


Likewise, when nearing a stop, you can unclip and continue pedaling with that foot as you slow down.

, One of the biggest mistakes for new clipless pedal users is coming to a complete stop before unclipping. Once the bike is stopped, it will be much harder to balance. Anticipate your stop early enough that you can unclip one foot.Stop pedaling and get your dominant foot pedal into the lower position as you prepare to stop. Unclip this and keep pedaling until you are ready to stop.

, As long as your foot is pointing forward, it will stay locked to the pedal. Once you turn the heel outward, it disengages the clip mechanism. This may be hard to master, as it feels a little unnatural to turn your foot that way.


Make sure your foot is parallel to the ground, not tilted forward or backward. This will ensure the mechanism is aligned right and will easily disengage.

, Even though you are pedaling in the same motion as you would on flat pedals, it feels a little different with clipless pedals. If you can set your bike up on a stationary stand and practice getting clipped in, feel the difference in pedaling, and practice unclipping, you’ll feel more comfortable once you’re on the road.You probably don’t need to do this for weeks, or even days, just long enough to feel comfortable. If you ride for five minutes and you feel confident, then get out on the road. If it does take a few days to get the right, don’t feel bad.
It’s better to spend a little long getting used to your new pedals than to end up out on the road feeling uncomfortable with riding.

, Keeping your balance when you clip in is one of the hardest parts to learn. If you practice by balancing against something stable, you can get the motion down. While holding the wall, clip in both feet, pedal backwards to stay in place, and then unclip both feet.


When you are ready to ride, you can still begin to clip in by leaning on the wall for support. If you do this on your first few trips out on the road, you’ll get the hang of it enough that you won’t need the wall anymore.

, When you are first starting out riding with clipless pedals, you can make it easier for yourself by staying on level ground. It’s also good to have something soft nearby so that if you do fall, as most first timers do, you’ll have a cushion rather than falling on concrete., Cleats wear out over time, and if you don’t check them for wear, they may eventually snap while you are riding. Since this could cause an accident, it’s good to check them on occasion to see how they are holding up.


Cleats will wear out faster if you walk on them consistently, so it’s best to avoid this as much as possible. Consider having extra shoes to change into. You can also get rubber guards that go over the cleat to help protect it.

Straighten the front wheel before bringing it down.",How to Wheelie on a Mountain Bike (for Beginners)1," You should wear a helmet just when doing general riding. So it is especially important to wear one when attempting a trick like a wheelie, where you're more in danger of falling than usual. And you'll get the respect of your friends and fellow riders for showing that you're not reckless, and are taking bike riding seriously.;
, You might want to begin practicing on a level grass field in case of a fall. Test the flatness of the field by riding through it once before beginning. Otherwise, if you're confident enough, find a slightly uphill dirt or concrete path. , You'll be sitting down for the whole trick, and the lower you sit the better-positioned your center of gravity will be. But make sure you're able to sit firmly on the saddle without slipping off the back. Test this by lifting the front wheel at a standstill and leaning back on the seat. , If you start in too high or too low a gear, it will be difficult to pedal with enough force to lift the front wheel. Adjust the gears higher or lower as you find the right speed for your ability and the terrain. , This allows you to put as much drive as possible into your initial pedaling. You'll want to initiate the first thrust from 11 o'clock with your strongest leg, which should be the leg you usually begin pedaling with from a standstill. , Bend your arms and move your upper body over the front of the bike in a crouch position, but stay sitting.This will help you to ""load the spring""--you're positioning your body toward the front at first in order to create more force for the sharp backward movement that will follow. , This should be done with a sharp movement, giving a strong pedal stroke at the same time. Let your arms straighten without pulling the handlebars back (the front wheel should pop up without your needing to pull back).


Continue pedaling at a consistent rate. If you stop pedaling, the front wheel tends to fall back down.
Keep your fingers on the rear brake--this is your safety in case you feel yourself losing balance and tilting too far backward. , Feather the rear brake (to lower the front wheel) or pedal (to lift the front wheel) to adjust the vertical balance. To help balance sideways, flare your knees or arms out, or turn the handlebars in the direction opposite to the side the bike is leaning to. , Lean slightly forward and let the front wheel land softly back down. Be careful not to lean too far forward, just try to shift your weight back to center."

Test the adjustment.",How to Size a Mountain Bike," To know what size bike is right for you (what length seat tube you need), start with your inseam. To do this:


Stand up straight with your back against a wall, a book between your legs like the bike's seat.
Use a tape measure to calculate the distance between your crotch and the floor.
Multiply that number (in inches) by .67. Subtract 4. That's the length your seat tube should be.

If you have a C-C frame, multiply by .65.

;
, If you already have a bike, you'll want to know if it's the right size for you. Here's how to measure your frame:Find the top of the seat tube (where the seat clamp meets the post).
Measure from that point to middle of the axle that holds the crank arms together.
That number is your seat tube length. Does it match your ideal size? Check out the basic sizing system below if you're considering buying.

, This is a pretty generic test to see if your bike is the right height for you. That number you got when you measured your crotch to the floor? You want that to be about 2"" greater than the height of your bike at the top tube (the one that goes from the seat to the handlebars).


To execute this test, put your leg over the bike's top tube and straddle it. For a mountain bike, there should ideally be about 2"" between your crotch and the top tube. Make sure you're wearing your cycling shoes!

, Once you know how tall your bike should be, you'll need to know where the handlebars should fall into place for your particular torso length. To determine whether you have a long or short reach, you'll need your ""ape index.""


Measure your arm span (fingertip to fingertip) minus your height. A positive ape index (your arm span is greater than your height) means you should consider the next largest size; a negative ape index means you should (your height is greater than your arm span) go for the smaller of the two sizes.This is a great indicator, especially, if you're between sizes. Height and inseam should be your main two considerations; this should seal the deal.
If for some reason you're still in doubt, go smaller. It's easier to bail on a smaller bike than a large one.



, This is done by measuring your torso length and your arm length. Here's the specifics:


Stand up with your back straight against a wall.
Measure from your knuckles to your collarbone.
Measure from your crotch (the same place as before) to the hollow at the base of your neck.
Add the results together and divide by 2.
Take that number and add 4. This is the ideal length of your top tube.

To clarify, say your arm length is 24 and your torso length is 26. That's 50 / 2 = 25. 25+4 = 29. 29 is then what the length of your top tube should be.



, Now that you have your seat tube numbers, how does it correspond to general bike sizes? Different companies do vary a little, but here are the basics:XS bike: 13-14in (generally for those between 5ft and 5ft 4in)
S: 14-16in (generally for those between 5ft 4in and 5ft 7in)
M: 16-18in (generally for those between 5ft 7in and 5ft 10in)
L: 18-20in (generally for those between 5ft 10in and 6ft 1in)
XL: 20-22in (generally for those over 6ft 1in)

, Sometimes it's not the math that's important. Actually, all the time. What is always important is how the bike feels. Here's how your body should be:Arms: Your shoulders should be relaxed and your elbows slightly bent.

Saddle: You want your heel to just touch the top of the lower pedal with your leg straight. Make sure the crank is right at the bottom of its stroke.

Knees: With each pedal at the bottom of its stroke, make sure your knees are very slightly bent.

Shifters and brake levers: Don’t just leave them as is! Experiment moving them further in or tilting them.

, Sizing systems vary across companies, but they also vary across bikes. If you're online searching for your next gem, keep this in mind. Here are some basics:


Road, cyclo-cross and hybrid bike sizes generally run 3-4"" bigger for the same rider height, like in the chart above. If you're looking at one of these, adjust as necessary.
Hardtail bikes and full-suspension bikes are sized the same. The main differences are cost and what kind of roads they can handle. Full-suspension bikes have much better shocks and can handle more aggressive riding. The hardtail is more versatile and lighter, however, in trade., With your measurements, adjust the length of the seat tube. You'll need a tape measure and a wrench. Here's how:


Place the end of the tape measure where the pedal crank attaches to the bicycle.
Stretch the tape measure out to the seat height calculated using your inseam.
Use a wrench to loosen the bolt that holds the seat post.
Swivel the seat post up or down into the proper position.
Use a wrench to tighten the bolt.
Adjust the seat so that the saddle's lowest point is level with the upper end of the tape measure.

, Loosen the bolt at the base of the handlebars. Use a standard wrench, turning to the left. To adjust the handlebars:


Lean as far forward and down over the handlebars as you can while remaining comfortable. It's best to assume a position you naturally go to.
Raise or lower the handlebars into the most comfortable position.
Tighten the handlebars. Use a wrench to tighten the bolt around the handlebar stem.

, You want your saddle to be completely level. A minority of people prefer it tilted up or down, but most ride best with a level seat. Two things to keep in mind:


Tilt the saddle up or down so that your pelvis is level when you sit on the saddle.
Tilt the saddle so that you do not slide forward or backward when sitting on the saddle.

, You wouldn't buy a car without giving it a test drive, right? You should never have to swivel your hips, stretch out your arms, tilt to the side, or ever make yourself even slightly uncomfortable. Here's how to test your bike:


Sit on your bicycle with your shoes on. Your hips should be facing straight forward.
Position the pedals so that one pedal is at the lowest point in its rotation. The pedal will be as close to the ground as possible.
Place one foot on the low pedal. Your knee should be bent slightly. Your heel should rest on the pedal.
Lean onto the handlebars, keeping your elbows slightly bent.
If anything doesn't feel 100% comfortable, readjust as necessary.

"
"
Wear a Helmet.,
Start on a slight downhill slope at medium speed.,
Position your feet and hold the pedals in place.,
Lean forward over the handlebars, then lean back quickly.,
Center your weight over the rear wheel.,
Keep the front wheel 1 to 1 ½ feet off the ground.,
Bring the front wheel down steadily.",How to Wheelie on a Mountain Bike (for Beginners)2," You'll be going faster while doing the manual wheelie than when doing the pedal wheelie, making a potential fall more dangerous. You'll feel more at ease wearing a helmet by knowing that if you make a mistake and fall, you'll be well protected.

, It will be easier to coast with this wheelie on a decline once you've figured out your balance. Since you won't be pedaling, the downhill slope will help keep the bike moving at a steady speed.

, Set the cranks level with each other at the 9 o’clock and 3 o’clock position, and stand up on the pedals with your knees slightly bent. Your weight should be just back of center. The cranks will rotate slightly as you move backwards, but otherwise you won't need to pedal., The front wheel should be lifted mostly by the shift of your weight backwards, and only slightly by lifting the handlebars. Lock your arms straight, keeping your feet level with each other on the pedals. Your rear end should be behind the seat at this point, and your body should have a “U” shape, with the arms and legs straightened., To be able to coast with the front wheel off the ground, you’ll need to find a point of balance over the rear wheel and hold it there. As your arms straighten and you lean back, push forward on the pedals with your feet (but don’t pedal) to adjust your balance. , Steady your balance and coast for as long as you need to. If you feel yourself falling too far backward, feather the rear brakes to bring the wheel down.If the front wheel begins to fall forward, rock your hips in a backward motion while pushing outward on the pedals. Most obstacles on the trail won’t be much higher than a few inches (tree branches, rocks). But in order for you to be able to coast with the front wheel off the ground, you need to fix your center of balance over the rear wheel, and this should bring up the front wheel at least one foot.

, Either feather the rear brakes or shift your center of gravity forward to bring the wheel softly down. If you're avoiding obstacles on the trail, make sure the path is clear before finishing the wheelie--bringing the wheel down directly onto a rock or branch could cause a fall.

Have a professional install the shoe clips or connectors.,
Beware of sudden stops.,
Place foam pipe insulation over the top bar (the one between the seat and the steering wheel) until you become adept at disengaging your shoes and recognizing when you may might need to make an emergency stop.,
Disengage your clips from your pedals anytime you are near these hazards (you can still keep pedaling):


Intersections.",How to Safely Ride a Bicycle With Shoe Connectors," You will need to purchase your bicycle shoes at the same time (to install the shoe part of the clips into), unless you already own a pair. Do not leave until you have engaged the clips and disengaged the clips. You don't want to find yourself stuck in them. Have the professional adjust the clips so that they are firm, but easy to disengage (by twisting your feet).;
, The greatest danger faced by a bicyclist using shoe connectors is the sudden (unexpected) stop. If the shoes are still connected to the pedals, the rider will fall over, hitting the cement with his legs and having the bicycle then land on his legs (which hurts even worse). Hopefully, he will not fall over in traffic. It is vitally important that when any potentially dangerous situation arises that the rider disengages from his clips.

, It will lessen the impact of falling over.

, A wrapper from a Cliff Bar or a Snickers bar weighs less than an ounce and is not going to weigh you down. Put it in your pack and throw it away in a proper trash receptacle at the end of your ride.

, When it's necessary to pass, try to stay on the trail if at all possible.

,  If a trail is closed if will usually say something about it at the trailhead. Usually, two logs across the trail means it's closed. Trails are 99% of the time closed for a reason so don't ride on closed trails.

, Carrying more speed while passing mean less time to react to any situation that may occur. Slow down and stay in control of your bike.

, This is especially important if you are passing a horseback rider, since horses are not predators and will spook. It's wise to ask the rider how they want me to pass since they will get the shortest end of the stick if the horse bucks or runs. When passing a biker or pedestrian, try to say ""On your left"" or ""On you right"".

, Avoid passing another user before a turn (especially if it is a blind turn). Pass at a wide point in the trail.

, Think of those signs on the interstate about passing a truck that read ""leave more space."" Make sure not to cut the other user off because nothing is more annoying than having to brake and lose precious momentum because some jerk cut you off.

, If you meet a fellow biker, the rider who is going uphill has the right of way.

, Start out slow, riding green or beginner classifies single track trails, then work your way up from there.

, Nobody wants their ride ruined from seeing your brains splattered across the trail because you hit a rock or tree and weren't wearing a helmet. Your brain is the most important part of your body.

,  Although it might be amusing to see a rider wearing a speedo, you'd look pretty foolish. Bring plenty of layers and keep in mind that you may change several hundred feet in elevation and that it is colder at higher elevations. Make sure that your bike is in good running order, that your gears shift well, your brakes work and that your tires are properly inflated.

Start by finding an appropriate level open space to practice in.,
Place two rocks, cones, or water bottles 4 feet (1.2 m) apart near one end of the area.,
Ride towards the line at a running pace.,
Switch to using only your rear brake.,
Switch to using only your front brake.,
Resume using both brakes simultaneously.,
Pump your arms downwards quickly and with force just as you start to apply your brakes.,
Pump with your legs into the pedals to increase force on the rear wheel.

,
Keeping your pedals level, drop your heels so your feet point up 30 degrees while braking.,
Compare your stopping distance and control while braking to when you started, you should now be able to stop in a much shorter distance.

",How to Improve Your Braking," A dirt parking lot or short grass field is ideal.;
, These make your target stopping line. You should have plenty of room to ride straight at the gap between them to build up speed, and you should have plenty of space on the other side of them in case you don't stop right on the line.

, Stop pedaling and coast with both feet level. Squeeze both brake levers and try to stop with your front wheel perfectly on the line (center of the wheel between the cones). If either wheel skids, release some pressure on the appropriate brake lever. Repeat several times building up speed. You should have a good idea of where you need to start applying your brakes in order to stop on the line.

, You will need more stopping distance, so go back to your original speed. Practice until you can stop on the line consistently using only your back brake.

, Again, start slow and work up. It is very important that you not lock-up (skid) your front wheel. Practice this until you can stop consistently on the line.

, You will find you can stop in a much more controlled manner than you could before.

, The motion is much like a very fast push-up. This momentarily increases the force on your front tire, giving the tire more grip. With more grip you can brake harder without locking your tires.

,, This allows your legs to take much of force instead of your arms. This will let you ride longer without getting tired, as well as give you better control of the bike while braking.

This is very important as it will make a difference to ask, before just building.


The Forestry (commission) Service will destroy an illegal trail if they find it.
Follow proper building procedures. A good place to find this info is IMBA.;
, Forests are a good place, but they must have a trail through them. Forests work well because they have obstacles already there.


Find a place that is legal, not wilderness boundary, not someone else's yard and not your mom's garden. An ideal place is your own undeveloped private property, or somewhere the city has permitted you to develop. Make sure there are no cliffs or other extreme hazards on the way.

, The dirt can't be too wet, or too dry. Make sure its perfect dirt for your style of riding.

You don't want your trail to be too steep or to flat. The last thing you want is to build a cool trail and realise that its too steep. If you can walk down it with out having to catch yourself, then it's prefect. If you can run down it without going to fast, or have to crawl down, it's not a good place.

, This requires an engineer and people to look at the path the trail will take. If it is a personal trail and you already have an idea in mind, walk through it and make sure it is what you want.

, Even with a flow trail, which is an easy way to make smooth trails (discussed later) needs to not have trees, rocks, or excess shrubbery in the way. This may require getting help from volunteers or workers. To clear trees, dig around until the top of the first roots are exposed, then cut there. This ensures it won't grow back, and that it won't stick up as a stump. Rocks require creativity. Use tools to lever out bigger boulders. Smaller rocks can be picked by hand or raked.

, To make your trail just dirt, depending on the location, soil, length of trail, and available resources, there are different methods. Raking out by hand all the grass and weeds can be tedious. Tearing up the trail, churning the soil is good for long lasting smoother trails. A tiller machine or hand pushed tiller could work. If you are willing to spend a little, make a flow trail. They are incredibly smooth and can be made with perfect berms and jumps. The machines to make a flow trail can be rented or bought. Look them up online for more info.

, A steamroller or pulled roller can pack down the course initially. Vehicles may be required to ride it down to be more solid, as long as the riders refrain from skidding and peeling out. Ride or hike over the trail to get it even harder. Do not allow horses on your trail for the first year or so.

, Add wooden obstacle trails.


Try to build some jumps out of wood or dirt. Make them a reasonable height but not crazy. Perhaps 1-3 feet off the ground. Before you make the ramps though, make sure you have space to slow down when you get off the jump -- you don't want to ride right into a tree or mound or dirt.
A fun idea that is common in trails with wooden ramps is a see-saw. Make a wide slot in a fixed stump or secure base between 1 and up to even 6 feet (1.8 m), depending on the length of the see-saw and steepness you want. These are used by riding up, and getting dropped of on the other side. They can be put in steep drops for fun or to smooth the descent, or on a flat length just for fun. They are not suggested on turns or berms.
Another wooden obstacle is a fixed log for balancing. This can extend forward and have a safe sloping drop on either side and in front.

, This is crucial, because you don't want to stop on a narrow area, as you can lose your balance and fall., See what you can change to make it more fun as you all try it out."

Make sure your bike is in good condition.,
Be ready to jump.,
Visualize your jump.,
Bike towards your ramp.,
Compress your bike once the front wheel reaches the lip of the ramp.,
Explode as the back wheel reaches the lip of the ramp.,
Enjoy your flight.,
Return to your ready position.,
Land on both wheels simultaneously.,
Push the bike towards the ground.",How to Jump a Mountain Bike," This is an important part of mountain biking in general but is essential for you to safely jump. Your landing will place much more force than usual on its frame. Additionally, malfunctions become much more dangerous if they happen while you are airborne.Do a safety check before every ride., You should practice biking for a while before trying to jump. If you are inexperienced, you are likely to fail the jump and get yourself injured. A successful jump also requires a certain amount of general physical fitness. Keep your body in shape before jumping., Before you attempt any kind of jump, look at your ramp. Plan your route to it and picture landing on the other side. A general rule of thumb is that if you can't see yourself landing safely, the jump should not be attempted. If you see a lot of rocks and debris along your route and on the other side, find a different place to jump.


Practice jumping using a man-made ramp that is gently sloped and low to the ground. This will allow you to perfect your jumps in a safe, simple environment.Once you have mastered safer jumps, you may choose to use more challenging ramps. Popular ramps for mountain biking are man-made dirt jumps and natural outcroppings.

, Keep your bike at a moderate speed, riding out of the saddle. You don't want to go so fast as to make a mistake, especially when you're first learning. On the other hand, if you go too slowly you will not be able to clear the jump., Stop pedaling. Push down on the front suspension through your hands on the handlebars. Lean with your weight forward. Don't lean past the handlebars, which may cause your bike to pitch forward. Do not return to your seat until after you've finished your landing., ""Exploding"" is the term used by cyclists to describe when they stand up straight after compressing, pulling the front of the bike with them as they lean back. You will be shifting your weight from your hands backward to your feet and subsequently the second wheel. Shift your posture from one that is bunched up to one that is nearly standing. Keep your hands on the handlebars and your feet on the pedals at all times., If you have properly compressed and exploded, you should now be airborne. Take a moment to experience one of the most entertaining parts of biking. Keep your body loose and avoid stiffening up.If your bike did not leave the ground or you got off balance and fell, review the steps and try again.

, The ready position is the default stance you take while cycling. Keep both your elbows and knees bent and out while riding out of the saddle. Do this before you land., Make sure your bike is straight with the wheels parallel to the ground while you are still in the air. Shift your weight to level out your bike. Landing with both wheels at once will help absorb the shock better and keep you from washing out., Pushing the bike into the landing will create more traction, allowing the wheels to rebalance and grip the ground more easily. Use your arms and legs as your bike's primary suspension. Keep them loose and ready to soak up the impact."

Put your bike saddle in a lower than normal position.,
Roll up to your desired place in a standing position.

,
Come to a stop with both brakes.,
Balance by tweaking the brakes and moving the front wheel slightly.

,
Roll out of the track stand by releasing the brakes and pedalling forwards.

,
Practice this trick until you can hold the track stand for about 4 seconds and be able to roll out of it.",How to Track Stand,";
,, Your strong foot should be on the forward pedal while turning the front wheel on a forty five degree angle towards your front foot.

,,, Then you have mastered the track stand!

Check the measurements of your wheels.,
Decide between using clincher or tubular tires.,
Decide between using tubed or tubeless tires.,
Use knobby, wide tires for muddy surfaces.,
Use semi-slick tires for harder surfaces.,

Use slick tires for asphalt.,
Use studded tires for ice.,
Use knobby or semislick tires for snow.",How to Pick Mountain Bike Tires," The two most common wheel sizes are 26 and 29 inch. If the bike already has tires, you can check their measurements and buy similar tires.;
, Both require different rims. Clincher tires have a bead which hooks onto the inside of the rim. Tubular tires are glued onto a specially designed rim.


Clincher tires are the most widely available.
Tubular tires are slightly lighter and stronger.
Tubular tires have a smaller chance of getting pitch flats.
When getting a flat tire at high speed, a tubular tire will not roll off the rim as long the tire is glued on properly.

, Solid tires are also used, but much less commonly. Tubed tires have an inner tube, tubeless tires don't. A tubeless tire has a bead which hooks onto the rim, preventing air from escaping.


Tubed tires are the most common.
A tubeless tire with a small hole will gently deflate while a tubed tire may burst like a balloon, leading to loss of control.

, There are lots of tires available with varying amounts of knob sizes, knob patterns and tire widths.

, The smoother center of a semi-slick tire gives good grip on hard and relatively soft surfaces while having less rolling resistance than knobby tires. The knobby edges help with cornering, allowing for more aggressive cornering. They also help a little in muddy conditions.

, That's right, nothing is stopping you from putting completely smooth tires on your mountain bike. In fact, it's what you should do if most of your riding takes place on asphalt and hard surfaces. You don't need to have a tire pattern for asphalt because the asphalt's surface is knobby enough on it's own.

Having a non-slick tire is inefficient even in wet conditions as you will never be able to reach a speed under your own power to allow for hydroplaning to occur. If you lose grip with a slick tire, for example on a very smooth surface like metal or ice, you would also lose grip with basically any other tread pattern.
Tread only slows you down on asphalt.

, You could get away with semislick or knobby tires with extreme caution but to cycle effectively and safely on ice, you need studs.


, This one is up to you, both patterns have comparable performance, with the knobby tires having better grip in deeper snow and the semislick having less resistance on smoother surfaces and lighter snow.


In deeper snow, tire width has a massive effect on grip. Wider tires will spread the weight of the bike and rider over a larger surface, meaning the tires will not sink into the snow as much. Fatbikes have oversized tires, more than 4 wide, giving them excellent versatility.

"
Get ready.,
Roll forward at moderate speed (15 to 20 km/h (9.3 to 12.4 mph)) with your weight over your rear wheel.

,
Rock your weight forward while progressively squeezing on the front brake.,
Sustain!,
Release the front brake and extend your legs to drop your rear wheel back onto the ground.

,
Rinse and repeat.",How to Do a Stoppie on a Mountain Bike," There's a good chance you'll get launched over your bars a couple times, so strap on your helmet, gloves, and pads. If you are rocking clipless pedals, switch to flats to make ejects easier. Find a big grassy area with no obstacles to practice in.;
,, Keep increasing the braking power until your rear wheel begins to lift. If you find that the rear wheel is pitching upward too quickly, release the brake immediately and move your weight rearward.

, Gently shift your weight back over the rear wheel to balance and keep yourself from going over the bars.

,, Increase your speed and amplitude to up the altitude. The faster you go, and the quicker you shift your weight forward, the higher the rear wheel will lift.

"
Choose the right gear ratio.,
Check your back brakes.,
Adjust your seat as desired.,
Lock out your back shocks.,
Find the proper training area.,
Get your front tire airborne.,
Continue pedaling.,
Tap the back brake.,
Increase your hang time.",How to Do a 5 Minute Wheelie on a Mountain Bike," When most people start off doing wheelies they put their gears into the “easy-to-pedal” mode, which means their chain in on the smallest cog on the front sprockets, and biggest cog on the back sprockets. This is fine when first starting out, but once you get more advanced, you’ll want your chain to be on the middle cog on the front sprockets, and somewhere around the middle cog on the back sprockets. The speed for your wheelie will be about 5–10 mph (8.0–16.1 km/h), and having the gear ratio set to “easy mode” will make you lose your wheelie due to excessive pedaling.;
, The back brake is the integral part of the long-wheelie, so make sure your brakes are powerful enough to bring you to a skidding stop when used at high speeds. Anything less and you’re liable to “loop it,” which means falling backwards and having a fart shoot out when your back slaps onto the pavement. While doing the wheelie you should have 1-2 fingers on the brake lever.

, Some people say lower your seat, some say make it higher. It is the most comfortable a little bit lower than your ""high"" setting of your seat. If it's too low, it will be harder to pedal, and if it's too high, well it's just pretty scary

, Doing wheelies on a hard tail is far easier than on a full suspension, but if you happen to have the latter, see if you can lock out your back shock. A bouncing back end will seriously affect your balance.

, Try to find a straight flat road that works up a slight incline. Wheeling uphill is far easier than down, and you’ll want conditions set to your advantage as much as possible in the beginning. Also, try to find a place with low wind. Even the slightest breeze can topple you.

, Get your bike lined up as straight as possible while in a slow roll. While pedaling down hard, lift the front tire as hard as you can. Don't pull on your handlebars. Use your weight to shift the bike back.

, Apply a hard, steady stroke once you're up in wheelie position.

, When you feel you’re about to flip over backwards (loop it), tap on the back brake to bring the front back down again, then counter the downward fall of your front tire with the force of your pedaling. It’s a delicate balance, but the truth is, you should always be “about to loop it.” As your get better you’ll notice you’ll actually WANT to be right on the edge of that balance point. When you can stick it there, you’ll be applying more breaks and your speed will remain slow and steady. Pedaling hard to try to keep up with a wheelie is the most common way to lose it, so don’t be afraid to lean way back and keep it right on the edge. With a little practice, you’ll find the sweet spot and hold it there longer and longer. Soon enough you’ll be wheeling around town like a champ and dodging flying panties and bra’s from your female admirers.

, Once you get more advanced you can do wheelies one handed, go off curbs, navigate turns, and even do circles. Nothing feels better than rifling off a sick wheelie, so even if it’s frustrating at first, stick with it!

Decide which type of bike you would like.,
Decide which suspension you want.,
Pick your wheel size.,
Choose an aluminum alloy frame.,
Choose how many gears you need.,
Choose a bike with disc brakes.,
Choose which size bike you need.",How to Buy a Mountain Bike1," There are many different kinds of mountain bikes. Each type specializes in a particular riding style. Based on what you will use your mountain bike for, decide whether you would like a cross country bike, trail bike, freeride bike, downhill bike, or trial/dirt jumping bike. If you are new to mountain biking and just want a general, standard mountain bike, choose a trail bike.Cross-Country Mountain Bikes - Cross-country bikes work well on cross-country trails, whether recreational or competitive. They are available as a full-suspension bike or a hardtail, which has front suspension only. They climb hills well, but aren’t as comfortable on the way back down.

Trail Mountain Bikes - Trail bikes are also known as ""all-mountain bikes"" because they work well for many applications. If you're looking for a multi-purpose mountain bike, this is the right type. It won’t be perfect for everything, but it can likely get the job done. This is a good mountain bike to start out on.

Freeride Mountain Bikes - Freeride bikes are full-suspension bikes that work well on aggressive trails with lots of jumps. They are tough bikes that will allow you to do stunts, but they aren’t the best for climbing hills.

Downhill Mountain Bikes - Downhill bikes are made to fly down hills. These bikes are always full-suspension and will handle very rough terrain. Their full-suspension will absorb big impacts when landing or cruising through rock gardens. But they aren’t great for going up large hills.

Dirt Jumping or Trial Bikes - Dirt jumping or trial bikes are of course made for dirt jumping! They also work very well at the skatepark. They are a specialized bike that is designed for going over obstacles. Hardtails are the most common, but full-suspension options also exist.;
, Suspension absorbs shock so that you don't feel all the bumps of the terrain. Bikes are available as full-suspension (dual suspension) or hardtail. Both are good for different reasons. Full-suspension will make your ride smoother, but it will also be more expensive.Full-suspension bikes have suspension in the front and the rear. This makes them a good all-around bike for a comfortable ride.
Hardtails only have suspension in the front. This makes the bike lighter so it is easier to climb hills, do jumps, and make quick maneuvers.

, Bike wheels come in 26”, 27.5” and 29”. 26” wheels used to be standard for adults because these tires are lightweight and maneuverable. But then bikes started offering 29” wheels because they allow you to cover more ground when traveling cross-country. They also go over bumps smoothly, but they are slower to accelerate and more difficult to maneuver. 27.5” wheels offer “the best of both worlds” because they roll over terrain more easily than 26” tires and are more maneuverable than 29” tires.27.5” tires are good for someone just starting out because they are a happy medium that will work well in most circumstances.
One inch equals 2.54 cm.

, There are many different types of frames, including aluminum, titanium, carbon, and steel. Aluminum is the most common standard frame type. It is durable and reasonably priced.Steel is strong and inexpensive, but it is heavier than aluminum.
Titanium is lightweight and very strong, but too expensive for most buyers, unless you are buying a very high-end bike.
Carbon is strong and lightweight, but it is more expensive to manufacture.

, Mountain bikes can have a single gear or up to 30 gears. To know how many you need, consider your fitness level and what type of terrain you will ride with your bike. If you will be climbing many hills and find hills challenging, you will need more gears. If you’re in very good shape or will only be riding flat terrain, you will need fewer gears.If you aren’t sure how many gears you need, try a 10-speed bike.

, These are the most common brakes on mountain bikes. Some entry level bikes will have rim brakes, but these don’t stop as well. Disc brakes can be hydraulic, which offer stronger braking without having to press the brake as hard, or cable-activated/mechanical, which will need manual adjusting., Mountain bikes are sized as small, medium, or large. Some are available in extra small or extra large. The sizes are pretty standard across brands. To get the best fit, go to a store and try out some bikes.For a men’s bike, small is for men under 5’8”, medium is for men from 5’7”-6’, large is for men from 6’1”-6’4”, and extra large is for men over 6’3”.
For a women’s bike, extra small is for women under 5’3”, small is for women 5’2”-5’7”, medium is for women 5’6”-5’11”, and large is for women 5’10”-6’2”.
For reference, 5 ft = 1.5 m; 5’6” = 1.7 m; 6 ft = 1.8 m.

Turn the mountain bike over onto its back.,
Remove the faulty tire from the mountain bike.,
Remove the tube from the rim of the wheel.,
Check and clean the inside of the tire for debris.,
Locate the holes or tears in the tube.,
Patch the holes using the bike tire patch kit.,
Wait a few minutes for the patch to bond to the tube.

,
Test to see if the patch has held well.,
Place the tube back into the tire.,
Secure the tire into your bike frame.,
Pump up your new tire.

",How to Change a Bike Tire on a Mountain Bike," In other words, position your mountain bike in such a way that the seat and handlebars are on the ground and the 2 tires are in the air. The tires should be able to spin freely without any resistance.;
, Your tire will be kept on the axle by 2 nuts, 1 on each side, and these nuts will need to be loosened and removed.


Depending on the make of your mountain bike, you may also need to undo a quick release lever on the side of the tire.
Disengage the brake cable before pulling out the tire from between the brake pads.

,


Locate the valve stem for air input and choose a spot on the opposite side of the wheel. Using the beveled end of a tire iron, separate the tire from the wheel rim and latch the iron onto a spoke.






Repeat with a second tire iron approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the first tire iron. Keep doing this around the wheel until you can fully remove the tube from inside.

, Look for anything that could cause future tears or punctures. In particular, thorns, glass shards, and metal shrapnel should be removed.

, To find the holes, you can submerge the tube under water and look for bubbles, or you can pump up the tube and listen for any air leaks.


If a hole is located on a seam or ridge along the tube, the tire patch may not hold well and the tube will be irreparable. In that case, you'll have to purchase a brand new replacement tube.

, Roughen the areas of the tube around the holes using sandpaper. Apply a glue-less patch to the tube firmly, covering and sealing the hole as tightly as you can.

,, Pump up the tube slightly and see if there are any air leaks with the new patch. If there are, you may need to try again and apply a new patch, or the tube may be too damaged and you'll need to purchase a new one.

, Starting with the valve stem, insert the tube back into the tire. Make sure the valve stem is centered correctly or else it could end up being damaged with future use. Work the tire rubber back into the rim, removing 1 tire iron at a time.

, Screw the nuts back onto the axle and reconnect the brake cables. Make sure your tire is centered correctly and be sure that your brakes are working correctly.

Decide on a budget.,
Find a bike that meets your criteria.,
Find a dealer that sells the bike you want.,
Avoid second hand bikes unless you are very knowledgeable.",How to Buy a Mountain Bike2," Have a clear idea in your mind of how much money you have to spend. Mountain bikes can cost anywhere from $200 to $10,000+. If you are new to mountain biking, keep your budget smaller until you develop the expertise to know exactly what you want. You can get a decent mountain bike for under $1,000.Don't forget that on top of a bike, you may want other items such as helmets, gloves and spares.
Factor in a maintenance charge of about $100 per year so that you can get a tuneup.

, Research on the internet or in catalogs to find a bike that meets your requirements. Online bike forums contain a lot of valuable information as well (try pinkbike.com/forum or forums.mtbr.com). Narrow down the selection to 4-5 bikes and Google them to read reviews.


To search online, you can look on Amazon, REI, or your city’s Craigslist for used bikes.
Bikeradar.com has a useful list of quality mountain bikes for under $1,000.You could also go to your local bike store to see what they have.

, When you have chosen a bike, look at dealers that stock it. Try to find a bike store or sporting goods store in your area that sells your bike. You want to find the best price, while also looking to see if that dealer will provide services and spare parts for you.


The internet is a good place to find online dealers, but you may have to pay for shipping and handling, plus you have the problem of finding a repair shop.

, Buying a bike second hand is a good way to get a great deal, but it is also easy to get ripped off. If you don’t know much about bikes, the seller can easily overcharge you and likely will not allow you to return it.If you do buy second hand, make sure to inspect the bike before buying it and to bring along an experienced biker to look at it. Then proceed with extreme caution.
You can find second hand bikes on bike forums or Craigslist.

Buy the bike in late summer or autumn.,
Do a test run before buying.,
Find out about warranties and repairs.,
Buy accessories.,
Pay for the bike.,
Keep your dealer’s contact information.",How to Buy a Mountain Bike3," This is when you are most likely to get a good deal. People generally buy bikes in spring and summer, so by waiting until the end of bike season, you can get a better deal., When it comes time to buy the bike, give it a small road test first to make sure it is of a comfortable size and weight. Do not be afraid to ask the dealer to make minor changes to anything such as the brakes, suspension or gears.You can demo the bike and take it on a longer ride by paying a small fee to the store. This is a good idea if you are seriously considering buying that model.
This is why it is preferable to buy a bike at a local store rather than online. If you buy it online, you won’t know how it rides until you’ve already purchased it. If you buy it online, look for a good return policy in case you aren’t satisfied once you try it out.
If you buy it online, ask around to see if someone you know has that model and try riding theirs before buying your own. You can also read reviews of the bike online to hear about other people’s experience with it, but none of this is the same as actually riding it yourself.

, Bikes sold from a bike store should guarantee the bike and be able to help you with future repairs. They might even offer free tuneups. Find out everything that is included with the bike before buying it.Look for stores that offer a full warranty that will cover any manufacturing defects.For example, REI allows you to return your bike for a refund within one year of buying it if you are not satisfied. If it has a manufacturing defect, you can return it anytime., Make sure you have a helmet and a bike lock. If you plan on traveling long distances with your bike, you will need a water bottle and possibly a backpack. You might also want gloves and wicking cycling apparel. Your local bike store should have everything you will need. Factor these items into the price of the bike., When you have found the right bike for you and tried it out, all that’s left to do is pay for it! This shouldn’t be a problem since you hopefully stayed within your budget. You can simply charge it or pay by check or cash, depending on the store’s policies. If purchasing online, you can probably use PayPal as well. Be sure to keep the receipt in case there are any problems.

, When you have purchased the bike, make sure you take down the phone number of your dealer in case you need them in the future. They may be able to help you with repairs, tuneups, and replacement parts.

",How to Become a Good Mountain Biker," There's over five varieties serving many riding styles.


Cross Country, or XC, is a type of riding that accommodates long rides over many different types of terrain: from steep climbs up a dirt fire road to a long narrow smooth descend on a single track trail. If you like long uphill and fast downhill rides, then this is the type of riding for you. Cross country bikes are usually lightweight with 2""-4"" of front suspension and steep head-tube angles for easier handling.
All-Mountain, or AM, is a model between the cross-country and free-ride. Oftentimes, there can be steep downhills combined with small drops and some jumps. If you care more about the descent, but still want the ability to climb, AM is probably the bike for you. AM bikes usually have about 5"" of front and rear travel paired with a set of hydraulic disk brakes and slacker head-tube angles for more slow-speed stability.
Four cross, or 4x - 4x, is BMX racing with a mountain bike. Bikers race on a smooth track with 4 people. If you like riding downhill, but can't handle the obstacles than this might be a good choice. FR bikes have the most suspension of all because of the high drops and hard landings it must handle. A slightly steeper head-tube angle than DH bike allow for better handling.
Dirt jumping. This bike is a lot like the BMX in that you go maneuver big jumps. You can also use this model for urban riding; for example, it will allow you to go down steps and jump off ledges. If you like to play on your bike, both dirt jumping and urban biking are for you. Dirt-jumping bikes have low frames and small front travel for a stiffer response.
Downhill, or DH riding is all about speed. People have been known to go over 60 mph (97 km/h) on this bike. DH is one of the most challenging types of mountain biking because of the speed and the obstacles involved. Often, the trails can get steeper than 45 degrees with a large drop or jump at the bottom. What makes this kind of riding even more challenging are narrow single track trails, which you will often encounter. Most downhill courses are found on mountains for skiing and snowboarding. Take your bike with you up on the lift and go for the rush of the speed ride! DH bikes have about 8""-10"" of travel, hydraulic disk brakes, and a very slack head-tube angle.
Free-ride, or FR, is a cross between downhill and dirt jumping. Most free-riding places can be found at downhill courses. With free riding, you drop off cliffs and man-made obstacles. In fact, mountain biking pros go to the desert and jump of cliffs 80 feet (24.4 m) high or more. Free-riding is popular in the north (places like British Columbia). If your middle name is Danger, this is for you.;
, Look at reviews from experienced riders. Bargain hunting at large, discount one-stop stores is not recommended. Speak with pros and purchase accordingly.

, Essential for this kind of biking are a strong core (the mid-region of your body), as well as solid thigh muscles, glutes, as well upper-back and upper-arm muscles.


A combination of isometric and aerobic activities is recommended. Pilates is excellent choice, too.
A regular brisk walk on the treadmill with a high inclination is also great training.

, This is excellent preparation.

,, The following obstacles are fairly common when riding off-road trails and tracks:


Switch backs: a sharp turn on a trail.
Baby heads: rock garden with loose rocks.
Roller-coaster: a long bridge with sharp turns, sometimes elevated.
Teeter-totter: an uphill path that shifts in the middle to a downhill inclination. It can also be elevated.
Trash: don't be surprised if you run into such things as old sinks, ovens, and other discarded stuff. People have been known to haul the junk they can't sell or get rid of into the woods. I have even seen an old Volkswagen Beetle in the middle of the trail to be ridden over, which could also be great fun for the experienced.
Nails: watch out for them! Nails are not fun.
Hanging logs: logs that have fallen on the trail.
Log piles: man-made piles of logs to ride over.
Ladders: man-made obstacles to ride on.
Rock gardens: a bunch of rocks in the middle of the trail.
Skinnies: a 2x4 ridden over like a bridge. They are sometimes elevated.

,, Practice lifting your front tire on this flat surface, which will help you get over hanging logs and log piles. Your back tire will go over most obstacles that your front tire cannot handle. When going over hanging logs, lift your front tire up to the middle of the log. When you going over hanging logs, it is best to go at medium speed. When going over log piles, think of them as moguls; all you have to do is carry some speed and ride over them.

, Practice tricks on your bike, such as: wheelie, stoppie, bunny hop, fast maneuvering, etc. These tricks will help you to climb on obstacles, such as rocks with greater ease and confidence. Practice in a daily basis and utilize all the off-road spaces you are able to find to practice. Test your new skills often on the off-road tracks.

, Try only the kinds of jumps that match your level of skill. Don't go for the 8-footer right away!


After completing a jump, remain standing on your bike to keep air flowing through your lungs.
After you get used to jumping and landing standing, start practicing popping of the jump. To pop off a jump, carry a good amount of speed standing up on your bike. Once your front tire is at the top of the jump, push down hard on your suspension and pull up. You will get much more air this way.

, Drops are an important part of free-riding. When you go off drops, maintain a speed of 5–7 mph (8.0–11.3 km/h). If you go too slowly, your front tire will point straight down and you will fall.If you go to fast though you may end up overshooting the landing and really hurting yourself. So be sure to find the right speed for the drop. If you do not have a great deal of space to gain speed, try a wheelie near the end of the ledge so your front tire does not go hit the ground first.

Make sure that the ground is appropriate for riding, and whenever riding on dangerous terrain, go with a friend. Always have a cell phone with you, and make sure it is charged.;
, Your legs can't generate 200 horse-power; you will need to depend on your ability to spin the pedals quickly to generate the power need to burnout. It might take a bit of experimentation to find the gear that matches your leg strength and ground conditions.

If a bike doesn’t fit you well, then it will be uncomfortable and inefficient to ride. A good bike shop will be able to set you up with a bike specific to your needs.Many will offer repair, service plans or discounts on future purchases. In general, there are three styles of mountain bike that you can check out, depending on your interests:



Rigid mountain bikes have no suspension, meaning that there's less mechanical parts to worry about on your bike, and you can transition to riding it and learning the parts more easily. It's more difficult to ride off-road, however, offering none of the cushioning effect of more complicated bikes.

Hardtail bikes are good for most beginners who want to start tackling difficult terrain, offering--as the name suggests--a suspension fork on the front wheel and a rigid back wheel.

Full suspension bikes are the most expensive kind of mountain bike, but offer suspension in both the front and back, making them the most effective and comfortable bike to ride on the kind of difficult road mountain biking demands.
You don’t need to buy a bike right off the bat, so consider borrowing one for a few rides to see if mountain biking is right for you. Bike shops near some state parks featuring trails will often rent appropriately-sized bikes, so check out your options. There is no use in investing hundreds of dollars in a brand new bike if it's something you won't enjoy.;
, A good helmet should be priority one if you want to start cycling off-road. Your helmet should fit snugly, but not obscure your vision or pull down hard over your ears. Never go mountain biking without a proper helmet.

, While not necessary for your preliminary rides, there are several pieces of safety equipment you can get, at varying levels of expense. As you progress further into the sport, you may find you require more, but it's entirely up to you, your riding style, and your needs. Some mountain bikers would consider a trail incomplete without:


Gloves
Shin guards
Arm braces
Water bottle

, On you first rides, and probably most rides afterward, it's likely that you'll fall at some point, and certain that your bike will take a beating. You'll be catching air, riding over rocks, bumping up against branches, and tearing around having a great old time on your bike. You might get some scratches and bruises on your first couple of rides, so prepare for light abrasions. It’s also a good idea to carry water and a phone with you when you ride. Make sure you or someone in your group has:


Plenty of water
Band-aids and blister kits
Patch kit and multi-tool
Small air pump
Extra socks
Rain gear or warm clothes

, Mountain biking is part nature walk, part aerobic exercise, and part BMX. Other than a good bike, a healthy body will be your most important piece of gear. You don't want to get out into the middle of a trail with steep grades and realize you're too tired to hoof it back. While most mountain bikers, even experienced ones, will often get off their bikes and walk especially difficult turns in the trail, it's generally easier to stay on your bike and keep your momentum going. Stopping and starting too much because you're out of shape will eventually make the ride more difficult, instead of less.


If you haven't ridden a lot lately, but want to start mountain biking, go on some long rides to get comfortable being on a bike again. Go several miles, alternating between cruising and sprinting to get yourself back into good bike shape.

, Get comfortable on your bike first, adjusting the seat and handle-bars to the proper specifications so you'll feel comfortable riding. You don't need to hit up master-level trails or start free-riding to learn to mountain bike. Find some unpaved but level ground to ride on to get used to the different feel of biking on a less-than-smooth surface. Ride it around in grass to get comfortable and get the bike dialed in. Next, work up to some hills to practice your shifting and balance on your bike.

, When you're on a trail, especially, you want to keep your eyes scanning about 15 yards (13.7 m) ahead of you for obstacles, low-hanging branches, and steep turns that'll come up in the trail. It can be tempting to lock your eyes on a particular turn or branch and look it toward you, causing you to lose your balance and ignore the upcoming obstacles. You'll have an easier time staying balanced and letting the bike do the work for you.

, Experienced mountain bikers learn to shift their weight slightly to increase the braking effect on their bike without braking for very long. It's more of a controlled fall than an extreme slowing down.


When going downhill, shift your weight backward but apply more brake to the front wheel. Clamping too hard on the front can cause you to flip, while brake too much on the back can cause you to go into a skid, so be careful. There's more weight carrying you with the front tire, so use that brake to slow yourself and control your descent.
It can be tempting at first to want to clamp onto the bike brakes as soon as you see your first steep downhill, narrow channel, or gnarly turn. On the trail, try to avoid riding your brake and instead learn to use speed to your advantage over difficult obstacles. The bike is made to take the beating for you, and it's easier to lose your balance at slower speeds, making the obstacles more dangerous.

, Approaching grades effectively will keep you moving through the course quickly and comfortably, maximizing your efficiency.Learning to properly negotiate up and downhills is a big part of mountain biking:



When you're going uphill, stay seated and lean forward into the hill. On the road, standing can give you extra power in your pedals, but it can make you spin out on dirt. Keep your butt in the seat. Go easy on the pedaling to go light on the chain and downshift before you hit the hill, then pedal, pedal, pedal.

When you go downhill, the most important thing is to relax. Don't oversteer and try to control things too much, or you risk a wipe-out. Stay focused on obstacles, and stand up off the seat, keeping your pedals parallel to the ground. Don't lock your elbows, which can be quite painful if you jam a tire or flip.

, Shifting gears allows you to slip the bike chain onto a smaller or larger diameter gear on the bike, making the pedaling require more or less power to pedal, respectively. It's important to try to shift before it becomes absolutely necessary for you to do so, anticipating up-hills that will require you to shift up and switching gears before you'll be slowing down considerably.Shift after a power-stroke. If you feel you need to lessen the power it takes to pedal, make one extra-hard stroke, followed by a ""soft stroke"" that you'll earn yourself with the momentum you created. Shift on the soft stroke to make sure the chain slips appropriately., Speed is your friend. Going quickly means you can work less hard and use momentum to your advantage, maximizing the efficiency of your bike and your body. Keep moving and try not to slow down too much, even if you're concerned about a grade. Keep moving and the bike will do the work for you.


At the same time, don't be foolish. Slow down, stop, and check out extremely difficult-looking turns or descents before you blunder into them too quickly. When you're first starting out, stick to beginner trails and take it easy anyway.

, One of the best ways to build mountain biking skills is to go out and hit the trails with experienced riders. When you’re actually on the trails, don’t try to hit every jump, root and rock or keep up with more the experienced people. Go at your own pace and skill level, your technique will mature with time. Be sure and wear your helmet and keep riding and having fun.

, Other riders in your area should be familiar with local places that allow bicycles on their trails. Many state parks have some that are built specifically for mountain biking. Also, in many towns there are clubs that will build and maintain trails specifically for riding. Learn which would be most appropriate for the beginner and check it out with some other mountain bikers to learn. Common mountain bike trail locations include:


State or national parks
Fire roads
Rural access roads
Private property (with permission)

, When you're riding trails, you need to stick to bike-friendly trails and give pedestrians the right of way. Often, beginner trails will also be walking trails, and sometimes you'll come across hikers, dogs, people on horses, and children playing, so it's important to stick to the rules and watch what you're doing. Don't go too fast if it's an especially busy day on the trail, and don't blindly shoot around corners. Be sure to be aware of other riders around you and step off the path when they approach you from behind.


Don't be one of the cyclists that gives the community a bad reputation. Don't shoot around people walking and spray sod in their face. The road doesn't belong to you. It's shared.

, It's common to want to familiarize yourself with parts of the trail while walking. It's a good idea to know what you're expecting, where the big hills are, and what you're going to need to do. It can be a fun project to scout your trail, making the first ride through it all the more exciting. Think of it less as ""ruining a surprise"" and more as ""preparing like a pro.""

, Lots of online and local communities exist which can help you find trails in your area, but you also might consider making the trip to a popular mountain biking destination, once you get some experience with the sport.Colorado and North Carolina are the two states with the most mountain biking trails in the US. Some popular and scenic trails rated for the beginner include:


Rustler's Loop in Fruita, CO
Dead Horse Point State Park in Moab, UT
Bell Rock Trailway in Sedona, AZ
Blue Heron in Greensboro, NC
Evans Loop in Morrisville, NC

Practice with friends.",How to Do a Mountain Bike Bunny Hop," When learning how to bunny hop on a mountain bike, you should start at a moderate pace. If you go too fast, you probably won’t be able to execute the hop the way it needs to be done. As a result, avoid peddling too hard when learning to hop.


While you can eventually increase your pace, start at 4 to 6 miles per hour (6.5 to 9.5 kilometers per hour).;
, As you ride along at a steady pace, hold your forearms are low. This will give you the control and position you need to execute the bunny hop. If your arms are too high, you may not be able to generate the force and you could lose balance.







, Dipping your heels and bending your knees puts you in position to accelerate and control the bike. In addition, this position allows you to adjust as you execute the hop.









Your positioning should resemble the crouching position of a sprinter., Keep your weight centered to maintain good balance. Leaning over the handlebars gives you the momentum needed to perform a bunny hop.








If you do not stay centered, you could wind up falling off your bike.

, Move your legs and feet into the correct position as you accelerate. Without positioning your feet correctly before the bunny hop, you won’t be able to execute it properly.







, While you already put yourself in a crouching position, you’ll want to retract this position even more before you execute the hop. Being in the crouching position is safer and gives you more control.







, Pull upward, then push down and firmly grip your pedals. In combination with your acceleration, pulling up and back on your handles should lift the front tire of the bike into the air. If you’re riding on a hill or on mountainous terrain, you may gain substantial air.







, Leaning back could lead you to fall back and hurt yourself. Instead, make sure you push down with your feet and stand with a slight forward lean.


If you lean back or sit back, you won’t be able to get the back wheel into the air., Immediately after pulling up on your handlebars, you need to ease back into a crouching position. Then, push your weight into the handle bars. In addition, slightly rotate the handle bars. This will create momentum that will help bring your back wheel off the ground.







, Point your toes down and sweep your feet backward above the peddles. This will help you adjust to the bike moving into the air.







, While how much you bend your knees depends on your body and height, consider bending them at about a 60 degree angle. This is important, as the impact of landing could injure you if your legs are straight or tense.








, Find a patch of grass, either your backyard, a field, a meadow, or something similar. Complete practice drills where you try to perfect each part of the bunny hop. Feel free to experiment and change up anything that does not work for you.Watch to see which wheel tends to land first. After watching this, you can alter your technique so you get either the back or front wheel to land first.
Don’t move on from a flat surface until you can comfortably hop over six inches of ground.

, After you’ve built confidence, try doing a bunny hop on a trail over gently rolling terrain. Use small obstacles, like small rocks, tree limbs, or roots to hop over., After you’ve mastered small obstacles on intermediate trails, it’ll be time for you to move on to serious trails. On these trails, you’ll find a variety of obstacles – under different conditions – that you may need to hop over.

, Watch how your friends execute a bunny hop. Then, have them watch you. Give each other feedback. Ultimately, you and your friends will be able to do better bunny hops.


In addition, consider joining a club where you can learn from people with more experience. Consider clubs like the Overland Mountain Bike Club in Colorado, the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club in North Carolina, or other clubs around the country.Set up times to bike and practice biking with friends on the weekend.

Then lift the brake cable up out of the retaining clip and repeat with the rear brake cable.;
, To protect your grips and saddle, lay out an old towel or something similar on the ground (or fork out the hundred bucks or so for a repair stand). Standing beside your bike, lean over it and grip the frame with your hands - one hand on the down tube at the front and the other hand on the seat post at the rear of the frame. Then lift up the bike and turn it over.


Alternate method: Hang the bike from the saddle. To protect the underside of your saddle, pad the tree branch, rafter, etc. Hanging the bike right-side-up is a better method as the chain sits in a specific location due to gravity pulling it down.
Another Alternate Method: String it up. Hang the bike from a balcony by stringing rope around the handle bars, up to the balcony, and down around the seat stay.

, Open the quick release lever on the front wheel axle and lift the wheel out. Remove the rear wheel - open the quick release and, as you lift up the wheel, ease the rear cassette housing out of the dérailleur mechanism (the part with the two cogs)., Using the brush and some soapy water, start by cleaning the rear derailleur, working the brush into all the moving parts.


Turn the pedals to move the chain round and, holding a wet soapy rag around the chain on the rear derailleur, give it a good wash down.
Use the brush with plenty of water to clean the chain ring (the front cog where the pedals attach). Then give it a wipe down with a dry cloth.
Taking a wet rag, wash the pedals and then wash the cranks (the bars that hold the pedals on).
Finally, clean the front gear mechanism, working the rag into all the moving parts to clean them thoroughly.

, Start by washing the front forks with a rag and soapy water, wiping them dry with a cloth as you go. In the same way, clean the centre and rear of the frame.


Wash the handlebars with a soapy rag, paying particular attention to the brake lever and gear assembly.
Using a damp rag, wash the top tube or crossbar, making sure to clean under the brake and gear cables that run down its length.
Finally, clean the underside of the seat.

, Take a wet rag and start by cleaning the rims of the front wheel. Give the spokes a wash-down and clean the axle. If you have a disk brake system, use a degreaser, such as muck off or white lightning to clean the disc's.


Drop the front wheel back into the forks and tighten the quick release - not too tight, not too loose. When you have tightened the lever to the correct pressure, the quick release will leave a mark on your palm for a few seconds. If you need to adjust the tension of the quick release, turn the nut on the far side of the axle clockwise to tighten it, or anticlockwise for less tension.
Take the rear wheel and clean the rims, spokes, axle and rear disk rotor if you have one, as you did with the front wheel.
Clean the gear cassette on the rear wheel carefully. Use the lever end of the bike brush to remove any stones between the teeth, then work the brush into the cogs, using plenty of soapy water. This will remove any build-up of lubricant or dirt.
Drop the rear wheel back into the frame, easing the gear cassette back into the derailleur assembly. Tighten the quick release.

, Spin each wheel, making sure it turns freely and that you can see that it's straight (true). As the wheel rotates, hold your fingers against the rims, to feel if there are any dents or knocks on either side.


If you have disc brakes, also check both sides of the rotors on each wheel for true. Make sure it looks smooth and straight. Do not touch the rotor.
If you have V brakes, watch the wheel while it's spinning, to make sure that the brake blocks do not make contact with the rims.
Check the spokes by turning the front wheel slowly and letting your hand fall over each spoke as the wheel rotates. Every spoke should feel taut but if one feels sloppy, it will need tightening.
While the bike is still upside down, check the tire pressure and that both tires are in good condition. If you find any major damage, replace the tire before your next ride.

, Check both pedals by spinning them, making sure that they turn freely and that there is no noise or grinding from worn bearings. If there is, you'll need to replace the bottom bracket.


Turn a pedal to rotate the crank and listen out for any noise or signs of wear from the bottom bracket (the assembly that holds the cranks and chain ring in place). If you find any, it will need further maintenance.
Check the front gear mechanism. Turn the pedal and move the chain up and down the gears using the gear lever. You're looking and listening for signs of snagging, which happen when the mechanism is misaligned and needs adjusting. Do a similar check with the rear derailleur and gear cogs.

, Stand by your bike and grab the frame with both hands as you did before to turn your bike back up the right way. Then lean the bike against a wall.


Using a clean rag and soapy water, wash the handlebars and the headset (the part where the handlebars meet the frame). Take care to clean well around the brake and gear levers. Wash the tops of the forks on the front wheel and, if you have front shocks, give the seals a good wipe down.
Moving to the centre of the bike, clean the down tube and the top tube or crossbar.
Open the quick release to remove the saddle. Wash the saddle tube and the seat post on the frame, then remount the saddle, tighten the quick release and give the saddle a wipe over.
Finally, clean the seat stays (the two tubes that join the seat post to the rear axle) and wash around the bottom bracket.

, Test your brakes by standing in front of your bike, holding the handlebars. Apply the front brake and pull the bike towards you. The front wheel should not move at all and if you continue to pull, the rear wheel should lift up off the ground; otherwise, the brake will need adjusting.


Do the same test with the back brake. When the brake is applied, the rear wheel shouldn't turn round and if you keep pulling, it should skid. If not, the rear brake will need adjusting.
Also, look at the brake levers - the brakes should start to grip at about 1/3 pull. The levers should not touch the handlebars. If they do, your brakes need adjusting.
If you have disc brakes, check that they are in good condition by standing in front of the bike and looking down inside the disk brake caliper (the bit that fits around the brake rotor). Apply the front brake and you should see both brake pads move across equally to clamp the rotor. If they don't, this indicates a problem. Repeat the above test with the rear disk brake, standing where you can see down into the rear caliper.
If you have V brakes, check the brake blocks for signs of wear. They should be free of graphite build-up, and the grooves in the pad should be deep; otherwise, they'll need replacing.
With V brakes, also check both brake cables for signs of wear or fraying. Start at the brake levers on the handlebars. Follow the cables along the top tube, then check the other end of both cables where they meet the brake calipers. If you find any signs of wear or fraying in your brake cables, they will need replacing.

, Stand beside your bike, and holding the headset with your left hand, apply the front brake with your right hand and rock the bike back and forth. Make sure you cannot feel any slack or hear any knocking in the headset. If you can, your headset will need adjusting.

, Place some rags over the rear wheel rims underneath the derailleur, to catch any oil drips.


Rotate the pedal anticlockwise to move the chain around. Holding the spray lubricant vertically, spray the chain for a few seconds as it passes over the rear gear cogs.
Moving the chain with the pedal, spray the teeth on the inside of the chain ring near the cranks. Rotate the pedal again and finally, lube the outside of the chain ring in the same way.

, Now reattach the lights and any other accessories you took off. Turn the front light on, making sure the light is bright, then do the same check with the back light

Roll up to the drop at a reasonably fast speed.,
Get into your attack position when two seconds away from the edge of the drop.,
Lighten the front wheel as it reaches the edge by pushing your hips back and lightly lifting up on the handlebar.,
Keep your front wheel level with the take-off until the back wheel leaves the ramp.

",How to Ride Off a Drop on a Mountain Bike," Take note of the condition of the ladder (if it's a ladder drop), the steepness and roughness of the landing, and what the terrain would be like if you overshoot or undershoot the landing.;
, If you are going too slow your front wheel will dive as soon as it rolls off the edge and toss you over the bars. Too fast and you might overshoot the landing.

,


Center your weight over your pedals and keep your hands light.
Bend your knees slightly.
Keep your arms bent and relaxed.
Relax your grip on the handlebars.
Get your chest low - you want you upper body to be almost horizontal.
Look at the landing.

, The slower you are going the further back you must have your weight to keep your front wheel from diving while the rear wheel is still on the ramp.

A good place to start is a flat, smooth stretch of ground such as your driveway or your sidewalk. Those who don’t have space at home can practice in a parking lot or park.Starting off on grass or smooth gravel helps since falls there hurt less. These surfaces make balancing and pedaling harder though.
If you plan on practicing balance and pedaling on hills, find locations with gentle slopes.
Check your local laws to see if it is legal to ride on sidewalks or other paths.;
, Knee and elbow pads insulate joints and protect against scrapes, so they are recommended for all riders. Long-sleeved shirts and long pants also help protect against falls and can be combined with pads.


Avoid baggy pants and long skirts. These may get caught in the gears and tires.
Avoid open-toed shoes. These leave your feet exposed to the bike and ground.

, Helmets are recommended for beginners and experienced bike riders alike. You never know when an accident will happen. A broken bone can usually be fixed, but head trauma, common in bicycle accidents, leaves a lasting impact. Also, some areas have laws requiring riders to wear helmets.Helmets are measured to fit the head. A good one fits tightly and comes down to an inch (two and a half centimeters) above your eyebrows. It will also have straps that keep your helmet tight while still letting you move your mouth.
Commuter helmets are one common type. They are rounded, made of foam and plastic, and can be found online or in retail stores where bikes are available.Road helmets are elongated and often have vents. They’re also made with foam and plastic but are popular on roads or in competitive racing. Seek them online or in retail stores.Youth (age 10-15), child (age 5-10), and toddler (under 5) helmets are all smaller commuter or road helmets. Toddler helmets are the only ones with more foam.
Mountain bike helmets and professional sports helmets come with visors and neck bracing for tough off-road conditions., Riding is possible at night but not recommended for beginners. You’ll be spending a lot of time learning to balance. This means that, as you get acclimated, the bike can swerve into traffic or other dangers you'll have a hard time seeing.. At night, drivers also have a more difficult time seeing you.If you have to go out at night, wear light-colored clothing, reflective stickers, and use bike headlights.

, Flat surfaces such as a driveway, sidewalk, quiet road, or park trail are stable There are no slopes, so the falls are shorter and you will have an easier time balancing and coming to a stop.


Short grass and smooth gravel are also surfaces you can use. Falls will hurt less, but these surfaces force you to pedal harder to move the bike.

, Lower the bike seat far enough that whoever's riding can put both of their feet flat on the ground while seated. A low seat allows you to stop yourself with your feet before you fall. Adults don’t need to use training wheels, but young children can use these or specialty balance bikes.It is possible to remove the pedals to keep them out of the way, but it isn’t required.

, Find out how the brakes work on the bicycle. Stay off the bicycle. Keep it next to you and walk it. Push the brake buttons to get used to their location, how they feel, and how the bike reacts to them. Once you’ve learned this, you’ll feel more comfortable because you’ll be able to make an emergency stop when needed.


If your bike has brakes on the handlebars, test each one to see which controls the front and which controls the rear wheel. These can be switched by professionals.Notice how squeezing the back brake causes the rear wheel to skid. Squeezing the front brake causes the bike to pitch forward.If your bike doesn’t have brakes on the handles, it should have backpedal (coaster) brakes. To brake, press down on the pedal closest to the back end of the bike as if pedaling backwards.If your bike is a fixed wheel and hasn’t been modified, it has no brakes. Instead of braking, you will need to either slow the pace of your pedaling or skid by leaning forward and holding both pedals horizontally with your feet., It doesn't matter which side you choose, but your dominant side will feel more natural. A right-handed person, for instance, can stand on the left side of the bike. Lift up your right leg, reach it over the bike, and put it on the ground on the other side of the bike. Hold the bike upwards between your legs.


Feel the weight of the bike between your legs and try to keep it balanced as you lower yourself. Having feet on the ground prevents the bike from toppling while you acclimate.
Maintain your weight in the center of the bike, evenly distributed between your left and right sides. Sit up straight instead of leaning.

, Rather than pedal, push yourself off by foot. Tuck your feet upwards and onto the pedals. While in motion, maintain the bike’s balance as long as you can. Once you feel the bike beginning to tip, catch it by putting one foot to the ground, then push off again., When you look at obstacles, your bike heads towards them. Concentrate on looking towards where you want the bike to go. It takes some practice to avoid distractions from road hazards or other sights.


Before you have complete control, go where the bike goes. When starting, the bike tends to go to the side or in circles. Instead of stopping, let it go and try to maintain balance while it does.If you are helping a child or friend, you can hold onto their lower back to help them stay steady while they practice.

, Start with one foot on the ground. Your other foot should be flat on a pedal pointed upwards. Push off, put that foot on the other pedal, and go! Keep going as long as you can maintain balance.


Going faster makes balancing easier, but don’t go so fast that you lose control.

, Don't stop by foot. A better practice is stop by using the brakes. Stop pedaling, shift your weight onto the lowest pedal, and squeeze both handbrakes, if the bike has them. Once the bike has stopped, raise yourself a little and step off onto the ground.Putting your feet down too early while using the breaks stops the bicycle abruptly. Your momentum won't stop and you'll whack into the handlebars., Walk the bike to the top of a slope, mount it, and glide down, allowing the bike to slow naturally in the flat area at the bottom. Dismount and repeat as necessary until you get used to balancing and controlling the bike.Keep your weight focused in your feet. Stay pressed against the seat, keep your elbows bent, and your body relaxed.When you are confident you can coast to the bottom, try riding down with your feet on the pedals.

, Once you have become comfortable keeping your feet on the pedals, try again, this time gently squeezing the brakes while descending. You'll learn to slow the bike without swerving out of control or pitching over the handlebars.

, Once you can coast, pedal, and brake in a straight line, try going down the hill again. Move the handlebars until you change the direction of the bike without losing control. Feel how the slope changes the way the bike acts and adjust your balance to match it.

, Use the techniques learned while gliding to pedal and steer without stopping at the bottom of the hill. Transition to the flatter surface while practicing sharper turns, then brake to a stop.

, From the flat bottom of the hill, start pedaling. The slope requires additional work. Lean forward into the pedaling or even stand up to gain extra power. Bike up and down the slope several times until you feel comfortable.


Once you feel confident, bike halfway up the slope, come to a stop, and start pedaling upwards again.

Get a fixed gear: The best way is to build bikes from old ""10 speed"" bikes, which is generally the least expensive and most ""customizable"" approach.,
""Just keep turning the pedals"".,
Practice random acts of senseless stopping.,
Leave the bike computer and heart rate monitor at home.,
Learn to pace yourself.",How to Ride a Fixed Gear Bike," Make sure the frame has either diagonal or horizontal dropouts - vertical dropouts don't allow for adjustment or chain flex, and are generally a poor choice for single- or- fixed-gear conversions. You will need to make decisions on what size gear to use and whether you wish to add a front or rear brake -""very low 70's gearing"" and ""front brake only"" are typical decisions. Or you can buy a decent, inexpensive track frame and build it up with quality parts. Those store bought fixies often are a hodgepodge of parts, some of which are garbage. Buying a bike is relatively simple but you should be aware of generic parts. Those ""fixies"" you see for 300 hundred bucks or less, typically have all generic parts. Generic parts get the job done, but in the long run, you may spend more money fixing and replacing parts.









Alternatively, many retailers offer fixed-speed bikes for reasonable prices. If you lack mechanical knowledge of bicycles or are unfamiliar with their maintenance, new bikes eliminate much of the difficulty of selecting, converting and repairing an older bike.;
, Sounds obvious but if you do not control the bike, it will control you, with unpleasant consequences. It is not as obvious as it sounds. It will take quite a while for your subconscious mind to learn not to try coasting, and not to feel like a runaway locomotive when you discover you can't.








, Depending on whether you have chosen to use brakes, this may require a lot more time and - or mastery of ""skid stopping"". At the very least it will entail trying to ""back-pedal"" to slow down, which you may find an interesting challenge. If you can't learn to slow yourself down or stop, get off the bike. You could seriously hurt yourself or get killed.








, The point is to simplify things to where we can enjoy riding as we did when we were children.

, Stopping and starting take more work than on a geared bike. If you see that a stale green light ahead, it is better to slow down and hopefully catch the next green without having to stop, than charge the light and then have to stop suddenly when it turns red.

If you're left handed, swing your right foot over the bike. You should now be standing up with the bike between your two legs.;
, You don't want to put so much pressure on the bike that it tips over, only enough to straighten it up without having to pinch the seat with your knees. Put about half the pressure that you use to stand up on the pedal, that's not much at all.

, Hold on to the handlebars for support and to keep the bike straight. Slowly, push off the ground with your non dominant foot. The motion should look the same as how you push off on a skateboard, rolling your foot forward. Another way to look at it is when you're running and you spring off the ground with the balls of your feet. You don't want to use that much force though, only enough to get the bike rolling. After the bike has started to move, put the pushing foot back onto the pedal.

, Keeping your weight center and even, pedal with your feet. This shouldn't be too hard to work out, it's almost as if you're trying to run forward. Be sure not to lean from side to side otherwise your bike will tip over. Hold the handlebars to steer and keep the bike from tipping.

, To stop the bike from moving, feather your brakes. This means to squeeze the brakes very lightly. If you continue to squeeze the brakes lightly, the bike won't slow down very much. To stop the bike, you have to continue to add pressure to the brakes. Be sure to start braking very lightly at first though, squeezing the brakes with full force will stop the bike very sharply. However, you will carry on moving and just fly over the handlebars. To get off the bike, just swing you leg over, reversing the motion in step 1.

Find safe places for children to ride for fun, and safe routes to school and other places.",How to Ride a Bike Safely," Before you even set out, it is important to ensure that your bike is roadworthy and safe. This is especially important for aging bikes. Checking your bike means looking at the following:



Air -- are your tires inflated adequately?

Brakes - do they work, are they clean?

Chain - is it clean, free of debris, and able to turn with no problems?;
, Wheel your bike around a flat surface, pulling the brake levers on and off. If they do not work, and you're not sure how to fix them, contact your local bike shop and ask them to help.

, Put the whole tire into a small bowl of water. See if there are any bubbles coming out. If there are any bubbles, it means your tire is punctured and you can get it fixed by a bike shop or do it yourself. Repeat for the other tire.

, This is very easy as all you need to do is sit on your bike and make sure that the tips of your toes touch the ground (and nothing else). Adjust the bike seat as needed, and the handles too.

, These all increase your visibility. When buying t-shirts or tops make it a policy to buy bright or at least white colours. You can also add reflector lights or reflective tape to your backpack if you're wearing one.

, Riding a bike in high heels or flip flops is never a good idea. Wear shoes that fit snugly, are flat soled, and have no dangling pieces that could become caught in the bike structure and spokes. Tuck in laces.

, They will hold back long pants that are threatening to flap into the wheel spokes, or become dirtied by the chain grease.

, It could unexpectedly come loose and wrap around your wheel, throwing you head-first into the ground or road. It could also become entangled in the chain or obscure your rear light and reflector.

, In some places, you have no choice but to wear a helmet by law. Yet, even where this is not legally required, it's a good idea to wear one to augment your safety - head injuries are the most common fatal injuries sustained in bike accidents., Dirt, pebbles, or even bugs can fly into your eyes, causing temporary vision difficulty. A pair of bicycle-appropriate glasses will help prevent this.

, Every cyclist has a duty to know the road rules, both as they apply to you as a cyclist, and as they relate to other road users as well. This includes teaching children what rules they need to be aware of (see below). It is also important to use common sense when riding in traffic, relying on all of your senses to help guide you through traffic safely. Anticipate the unexpected to reduce surprises.

, Riding against traffic on the wrong side of the road is illegal and increases a cyclist's risk dramatically because it increases closing speeds and turning motorists are likely to not even look for traffic in the direction from which a wrong-way cyclist would be coming.

, Learn to be able to turn your head to look back behind you without veering off course. This can be done by practicing looking back while following a stripe in an empty parking lot. This skill is essential any time you need to move left or right from your course, like when you need to move over for a truck stopped at the curb or some other obstacle. Just because it's not your fault that you need to change course, does not mean that you have right of way to move over. If other traffic is using the adjacent line of travel, you need to yield to them, or negotiate for right of way to move there (see below). It's important to practice the looking back skill because many cyclists, even experienced ones, don't realize how much they veer when they look back. Looking back to make sure it's safe to move over is of no help if you veer left right in front of overtaking traffic as you look back.

, That is to say when turning or adjusting laterally on the roadway. Holding your arm straight and parallel to the ground with open palm faced forward is much more clear and attention-grabbing than an arm halfheartedly lifted and held in position with a bent elbow. Before taking your hand off the handlebar, be sure to scan the road ahead for obstructions like stones, potholes, or anything that can jerk your wheel. Not only does signaling let them predict your next move, but it gives cyclists a reputation of courtesy.

,,, Not only do your ears act like a radar for detecting approaching cars, certain types of music can encourage you to take excessive risks!

, Realize that many motorists may overlook cyclists, especially those riding inconspicuously near the road edge. Some motorists are irritated by the presence of cyclists and seek to make it harder for you to drive near them. Don't get angry; if they honk that means they've noticed you! Convey gratitude by smiling, nodding or waving. Stay calm, keep your wits about you, and remain focused. A mirror can help you know when a motorist is approaching from behind. A well-timed look back, nod or even slow/stop arm signal can be very helpful in communicating to the motorist that you are not oblivious to their presence and your effect on them, which alone can often nip-in-the-bud a potential road rage situation.

, Remember that even at 10 mph you're traveling the distance of an entire car length every second. If a door opens suddenly in front of you, you may not even have enough time to react, much less stop. And if you instinctively swerve or are knocked left by the opening door, you could be hit by overtaking traffic. Sure, they're legally obligated to look first before they open the door, but are you going to trust your safety - perhaps even betting your life - that they always will without exception? If you regularly ride in door zones, it's only a matter of time before you get doored. Since car and truck doors extend out as much as three-and-a-half feet when open, tracking five feet away allows your two foot wide body to be clear of an open door plus a minimum of six inches of error margin. Any closer than five feet puts you in the door zone and in serious risk. Don't be lured into riding in a door zone by a bike lane. That paint on the ground offers no protection!

, Riding far right in lanes less than 14 feet (4.3 m) in width is a great cause of conflict and consternation in traffic. It makes the cyclist less conspicuous and invites motorists to try to squeeze into the lane side-by-side with the cyclist, causing them to either pass with insufficient safety margin, or realize too late that they have to at least encroach in the adjacent lane to pass safely. Alert them early of the condition that lane sharing is not an option by clearly controlling the lane by riding near the center of the lane, or even left of center, so they have the time and space to plan a safe lane change and pass.

, Between intersections when faster traffic is present, if the traffic lane is wide enough for traffic to pass you safely within the lane, keep to the side and make it easier for the drivers to leave you room. But during significantly long gaps in traffic, a more conspicuous position well out in the traffic lane helps grab the attention of the next driver who approaches, discouraging them from choosing to attend to a distraction until after you've been safely passed. A rear view mirror can help you notice when faster traffic is approaching, and to let you known when to move aside, usually after they've slowed indicating they've noticed you, but before they get irritated. Never use a rear view mirror glance in place of a head-turn look back prior to moving laterally on the roadway.

, As you approach any intersection, junction or place where turns may be made, regardless of your intended direction, choose a conspicuous and predictable lane position with plenty of buffer space around you. The savvy cyclist adjusts for the proper position at least 100–200 feet (30.5–61.0 m) prior to the intersection, if she is not already positioned there prior to that.

, Turning motorists often check only for traffic where vehicular traffic is expected, sometimes overlooking pedestrians or cyclists positioned elsewhere. But sometimes they overlook even properly positioned cyclists (just like motorcyclists or even cars are sometimes overlooked), which is why the extra buffer space is important. Look for evidence that you've been noticed - and eye contact does not count (someone can look right at you and still not ""see"" you) - before relying on being noticed. Pay attention to where they are looking, which way their tires are turned, if they're rolling or completely stopped, etc. It's only a matter of time before someone overlooks you and cuts you off... so be ready and not surprised when it happens!

, Remember that signalling your intent to move does not give you the right of way to move. Any traffic already moving into that space needs to yield to you first. So signal clearly and look back, waiting for others to yield to you before moving. If you need to traverse across several lanes, move with looking back, signalling and negotiation for each lane change, one at a time, just as you would if riding a motorcycle.

, Start preparing early so you have plenty of time and space to move across the road one lane a time with signalling and negotiation as needed. If you are not comfortable with this, pull over, get off your bike and walk it through the intersection using crosswalks based on pedestrian rules of the road.

, Other drivers are likely to not expect straight-through traffic to be traveling there. Prior to the intersection, move left if you're not already controlling the rightmost lane that goes straight.

, Instead, merge left to get behind them, or even further left to pass them on the left. Beware of motorists that pass you, and then slow down enough for you to catch up and start passing them... on the right. More often than not, they are slowing in order to turn right... that's you're cue to look back and merge left to pass them on the left. Don't shoot the gap! If you are passing stopped cars on the right, beware of the possibility of a passenger door suddenly opening - especially if it's a taxi. Passing on the left, with more than four feet of passing space, is much safer, and usually faster.

, It is important for you as a cyclist to avoid speeding, and to obey all speed limits in slow zones (such as around pedestrian crossings, and school zones).

, The rules will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but, generally, shoulder use is optional but never required, and bike lane use is generally only mandatory when faster traffic is present and they can be safely and reasonably used. Beware of glass, rubble and other debris that tends to collect in shoulders and bike lanes because they are not being continually swept clean by vehicular traffic as the rest of the road is. Take into account the extra risk you assume by riding as far right as bike lanes and shoulders usually are because you are less conspicuous there (less conspicuous to drivers approaching from behind as well as to those ahead of you). Being so far right also shortens your sight lines to potential hazards in front of you, and reduces the amount of safety/buffer space between you and potential hazards near the edge of the road. In short, decide where to ride by imagining where you would ride if there was no stripe per the considerations given above, and ride there. Remember that stripes are in fixed locations, and the best location for you to ride depends on the current situation and conditions, so don't blindly rely on bike lane stripes for guidance.

, Remember that bike lanes are usually only 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) wide, so even if it's a relatively wide 5' bike lane adjacent to parked cars, you should not ride in that bike lane. The closest you should be to the parked cars is by tracking on the bike lane stripe.

, Even more than when riding in bike lanes, be aware of the additional risk assumed by riding where traffic is easily overlooked, whenever approaching any intersection with a road or driveway.

, Generally, it is not a good idea to ride on the sidewalk and in many jurisdictions, it is illegal to do so. One clear exception to this is where a sidewalk has been specifically designated as a marked bike path but be careful still, as it is likely you will still need to share it with pedestrians, as well as cyclists coming in the opposite direction. On the whole, many roads are generally smoother, making the ride easier, quicker, and more comfortable than trying to navigate a bumpy, frequently obstructed sidewalk.

, This is especially true if these are the first rains for some time: oil and grease in the tarmac is free to float on the surface. Therefore do not lean into curves and be wary of slick markings and drain covers. In icy conditions extreme caution is required, but consider delaying your journey until after midday or canceling it altogether. Having large wheels will help you ride in wet conditions.

, The tyres can otherwise get caught in the tracks, or when wet the wheels will slip.

, This can be invaluable to EMS responders if you're unconscious.

, Motorcycles are required to have a front headlight on at all times, because they are smaller and harder to see than other vehicles. A bicycle is smaller yet. Nighttime riding usually requires a front white light as a minimum, although adding other lights will help to increase your visibility, along with reflective clothing as discussed above. Lighting is useful both for day and for night riding:


During the day, a flashing front light is good because it attracts more attention.
At night, use a constant front light rather than a flashing one. Its steady stream of light will provide adequate visibility to drivers, while a flashing front light at night soon gets to be annoying as it strobes your view.
Whenever it gets dark outside, turn on your headlight. This means the moment that you feel your eyes straining to see well, even if the sky is not pitch black; remember too that drivers need to see you during twilight, so err on the side of turning on the light earlier rather than later.
Put a red LED strobe or beacon on the back of your bike or your helmet. It is OK for this light to flash or have special patterns, because it disrupts night vision less than the white front lights, and because drivers do not count exclusively on your rear light to gauge their distance.

, Riding a few feet one way or the other might not seem like it should make a big difference in terms of being seen since you should be in someone's field of view either way, until you think about drivers' ""zone of attention"" rather than their field of view. Being within their field of view is usually not enough to be noticed - you have to be in a place that makes you relevant to them to be noticed - be where they are paying most of their attention. While being in the ""motorcyclist position"" in the traffic lane does not guarantee that you'll be noticed, it makes being overlooked much less likely, and gives you a better vantage and more buffer space from hazards. Also, if you have a mirror, being well out in the lane makes it easy to determine when you are noticed, since motorists obviously slow down when they notice a cyclist up ahead in ""their lane"". If you're off to the side, then they often don't slow down even if they do notice you, so you have no way to discern those who have not noticed you from those who have. You can always temporarily move aside to let faster traffic pass, as being conspicuously well out in the traffic lane is the best way to be noticed.

, Cycling at night can be extremely dangerous. Always travel on a well lit road or path with no debris or potholes. Go slower than you would in the daytime, as you still need enough time to react to danger, and the lower visibility makes night cycling dangerous for this reason.

, Hand signals are vital if you are going to turn. This is especially important for left turns, because they involve crossing traffic. Ignore what you were told in elementary school; instead, if you are turning left, extend your left arm, and if you are turning right, extend your right arm. Signals that were once based on the left arm were devised for driving a car, a situation where only the left arm can reach out the window.

, When you are passing pedestrians or other cyclists, it is essential that you warn them of your presence. Not only is this polite, but it reduces the chance of collisions, because pedestrians are less likely to suddenly swerve into your way, and they may move over, keeping you out of traffic. A bell, or a loud voice ""On your "", ""Passing"" are good ways to attract attention.

, When riding past parallel-parked vehicles, leave enough room for the vehicle door to swing completely open just as you are about to pass. Getting ""doored"" can cause serious injury and even death.

, Let children learn at their own pace and offer lots of encouragement. They will fall off, so be prepared with hugs and motivational talk to get them back to trying. Be patient at all times.

, This should feel like ""second nature"" to them.

, Discourage them from doing this and warn them about the dangers of not holding onto the handle bars or going down steep hills too fast.

, As a person responsible for your children's well being, it is up to you to take the time to scout out good routes and places with your children where they can ride in safety.

Wear bright, easy-to-see clothing in the daytime.,
Wear clothing with reflective material at night.,
Wear reflective material on shoes and helmets.,
Use lights and reflectors to improve visibility at night.,
Ride in a way that ensures drivers see you.",How to Be Visible on the Road when Bicycle Commuting," During daytime hours, brightly colored clothing is key to being visible. Immediate visibility is the key reason why road workers wear bright colors, like fluorescent green-yellow or fluorescent orange, so use their safety lesson as your guide too.Make sure you just don't stand still on your bike, move your legs or hands so they see something move :)


Judge for yourself as you are driving in your motor vehicle. Watch for pedestrians or workers in different types of clothing. You will probably see that those wearing the bright fluorescent colors are visible long before any person wearing darker colors.
Reflective material does not provide a huge advantage during the day but is essential in low light conditions. If you live in a place that frequently experiences grey and overcast weather, lots or rain or snow, then reflectivity will be useful during the day too.;
, Clothing or a safety vest that has reflective strips will greatly improve your visibility at night. Low cost vests with reflective strips are available at most automotive supply stores and home improvement stores. These vests are lightweight, can be slipped on over your normal outerwear, and provide improved visibility at night.

, Also add reflective material to pedals and other bicycle parts. Most bicycle shops carry safety gear such as reflective ankle bands, reflective arm bands, reflective tape, and other safety gear designed specifically for cyclist. You can purchase reflective adhesive tapes that can be applied to most surfaces. Everything you can do to improve your visibility will improve safety.

, Reflectors are most effective at night when vehicles are using their headlights. Blinking red lights on the rear of your bicycle and solid or blinking white lights on the front can enhance visibility and improve safety.


Most areas have laws that require reflectors, as a minimum, when riding on public roadways. Many states, provinces and local governments are passing laws that require powered lights on bicycles when riding at night. Bicycle headlights come in two categories: see or be seen:
Lights in the see category provide enough light to allow riders to see the roadway in front of them in dark conditions. The illumination distance is related to the speed of the cyclist. You want to have enough illumination distance to ensure you can see potential obstacles or hazards and have enough time to stop safely. In other words, you do not want to override your headlights. If you are a fast rider, you will need a higher powered light that projects light far enough in front of your bicycle to allow a safe reaction time.

Be seen lights allow the rider to be seen by drivers when riding at night. These lights, often blinking lights, help to make the cyclist visible at night. The blinking effect can aid in getting a driver's fast attention and are useful when there is sufficient ambient light to allow the cyclist to see the roadway.
Many riders use lights even in daytime conditions, again with the thought being “everything you can do to improve your visibility will improve safety”.
Light intensity, measured in lumens, can range from a few lumens to well over 1000 lumen for bicycle lights. One key thing to consider when choosing a bicycle headlight is how far ahead of the bicycle the light will illuminate.
Black ""ghost"" reflective tape blends in with black bike parts (or even clothing, though you'd probably have to stitch it on) in the daytime, but appears bright at night. The gray tint absorbs much of the light shining on it from any given direction, but the retro-reflective prisms or beads' focusing of light back toward its source more than offsets the partial loss to the tint to shine powerfully in drivers' eyes.

, Do this by following the “rules of the road”. Most areas have bicycle safety laws that require bicycles to follow the same rules as motor vehicles when using public roadways.


Some riders feel that riding against traffic is safer, because it allows them to see oncoming traffic. However, riding against traffic causes several major problems. One of the most important aspects of riding with the traffic flow is that this puts the cyclist in a position that motor vehicle drivers expect to see other users of the roadway.
In countries that have right-hand traffic (cars drive forward on the right side of the road), drivers coming from a crossroad expect to see other traffic coming at them from the left. If you are riding against traffic, you will be in position that drivers do not expect.

Kick the bike with your turn.,

Catch the pedal with your left foot.,
Guide the bike where you want it to go.",How to Tail Whip1," To do a BMX tail-whip, you'll need some serious air. It's hard (though not impossible) to tail-whip from the ground, so practice on a quarter-pipe or other jump that you can get up off the ground high enough to whip the bike around safely and have a chance of landing it. Practice getting big air and turning around clockwise to aim forward as you land.









One good exercise when you're trying to learn is to kick off your far leg. If you're turning to your right, practice lifting your left foot off the pedal and bringing your knee up while you picture yourself tail-whipping. Then, bring your foot back to the pedal for the landing. This will help you get the timing right and practice your form.The steeper the transition, the easier the trick. For some BMXers, it's easier to transition between a quarter-pipe and a wedge to land more safely. Do some experimenting and perfect getting good air before you try to tail-whip.;
, As you're transitioning, it's usually good to kick the bike when you're just starting to turn around in the air, not quite to parallel, but in between your jump and your transition. It'll take some work to get the timing right, but you want to make sure you've got enough time to get the pedals controlled under you before you come crashing down.








, If you're transitioning to the right, you'll kick the bike with your right foot, and vice versa. Usually, the best place to kick the back is on the frame, right under the seat. It's also less of a ""kick"" and more of a push, using your motion and gravity to follow through and ease the bike around. Most of the ""whip"" is done then with the wrists.








, Keeping the corny dance-move called the ""washing machine"" in your mind is actually a good way to get the proper arm motion down for doing a tail-whip. You want to rotate your arms around in the direction of your turn (clockwise, if you're going right) and, keeping a firm grip on the handles, whip the bike around as quickly as possible as you continue turning in the air.








, The hardest part of the trick is catching the bike under you and getting your feet back on the pedals. If you can catch it and push it down, you'll also be able to quickly find the other pedal with your other foot.









Ideally, you'll get the pedals under you for the safest and most comfortable landing. If you want, though, you can try a one-footed landing if you can't get it situated in time, and you can use the seat some if you need to.
If you need to bail, just letting go of the bars should usually lets gravity do its work. The bike will continue on it's trajectory away from you, and you can use your knee-pads to land safely and

, When you're trying to wrangle the bike back into position, use your arms as much as possible to fight gravity. Make it go where you want it to go to ensure a successful landing. Bring it back and under you to position it correctly and nail it. Keep practicing, and you'll get it eventually.

Decide what colour you want the bike.,
Buy the spray paint.,
Take your bike apart.,
Sand all of the existing paint off of the bike.,
Apply your base coat.,
Finished.

",How to Paint a BMX Bike," Think about it, your bike could be whatever colour you want it to be. You can even put a logo or pattern on it. Some cool colours are light blue, deep red, black or a neon colour. However, it's what you want and it's your opinion that matters. After all, the bike is yours, right? If you're stuck for ideas, look online or head out to a store that sells spray paint. Check out the colours they have and picture your bike looking like that. If you like it, go for it!;
, After you've spent some time thinking long and hard about what colour you want your bike to be, go out and purchase the spray can. Spray paint is much easier to work with and lasts longer, too. You might want to get two or three cans of your base coat colour and a can of your second colour if you're having a logo or pattern on top.

, The bike is much easier to work with if all of the parts are separate. If you really don't know how to take your bike apart or you really don't want to, you can either bring your bike to a friend or specialist that can take your bike apart or just cover all the parts that you don't want to get paint on with masking tape. However, the result can be slightly scruffy.

, If you try to paint straight on to the old finish, the new paint will not stay on the bike and the old finish will show through. This will look really untidy so avoid it. Use a medium-grit sandpaper to get all the paint off and then a super fine-grit sandpaper to smoothen out your parts. Make sure that all of the paint, dust and grease is off before continuing to the next step.

, Apply one thin layer of paint onto the bike. The mistake most people make is that they want to cover all of the bike on the first coat. When the paint dries, it will look very uneven. Avoid this by just applying a thin layer of paint. Let it dry for about forty-five minutes then apply a second coat. Repeat this step until you like the finish. After that, apply a coat of lacquer to seal in the paint.

Practice bunny-hops first.,
Practice kicking the scooter out.,
Practice jumping and whipping, but land on the ground first.,
Try to land.,
Keep practicing.",How to Tail Whip2," If you start immediately with the tail-whip, chances are you'll hurt yourself. It's important to practice the little things first to build the skills necessary to complete a tail-whip. It'll be much easier to teach yourself slowly, practicing the steps leading up to a successful tail-whip.









To do a bunny hop, stand on your scooter and bounce straight up, keeping your feet on the board at all times, and landing safely on two feet. Practice landing smoothly to get used to the feeling of landing on the wheels and controlling it. To land a tail-whip, you'll have to be able to do this in your sleep., Another good skill-building exercise is to practice stepping off the scooter and kicking it as you would in a tail-whip, except that you'll be standing on the ground.









To do this, ride the scooter slowly and then step off the board with your right foot on the left side of the board, and kick the scooter around (counterclockwise) with your left foot. Practice stopping the board with your kicking foot to get a feel for how to control the spin with your wrists, and how to stop it safely.

, The next step in slowly learning to tail-whip is to combine the two skills you've already practiced, but basically bail-out and land on the ground. It's harder than it seems like it might be to jump and whip at the same time, so don't force yourself to try to nail the landing in addition to learning those necessary skills.









Scootering at a slow speed, do your bunny hop and kick the scooter around with both feet, holding onto the bars and controlling the spin with your wrists. Land flat on the ground with both feet and practice bringing the scooter down firmly in front of you, in the proper position for you to land on it.
You might start trying to land with one foot, or at least stopping the scooter with one foot before you try a full-on landing.

, It'll take a lot of practice to put it all together, but you can start by trying it standing still, doing a bunny hop and tail whipping around to try to land, but it's actually a little easier to do it in motion. Go at slow speed and don't be afraid to bail if it doesn't quite work out.








, This is the foundation for lots of scooter tricks, so it's worth sticking it out and trying to learn it, no matter how long it takes. Don't give up!

Seat and Post.,
Tires and Rim sets.,
Rim sets.,
Hubs.,
Sprockets.",How to Make a Pro Level BMX Bike," In general, frame size is based on rider height.


4'9""-5'2"" uses 18-19.5"" top tube frame
5'2""-5'5"" uses 20-20.5""
5'6""-6' uses 20.5-21"";
, These usually can all be purchased from one company in a combination. If you're planning on mixing brands, it is a good idea to use bike companies that don't make complete sets, just really good parts.

, If your frame has an integrated head tube, it calls for an integrated headset. If your bike has a standard 1-1/8 head tube, a 1-1/8 standard is required.

, Pedal choice is dependent upon your cranks, which are dependent upon your spindle, which is dependent upon your bottom bracket, which is dependent upon the frame BB shell type.

, There are 2 types of seats and about 3 types of seat posts.


Pivotal Seats are the most popular seat in modern BMX. They are super easy to maintain and to adjust. They are very slam-able. All pivotal posts are connected to the seat by a 6mm Allen bolt that threads into the hole of the post.
Seats with rails can be used with Posts with guts (your typical stock post) or Micro Adjust. Certain posts of this type are almost as slam-able as pivots. Micro-Adjust posts are adjusted by 2 5mm Allen bolts or other bolts dependent upon the brand.

, Typically, a 20x1.95 tire is acceptable for all styles. However, there are tires that work better for street, dirt, and park.


Street. You want a smoother tread, fatter tire (20x2.0, 20x2.25, 20x2.3).
Dirt. Knobbier tires are a requirement. Depending on your riding style racers need 20x1/8 skinny tires but trail diggers might want 20x1.75-20x2.0.
Park. Go for smooth but grippy tires.

, Pretty much all rims for non-race are 20x1.75 rims. They are compatible with tires 20x1.75-20x2.5 (really fat). Straight rims are compatible with brakes, and chrome rims are the best for brake power. Round rims allows for less rolling resistance because they are more aero-dynamic. If you're a brake-less rider aero or round rims are a good choice. Spokes on any type of rim should be kept tight. Double wall rims are the most useful rims on BMX, they are strong and generally light-weight.

, Cassettes and Freewheels are the common rear hub. Cassettes go from 8 tooth to 20 tooth cassettes and freewheels range from 13 teeth to 20 teeth. Free coasters are another type of BMX hub. They resemble cassettes, but are silent and when going backwards you do not need to pedal backwards. Popular gearing are 22 or 23/8 (##=sprocket teeth/#=rear hub teeth), 25/9, 28/10, 30/11, 32 or 34/12, 36/13, 38/14, 40/15, 42-48/16-18, 50/19 and 52/19 or 20

, Refer to the gearing list above for advice on gearing. Sprockets are on the spindle usually on the right side or left depending on which side the drive side of your hub is on. They come with 19mm adapters if they have a 22m bore or they will come with both size adapters if they have a 5/16 bore. Pick a nice light sprocket, that is all you need to know now.

, The left brake is useless and will only slow you down. If you want to go even faster, take off both brakes, but this is not recommended, for safety reasons.

, If you have a heavy bike, this may be the reason. Maybe your sprocket is too big or your frame is too heavy. Try to invest into a new frame, maybe like a Stolen or a Fit.

, These parts are only more weight onto your bike. Yes, they can help, but would you rather go faster and have fun? This one is optional but not recommended, since it does put you at more risk.

, If you use 4pc, that's just even more weight.

, If you have good tires, you are practically set. People may think that skinny tires make you faster, but thick tires are so much better. Consider Cult Vans Tires.

, If your seat is too heavy, that could be the thing slowing you down. Get a Shadow Conspiracy seat, they for sure are the best seats out there.

",How to Barspin on a BMX," Make sure that your tires are rock solid. If they're not, pump them up. Tighten your stunt pegs to ensure that they stay on the bike. Tighten your seat to ensure you stay on the bike and tighten your handlebars so you can get a good grip on the bike. Replace your helmet if it's cracked or if it has suffered a hard knock. Even if you can't see the damage, it's there.;
, The bunny hop is the simplest but most important trick on a BMX bike. Most other tricks (including the barspin) use a bunny hop to get into or out of the trick. For example, a 180 is a bunny hop but spun around. However, without knowing the bunny hop, you can't 180.

, If you're going to barspin over a gap, ride a little bit faster. However, when first trying this trick, you should start flatland and work your way up to jumps and ramps. Keep your bike dead straight while riding. If you try and barspin at an angle, you will most likely bail.

, As soon as you get to a comfortable and steady speed, you need to bunny hop. Bunny hop as high as you can to get the cleanest spin. Think of it this way, the higher you bunny hop, the more time you have to bar spin. The more time you have, the less likely you are to bail.

, Throw the bars with your dominant hand. If that's your right hand, throw the bars clockwise. If your left hand is dominant, you're throwing the bars anti-clockwise. Wait for your bars to make a full 360 rotation before moving on to the next step.

, When your bars have nearly completed the 360 rotation, prepare your non-dominant hand to grab them. When the bars are straight, grab them as if you're going to ride off.

Even though these parts could weigh next to nothing, in total they all add up. Be sure you know what the different parts are and what they do when analyzing the bike––never remove anything vital.


Some unnecessary parts include: Chain guards, reflectors, lights, detanglers, brakes and possible stunt pegs.
If you're going to remove brakes, only remove one (probably the front brake). It's not recommended that you remove brakes at all.;
, Check the specs, do some research and figure out which parts of your bike weigh heavier than normal.

, This will allow you to figure out how to make your BMX bike lighter for cheaper. Remember to read reviews on the parts you buy before you buy them! Remember weight isn't everything.

, Many of the parts can be replaced. The focus needs to be on replacing the heavier parts with quality light parts that are strong, durable but weigh less. Start with cheap things like seats, pedals, pegs, etc. Once you've changed those over for lighter versions, you can move on to move expensive ones, such as wheels and tires.

, Before you buy any parts over 50 dollars, check your local Craigslist listings, as this can save you a lot of money.


Shop around online and in bike stores for the lightest of each certain part to replace the old one.

, If you bought your bike stock, which means all of the parts are from the original bike, then chances are you have a railed seat. Buying a pivotal seat is fairly cheap and easy to put on. As well as improving the weight, this type of seat will also allow you to choose different colors.

, Most stock bars are usually a lot heavier than higher end bars.

, Your current wheels probably have many more spokes (metal rods) than needed. While you could remove them, be aware that to do so is very unsafe. A safer and better option is to buy new ones that are lighter. New ones will freshen up your performance as well as your bike's lifespan.

, Default tubes are usually very thick and lined with more metal. A thinner tube has less metal, therefore less weight.

, This is the extreme of all extremes but some riders do it to good effect. Creating holes takes out chunks of metal from your bike, removing chunks of weight with it. Be careful where you drill though, as you still want to be able to use the bike when you're done with this whole process.

, If your handle bars are low and you find there's 8 inches (20.3 cm) of metal sitting inside your frame, saw it down to 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm). If your seat seems to have the same problem, saw that down too. Any parts of your bike that stick out from the rest of the frame, saw them down. This means if your bars are too wide, remove the grips and saw them down. In fact, keeping the grip off will save weight in itself.

, By doing a 5-minute workout every day, this might help you gain more strength so you won't need an extremely light bike. Durability is more important than weight. Remember to do your research and happy biking!

,
Get a fair amount of water (remember water restrictions!)",How to Build Dirt Jumps (BMX/Hard Tail)," This should include plenty of open space, try to find gold coloured dirt which will pack really well. You might have to dig down a bit to find it. (Make sure to get and permission from the property owner before you start.) Also, slightly downhill is preferable, because it makes it easier to maintain speed through the jump line.

, It's a good way of economizing space . Its more work to use a wheelbarrow, but your line will be of higher quality. Good jumps take lots of time, and then even more maintenance. But they are worth it.

, Using that wheelbarrow, make a huge pile of dirt, more than you think you'll need. Pack it down as you pile it up, paying particular attention to the back and sides. The lip will come later. Right now, you're making the base nice and solid.

, This should be nice and wide, and transition smoothly to flat. The steepness of the landing ramp depends on the steepness of the lip. Just like before, pack it in, make it solid.

, The lip should be 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) wide, and the landing 3–5 feet (0.9–1.5 m). Don't build a ""rhino horn"", put in the time and do it right, so you don't have to redo it later. Pay attention to the curve of the jump, make sure your bike can roll over it smoothly, not with a sudden jolt into a new direction. The faster you're going, the longer the transition from flat ground to take off needs to be. The landing ramp should be a little shorter, vertically, than the take-off ramp.

, If there are any retaining walls or ledges, make sure you build them solidly. If you're aiming for length in the air, around a 40 degree angle would be best. For height, build the ramp at a greater angle. Make sure your jump doesn't get too steep too quickly!

, You can make different style jumps, you can have a flat double (where the takeoff and the down ramp are the same height), step up (where the down ramp is higher than the takeoff), step down (where the down ramp is lower than the take off) usually the best for length, Table top (where the gap between the takeoff and landing is filled).

, There needs to be a good rain, followed by aggressive packing in before the jump will be solid enough to hit smoothly. Remember, good jumps take time!

, This will save many headaches later, and ultimately improve ""flow"".

, To do this, sprinkle cement sand over the up ramp and leave it overnight. The moisture overnight will make the cement set, protecting the lip and keeping it just how you like it.

,,,, and SLOWLY pour the water over all the dirt on the jump, pour it too fast and the dirt will just run off


Important: Don't ride on the jump the day you built it. Remember, good jumps take time!






Do not cement this jump.
If you add 1 inch wide pieces of wood that are at the dirt level it will make the jump stronger and you will be able to get more traction. Make sure the wood is the same length as the jump and put them every 2 inches.

,
Now After you have all of your holes marked it is time to drill the frame that you are putting the guards on.

,
Drill and tap it to the same size bolts you are using.,
Bolt them up.

Be really comfortable on a BMX.,
Adjust the flip for a nice landing, but for starters get a good 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) of air.,
To give you an idea of how you want to pull off the ramp, picture you are on a roller coaster going through a loop.,
Try taking a few practice runs, going as fast as you're planning on going for the real one.,
As you approach the ramp, pump into it, pushing forward into it, going with the transition as if you were trying to pick up speed.,
Now you're off the lip, flipping upside down.,
If you go completely around on the rotation and you see the ground, it will happen faster than you can think, but just land.,
Now if you went too slow, or didn't commit to the flip enough and you under rotated... good luck, odds are your front wheel is going to land first and anything from having sore wrists from the front impact, to landing in a tangled heap on your bike can happen.

,
Next try pumping harder into the ramp going off the lip, this will speed up your rotation and get you over rotating, or landing on your wheels.

,
Wear pads, all of them, every time you ride your bike.

",How to Backflip a BMX," It's best if you have been riding a few years and have other easier tricks like 360s down first, so you know how your bike likes to move.;
, It's easiest to learn on a 5 foot (1.5 m) ramp, not too steep, and not too mellow.

, You know how you're looking ahead with your head back too see where you're going? That's exactly how you flip.

, Then get a feel for the transition of the ramp pumping into it, and starting your rotation then taking your feet off and landing holding your handlebars.

, This gets your rotation started and really is the key to flipping. Pump hard into the ramp, and picture like you're going through a loop on a roller coaster.

, No matter what happens, don't let go until you can see the landing! If you go off the lip starting a flip and let go right away, your body will keep rotating and your head and back are going to hit the ground harder than you have ever hit it before, and to top it off the bike could land back on top of you. If you hold on, even if you don't make the full rotation, you're only falling from 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) up, you might get banged up but you're much better off.

, It's that simple. Your body will usually correct small imperfections in your rotation automatically and as long as you judged your speed right, you're about to roll away from your first flip! Now if you went too fast, or rotated too quickly (which is pretty easy to do on a new ramp), you may over rotate. This may sound scary, but it's usually no big deal. If you feel you're over rotating, once you see the ground, take your feet off and ditch the bike. 9 times out of 10, you are going to land on your feet...just go a little slower or pump into the ramp a little less next time.

A three-eighths inch (9.525mm) socket with wrench extension
Sockets in 19mm (three-quarter inch), 17mm (0.686-0.669/eleven-sixteenths inch) 15mm (0.591-0.625/five-eighths inch)
Allen wrenches in 4mm (0.15748 inch), 5mm (0.19685 inch), 6mm (0.23622 inch), 8mm (0.31496 inch)Open-end wrench in 15mm (0.591 inch) or an adjustable wrench
Wire cutters or scissors
Grease
Phillips and flat-blade screwdriver
Box cutter or knife
Air pump
Hammer and rubber mallet
PVC pipe or old headset cup;
, Using the box cutter or knife, carefully cut the tape or cut the box. Remove all the parts from the box. Cut any zip ties that may be fastening parts together, and remove foam or cardboard that’s wrapped around parts.Lay the parts out on a flat surface so that you can see each one.

, Use the instructions as a reference if you are assembling a new bike. Inspect the parts for damage. While most bikes have the same basic components, different manufacturers will ship their bikes in different stages of assembly. Depending on how much pre-assembly has been done, your parts may include the:Bike frame
Saddle (the seat) and seat post
Handlebars and grips
Front fork (the Y-shaped part that attaches to the front wheels and handlebars)
Front brakes, rear brakes, and cables
Reflectors
Front and rear wheel assemblies and tires
Chain
Peddles
Additional box or bag of small parts and hardware

, Most BMX bikes come pre-assembled with the back wheel and front forks already attached to the frame. If you just bought your bike and are assembling it for the first time, skip forward to the appropriate section depending on how much pre-assembly has already been done on your bike.

, The crown race is a circular piece that sits on the bottom of the steering tube (the single tube attached to the fork) where the tube and fork meet. It forms the base of the headset (the component that allows the handlebars to rotate on the fork). Note that some bikes already have the race built in.


Hold the fork upright so that the bottom of the forks are facing the ground. It's a common mistake to damage forks during installation, so if you place the forks on the ground, rest them in old shoes or on a mat to protect them. Place the crown race over the steering tube and set it firmly at the base of the steering tube.

Crown race installation method A: Since you don't want to damage the crown race during installation, there are two ways you can put it on without damaging it. The first is to place an old headset cup (the cup-shaped component that makes up part of the headset) over the crown race. Hammer evenly around the headset cup to secure the crown race beneath in place without damaging it.Crown race installation method B: Slide a PVC pipe of the proper diameter over top of the steering tube and rest it on top of the crown race. Make sure the pipe is longer than the steering tube. Now, hammer the top of the pipe until the crown race is secure in place., First, lubricate the top of the crown race by applying a layer of grease. Then, slide a bottom bearing on top of the crown race and apply pressure to set it in place.


For integrated headsets, bearings are universal, so you don’t need to worry about which one goes on top or on the bottom., Insert the steering tube into the head tube (the short tube attaching the frame together at the front). Make sure the forks point toward the ground. Slide the top bearing on, making sure that the concave part sits inside the head tube, and apply gentle pressure to set it in place.

, Slide the cup on top of the bearing. It may be slightly difficult to get on, but it’s supposed to be that way. If you’re using them, slide on the spacers next, followed by the gyro (also called the detangler that allows the handlebars to rotate 360 degrees without tangling the brake cables) and the top gyro plate.


The gyro will slide over the spacers (if you’re using them), the bearing, and the cup, and sit on the head tube where it meets the frame.
The gyro top plate will sit on top of the spacers if you’re using them; otherwise, it will sit on top of the headset cup.

, The stem is the piece that slides into the steering tube and then attaches to the handlebars. Loosen the bolts on the handlebar stem. Slide the stem on to the top of the steering tube. Center a spacer over the hole. After that:


Grease the compression bolt (the threaded bolt that screws in and keeps the stem attached to the steering tube), and insert it into the hole in the stem.
Twist it into place or tighten it on with the appropriate Allen wrench.
Tighten the bolts that you loosened on the stem, gradually tightening one then the other so they are evenly and snugly attached., You can install the stem on the handlebars separately and then attach the entire assembly to the fork afterward. First, loosen the clamping bolts on the stem and remove the front face plate. Then:


Place the body of the stem on the ground groove up.
Rest the handlebars into the groove.
Replace the face plate so that it wedges the handlebar in between the two stem pieces, and use the bolts to fasten the face plate back to the body of the stem.
Tighten the bolts in an X pattern, applying even pressure to each bolt., Do this if you attached the stem right to the frame. Center the handlebars, and then attach the face plate to the body of the stem with clamping bolts. Snug them up evenly in an X pattern, but don't worry about tightening them all the way. You will be properly adjusting the handlebars later, once the bike is more complete. Align the handlebars so they are parallel with the fork.If you installed the stem on the handlebars separately, now attach the assembly to the rest of the bike. Position the handlebars and stem onto the steering tube. Grease the compression bolt and insert it. Twist it into place or fasten it with an Allen wrench.Install your gyro at this time if you are using one.

, Set the seat post clamp on top of the seat tube. Grease the inside of the seat tube (or the seat post) and insert the seat post into the seat tube. Adjust the seat to the appropriate height. Align the seat so the nose runs parallel with the frame and tighten the bolts on the seat clamp.


Your seat doesn't have to be in the perfect position right now, and you can always adjust it later on. But do make sure the maximum height line is below the seat tube, otherwise you risk damaging the stem., Or, if you have a bike repair stand, mount your bike to it now.


Bike stands can run you well over $100, but if you work on your bike often, you will help prevent strain on your back and knees by investing in one.

, The bottom bracket is composed of an internal spacer and two bearings that all hold the crankset. Run the spacer through the bottom bracket shell (the short tube that the seat tube and down tube attach to). Hold one side of the spacer in place with a finger as you set in the bearing on the other side. Once you’ve set the bearing in place, tap it in firmly with a rubber mallet. Repeat to install the bearing on the other side., The crankset is what attaches to the chain and the peddles to spin the wheels when you peddle. It's mainly composed of two crank arms (each one attaches to a peddle), a spindle (a rod that both crank arms attach to), and a sprocket (a wheel with cogs that attaches to the chain).


Insert the spindle into the right-side crank arm by matching up the splines (grooves) and pushing the spindle in. Screw in the bolt until it won’t twist any more. Slide the sprocket down the spindle, position it on the crank arm, and attach it with the sprocket bolt.Depending on the type of crank you’re using, you may have to put the sprocket on first, and then slide the spindle through and fasten it., Slide a crank spacer over the spindle so that it sits beside the sprocket. Insert the spindle into the bottom bracket and push it all the way in. Use a rubber mallet to give the crank a gentle tap or two to ensure it is firmly in place. Position the crank so that it is facing down and is perfectly vertical., Slide a spacer onto the left crank arm and insert it into the bottom bracket, so that it's vertical and facing upwards. Align the two cranks so that they are even, making sure they form a straight line (with the right crank facing down and the left crank facing the ceiling. Tap the left crank arm gently into place with the rubber mallet.

, Then, tighten the bolts. This will completely lock the cranks onto the spindle.


Check that both crank arms have approximately the same amount of clearance between them and the frame.If the clearance isn’t the same, you can adjust one of the crank arms by adding or removing spacers.

, Start by greasing the threads of each peddle. Use either the appropriate Allen wrench or peddle wrench (depending on your peddles) to attach one peddle to each crank arm. Use an open-end wrench if you don’t have a peddle wrench.Look for an ""L"" and ""R"" on your peddles for guidance about which one's for the left and right side.
The peddle on the right will tighten if you turn the wrench clockwise, but the peddle on the left will tighten counter-clockwise, which is the opposite of a regular bolt., Slide the safety washers over the axle and set them into place by pressing the tab on the washer into the tab hole on the dropouts.Thread the axle nuts on by hand, and then finish tightening them with either a wrench or ratchet and socket.To avoid a crooked wheel, tighten each nut a little at a time, as this will help keep the wheel centered.
If you’re installing pegs, make sure you do this before putting on the axle nuts. Pegs are short metal tubes that extend out from the wheel and act as foot holds for when you're doing tricks.
It's best to start with the front wheel installation because this will help keep the bike balanced as you work., Slide the axle into the dropouts.

, Wrap the chain around the back sprocket first, followed by the front sprocket. Then, close the chain by:Butting the two ends of the chain together.
Sliding a master link (the open-faced link that can be connected to attach the chain ends) through each chain end to join them.
Pressing a plate around the two pins of the master link.
Sliding the clip over top of the plate and snapping it into place. Use a flat-head screwdriver to snap it in place if necessary.

, Loosely install your pegs or axle nuts. Pull the wheel back to tighten the chain, and then tighten the pegs or axle nuts a little more (but not all the way). To make sure your chain isn't loose, start by tightening the non-drive side of the bike first (the side opposite the chain). Then:


Straighten out the wheel and tighten the axle nut or peg on the drive side.Then, snug up each side evenly until the pegs or axle nuts are on properly.

, Once the wheels and chain are on, flip the bike back over again or take it off the bike stand. Loosen the bolts on the stem if necessary and adjust your handlebars so they’re in a comfortable position. When you have the handlebars in the rights place, snug up the bolts in an X pattern. Tighten the compression bolt if the headset is loose.Make sure the stem and front tire are aligned before tightening your bolts.

, Slide the levers onto the handlebars and orient them in a position that’s comfortable for you. Tighten the levers with the appropriate Allen wrench. You have flexibility with the lever positioning, so take your time and move them around into different positions until you find the most comfortable one before tightening them up.


Try sliding the levers closer or farther apart to separate your hands more or bring them closer together. You can also rotate the levers on the handles to see how you like them oriented.

, First, lubricate the brake mounts, which are the little bolts sticking out from the front of the forks. Then, slide one brake arm onto the brake mount, followed by the spring. Loosely tighten the spring bolt with your fingers to ensure the brake arm is in place against the mount. Repeat on the other side.


Make sure you install the proper brake arms on the proper side of the bike.

, Insert the head of the cable into the lever, leaving the barrel adjuster (the screw mechanism that allows you to control tension) on the lever. Run the cable over the top of the crossbar, down the length of the fork to the wheel, and around the front of the fork and into the brake arm.


Make sure the cable isn’t so tight that it’s wrapped tightly around the fork, but also not so loose that it will rub against the tire.

, Use wire cutters to make a notch in the cable where it needs to be cut (where it feeds into the brake arm). Pull out the inside cable and cut the outer housing with wire cutters where you made the notch. Feed the inner cable back through the housing. Connect the cable to the brake arm and tighten the bolts., Tighten one side at a time. Loosen the spring bolt with an Allen wrench. Once it’s loosened, adjust the tension with a crescent wrench. When you’ve set the tension, use the Allen wrench to tighten the bolt again while holding it in place with the crescent wrench.As you adjust the tension, continue testing the brakes to ensure that they are applying pressure evenly.

, Hold the brake pad steady and loosen the bolt. Line up the pad so that it’s parallel with the rim. When it’s properly aligned, tighten the bolt again.


Make sure the brake pad isn’t actually touching the rim; you want it about one mm (0.04 inch) away from the rim."

Find a low fence and place the unicycle parallel to the fence so that you can use it for support as you mount the unicycle.,
Position the pedals of the unicycle in a slightly offset, vertical position so that one pedal is in the 4 o'clock position and the other is in the 10 o'clock position, mirroring the hands of a clock.,
Tilt the unicycle toward you until the seat of the unicycle rests between your legs.,
Continue to squeeze the seat between your thighs and place both of your hands on the fence.,
Step on the pedal closest to you in the 4 o'clock position with your dominant foot.,
Give yourself a little push with your other foot and sit on the unicycle seat, placing your non-dominant foot on the pedal furthest away in the 10 o'clock position.,
Hold on to the handrail and begin to pedal very slowly at first.,
Practice mounting and pedaling while holding on to a fence until you feel comfortable balancing on your own.,
Put the weight of your body directly over the seat.,
Move the unicycle forward by leaning your entire body and the unicycle forward as a single unit.,
Sit up straight when riding at a normal speed.,
Pedal backwards by sitting up straight with your torso over your seat and pedal the feet in short, 1/4-turn revolutions backwards.,
Continue to practice pedaling forward and backward while holding on to a fence or handrail for as long as necessary.,
Position your upper body directly over the seat and steady yourself for a turn.,
Use your hips to turn the unicycle quickly to the right or to the left.,
Pivot sharply on the wheel of the unicycle as you swing your hips by guiding the pedals with your feet.,
Hold on to a handrail when attempting to turn for the first few times.,
Remember to tilt your body slightly as you turn to encourage motion in the desired direction.,
Continue to pedal immediately after you turn.,
Position the pedals in the same vertical position you used to mount the unicycle.,
Transfer your weight to the foot on the lower pedal.,
Hold on to the handrail with one or both hands depending on your comfort level.,
When you feel stable, step down with the highest, dominant foot first.,
Immediately step your lower foot off as the first foot hits the ground to dismount .",How to Unicycle," You want the fence to be high enough for you to rest your hand at a comfortable height while riding.;
, If you know which foot is your front foot for sports like skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding, you will want the pedal in the 4 o'clock position to be on the side of your dominant foot, and the pedal in 10 o'clock position to be for your non-dominant foot.

, Squeeze the seat comfortably with your upper thighs.

, Keep your body and the unicycle facing forward and parallel to the fence.

, Note that this is the opposite movement than you would perform on a bicycle, which requires that you step on the pedal furthest away to gain forward momentum.


It will take a lot of practice to get used to moving backward instead of forward when mounting a unicycle. Take your time and be patient.

, You will immediately have to pedal slightly to keep your balance.


You want the wheel to rotate 1/4-turn backwards as soon as you mount the unicycle. Once you mount the unicycle, the pedals should be directly vertical.

, Lean slightly forward in order to maintain your balance.

, This can take several hours to several days depending on your abilities.


Once you feel ready, you can learn to free mount by following the same steps above without the assistance of a fence or handrail. Instead, use your hands to hold on to the seat as you mount or use your arms to help you balance.

, Make sure you keep your shoulders back, a common mistake while learning is to hunch you shoulders. This allows your legs and feet to be light on the pedals. If you are heavy in your feet, the pedals become more difficult to manipulate, making pedaling and balancing harder.

, This motion will feel awkward and possibly a bit scary at first, but you'll soon get used to it.


Make sure to move the unicycle and your body in one solid piece.
Don't just bend your upper body forward at the waist as doing so will throw you off balance and fail to propel the unicycle forward.

, Imagine that your back is an extension of the seat post.


To accelerate, tilt forward slightly and apply more force on the pedals.
To slow down, sit up straight and control the force exerted on the pedals. Be sure to keep your weight over the seat and refrain from tilting backwards when slowing down as this can be dangerous.

, Be careful not to lean back and lose your balance. It is much harder to break a backward fall than a forward fall.

, As you feel comfortable, you can let go of the handrail and begin to pedal without any support.

, Be prepared to use your body to guide the unicycle in either direction.

, Because your hips are the most centered part of your body/unicycle unit, most of your power for turning will come from the hips.

, This motion needs to happen quickly in order for you to keep your balance.

, As you get more comfortable, however, you can take your hands off of the rail and use your arms to support momentum in the correct direction. To do so, wind up and swing your arms in the direction opposite of the way you are turning.

, Stay close to your center of gravity and keep your weight over the seat.

, It is much more difficult to balance on a unicycle when the wheel is stationary.

, Make sure your dominant foot is highest and your non-dominant foot is lowest.

, Look forward with your gaze in order to maintain a grounded center of gravity.

, As you gain experience, you will no longer need to use a handrail to steady yourself as you dismount.


When you no longer need to hold on to something as you come down, you will transfer your hands to the seat simultaneously as you step down. This allows you to catch the unicycle instead of letting it to fall to the ground.

, Keep the weight on your lower foot the whole time.

, Be sure to time it right so that you don't lose your balance in the process.

Finished.

",How to Ride and Mount a Unicycle," There are a lot of cheap unicycles that make learning to ride difficult, the seats are poorly designed, and will they break quickly.;
, You will almost surely start with a 20"" or a 24"" wheel.

, The seat height is critical: you should be able to reach the bottom pedal, with just a small crook in your knee. Get an extension on the post if needed. The post itself should be easily adjustable. Make sure the pedals are rubber (and not metal). It's hard enough to learn, without doing it on a cheap, poorly-setup unicycle!

, Heavy duty hand pads are a must! Knee pads are an option, but, you don’t want to restrict your movements either. Very well padded shorts are highly recommended: you are going to land on the pavement a lot at first! Depending on your athleticism, you may want to consider a helmet.

, Someplace you can hold on to, but, won’t get hurt (and won’t hurt someone else). Tennis nets, a wall, or a smooth fence, are good: you want a barrier where you can ride along and hold on to something safely. Holding on to a friend or a post, is a very poor substitute, and not recommended (unless the friend enjoys getting his shins hit with your pedals).

, There’s little point in practicing for hours on end immediately: your body seems to learn between your work-outs.

, Step on that pedal with the foot of your weaker leg. Then, throw your leg over the seat, and sit on the uni. Then, step on the other pedal (pulling yourself up while holding onto something for support).

, Rotate the wheels ½ turn forward and backward. All your weight should be, on the floor of your pelvis (and not on your thighs or calves). Trust me, you’re not going to ride off anywhere immediately! Just concentrate on getting the feel of your vehicle.

, Expect that you will fall off. At first, you will hardly go a full revolution of the wheel, actually. But, with practice, will come perfection (or at least, a few revolutions!)

, You will advance from, a few revolutions, to, riding off into the sunset, quite quickly. One day, it will just…suddenly happen! You'll be riding a unicycle!,"

Learn how to mount and ride a unicycle.,
After you can unicycle and feel comfortable, you can start to learn how to hop and eventually hop up stairs.

,
While you are unicycling slow down and almost come to a stop (this should be done on flat ground away from any obstacles).,
Reach down and grab under the seat with your dominate hand.

,Now bend your knees (most of your jump power will come from your ankles)

,
As you straighten your knees push up with your ankles and pull up on the underside of the unicycle with your hand.

,
When you land you can either continue to hop or start to pedal.

,
Practise until you are comfortable hopping on flat ground.

,
When you are comfortable on flat ground, find a place where one section of the ground is higher than the rest or use a short platform.

,
Start to hop beside the ledge and, when you are ready hop, lean towards the ledge.,
If done correctly you will now be on top of the ledge.

",How to Hop on a Unicycle,";
,, When you are stopped your strong foot should be in the front with your weak foot in the back.

,,,,,,, Make sure that you hopping high enough to clear the ledge.

Make sure the uni is ready for you!,
Be prepared to sit higher than what you'd do on a bicycle.,
Find a good place to climb on.,
What follows is written for right footers.,
Start getting on the uni.,
Be prepared to get off.",How to Get on a Unicycle," Obvious? See tips. Wear shoes that won't slip on the pedals.;
, This is since the pedal's axis (the wheel axle here) is higher and you pedal directly above that axis and not behind it. Deal with your fear of falling. If you happen to fall, your feet will not be all that high off the ground. Practise jumping forwards and backwards off an object half a metre high. Your feet will be closer to the ground than that! (Unless it's a giraffe or 36""er you're trying to get onto.) There are only two things that could happen: either the wheel could kick forward or backward out of control, leaving you on your feet, or the wheel could twist and you'd most likely fall to the side away from your support.

, The surface below the wheel should be level and free of obstacles. Ideally, you should have support on both sides. This support could be a doorway, a narrow corridor, two stacks of chairs or a livestock crush pen. Where support from only one side is available, try to move something there to provide the other side support, eg. a clothes horse, stepladder, vehicle or an assistant with a rigid shoulder. The height of the support should be from about your belt height to your shoulder height.

, Interchange ""left"" and ""right"" you're left footed. Put the unicycle in your crotch with the wheel in front of you. Viewed from the right hand side, that pedal's crank must be in the seven o'clock position when you put your foot on it. (See picture.) For left footer, the pedals in the five o'clock position viewed from the left. Do not try to climb on with this pedal high! The other pedal will whack your shin and you'll remember it for some time!

, All that remains is to move the other foot from the ground to a pedal. Well, there's a little more involved. What you're aiming at is to have the pedals level, where you have maximum control. The lower pedal should move higher as you climb on and the wheel roll slightly forward. Hold your support on either side as you climb on but do not pull on it. If you're trying with support on only one side use both hands or have one hand on the seat. You have one foot on the ground and one on a pedal. Push equally hard on the pedal and on the ground as you move up. The rear pedal should not move down much. Get both pedals level as soon as possible. Your instinct will be to stand on the pedals but try to transfer your weight to the seat. Hold the position as you gain control and enjoy the view!

, These instructions would be incomplete without a word on how to get down again. It's simple: grab the seat with your right hand and lift your left (front) foot off the pedal. That's it. Your equilibrium is shifted behind the axle and you'll find yourself stepping off the uni onto the ground. Practise climbing on and off till you can do it with confidence.

Once you feel confident that you can ride and recover on a flat, rocky trail, then you are ready to tackle inclines and declines.,
Keep practicing.",How to Off Road Unicycle," Off road unicycling means getting off paved areas and surfaced roads and hitting the dirt or rock trails. If you don't want to wander too far from home, you could use local parks and trails. Alternatively, you could pack the tent, a backpack, your unicycle, and head out into the country for a genuine get-away, remote experience.


Core strength and balance are essential for good unicycling, on all surfaces. You will need to be strong, agile, and have a good sense of balance.
It is a really good idea to try to attend a workshop run by professionals in off-road unicycling. They will be able to watch your technique (or lack of it) and set you straight. Look for local clubs, groups, or university teams for possible weekend courses.;
, Off-road unicycles or mountain unicycles are different from their city cousins. The off-road unicycle will have tires similar to those of mountain bikes (larger and knobby), with the ability to handle any terrain. In addition, off-road unicycles tend to have stiffer saddles, lighter and larger hubs and rugged frames. There are other possible features too (such as rim brakes), which your retailer can convince you the worth of paying for.


Get all the safety gear together before you even start. Always wear your helmet, elbow pads, and shin guards!

, Rough terrain is hard enough on a bicycle. On a unicycle, it is going to feel challenging at first, so expect to make slow progress. A good approach to going off-road the first time is to try grass, and then gradually progress to rougher textured terrain.


Practice on grass first. It provides resistance and some bumps to get you used to being off paved areas. And if you fall, it's usually kind to your bones.

, At this stage, it's good to stay near home as you'll appreciate the opportunity to nip home and re-energize in comfort. A number of countries, such as the USA, Canada, and New Zealand, have online directories of suitable trails for off-road or mountain unicycling. Off-road terrain can range from dirt tracks, hiking trails, fire trails, mountain bike trails, to paths made by animals such as deer, goats, or sheep.


Find flat dirt trails first. Try to find one that doesn't have any rocky outcrops or potholes. The smoother it is to begin with, the better. The idea is to simply get used to the feel of unicycling over dirt and minor bumps at this stage. Ride as straight as you can, going as slowly as you need to feel confident.
Progress to a bumpier, pebble or small rock strewn pathway.
At all times, concentrate. Learn to read the trail as it looms ahead so that you know what to avoid - this comes with practice and experience., This can help to give you a little more control over the process, as well as helping you to place more force on the front pedal.Keep your backside about half an inch to an inch off the seat.


Keep practicing until you can not only unicycle on the rough terrain but you also feel confident that you are able to recover from going over bumps, rather than tipping over.

, These bring their own set of hazards to the novice off-road unicyclist.


Look for low, gently sloping hills to begin with. As with the first time you try rough terrain, try to find a smooth incline to begin with.
Ride up the hill at varying speeds. Start out slow, then gradually build up speed until you feel comfortable going up the hill fairly quickly. Pull up on the seat as you go uphill, as this will give extra climbing force – you may need to keep practicing to feel confident using only one arm for balance.
Gradually increase the steepness of the inclines and keep trying out the varying speeds. Note that bunny hopping can be a source of help as you climb higher on steeper hills.Practice declines. This is not as hard as going uphill but the speed means that there is a greater likelihood of falling a longer way and hurting yourself considerably. Also, going downhill requires a lot of strength in your legs and grip, to slow down the unicycle's speed.Hold the seat when going downhill. You will need to be able to pull the seat up enough to apply backward pedal pressure to slow down. As with a bike, it's much harder to ride slowly downhill than it is to ride fast. Bend your knees inward as this lets you squeeze together your legs and apply pressure on the seat.Concentrate on keeping your feet on the pedals as you ride downhill, as bumps are liable to throw your feet off. It's a good idea to practice riding one-footed to get used to the balance required in the event that one foot flies off.
Again, bunny hopping skills can help, or using the technique of ""switchback"" on steeper, slippery terrain. Once you've mastered downhill, you're ready to enter MUni challenge races!If it's too steep, get off and walk until you feel surer again. That's better than having an accident.

, As with any learning, practice is essential - no article, no teacher, no theory can teach you muscle memory. You simply need to get out there, and learn by giving it a go, again and again.


Challenge your mountain bike buddy to a race when you're super confident. This can be a great test of strength and ability when you're ready for it because there is no way you'll want that mountain bike beating you!

Acknowledge your feelings.,
Talk to other fans.,
Eat something.,
Turn off the TV.,
Get a little exercise.,
Remember it’s just a game.",How to Cope when Your Favorite Sports Team Loses1," Sometimes people allow things like the performance of their favorite team to affect their emotions. That’s okay. If you are angry or upset about your team losing, don’t pretend otherwise. Give yourself a chance to vent a little bit, or at least be disappointed.Keep control. Because it’s only a game, there is no reason for your anger or sadness to lead to personally destructive behavior. If you are at the game, go ahead and yell a bit, but avoid shouting at other fans (especially fans of the other team). Avoid fights or throwing things as well.;
, Sports are a great communal experience, and even if you are watching alone at home, there are other people out there enjoying the game too. Call your friends who are also fans to let off steam and cope with the disappointment of a losing team. Consider joining a fan club or online forums to talk more about your disappointment and even brainstorm ways to fix what went wrong. If you are going to suffer, it’s better to do so together., Food can be a great comfort when faced with disappointment, including watching your team lose. Just make sure to eat healthy if you can. People tend to reach for sweets and other unhealthy foods when dealing with a loss. Instead, make sure you are surrounded by healthier foods so that you aren’t tempted to pack on the pounds after defeat.Comfort food, a term for rich foods that tend to make people feel good after eating it, are popular choices after a loss. They are filling, and may remind people of pleasant memories like childhood, and other things to take the mind off of losing. Look for hearty foods like macaroni and cheese, stews, pot pies, meatloaf, and sweets, which are all popular “comfort” choices. To make these options a bit healthier, consider using lower fat creams and cheeses, swapping out beef for turkey in meatloaf or chili, or adding vegetables. If you are looking for something sweeter, eat darker chocolate.Avoid overeating. While it is okay to enjoy a little snack to feel better after a loss, remember to control your portion size. Use smaller plates when eating to prevent you from overdoing it, and put away the snack after putting some on your plate., If you are watching the game, and your team loses, you don’t have to wallow in your disappointment. Turn off the television and do something else. Find another activity to take your mind off of the result.You’ll want to find something that has nothing to do with the team or game you just watched. Read a book, cook something, or watch a movie that takes place in an exotic location. Make sure you are doing something completely different.

, Some physical activity can be a good way to work off the frustration of watching your team go down in defeat. Even just a few pushups or jumping jacks, or a quick jog, can help work off your stress and disappointment. It can also give you an energy boost and stave off further anxiety over your team’s performance., Your life is full of more important things than who wins and loses a game that you aren’t even playing in. While people can lose sight of this in the excitement of a game, it is always a good reminder after a loss. This doesn’t make your disappointment at losing any less real, but can help you move past it quickly."

Get a collection!",How to Become a Hardcore WWE Fan," In order to become a true fan, you need to watch the programming that WWE offers. These shows are Raw (USA Network), Smackdown (Syfy Network), Superstars(WWE Network), NXT (WWE Network), and Main Event (WWE Network). It's okay if you don't have WWE Network right away. The main shows are Raw and Smackdown anyway, so strive to watch those more. In the mean time, you could see clips of the shows on WWE Network, on WWE.com. Each program features a different roster of wrestlers and a different feel. Watch the shows intently the first few times, and get used to the way the programming runs. RAW and Smackdown tend to feature the more popular superstars. Main Event usually feature mid-card superstars. Superstars feature lower card Superstars. (aka jobbers) And lastly, NXT features future WWE Superstars and Divas who strive to make it to the main roster.;
, WWE rules are unique, and can be confusing at first. If you watch the programming more, you will get the hang of the way matches work. Basically, a wrestler wins via have the shoulders of his opponent on the mat for a count of three or having them tap out to a submission hold. You can also win via Disqualification, Count Out, or Knockout. However, some matches have different stipulations.

, After you have watched the programming for 2-3 weeks, get to know the roster better by visiting pro wrestling websites and on WWE's official homepage. You will need to have them all memorized, if you're trying to be a true fan. (The time it takes to memorize everyone varies, but the harder you work, the faster you'll learn.) Set goals for yourself to have a certain amount of wrestlers memorized by a deadline - this method should take a week or two. Make sure you know the major players of each brand, and the main finishing moves.

, Whatever you do, do not TRY to pick a favorite. This is where people go wrong and become fake fans! You don't pick your favorite wrestler, your favorite wrestler will pick you. Don't try to make yourself like someone, it all comes naturally. If you don't have a favorite wrestler by the end of the month, its OKAY! It takes time to build up actual love for a wrestler, not 1 day. You will have favorites, but there will be that one person that always sticks out to you, and can always get you pumped and happy to see them. When you do eventually have a favorite wrestler, try to stay updated with that person and try to learn about their life, where they came from, how they started, and so forth. This builds for a deeper connection and natural love for that person.

, Study up on the history of the company, and get to know the historic legends of the business, such as Hulk Hogan, The Rock, and ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin. Going to the WWE homepage is a good idea to study the history. You can also watch some of the many WWE DVD's, read one of their encyclopedias, or you could subscribe to the WWE Network for just $9.99.

, Go to a wrestling news or behind the scenes website that is credible. You will learn a lot about how the business works, and about recent events not shown on WWE television.

, Go to a WWE event and see the Superstars in real life. This is an experience any true WWE fan should do at least once or twice in their life. It doesn't matter if you go to a house show (WWE Live) or go to a top notch PPV like Wrestlemania. You should experience it if you are a true WWE fan.

, This is where most of the better matches take place and where feuds are resolved. In order to become a true fan, try ordering at least one or two pay per views a year to know what they are like.(Instead of paying $60 for a pay-per-view, you could just get WWE Network, for the low, low price of $9.99 and watch every pay-per-view, plus some.)

, Obviously you shouldn't become a fan if you don't enjoy wrestling.

, You can't be a WWE fan without some merchandise such as signed items, DVDs, action figures, belts, shirts, etc. You could even just go to the store and get a poster.(NOTE: Not everyone you see with WWE merchandise, is not a true fan, so if you don't really have much, it's ok.

, Hold on to the wall while you place the other foot on the pedal. Push down and balance yourself. You have to push forward not just down on the high pedal. If you push down and not forward, nothing will happen or you will go backward.

,, Start in your original position and push hard on your right foot. Don't do it too fast or you'll lose your footing.

, Then just start to pedal.

, Have them stand on either side of you. Put a hand on each of their shoulders. Look straight ahead, find something to focus on and keep looking at it. Do not put your weight on the spotters shoulders. Just keep them there for support. Keep your weight on the seat, or your feet will wobble up and down and you will fall off. Most people can learn to ride forward on a unicycle using the method described in this writing, with a couple hours of practice a day for one week. So, unicycles up dudes! And remember never never ever ever ever give up!, You need a lot more practice before free-mounting, and you should ride beside the wall using it for balance before trying to ride away from the wall.

Accept your impotence.,
Stay loyal to your team.,
Remember the good times.,
Be prepared to deal with taunting from other fans.,
Be optimistic.,
Talk to a therapist.",How to Cope when Your Favorite Sports Team Loses2," There is nothing you can do to affect the outcome of a game, including wearing those lucky socks. Your team didn’t lose because you didn’t cheer loudly enough or sat in the wrong seat. Their failure is not your failure.One way to give yourself a little more control is to play as your team in a video game. Set up the game they just lost, and get the result you wanted to see. If you’re feeling a little down, go ahead and set the difficulty on easy to really give your opponents the pounding you feel they deserve.

Playing fantasy sports is a way to be more active with the sport. Drafting your own lineup and trading players around can give you a small sense of control over events. Additionally, fantasy sports users are more likely to feel the positive emotions after winning matchups than the negative feelings that come with their favorite teams losing., One loss shouldn’t be enough to drive you from supporting your team. Staying loyal after a loss, or even when moving to a different city, can give you a big psychological boost.Plus, sticking it out through the bad times will make it feel even better when your team does win the big one.

, While losses hurt, no team loses all the time. To get over a big defeat, think about your team’s good times. Remember great comebacks, championships, or even just good times with friends and family watching your team. If you’ve watched your team before this game, there will be some moments you can look back on fondly., Taunting, insults, and banter are parts of the sports fan experience, and you’ll almost certainly be a target after losing. Rather than being surprised when it happens, be prepared to handle it appropriately.Ignore it. Like other forms of teasing or bullying, taunts from opposing fans can be ignored. Laugh it off, or just walk away. Don’t give them the satisfaction of knowing they got to you. Those fans didn’t play in the game, so who cares what they think?
Give it right back. Don’t be afraid to respond with a few taunts of your own. You can probably think of a few good insults for the opposing team and their fans. It won’t change the result of the game, but can be another good way to vent your frustrations.

, The great thing about sports is that there will always be another game. Another game means another chance to win. Instead of dwelling on the game your team lost today, think about the game they could win next time out.Depending on where you are in the season, a loss can even be helpful to your team’s future performance. Finishing lower in the standings might mean a better draft pick, or a chance to see underperforming players replaced.

, While being sad after watching your team lose is not unusual, it should not have long-term effects on your emotional health. If you find that a loss is affecting your ability to live in the real world, look for professional help. Just because your depression seems to be coming from the outcome of a sporting event doesn’t mean it isn’t a real concern."

Whether the sport is basketball, soccer, football, hockey, or baseball, you need to understand it.,
See if your town, city, or state has any training camps or teams you can join to learn more about the sport.,
If you have a Facebook or Twitter, make your posts about the sport.",How to Become a Dedicated Sports Fan1," Every sport has its rules and regulations, and its own hand signals. Here are some tips for learning to understand the sport:


Read books on your sport. Go to a book store and look around, or look around on the internet. It's important to find quality books that offer as much information as possible on the sport, this way you can make fewer purchases, and learn much, much more.
Watch games. Tune in to see all the action. Turn up the volume to hear what the announcers, referees, and coaches are saying about the game. They can offer some very helpful information on the sport. You will also get to see which teams, and players, are the best.
Ask around. Ask some of your friends and family members who are interested in the sport what it's all about. They'll be happy to help you! Watch some games with them, and if you don't understand something, ask them!
Look around on the internet. There are many websites where you can ask questions about certain topics, ask a couple of questions, and while you are waiting for answers, search around for your sports website, to see if it has any information on the sport.;
, Every sport begins with a little dirt! Try not to miss any meetings, games, or practices so you can learn as much as possible. Listen to your coach or instructor and hear what they have to say.

, Or maybe even create a blog to keep track of everything you learn. It's important not to forget anything about the sport, or else you won't be able to really choose the team, because you might end up picking the worst team, when the best team would be obvious if you remember everything your coach said.

"
"
Now that you completely understand the sport, watch the teams carefully to see who you think is the best.,
Watch games and carefully study each team.",How to Become a Dedicated Sports Fan2," Look online to see who has won many major events, or who has the best players. You can look on the sports web site to see who is top notch, stacked, or has the best coaches and trainers. These are all the best ways to decide the team that is great.

, See who is winning more, and who is losing the most. It's important to choose the team that has the best standing, such as, out of 18 games, if the teams stat is 1-17; they are probably the worst team, but if a team has 17-1 they are probably the best team in the league. But, don't choose a team that has a better standing than one, such as, if out of 12 games, one teams stat is 0-12, and another's is 1-11, don't choose that team because it won one game and the other one lost all the games, see if there are teams that are doing a lot better, because, odds are, there will be.

Now that you have all the information you needed, choose your team!,
Buy proper sportswear for your team.,

Now that you have decided on your team, you can talk teams with friends and family members that enjoy your sport as well! Read the next few tips on how to become a real dedicated fan.

, Everyone should know which team is yours with the following products:


Jerseys. Every team and every player has a jersey. Choose your favorite player and sport his jersey. Or, over time, save up your money for a jersey. Watch your money though! Jerseys can be expensive, depending on how well the team and player is.
Wristbands, Headbands, and Knee Pads are available for every team. Usually they are only available for the team, though! They aren't very expensive, but you won't need many!
Water bottles. All teams have reusable water bottles, and they aren't very expensive. There are also player water bottles available, as well.
School Supplies. Many stores (Walmart, Target, Staples) may sell very known player and team supplies, but you may want to look up appropriate team and player supplies on the internet.
Autographs. Autographs can cost hundreds of dollars, or they can be free or at a very low price! Always check and make sure you are 100% certain about your purchase BEFORE you buy the autograph.

, Cheer your team on at their games. Be careful, because many sport events can be very expensive. This all depends on the sport and game though. For example; the Super Bowl can cost a lot of money, while a swim meet can be very inexpensive.

Check the temperature of the water using your toe or finger to ensure that the water has suitable conditions for you to jump in..",How to Prepare to Go Swimming (Girls)," Swimming really burns off energy so it's best to have a good meal before you swim. Make sure it's not too heavy though, otherwise it will be really hard to swim.;

Plan ahead for your day.,
Consider the swimwear that you plan on wearing.,
Purchase a good pair of goggles.,
Prepare your bag with necessities.,
Bring tampons if you’re menstruating.,
Pack your things in a duffel bag.,
Enjoy yourself!,
Realize that everyone is as uncomfortable as you are.,
Act naturally in the locker room.,
Be kind towards the peers in your class.,
Enjoy the sense of community.,
Try your best in the pool.,
Listen to the coach and follow their direction.,
Improve your competitive swimming abilities.",How to Prepare for the Swimming Unit in Gym Class," Swim class is often inconvenient; it involves undressing, showering, getting wet, and then getting dressed again, all while you’re still at school and in front of your friends and peers. Plan ahead before you leave your home that morning, and you’ll be able to minimize the inconvenience that comes from swim class.


If you have gym class earlier in the day, consider wearing your swimsuit under your clothes so you don’t have to change when you get to the locker room.
If you’re a girl, consider tightly braiding your hair in the morning. No guarantees, but it may keep your hair dry.
Avoid wearing tight clothes such as skinny jeans, since these are harder to put on after getting out of the pool.
Always lock your belongings in a locker with a combination lock. Practice using the lock until you can confidently open it without looking at the code.;
, Your goal should be finding something that’s comfortable, practical, and efficient in the pool. You’ll need to wear the same swimwear for as long as your swimming unit lasts, so find something that you enjoy wearing.


For girls, choose a swimsuit that you feel comfortable in and that lets you move freely in the pool.
For guys, you’ll need a pair of comfortable swim trunks. Avoid any that impair your movement or are excessively baggy, as these will slow you down in the pool.
Consult your instructor and make sure that your planned attire follows any regulations in place.
Make sure that, if you wear shorts that are not intended for water (basketball shorts, running shorts, etc.) that they have a very secure waistband, or preferably a drawstring. You don’t want to lose your shorts in the pool.

, As long as your school allows them, goggles are a practical part of every swimmer’s attire. You should have a high-quality pair that will keep the water out of your eyes. This will help you focus more on your swimming, and less on the distracting feeling of water in your eyes.


When you wear your goggles, make sure that they’re not too tight across the nose.Goggles should be snug around your eyes, and not let water seep in, but they shouldn’t be uncomfortably tight.

, When the gym period ends, you’ll probably need to dry off, shower, and change your clothes before you move on to the rest of your day. Plan ahead and bring everything you’ll need with you in your duffel bag. Include:


Large plastic bag for your wet swimsuit.
Shampoo and conditioner (for girls, or guys with longer hair).
A hairbrush/wide toothed comb (for people with long hair).
Body wash (Chlorine will dry out your skin unless you wash it off).
Deodorant and/or body spray.
Large beach towel.
Makeup (if you plan to apply it after gym class).
Flip-flops to wear on the pool deck.

, If you’re on your period (or anticipate that you could be, within the next couple of days), bring tampons with you in your duffel bag. Tampons can be worn in the pool without any problem, and should be worn instead of pads in this setting.The adhesive on most types of pads isn’t waterproof, so they may come off in the pool, and are generally less effective in water than tampons anyway.
Many young women start wearing tampons (rather than pads) for the first time during a gym swimming unit. If you’re in this situation, it’s completely normal and nothing to feel worried or anxious about.

, Since you’ll be changing clothes at the pool and bringing more items to class than you normally would, you’ll need a pool-specific bag to bring everything in. This is all in an effort to keep your belongings safe and intact.


Make sure that the bag zips shut and has a flat bottom so your clothes won’t get wrinkled. In addition, you may want to look for a waterproof bag, in case pool water gets splashed on it.
Consider investing in a combination lock if you haven’t already.

, Usually, swimming units are stress-free and involve tons of free time. Don’t be too worried about it. Many people squirm at the thought of mandatory swimming with classmates, but end up loving it. Don’t get too worked up with anxiety over the swimming unit; be mature and have fun.

, So often, it’s easy to imagine that your peers are enjoying the exact activities that make you feel uncomfortable or uneasy. It’s important to realize that everyone has the same concerns and insecurities about swim class.


Use this to your advantage; if you know that others are uncomfortable as well, you don’t need to feel self-conscious or awkward. You’re not alone!

, Many teens’ (even adults’) anxiety surrounding swimming in gym class stems from their apprehension about the locker room.The main concern often stems from a lack of privacy, and from the awkward experience of being even partially undressed in front of your peers.


Locker rooms showers are seldom a single large, open space. You can often find a private shower cell, in which you can shower, towel off, and change your clothes, if you’re uncomfortable changing in front of others.
If there aren’t separate shower cells for you to change in, you can change your underwear with your towel still wrapped around your waist.
Be discrete when undressing or showering around your peers. Don’t linger or stare at anyone’s body—this rule applies when your peers are wearing their swimsuits, too. Treat your peers with the same discretion that you’d like them to treat you with.

, Many students feel anxious when faced with swimming; maybe they’re uncomfortable in water, don’t like the idea of changing and showering in front of their peers, or are concerned about being seen in revealing garments in front by members of the opposite sex. Rather than worsening this by being rude to people or treating anyone with scorn, be kind to your fellow students.


Be considerate of your classmates. High-school especially is a time where many people are self-conscious, and standing around in tight, revealing clothing really doesn’t help.
Don’t berate or belittle anyone.

, Once everyone has gotten over the initial anxiety about being seen in a swimsuit and having to jump in a cold pool during the school day, swim class can be fun. It encourages a sense of community, and if you participate in the team-building, you can help yourself and other students enjoy the class more.Be encouraging to your peers; cheer each other on in the pool.
Say something like, “You’ve really come along way this month; you seem like you’re having fun in the water!”

, The point of any swimming unit is to learn how to swim (or to improve in your swimming skills), and you won’t get much out of the class if you don’t participate and make an effort.Whether this is your first time in the pool or you’re an experienced swimmer, get out there, participate, and have fun!


Even if you can’t swim, try your best. Most teachers can recognize when someone is trying and will give you a good grade for effort.

, High school swim unit is a great opportunity to improve your swimming skills, especially if you plan to compete in a swim club.Your swim coach is most likely a highly qualified individual who cares about his or her students and wants to help them swim better.


Even if you’re not a competitive swimmer and have no plans to become one, you should still obey the coach. He or she can lend a fun sense of community to the class, and swimming is a great way to stay in shape.

, Many high-school students are already involved in a swim team, and regularly compete in swimming or diving competitions. Learning from a coach is especially valuable if you’re already a competitive swimmer. Even if you routinely swim and train at a private swimming club, your high school coach can add a sense of community and team spirit to your swimming.Focus on learning new strokes and improving your time; tune out distractions. Take your training—even if it’s not at your normal swim club—as seriously as possible.

Pack a bag of things you need for the meet.,
Make sure that you know your game plan for the meet the next day.,
Eat a good dinner the night before you swim.,
Do your best to ensure you are not sore or stiff the next day during your swim meet.,
Go to bed as early as possible beginning days before your swim meet, especially if you are getting up early.,
Eat a light breakfast such as a bowl of cereal and a banana, or an energy bar if you're swimming a morning event.,
Rest.,
Put on your bathing suit right before you leave and gather your stuff for the meet.,
Put on sunscreen if outside.,
Listen to some good pump up music.,
Drink plenty of liquids.,
Know the events you are swimming.,
Think through answers to possible mishaps and false starts.,
Focus on the things that you can control versus the things you can not control.,
Visualize your race.,
Get in the zone.,
Get in the pool and swim.",How to Prepare for a Swim Meet," This helps because you won't be scrambling the next morning gathering your things and you can get as much rest as possible. Pack things such as towels, two pairs of goggles, two swim caps, fruit, nuts, water, and an energy beverage that contains electrolytes to resupply your/the swimmer's lost minerals.;
, For example; ask your coach what time warm ups are, what events your swimming, and whether or not the meet has positive check in. (Positive check-in is when you have to write your initials next to your name on a sign in sheet. This lets the officials know that you are there and so they write out the heats so that there are no empty lanes.)

, Eat plenty of carbohydrates and proteins but don't eat something to heavy or completely out of the norm. Stay away from acidic foods (including tomato and tomato sauce) for they will upset your stomach and cause cramps. The best plan is to eat something simple, easy to digest. Although pizza, chicken wings, and plates of pasta may seem like ""Power food,"" the reality is that they will sink you like a rock.


Carb loading is a technique that is outdated and since been proved inefficient and unhelpful unless in special circumstances only usually encountered at an elite level.

, If it is a multi day swim meet, warm down after every event. If a warm down pool is unavailable, conditioning exercises such as jogging, jumping jacks, and wall push ups then follow with static or dynamic stretches.

, If you go to bed at midnight every night for a week and get 5 hours of sleep every night for a week, getting 10 hours of sleep the night before is not going to help you. You will still be exhausted the day of the swim meet.

, If you're swimming in the afternoon, eat a big breakfast and a light lunch. Eat one or two hours before the event. Bananas, crackers, and plain toast with no butter in modest amounts are good food. The best foods are pasta, cereals, bagels, breads, fruits, and vegetables. These are out of the stomach in two hours, therefore should not be eaten more than three hours before swimming or they could override the energy in time for the race. Bananas are great because they have potassium which makes you more resistant to fatigue. Remember, no sugar.

, If you have school, do not rush between classes. Take your time walking up and down the stairs. Do not over-exert yourself, save your energy for the race.

, Don't put Fastskins on until after warm up and you are dry. Be sure you have water and healthy snacks. If you are swimming both trials and finals, you are going to need up to five towels; however, you can hang up your towels to dry to save space in your bag.

, Remember, it takes 30 minutes to soak in. You don't want goggle tans, that's for certain.

, Plug in your iPod or phone and listen to your favorite mix of tunes. Dance if you want but don't wear yourself out.

, Electrolyte drinks and water are the best liquids. Many people think that Gatorade is good but it is high in sugar (but can still help). Only drink this five minutes before an event. Drink plenty throughout the day and during the meet. Lack of liquids do affect your performance as well, even before you feel thirsty. But make sure to go pee before you swim!

, Your coaches should have a sheet with your events, or check your team website. The Trumbull Pisces website has a tab where you can look up your events, so see if your team does that too. When you figured out what you are swimming, relax. The next part will boost your confidence and calm your nerves.

, Having already thought about how to react quickly will help to calm you and reassure you that you're ready.



What will happen if my goggles fall of when I dive? - Relax for that. Just tighten the straps of your goggles. When you dive, tuck your chin to your neck. Therefore, the water will not apply direct pressure to the goggles, and they will stay on you.

What if I come in last place? - It happens. What you should know is that your coach entered you in the meet because he has faith and confidence that you can handle it. If swimming a 200 free, don't panic. If your coach believes you can do it, you should believe you can do it!

What if my time becomes worse? - to avoid that, give your races every thing you've got. Every single ounce of energy left in you should show in that race. If you do come last, know that you tried hard and give yourself credit for that. Plan out your race. For anything 25-100 yards/meters, sprint! You don't need to pace yourself because it is a short distance. For 200 yards/meters and above, pace yourself. If swimming 200, your first 50 should have a strong pace. the second 50 should have a harder pull, and the third 50 should have a faster kick. The final 50 should be all out.
Think about your times. Set a goal. If swimming a 50 free, imagine your time on the board being 35.99! If you believe it'll happen, it will happen. For a 200 free, pace yourself. First 50- 43 seconds. Second 50- 45 seconds. Third 50- 45 seconds. Fourth 50 - 43 seconds.

, You can control your start and your turn, you cannot control the size or speed of your opponent. You can control what you eat before your race, you cannot control the traffic on the way to the meet.

, Sit down somewhere quiet, and visualize the race from the moment you're up on the block to the moment you hit the wall. Visualize the exact time that you want to see on the time board. This helps keep a positive attitude.

, Depending on what kind of person you are, you may want to get pumped. Do a high intense set of 60 jumping jacks, stretch, or anythings that suits you to get you going, 5 minutes before your race.

, Don't tire yourself out, or go too fast. Get in and stretch out and get a feel for the water. Drills are great for this.


If you do feel the need to go fast, do a short hard set but don't go over 80 percent of your maximum speed. Make sure your intervals give you a good amount of rest. This will get the blood flowing, you will get a feel for your stroke, and you will remain rested for your big meet. The point is you need to conserve your energy while keeping your body conditioned at the same time.

Before The Meet.,
Always come fully prepared.,
Recharge regularly.,
Warm up and be ready.,
Remember to not get nervous before a race!,
Talk to your coach after your race.,
After all that, go warm down and refuel with food.,
When you're done with the meet, go home and tell everyone about it.,
Just have fun and make sure that you remember no matter what the result is you put your best efforts into the race.

",How to Perform Well in a Championship Meet," If this is your big meet of the season, your coach will probably taper you. (This is where you go easy the week/couple weeks before in order to rest your muscles. This will help you have a lot of energy when swimming your races. Also before your meet, you want to eat healthy. Try to eliminate most sweets and eat a lot of healthy carbs such as pasta. Another tip would be to visualize your races. As you are laying in bed at night or some other calm time during your day, view yourself at the pool you will swim at. See yourself swimming the race perfectly and see yourself winning or getting your goal time. This can help you plan exactly how you want and it will also boost your confidence.
, Pack all your equipment together the night before you leave. Then in the morning, you can just grab your stuff and go. If you are going to wear a practice suit for warm-ups, make sure you bring your racing suit. Remember to bring extra goggles, an extra cap, an extra suit, a water bottle, entertainment (like iPods, especially for long meets) and food. Food is important!!! Most meets will have concession stands, but most of the time it will be unhealthy foods that will Also bring a sweat jacket and towel/blanket to keep warm when you're not swimming. Don't forget clothes for after the meet too!

, Bring food and drinks. Things like granola bars and small sandwiches will be good for longer breaks at a swim meet, but fruit will be good to eat right before your races. And bring lots of water or other drinks like orange juice or gatorade. DO NOT BRING ENERGY DRINKS OR SODA! These drinks will mess up your cardiac-vascular system and slow you down.

, Even though you may have warmed up at the way beginning of the meet, it helps to warm up before your race by swimming a few laps in the warm up/cool down area. Do a longer swim (200-400) and then do a couple 25s or 50s sprint. After you finish warming up, you might want to talk to your coach about your race strategy. Then you can go over behind the blocks.

, You can get your goal times. All that hard work at practice will pay off. Just remember all the little things that your coach has been telling you to work on and remember how you visualized your races., He/she will tell you your splits/time and tell you how you did. This really helps a lot, so you can tell if you're improving.

, Then you can sit down and read a book or play some video games. Make sure you conserve energy for your next race. If you're done for the day, go take a hot shower and head back to wherever you're staying, whether this is a local or out-of-town meet.

, They'll totally be willing to hear about your success at a swim meet, especially a championship one.
